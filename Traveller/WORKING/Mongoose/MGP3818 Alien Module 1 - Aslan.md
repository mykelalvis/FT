## IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

The Aslan are the youngest of the great powers, an expansionist
race of feuding clans and predatory warriors, eager to seize all the
universe has to offer.

In the _Original Traveller Universe_ , the Aslan are one of only six races
to have independently discovered the principles of the jump drive.
These six so-called Major Races claim for themselves a higher status
than the so-called minor races and since most of the major races are
dominant within known space, the claim has some de facto merit.
Although there is no absolute agreement as to exactly which six are
the major races, common usage accepts the Vargr, the K'kree, the
Hivers, the Droyne, Humaniti (lumping the Vilani, Solomani and
Zhodani branches of the human race into one) and the latest on the
scene – the Aslan.

The Aslan, the youngest of the major races, are the subject of this
_Traveller_ supplement. With it, the race can be incorporated into any
and all aspects of _Traveller_. Whether the Aslan are to be used as
Player Characters, Non-Player Characters, patrons, opponents or
just as a backdrop against which adventures may take place, this
supplement provides the referee and the players with sufficient
information to deal with the Aslan, both as individuals and as a fully
visible society.

The _Traveller Core Rulebook_ deals with characters as humans
within an Imperial society, which is fairly comprehensible to most
players. Outside that society, aliens are different in culture as well
as physiology and a careful presentation of what shapes an alien's
character is necessary if players are to deal with or roleplay those
aliens.

_Traveller_ players can find any number of activities which include or
deal with Aslan, whether inside the Imperium or beyond its borders.
The Aslan Hierate (their empire) is located spinward and rimward
of the Imperium. The Aslan sector map shows the sectors of the
Hierate in relation to the Imperium.

Where the Imperium and the Hierate touch, humans and Aslan
frequently encounter each other. Aslan worlds under Imperial
rule are found scattered up to 40 parsecs inside the Imperial

border. Independent Aslan worlds are found throughout the
region spinward and rimward of the Imperium. Adventurers in
the Spinward Marches can venture rimward through the Trojan
Reach to the Aslan colonies in that sector and then further across
the Aslan-controlled Great Rift into the Hierate itself. Adventurers
in the Solomani Rim can venture through Solomani territory to
I'aheako (Dark Nebula) sector, which holds the Aslan homeworld
of Kusyu. The Aslan hunger for territory has carried them out from
Kusyu to the stars but still they desire more.

They are predators in a galaxy of prey, warriors without equal. Take
your place among the Aslan as a ruler or kneel before your new
masters!

Character generation for the Aslan follows the same procedures
and concepts as human character generation in _Traveller_. However,
numerous changes in the details of the system take into account
physiological, cultural and other differences between Aslan
characters and humans. An Aslan's gender and clan have far more
bearing on the character's career choices than a human's gender or
family background.

The more detailed rules for Aslan character generation in this book
supersede the rules in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

###### Initial Character Generation

Aslan characters, like humans, are basically defined by six personal
characteristics: Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence,
Education and Social Standing. Males have an additional special
characteristic, Territory, which starts at 0.

Aslan are, on average, slightly stronger than and have marginally
greater Endurance than humans. Their Dexterity is slightly lower
than humans. Intelligence and Education are about equivalent.
Social level refers to Aslan status in Aslan society and cannot be
considered to refer to human Social Standing.

To generate the first five characteristics, throw 2d6 five times and
allocate them as normal. Endurance, Intelligence and Education
undergo no adjustments. Strength gains a +2 bonus, while Dexterity
suffers a –2 penalty. The lower limit on characteristics is 1 (below 1
can happen only from wounding and only temporarily); the upper
limit is 15 except for Strength and Endurance, which is 16.

Social Standing is determined in the Clan, Family & Pride section
Territory starts at 0.

###### Traits

All Aslan have a dewclaw, which deals 1d6+2 damage in combat.
Attacks with the dewclaw use the Melee (claw) skill.

Aslan have better night vision, hearing and smell than humans,
giving them a +1 DM to any Recon or Survival checks involving
these senses.

## AASLANSLAN C CHARACTERHARACTER G GENERATIONENERATION

Aslan are capable of bursts of speed. An Aslan may move double the
normal amount a number of times equal to his 3+Endurance DM in
any combat.

Some Aslan have a vestigial tail; other Aslan have a full tail. A tail
gives no benefit in most circumstances but affects the armor that
the character can wear.

###### Gender

Aslan may be either male or female. Aslan biology dictates that there
are approximately three females born for every male. As a result,
males are in the distinct minority. Players may select the gender of
their Aslan character if they so desire. Alternatively, gender may be
determined randomly by a die roll. Throw 2d6 on the Gender table.

###### GENDER

RollRoll GenderGender
2-5 Male
6-12 Female

In Aslan society, males are permitted to be warriors, rulers and diplomats;
females are the scientists, technicians, merchants and managers.

###### Clan, Family & Pride

To determine if a character comes from one of the Twenty-Nine Great
Clans of the Tlaukhu or from a minor clan, roll 1d6 on the Clan table.
The Referee may choose to dictate which clan the character comes from.
Note that if any of the Player Characters are kinfolk, they will share a clan
and possibly a family.

###### CLAN

RollRoll ClanClan
1-3 Minor Clan
4-6 Major Clan. +1 DM to Ancestral Deeds roll.

There are hundreds or thousands of families in a clan. To determine
the Social Standing of the character, roll on the Ancestral Deeds
table and twice on the Past Deeds table to work out what Territory
his forebears acquired. Ancestral Territory starts at 0. The first Past
Deeds roll is for the deeds of the character's grandfather and the
second is for the deeds of his father.

###### ANCESTRAL DEEDS

1d61d6 Ancestral DeedAncestral Deed
1 Your ancestor shamed the clan and you come from a branch long dishonored. +0 Ancestral Territory.
2 Your family's glory days are long gone, all that is left are the tales of great landholdings now lost to upstarts. +
Ancestral Territory.
3 Your family made its fortune in the great expansion after the discovery of jump drive; most family holdings are on
distant worlds. +1 Ancestral Territory.
4 Your family are the descendants of an ancient hero forgotten by most Aslan. +1 Ancestral Territory.
5 Your family's ancestor was a trickster who deceived his enemies. +2 Ancestral Territory.
6 Your ancestors were conquerors and great warriors. +2 Ancestral Territory.
7 Your family is one of the most influential and wealthy in the Hierate. +3 Ancestral Territory.

###### PAST DEEDS

2d62d6 Past DeedPast Deed
2 Dishonored! Your forebear committed some dishonorable act that caused the clan to strip your family of all
territory. Gain Independence 0 (if male) or Trade 0 (if female). Lose all Ancestral Territory.
3 Your forebear was beset by many foes, one of whom conquered much of your land. Gain an Enemy and Gun
Combat 0. –4 Ancestral Territory.
4 Your forebear was a fool who gambled away much of your land. Gain Gamble 0 or Carouse 0. –3 Ancestral
Territory.
5 Your forebear suffered from a degenerative genetic disease that you may have inherited. Gain Medic 0. –
Ancestral Territory.
6 Your forebear barely managed to hold onto your landhold. –1 Ancestral Territory.
7 Your forebear was conservative and cautious. +1 Ancestral Territory.
8 Your forebear's brother did well as an ihatei. +2 Ancestral Territory.
9 Your forebear married well. +3 Ancestral Territory.
10 Your forebear conquered his foes. +4 Ancestral Territory.
11 Your forebear died gloriously in battle. +5 Ancestral Territory.
12 Your forebear was among the greatest heroes of the clan. +6 Ancestral Territory.

Characters have a Social Standing equal to their Ancestral Territory
(to a minimum of 2). If your Social Standing is 10 or more and you
are male, gain Leadership 1.

Only the first son in the family inherits the family Territory. Next,
determine your character's place in the family. In the case of
multiple characters from the same family, only the eldest character
need roll on this table – all other Player Characters in that family are
automatically younger.

2d62d6 MaleMale FemaleFemale
2-3 First Son Eldest Daughter
4-10 Second Son Middle Daughter
11-12 Third Son Youngest Daughter

Finally, at the start of character generation, the character has left
his or her parent's pride. The character may become part of another
pride through Life Events or form one during play.

###### Starting Age

Aslan characters begin their careers at 16 Aslan years of age (about 14
standard years). At this point, as untrained and inexperienced Aslan,
they embark upon a career in order to gain skills and experience.
Careers are resolved on the basis of Aslan terms of service which
are four Imperial years (six Aslan years) each.

###### Naming

The material on language gives some basic guidelines on names
and words used by the Aslan. Players may wish to use Aslan names
(if so, they are encouraged to pick relatively pronounceable ones!).
There is no necessity for doing so, though it adds to the flavor and
atmosphere of the game.

Even when names from the Aslan language are chosen, these are
unlikely to be the individual's full names, since an Aslan name is
a long, sonorous and intricate structure which changes to note the
background, accomplishments and life of its owner. Names for
game purposes are greatly shortened out of necessity.

Because the particle _ko_ on the end of an Aslan name means 'himself'
and is used exclusively by the head of a clan, care should be taken
that an Aslan name ending in ko not be chosen unless the individual
is the head of a clan (usually Social Standing 16).

###### Titles

Aslan do not have titles, as such, though a high Social Standing may
be denoted by certain portions of the individual's name. In Aslan
society, the social level characteristic denotes the relative status of
both the individual and his or her family but no special titles are
applied for specific social levels.

###### Akhuaeuhrekhyeh ( Rite of Passage)

At the age of fifteen (Aslan years), all Aslan characters undergo a
rite of passage: the _Akhuaeuhrekhyeh_. This rite tests the individual's
fitness to enter society and has an impact on the service which may
be selected by the character.

The actual rite is a test which examines the individual's abilities
and qualities; it is only simulated by die rolls. Males and females
undergo different rites.

A male Aslan makes a single die throw (2d6) which is compared to
each of his characteristics apart from Territory. A rite of passage
number is created by adding 1 point for each characteristic which is
greater than the throw.

_Example: Two male Aslan siblings, Hwelryr and Karinvyr both have the
same characteristics: STR 10, DEX 7, END 8, INT 6, EDU 5, SOC 7.
Hwelyr rolls a 6 for his Rite of Passage; Karinvyr rolls a 10._

_Hwelyr's Rite of Passage number is +4 (Strength + Dexterity + Endurance

+ Social Standing). Karinvyr's Rite of Passage number is +0._

A female Aslan makes a single die throw (2d6) which is compared
to Intelligence, Education and Social Standing. A rite of passage
number is created by adding two points for each characteristic
which is greater than the throw.

If doubles are rolled on the rite of passage throw, consult the Rite of
Passage Event table.

###### RITE OF PASSAGE EVENT

Numbers RolledNumbers Rolled EventEvent
1+1 The character is believed to have a
great destiny and the clan looks for
great things from him. The character
must excel or disappoint his ancestors.
He gains 1d6 Clan Shares.
2+2 Impressive Performance. The character
is given Cr. 5,000 as a reward for his
exemplary performance in the Rite.
3+3 You befriend one of the other young
Aslan undergoing the rite that day.

5+5 You are wounded in one of the tests,
leaving a distinctive scar across your
fur.
6+6 I Will Not Fail! Your rite tests you to
the limit but you are determined not to
give in. Gain +1 Endurance.

#### CAREERS

Upon completing the rite of passage, characters examine the
available careers and select one to enlist in. Some careers are
restricted to a single gender.

Spacer and Space Officer:Spacer and Space Officer: These two careers embrace all forms of
interplanetary and interstellar service which may be carried out by a
clan, including operation of all forms of spacecraft. Thus, the career
is similar to both the Navy and the Merchants (and to some extent
the Scouts) of Imperial society. However, members of this career are
strictly concerned with the operation of ships; a clan vessel involved
in trade would also carry characters of a management background
for the conduct of business.

Males in the Space service are primarily gunners; females are
technicians or support personnel. Male officers are pilots, gunners and
leaders; female officers are navigators, engineers and staff advisors.

###### Careers From Other Traveller Books

Aslan living in the Imperium or in other human-dominated societies may use the basic Traveller careers instead. Use the Aslan Life
Events table for such characters.

Military and Military Officer:Military and Military Officer: These careers are equivalent to both
Army and Marines. They represent clan military forces which may
be employed in interclan warfare, on Hierate service, as mercenaries
or as adjuncts to a corporation's activities where the military force is
needed for security or other purposes.

Males in the Military service are fighters or combatants; females
are support personnel. Male officers are commanders and leaders;
female officers serve as staff and advisors.

Wanderers (Males Only):Wanderers (Males Only): Many _ihatei_ are given vessels by their clans
and they then use them for explorations in the hopes of discovering
new landholds. Wanderers are much like the Scouts of Imperial
space, exploring in a lonely, risky business which provides a wide
range of skills but also a large chance of disaster.

Management (Females Only):Management (Females Only): Many female Aslan opt to enter
a business-oriented career, rather than pursuing marriage and
family. Such females may rise to positions of importance within the
structure of various corporations. The career gives a variety of skills
concerned with commerce, finance and relations with others.

Outcasts:Outcasts: Outcast characters for one reason or another do not fit in
with normal Aslan society. Generally scorned as misfits, they tend to
pick up an unusual assortment of skills; frequently such characters
will be more independent but will also nurse a fierce desire to prove
themselves and thus rejoin the society which has scorned them.

Outlaws:Outlaws: Some Outcasts become outlaws, travelling between the
stars raiding other clans or other races. Such activities represent a
deviant subculture within Aslan society; normal standards for male
and female pursuits have broken down to some extent, with each
learning and performing tasks that the other normally does. Pirates,
like Outcasts, privately nurse a desire to return to normal Aslan
society but see little chance for success in that aim.

Scientists (Females Only, with the exception of Healer): Scientists (Females Only, with the exception of Healer): Individuals
involved in the pursuit of the sciences (whether biological, physical
or social) can become Scientists. In Aslan practice, most scientists
are actually technicians, adept at the creation of mechanisms to
accomplish specific tasks.

Envoys (Males Only):Envoys (Males Only): Interclan relations are often entrusted to
specific Envoys empowered to arrive at agreements and commit clan
resources. The term Envoy (rather than Diplomat) is used because
the individual represents a clan rather than a government.

Ceremonial: Ceremonial: The Aslan have a rich cultural heritage. Those involved
in ceremonial tasks occupy a position of great importance within
their clans.

It should be emphasised that most careers (except Outcasts and
Pirates) are managed on a clan level. The Hierate has no integrated
Army or Navy; individual clans maintain forces which may be
contributed to the service of the Hierate or not, as the situation and
attitudes of the clan dictate.

With a career selected, the character enlists and once in a service,
the process of acquiring skills begins.

###### Qualification

Once a career is selected, the character attempts to qualify for
that career. The initial qualification attempt works differently to
the normal qualification. The rite of passage number is used as an
enlistment DM for all careers, except for Rogue and Scholar, instead
of the standard characteristic test. If the character fails to qualify, the
character is immediately reduced to Social Standing 2 and becomes
an Outcast. He or she may attempt to become a Rogue using the
normal Qualification rules or become a Drifter – as found in the
Traveller Core Rulebook.

Only one basic attempt at qualification is allowed and it must be
made at Aslan age 16.

After serving at least three terms in a career other than Outcast or
Pirate an Aslan character may attempt to qualify for another career
using the standard rules – the Aslan are a more hidebound culture
than the Imperium and expect characters to remain in a single career
for some time. Aslan who have spent time as Outcasts or Pirates
may only attempt to qualify for other Outcast or Pirate careers in
Aslan space, as their past is too dishonorable to allow them to
enter a more respectable career. Such characters are best served by
either leaving Aslan space or mustering out and entering play.

###### Skills

Skills are determined as normal, with one exception. If an Aslan
male rolls Independence on any of the skills tables, he must roll 2d
and score over his Social Standing to obtain the skill.

###### Mustering Out

Benefits are granted at the end of career service, as per the normal
rules.

Cash Table:Cash Table: Females, being more skilled in handling financial
matters, may consult the cash table to the limits of their eligibility.
Males are restricted to consulting the cash table no more times than
they have levels in the Independence skill; in addition, males receive
only half the amount shown on the table.

Benefits Table:Benefits Table: Characters may consult the benefits table to the
limits of their eligibility. Mustering-out benefits are explained later
in this chapter.

###### Aging

Aslan aging is slower in its onset but more severe in effects than in
human characters. The first roll on the aging table is not made until
age 40 (after six terms of service have been completed); thereafter,
it is checked every four Aslan years and _twice_ the total number of
terms served is applied as a negative DM to the 2d6 roll.

Aging is computed in _ftahea_ (Aslan years). Since each Aslan year
equals 320 standard days, Aslan aging points occur every 1,
days. Characters must maintain careful records and note when
aging must be performed.

###### ASLAN AND PSIONICS

Psionic ability is virtually unheard-of among the Aslan and there
is some doubt as to whether or not the race is naturally psionic.
The few known cases of Aslan possessing such abilities are all
shrouded in either mysticism or can be attributed to genetic
manipulation or alien technology. Aslan Player Characters may
not possess any psionic ability at the start of the game.

#### SPACER

service which may be carried out by a clan, including operation
of all forms of spacecraft. Males in the Space service are primarily

#### TERRITORY

The Territory characteristic is unique to the Aslan. Territory measures
the amount of land owned by that Aslan male. It is the foundation
of Aslan Social Standing – for a landless male or female, his or her
Social Standing is derived from the Territory of his or her sire. A
mated female's Social Standing is based on her mate's Territory.

Territory can be used in place of Social Standing among Aslan. For
example, instead of rolling Diplomat using his Social Standing DM,
an Aslan lord could use roll Diplomat and add his Territory DM
instead, when dealing with other Aslan.

In Aslan social contests between males, Territory can be used to
trump Social Standing – a male with Territory may automatically
win any social contests against a male who has less Territory.
_Any_ amount of Territory trumps any amount of Social Standing

+ the son of an Aslan clan head with Territory 0, Social Standing
15 will lose a contest to a penniless mercenary who has Territory 1,
Social Standing 2. That does not mean that the mercenary is more
important in Aslan society than the clan heir but he has Territory
and that is what counts. He can overrule the clan heir but, of course,
doing so would be a grievous insult and would likely result in some
ally of the clan heir overriding the mercenary soon after.

#### SKILLS

The Aslan deal with skills primarily on a gender basis: males feel
that some skills are dishonorable and beneath them; females feel
that some skills are shallow or simply unsuitable. As a result, Aslan
perceive and identify skills as common (available to both sexes), male
(suitable only for males) and female (suitable only for females).

In addition, there are a few skills that a non-Aslan would classify
as rare (generally unknown or unappreciated in Aslan society). On
the rare occasions that an Aslan learns a skill inappropriate for
his or her gender, that fact will usually be kept secret; for the fact
to be revealed would be shameful. Further, Aslan society is rigid
enough on the subject of skills that no respectable Aslan would
hire someone for a job which required a skill inappropriate to the
employee's gender.

At times, Aslan are forced to learn what they consider inappropriate
skills in order to survive. For example, it is widely known that
Wanderers often learn Engineer on the small ships they commonly
use; polite society ignores this breach of propriety and a former
Wanderer with the Engineer skill would never discuss it and never
expect to be hired as an engineer.

All comments about skill classification refer only to Aslan society;
for Aslan raised outside traditional Aslan communities (for example,
in the Imperium), the acceptability of various skills will change.

Male Skills:Male Skills: Some skills should be learned in Aslan society only
by males. Females consider such skills naturally the province of

males and rarely try to learn them. In some extreme circumstances,
females may learn them but will almost never admit to it in polite
company. Most direct combat skills are the province of males.

Independence is a uniquely Aslan male skill in that it indicates
the degree to which the male has overcome Aslan cultural and
psychological barriers to the comprehension of money. Females do
not need Independence since they are not faced with these barriers.

Female Skills:Female Skills: Some skills should be learned in Aslan society only by
females. Males consider such skills dishonorable for them to learn
and will avoid learning them if at all possible. If they have learned
them, honor forbids them from admitting it.

Common Skills:Common Skills: All other skills are commonly available and learned
by both males and females.

Rare Skills: Rare Skills: These skills may be learned by Aslan but are extremely rare.

The male Aslan skills and female Aslan skills table indicate which skills
various Aslan might consider distasteful or unacceptable to learn. The
rare Aslan skills table shows skills which very few Aslan would learn.

Skills not shown as male, female or rare may be considered common skills.

###### Independence

The individual is capable of dealing with the concepts of money.
In Aslan society, money is traditionally a female responsibility
and males (particularly upper-class males) rarely understand such
matters, a fact which handicaps them in a technological society.
Aslan characters may learn Independence instead of Broker.

Independence is an Aslan male skill, acquirable only by males; females
have no need of it. Each time the Independence skill appears during
character creation, males must throw their Social Standing or greater
to acquire the skill. Independence skill is a guide governing the
individual's ability to function without supervision. Lack of the skill
indicates no concept of money at all; the individual must be looked
after by a wife or companion who can pay for things and generally see
that the character has his financial needs cared for.

_Realising that a price is extortionate:_ Intelligence or Education, 1-6
seconds, Average (+0)
_Understanding an economics treatise:_ Intelligence, 10-60 minutes,
Difficult (–2)

###### Tolerance

The individual is accustomed to dealing with non-Aslan and has
learned to ignore lapses in propriety on the part of such persons. It
should also be used to help determine the degree to which an Aslan
is capable of getting along with others outside of the family, pride,
clan and race. An Aslan without Tolerance is unlikely to be found in
the company of non-Aslan.

In any Aslan's dealings with others, Tolerance offsets the negative
modifiers called for under the reaction rules (see page 139).

#### MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS

Aslan receive mustering out benefits when they leave the service.
Most benefits are identical to those in basic _Traveller_. The differences
are noted below.

###### Retirement Pay

There is no retirement pay. An old Aslan should have accumulated
enough Clan Shares to have enough money to live on.

###### Cash Benefits

Females are allowed to make all their benefit throws on the cash
table. Males are restricted to no more throws than they have points
in the Independence skill.

###### Kinships

Kinships are secret societies and trade guilds within Aslan society. A
character given membership in a kinship may ask other members of
the kinship for aid, learn skills or obtain funding for further studies
related to the kinship's purpose. There are scientific kinships,
ceremonial kinships, warrior secret schools and so forth.

Brotherhood of Stars:Brotherhood of Stars: This grand kinship of starfarers allows the
character to gain one free Low Passage per month and one free
High Passage per year.

Secret School:Secret School: A secret warrior school teaches secret combat
techniques. In addition to being part of this brotherhood of warriors,
choose one of the skills listed below; you receive a +1 DM to attack
rolls under the conditions listed for that skill:

+ Melee (claw):Melee (claw): When duelling
+ Gun Combat (pistol):Gun Combat (pistol): When dodging
+ Gun Combat (rifle):Gun Combat (rifle): After having aimed for at least one round*
+ Heavy Weapons (any):Heavy Weapons (any): After having aimed for at least one
    round*
+ Gunnery: Gunnery: After having aimed for at least one round*

*In addition to the normal +1 DM for aiming

Scientific Kinship:Scientific Kinship: A scientific kinship is a school of experts on a
topic. A character who is a member of a scientific kinship may roll
his Social Standing once per year; on a 10+, he obtains the use of a
kinship laboratory ship for six months.

Ceremonial Kinship:Ceremonial Kinship: A character who is a member of a ceremonial
kinship obtains 1d3 Allies in the Aslan hierarchy.

###### Clan Shares

Aslan characters do not receive Ship Shares. Instead, they receive
Clan Shares, which represent that character's clan placing an
increasing amount of trust in the character's abilities and the
character gaining more control over the assets of the clan.

A character may trade Clan Shares for any of the following benefits.
Characters from the same clan may combine Clan Shares in the
same way players may pool Ship Shares.

Cash: Cash: A character may trade Clan Shares for simple cash. Each Clan
Share allows the character to obtain 10,000 Credits in cash.

Corporation:Corporation: The character owns an operating corporation. It has
MCr. 500,000 in assets per Clan Share spent and produces gross
profits equal to 1d6–5% of its assets per year. The character need
not do anything to administer the corporation but may become
involved if he wishes.

Favors: Favors: Clan Shares can be kept in reserve and used to apply
political pressure to the clan in the future. A Clan Share can be spent
to acquire a Contact in the clan's upper echelons or to turn such a
Contact into an Ally.

Land:Land: This option can only be taken by a male Aslan with a Social
Standing of 9 or more. The character receives a landhold. Owning
lands is the dream of all Aslan males, the chief ambition which drives

them. For game purposes, however, a character with a landhold
makes a poor adventurer, since the administration of that land will
occupy his time almost exclusively. See page 40 for a discussion of
land and adventuring.

To determine the landholding's quality and size, first select or
generate the world where the landhold is located (see the _Worlds
chapter on page 151_ ). The size of the holding on that world is then
determined based on the number of Clan Shares invested in the
holding. Three Clan Shares gives +1 Territory. See page 41 for a
discussion of Territory.

There is usually a delay before a landholding can be claimed,
either roll 1d6+4 to determine the number of years, –1 year per
Clan Share spent to reduce the delay or have the Referee choose.
When that time has passed, the Aslan must return to claim his
landhold. Independence 3 or more allows the choice of continuing
to adventure instead (a male relative is appointed to administer the
land in his name).

Ship Shares:Ship Shares: Clan Shares may be converted to Ship Shares directly.
It is very rare for an Aslan to own a starship personally. Starships are
usually owned collectively by the clan or by corporations. In most
cases, it is the clan which owns the ship, with individuals assigned
to operate them in the interests of the clan. In similar fashion, other
ships are owned by corporations.

Clan leaders can grant the use of a starship if the character presents
a clear plan covering the advantages and disadvantages to the clan
and the character. Such plans may include clan communications,
trade and commerce, _ihatei_ expeditions, scientific research,
planetary exploration and clan warfare expeditions. Other reasons
may also be accepted.

Corporate leaders may grant the use of a starship in much the same
way as clan leaders do. Adequate reasons for use of a corporate
ship include trade and commerce, cargo transport and merchant
operations. When an Aslan corporation grants a ship, it participates
in the cost of operating it and in the revenue it generates. Each
year, the corporation balances the books on the ship. All expenses
are totalled (fuel, routine maintenance, life support, crew salaries,
berthing costs, cargo costs and other appropriate expenses); to
this is added 5% of the original cost of the ship. All revenues are
also totalled (cargo transport receipts, passenger fares, profits from
trade and speculation, charter fees and other receipts). The two are
added together to determine if the ship had a profit or a loss.

If the ship operated at a profit, the corporation takes 50% of the
profits. The crew is awarded bonuses equal to 20% of the profit.
The grantee receives the remaining 30% of the profit. It is possible
for the grantee to receive both grantee profit and a portion of the
crew bonus.

If the ship operates at a loss, the corporation must absorb it.
However, the corporation will decide to replace the grantee with
someone else on a throw of 8+, DM +2 for each preceding year the
ship has operated at a loss.

A clan grants a ship with less concern for immediate profit or loss
since non-commercial uses do not generate money as clearly.
The clan pays basic expenses for the ship but also receives all
revenues which the ship generates. Individually owned ships are
the responsibility of the owner. Ships granted as a boon are also
the responsibility of the owner. Ships received as mustering-out
benefits are treated as either clan or corporate grants. The number
of ship shares needed to receive a ship is listed below:

###### Aslan Life Events

The life events of an Aslan character are similar to those of humans
but there is a greater emphasis on the rise and fall of one's clan
and one's role in society. Outcast Aslan should use the standard life
events table, reflecting their disconnection from Aslan society.

## TTHEHE A ASLANSLAN R RACEACE

The Aslan are a race of intelligent beings; their starfaring culture is
the youngest of all the major races, having had star flight for less
than 3,200 years. Despite their youth, their spread through space
has been rapid, driven by the instinctive territorial desires which are
central to the makeup of the Aslan male.

#### ASLAN PHYSIOLOGY

Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous pouncer stock,
which was originally near the top of the food chain in the forests of
their homeworld, Kusyu. About 1.8 million years ago Kusyu's climate
shifted, with the result that the extensive forests of Tafohti (Kusyu's
largest continent) almost completely disappeared. As the forests
dwindled, so did the small fauna upon which the Aslan had preyed,
forcing them to venture out into the expanding grassland plains. The
large grazing animals in these regions were too much for a lone Aslan
to kill and they began hunting in _ahriy_ (prides) of several families. The
strongest male became the leader and his family received the best
parts of kills, choice sleeping places and first drink at any waterhole.

The Aslan which has evolved from those beginnings is, like humans,
an upright biped averaging two meters in height and 100 kg in
weight. There are two sexes: male and female, of which the most
notable external difference is the male's increased size and more
impressive mane. Females outnumber males by a ratio of 3:1.

The Aslan hand has three fingers opposing one medially-placed
thumb and all have retractable claws. In addition, Aslan have a
single highly specialized claw under each thumb; this dewclaw
folds back jack-knife fashion into a horny covering in the base of
the thumb and palm. The presence of these claws and the general
nature of their body structure make the Aslan somewhat clumsy by
comparison with humans but what they lack in dexterity they make
up for in strength and endurance.

Aslan all have tails, although the length of this appendage has
diminished over time and is now little more than a vestigial stump
in some bloodlines.

Aslan sleep about one-third of the time: shaped by their homeworld's
rotation period, their sleeping time is roughly 11 to 12 hours (one-
third of Kusyu's 36-hour day). Like humans, lack of sleep degrades
their abilities drastically.

The Aslan gestation period is roughly one _ftahea_ or ten months in
human terms. Most are single births – twins are virtually unheard
of and are almost always female. Male twins are rare enough to
be virtually unknown. The young are born encapsulated in tough
embryonic cauls, which are then cut away by the mother using
a claw (or in modern times, by a surgeon's laser). Cubs mature
quickly, learning to walk in only two months.

###### Time-Keeping

In any Traveller activity, there is a need to keep track of time
and its passage. The generally accepted Traveller method
uses Imperial standards. The Aslan have their own units of
measuring time.

Imperial Standard:Imperial Standard: Timekeeping in the Imperium is based on
the standard day, composed of 24 standard hours. Clocks and
watches count time using standard hours, minutes and seconds.

Aslan Standard:Aslan Standard: Aslan timekeeping is based on the rotational
period of their homeworld, Kusyu. This period, the eakhau (day),
is equivalent to just over 36 standard hours. The Timekeeping
table shows the basic Aslan units of time, their value in the next
lower Aslan unit and their Imperial equivalents. Referees and
players are encouraged to adopt Aslan timekeeping practices
where appropriate for added atmosphere and interest.

Aslan Calendar:Aslan Calendar: The Aslan calendar is based on the revolution
of Kusyu around Tyeyo, its star. The Aslan year ( ftahea ) is
about 320 standard days or about 212.2 eakhau long. The same
calendar is used on most Hierate worlds.

There are no subdivisions in the Aslan calendar: each day has a unique
name. For game purposes, each eakhau is consecutively numbered
from 1 to 212, much like the Imperial calendar. Every five years, a 213th
day is added to keep the calendar in sync. The Aslan calendar takes as
its starting point the first selection of the Tlaukhu as supreme council
on Kusyu about 3,200 years ago (–2083 Imperial). The current Aslan
date 3637 corresponds to the Imperial date 1105.

True to their pouncer ancestry, Aslan are capable of short bursts of
speed somewhat greater than that manageable by humans. They
also have slightly superior hearing and night vision. Otherwise,
they are one of the most human-like of all alien races, excepting, of
course, the Vargr (who are, after all, genetically-altered mammalian
stock originally from Earth).

Early [[Terra|Terran]] explorers regarded the Aslan as 'lion-like,' and the simile
has stuck ever since, although the Aslan bear little resemblance to
Terrestrial lions. Nonetheless, this early misnomer has influenced a
great deal of human thinking about the Aslan, including terminology
(the use of pride to translate _ahriy_ , for instance) and ascribed
behaviour – which is not at all leonine. The derivation of the word
Aslan is unknown but is sometimes credited to human explorers
who first contacted the race.

###### Lifespan

Aslan develop faster than humans and are considered adult at
fifteen years. A male Aslan is in his prime from the age of twenty
to around forty, whereupon he begins to decline rapidly. Males live
naturally into their sixties; females reach the mid-fifties on average.
Gerontology is not a priority for Aslan medical science, so aged
Aslan who wish to prolong their lifespan unnaturally must seek out
alternative sources of medical treatment.

###### Diet

The Aslan are almost exclusively carnivorous. They consume a few
nuts, fruits and berries but scorn root vegetables, grains and other
plant-based foods as being fit only for 'herd animals'. The Aslan
do practise extensive agriculture to maintain their vast herds of

livestock and there is some archaeological evidence to suggest that
the early Aslan had a diet that was higher in vegetable matter but the
cultural emphasis on predation and carnivorous behaviour means
that no modern Aslan would willingly eat plants.

The Aslan do have the technology to produce synthesised meat but
it is consumed only by the poorest members of society or on worlds
too scantly populated or too inhospitable to support agriculture.
Even frozen meat is considered extremely poor fare – in any civilised
Aslan house or restaurant, the meat is slaughtered right on the spot
and rich Aslan even hunt their own food on a regular basis, stalking
their prey across private estates. As a single herd animal provides
far more meat than even a teenage male could eat, almost all Aslan
dinners are communal affairs. A whole family plus guests will dine
together. Aslan normally eat one large meal a day and sleep after
eating.

Small animals are eaten raw, while larger cuts of meat are lightly
cooked and heavily spiced. The Aslan have an astonishing repertoire
of spices and chemical preparations both subtle and bold. Aslan
try to maintain such culinary practices even on spacecraft, using
mouse-sized robots covered in a meaty sheath to mimic live prey
and carrying herd animals in cryoberths for later consumption.

Aslan cannot naturally digest [[Terra|Terran]]-derived meats but adding a few
genetically-engineered stomach bacteria corrects this. Some Aslan
take pills when visiting human worlds to adjust their biochemistry,
although many clans now include these bacteria in the medical
treatments given to all children soon after birth.

#### SOCIETY

The Aslan have long been a warrior race; they are noble and proud,
devoted to those in authority above them and responsible for those
who owe fealty from below. Aslan society is based on the family and
its relationships.

###### Family Structures

An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family ( _ekho_ ) of from
2 to 12 persons under a patriarchal leader. This family will generally
include the male family head, one or more wives, plus children and
various blood relatives of the leader (unmarried brothers and sisters,
aged surviving parents no longer maintaining separate families,
adopted orphans of blood relatives).

The Aslan do not distinguish between mothers – all cubs sired by a
male are cared for equally by all the male's wives. Patrilineal descent
is all that is important in Aslan society. Cubs are more capable than
human infants and grow more quickly. A cub can walk by the age of
three months and can speak within five or six months.

A child is considered part of the father's family until:

+ She is married off to a male (if female).
+ He acquires Territory (if male).
+ The father dies.

In the latter case, the father's Territory passes to the eldest son. The
eldest son may choose to include his siblings in his family but is
under no formal obligation to do so.

Several families combine into a pride ( _ahriy_ ), with one family
dominant. The leader of that family is also the leader of the pride.
Other families owe him and his family their fealty. A number of
prides form a clan ( _huiha_ ), with one pride dominant. Again, prides
in the clan owe fealty to the clan's leader. The clan's leader is
expected, in turn, to protect and provide for members of the clan,
settling disputes between prides within the clan and administering
his holdings wisely and well.

Clans may, in turn, owe fealty to more powerful clans, particularly
where blood relationships exist. The Tlaukhu consists of the
Twenty-Nine pre-eminent Aslan clans, the strongest within the
Hierate; many other clans owe them fealty, either directly or through
a chain of other clans. Overall, however, clans owing fealty to one
of the Tlaukhu are in the minority; most clans are independent and
function accordingly.

###### Beliefs

Aslan are spiritual without being especially religious; they honor
their ancestors and ask for their blessings but do not worship them

per se. Every Aslan home has a Shrine of Heroes, containing relics of
important ancestors; most Aslan will also carry a pouch containing
other keepsakes or some other heirloom. Honorable behaviour
comes from obeying the traditions of the ancestors.

The Aslan do not recognize any supreme being or divine plan but
believe the universe is alive in some fashion. Perfect actions – actions
unfettered by doubt, by fear, by irrelevant worries or concerns – can
bring an Aslan into accord with the universe for an instant. Such
moments are called aokol.

#### DUELLING & HONOUR

Aslan pride makes them a touchy race and it is quite easy for Aslan
to give or take offence. This behaviour originated in the struggles
for dominance within families and prides and remains a basic
part of the Aslan personality. Over the centuries, Aslan touchiness
has grown formal and extremely ritualised; this rigid pattern of
behaviour has been necessary to reduce conflict and injury in the
settlement of personal disputes. It should be noted that this struggle
for dominance is so deeply embedded into the Aslan psyche that it
cannot be unlearned. An Aslan can no more ignore an infringement
on his territory or a challenge to his authority than a human could
ignore the urge to breathe.

Non-Aslan who do not understand these ritual forms of conduct
find it difficult to get along with individual Aslan. For their part, most
sophisticated Aslan have learned a certain amount of tolerance towards
those who do not fit into the Aslan cultural pattern but the cultural patterns
are deeply ingrained and offence is still taken from time to time.

Aslan society generally categorizes abrasive, uncultured or
offensive behaviour into three classes: familiarity, impoliteness and
discourtesy.

Familiarity is the treatment of social superiors as equals; it involves
social interaction, extreme friendliness or condescending treatment
by a lower class Aslan toward an upper class Aslan. Touching an
Aslan without permission is an instance of familiarity.

Impoliteness stems from a lack of proper education or upbringing;
it might include failure to address a social superior by the correct
honorific, failure to respond promptly when addressed or losing
one's temper in public.

Discourtesy is a deliberate insult and springs from contempt, a lack
of respect, malice; outward actions may often be perceived by Aslan
as discourtesy although not meant to be so by someone alien to
Aslan culture.

Failing to immediately apologise for familiarity is impolite; failing
to apologise for impoliteness when corrected is discourteous. An
Aslan may apologise verbally or by making signs of submission
(offering one's throat to the offended party or abasing oneself).
Without an apology, any of these three behaviours can give offence
and an offended Aslan becomes an enemy.

Discourtesy, however, is grounds for duelling. Duelling is a common
way by which insults and slights are resolved, especially if rituals
and other tension-relieving forms fail to defuse the problem. Duels
follow well-established rituals and are fought to the death only rarely.
The rules of conduct and protocols which govern them clearly state
what is allowed and not allowed. A challenge to duel is never made
lightly. At the same time, reluctance to challenge is seen in Aslan
culture as weakness, a trait few Aslan wish to exhibit. Properly,
anyone may challenge at any time. Most challenges are issued in
response to discourtesy; elaborate but informal rituals have evolved
wherein one party is discourteous and actually gains stature if the
other does not reply with a challenge. Much of this behaviour seems
incomprehensible to individuals not steeped in Aslan culture.

The rituals for duelling, however, are strictly segregated by gender.
Males and females never duel; insults and slights by the opposite
sex are dismissed with the excuse that males (or females) do not
understand female (or male) honor. When a transgression becomes
too blatant, too extreme or too unacceptable, then a member of
the insulted Aslan's immediate family (and of the correct sex) will
respond to the discourtesy with a challenge.

The barriers against certain duels within a family are almost as
strong as those for cross-gender duelling. Children never duel with
their parents (which socially includes any adults in their family of
the previous generation, not just their biological parents).

To issue an informal challenge, the offended party need only bare
his or her claws and roar a challenge to the other Aslan. Informal
challenges are resolved as quickly as possible and are often fought
on the spot. Formal challenges are more involved and are reserved
only for the most important disputes, such as legal arguments. To
make a formal challenge, the offended party must contact the clan
head or a sanctioned representative of the clan head. The clan head
will then decide whether or not to permit the duel and state the time
and place of the contest, which will usually be in a clan duelling
arena.

Duels between Aslan take place as personal combat. Combatants
use only their hands (and dewclaws); combat continues until one
side receives a wound. In the case of grave insult, the fight may
continue to unconsciousness for one participant. The winner has
his or her honor satisfied; the loser is required by social and ritual
standards to apologise (even if he or she was the one originally
insulted). Duels to the death are not unheard-of but are sanctioned
only in the most rare of cases. Armor other than light armor is
banned, as are combat drugs and other augmentations.

Those too sick or old to duel may appoint a champion in their place
but this is extremely rare. Traditionally, there is a clan champion
whose responsibility it is to fight for those clan members who
cannot duel but in a pinch, any Aslan of the correct gender can be
nominated as champion.

For non-Aslan, one way to gain an Aslan's respect is to be willing
to challenge to duel when required and to duel if challenged. Aslan
consider those who do not embrace their culture to be tahiwihteakhtau
(barbarians). Willingness to behave in the honorable fashion is one
indication that one is not a completely ignorant barbarian.

Since Aslan especially respect prowess in battle, upholding one's
honor in a duel is especially respected. However, if both parties
agree, the duel can be replaced by a contest of a different kind, such
as a debate, a board game or even the roll of a die. Such substitution
is frowned upon in most circles, as it is seen as degenerate and
weak but is common in places like the scientific community, where
females will debate the validity of different theories with logic and
mathematics, not claws.

In space, Aslan fighter pilots have been known to duel. Such fighter
duels have even decided the outcome of whole fleet engagements,
where both sides agree to abide by the results of the duel instead of
fighting. Fighter duels are fought to the first successful hit.

A duel ends when the loser is wounded (or slain, in the case of
duels to the death). The victor may not deliberately slay the loser
but (if male) is within his rights to scalp the loser. Duels can also be
fought challenging one party's right to breed (this is normally done
in response to one Aslan male having sex with the wife of another),
in which case the victor may geld the loser.

###### Duels & Social Standing

Most duels are over trivial matters and do not affect the Aslan's
social standing. However, formal or especially notable duels can
make or break the reputation of an Aslan. A character who wins a
formal duel against another Aslan of equal or higher Social Standing
gains one Social Standing; a character who loses a formal duel loses
two Social Standing.

###### Honor

Honor among the Aslan is primarily a male concern. Females are
expected to be honorable but it is the males who are obsessed with
their honor (or, to quote the poet Tarelriylr, only males have the
greatness of soul to be truly honorable).

The Aslan concept of honor rests on three pillars. The simplest
form of honor is respect , specifically, respect for the territory of
another. An honorable Aslan does not trespass on the territory of
another without permission or without intent to conquer. Territory,
in this case, covers all the possessions of another person – land,
money, wives, everything. An Aslan does not walk on the land
owned by another unless the other Aslan allows him access or
unless he intends to take it openly from the other Aslan. Conquest is
honorable; theft is not. Aslan do not work in secret (even Wars of
Assassins should first be declared openly).

From this concept of respect for territory, the Aslan have built a
whole system of feudal honor. Lords respect the territory of their
vassals, vassals respect the territory of their lords. A good Aslan
respects the privacy of another and only intervenes when he intends
to ask. The Aslan do not gossip, as this is a form of social trespass,
leading to strange situations where an Aslan might studiously ignore
the questionable actions of a neighbor for years, never mentioning
it to another soul and then violently intervene without warning. An
honorable Aslan takes everything he can hold and keep but does
not overreach himself, nor does he fail to live up to his potential.
An honorable Aslan, therefore, is boastful to human ears – his
boasts show the limits of his strength and ambition and show his
neighbors how far they can push him.

Respect even informs how the Aslan conduct their wars. An Aslan
'respects' his neighbor's territory by taking as much of it as he
can in time of war. Whatever the neighbor manages to hold onto,
though, is sacrosanct. An honorable man holds everything he can
and not a square inch more or less. Only males can hold territory;
all others are worthy of respect _only_ when they are associated with
a territory-holding male. During the Border Wars, this tenet of Aslan
honor confused many humans – an Aslan warrior might bomb a
city indiscriminately, then tend to the victims with great care. What
had changed was that now the city was conquered by the Aslan,
the humans were now chattels of a land-owning male. The Aslan
warrior now respected the humans, as part of his respect for the
conquering lord.

The second pillar of honor is _tradition_. The ways of the ancestors and
the heroes are the correct ways for an Aslan to behave. This does not

mean that the Aslan are slaves to the old ways – new technologies
make life easier and better and the Aslan must adapt to new worlds –
but it does mean that any new developments must be viewed through
the eyes of tradition. The teachings of the priests and poets must be
obeyed, especially those relating to war and duelling.

An honorable Aslan keeps to the traditions of his sire and his sire's
sires. He fights their feuds and helps their allies. He fights duels
fairly and makes war according to the limitations agreed on by both
sides in the presence of an earleatrais. He keeps his word when he
gives it and obeys the commands of his clan elders.

The third and final pillar of honor is harmony of action or
khoafteirleao. This is the hardest of the pillars to master and is
difficult to even explain to non-Aslan. Of human beliefs, perhaps
zen comes closest. The Aslan believe that the universe is a thought
in motion and that perfect actions can move in accord with that
thought. An Aslan who attained khoafteirleao is expressing the will
of the universe. Khoafteirleao can be reached in any context or deed
but is most commonly reached in combat or in poetry and speech.

###### Feuds

Disputes between families or between prides, usually take place because
of slights, insults, mistreatments or problems which have not been
resolved to both parties' satisfaction. The families may back different
scientific theories; one family member may have won a competition
which the other family had traditionally won; a family may have rejected
a proposed marriage between it and the other family.

Feuds are an intermediate step between duels and wars. Strangely for
Aslan society, they are unstructured and lack rituals to control them.
If kept at a low level, a feud is a pretext for discourteous behaviour
and sparks many duels. If allowed to get out of hand, it involves the
vassal prides and families of each side and can erupt into war.

#### WARS

Disputes between clans (usually over ownership, control or access
to land) are, like duels, also highly ritualised. They are resolved
through formal clan wars. Like duels, such wars are given highly
specific rules (agreed upon by all parties in advance). There are
many modes, from ordinary military conflicts to wars of assassins
to capture the flag games in which some token must be removed
from an enemy stronghold in order for victory to be won. Unlike
duels, most (but not all) clan wars do involve the death of enemy
personnel. In some cases (particularly wars of assassins), the war
may be bloodless, akin to the counting coup practices of certain
Native American tribes from early Earth history.

If a dispute is leading two clans to war, then the nature of the war
will be negotiated through envoys; generally, the clan willing to
commit to the most limited form of warfare is the one that holds the
moral high ground and can force concessions from the other party.
Wars are overseen by an earleatrais (referee) from a neutral clan.

While there are numerous variations on each of these modes of
warfare, a rough scale of escalation for Aslan conflicts is as follows:

+ Display of Strength:Display of Strength: Both sides marshal their fighting forces
    and arrive on an appointed battlefield; the side with the
    greater fighting force wins. It is permissible to call on allies to
    participate in such a display, in a dispute involving two well-
    connected clans a minor system might suddenly be filled with
    dozens of Aslan warships facing off against each other. Trickery
    is permissible in a Display of Strength – if your opponent
    believes that your hover-trucks covered in plastic shells are
    actually grav-tanks, then victory may be yours despite having a
    lesser fighting force.
+ War of Champions: War of Champions: As a Display of Strength but when both
    sides are gathered, a single unit from each side (a lone warrior,
    a squad, a vehicle, a warship) is sent forward to fight as
    champion against a similar unit from the other army.
+ War Games: War Games: Both sides agree on the amount of forces that can
    be committed to the war and the location of the war. Often,
    the war is fought on barren territory like an airless moon or an
    unclaimed and unwanted planet. The conditions for victory are
    agreed upon before war begins – the winner might be the first
    to conquer a particular fortress or to find a particular item or to
    inflict a set level of casualties on the opponent.
+ War to First Blood:War to First Blood: In the War to First Blood, the victor is the
    first side to accomplish some goal – traditionally, wounding
    a member of the ruling family of the enemy clan. Any means
    may be used to win the War to First Blood but hostilities must
    cease as soon as that goal is accomplished. In modern times,
    when clans can have members scattered over a dozen worlds
    without instant communications, Wars to First Blood are rare,
    as it is impossible to simultaneously alert all combatants that
    the war is over.
+ War of Assassins:War of Assassins: In a war of assassins, both royal families
    are permitted to send assassins to attack one another. Only
    the ruling families of each clan and their bodyguards are valid
    targets in a war of assassins and even then the 'assassination'
    may not be lethal – touching a target with a bared claw may
    be enough to count as a 'kill'. An assassin must bear a token
    confirming that he is the agent of the clan that sent him – an
    ivory medallion is the traditional sign of the assassin but more
    modern clans use a microscopic sensor-baffling implant to
    avoid detection by scans.
+ Strictly Limited War:Strictly Limited War: In the strictly limited war ( _tehlaicho_ ), the
    forces and theatre of operations for both sides is agreed on
    beforehand. Two clans might agree to fight only with whatever
    military forces are on a particular world when the war begin and
    would prevent the war from spilling onto any other planets.
+ Limited War: Limited War: A limited war is restricted to a single system but
    there is no limit to the forces that can be committed to the
    conflict. This level of war includes attacks on ships within the
    system and is likely to expand into piracy and raids on supply
    lines.
+ Minor War: Minor War: A minor war permits attacks on multiple systems
    and the use of warships and other heavy weapon. 'Minor'
    implies that neither clan is willing to risk too much in the

conflict – both sides exchange regular Envoys and have clear
end goals.

+ Open War:Open War: Open war between two or more clans is rare and
    is precisely what the Aslan codification of conflicts is intended
    to avoid. In an open war, the entirety of the clan's military and
    industrial base is committed to the conflict and everything is a
    valid target. The loser of an open war will suffer a catastrophic
    loss of territory, power and prestige.
+ Total War: Total War: The aim of a total war is to annihilate the other clan
    completely, wiping out every living male. In modern times,
    total war would likely be impossible to successfully prosecute
    and would draw the wrath of the _Tlaukhu._

#### LAND

A deep-seated territorial instinct causes male Aslan to have an
inordinate (from the human point of view) concern for the acquisition
and control of land. The ownership of land is a major goal in the
lives of most Aslan males. An Aslan's stature is determined by the
amount of land he (or in the case of females, her husband) controls
and the amount of land controlled by his family, pride or clan. The
lowest classes in Aslan society are landless, providing the farmers,
labourers, craftsmen and workers essential to the society.

The largest landholds are in the hands of the Tlaukhu and consist of
many worlds and parts of worlds. Since holding such an extensive
territory is beyond the ability of one Aslan, an extensive network
of vassals (usually sons, brothers or male relatives by marriage)
administer it in the clan head's name.

The Aslan concept of nobility springs from landholdings and Aslan
social level could originally be correlated with the landholds of the
family: any family with a landhold was noble, with higher social
level equated to greater landholdings. Today, any Aslan of Social
Standing 9+ is considered noble. This does not mean that a noble
male himself has land, only that he comes from a family which
holds land.

Landholds are passed on from father to son. Originally, sons
fought for the right to inherit their father's landholdings; the losers
became subordinate to the winner or left to seek a new landhold
for themselves. On large landholds, the losers became vassals to
the winner and administered part of the landhold as their own.
Primogeniture (the automatic passing of landholds to the eldest
son) is a recent cultural innovation, having come into favor about
2300 to 2400 Aslan. Sons who do not inherit are ihatei (literally,
second sons). With the development of starflight, ihatei became the
vanguard of Aslan exploration and conquest of space.

Landholds have always been difficult to come by. Early explorations
on Kusyu opened up new territory and made more land available.
Periodic warfare has redistributed landholds to the stronger males
and conquering clans redistributed land to particularly brave,
resourceful or deserving males. With the advent of starflight, vast
new territories became available.

Landholds are frequently granted as a reward for military excellence
or other superlative service to the clan. An individual clan will include
prides and families of all social levels; the most important of these
will be of high Social Standing (9+), with extensive landholds (usually
all held in fief as vassals of the clan's leader); middle class prides and
families will have smaller landholds, while the lowest classes own no
land at all but live and work on land belonging to their lords.

Only males may own land; the male's mates will, however,
administer any revenue from the land and the industries on it.

###### Territory

A male's Territory characteristic measures the amount of land he
possesses. Territory is rated on a scale like any other characteristic.

TerritoryTerritory

Characteristic Characteristic
DMDM DescriptionDescription ExamplesExamples
0 –3 None No territory.
1-2 –2 Average A single-family
dwelling and a small
garden.
3-5 –1 Wealthy A dwelling housing
the family and
associated retainers,
a large garden.
6-8 +0 Minor noble A large structure
housing the family
and capable of
accommodating most
of the pride, together
with gardens and
some open space.
9-11 +1 Average
noble

An estate of
considerable size,
including a hunting
forest of several
square kilometers in
extent.
12-14 +2 Grand noble A vast estate, possibly
covering an entire
world.
15 +3 Clan head Multiple worlds.

Estates of size 9+ are usually partly sub-infeudated, where the ruling
Aslan grants portions of his territory to vassal males.

The physical size of a territory is important but so too is its economic
importance. A Territory that consists of several thousand kilometers
of airless moon is less prestigious than only a few kilometers of
a vibrant city. For a territory to be truly desirable, though, it must
include space to run and hunt – the ruler of a city may be far
wealthier than another noble whose territory is virgin wilderness
but the latter noble will receive more respect from his peers. The
best territories are therefore those which contain both wilderness
and commercial potential.

###### Territory & Social Standing

Territory is the foundation of Social Standing among the Aslan.
A male's Territory score determines his Social Standing and the
initial Social Standing of his offspring. In practise, Social Standing
and Territory do not move in lockstep – a female might win great
respect because of her success in managing a company, increasing
her Social Standing above her sire's Territory but it is rare for an
Aslan's Social Standing to differ from the most closely related male's
Territory by more than 3.

In play, the Referee should adjust an Aslan character's Social
Standing to reflect Territory changes. Every month of play, add or
subtract one point from Social Standing to move it towards the
Territory score of the character (or the character's mate or sire if
female). Acquiring Social Standing is comparatively easy for the
Aslan, as it is much more fluid than standing in the Imperium but it
is nothing without territory to underpin it.

###### Gaining and Losing Landholds

Every world in Aslan space is owned by someone (apart from a few
planets quarantined by the Hierate). To get a landhold, a young
male has five options.

He may inherit his father's landhold. Obviously, this only applies
if the Aslan is the first son or if his elder brothers are all dead or
Outcast.

He may be awarded a landhold by the head of his pride or by the
clan. Landholds are given as a reward for heroism in battle or for
some other notable service or success. Some landholds are in the
clan's gift – they have either been recently acquired or else passed
into the clan's possession if the last landowner had no heirs.

He may be given a landhold that is a sub-fief of a larger domain,
making him the vassal of the lord who holds that larger domain.
Again, such landholds are given as rewards but are much more
political. An ambitious Aslan lord might recruit promising warriors
by offering them part of his territory.

He may take a landhold by force. Normally, this happens in a war; it
is customary to permit warriors to keep whatever they can conquer
in a war, spurring them to greater feats of heroism. On some border
worlds, far from the watchful eyes of clan armies, an ambitious
young male can force an older one out.

For thousands of years, these first four options were the only ones
available to a young male. The obvious path to a landholding was
through warfare, conquering a rival's holding or so excelling in battle
that the clan would reward him with land of his own. The ensuing
bloodshed kept the clans in a nigh-constant state of war and turned
Kusyu into a planetary pressure cooker. Then, the development of
the jump drive gave a fifth option.

The young male may expand the Aslan Hierate by finding a new
territory offworld. This is the route favored by the Aslan in modern
times. The energies of hungry young males are redirected into

exploration, into taming new worlds and into contacting new
species. Aslan _ihatei_ have wandered far from the Hierate, visiting
worlds hundreds of parsecs antispinward and coreward.

While a male may claim any unoccupied territory on any world he
wishes, he must prove his ability to defend and develop the territory.
A clan has no interest in defending a territory far outside of its
sphere of influence, nor will a male be able to attract settlers and
lesser families to an inhospitable world without resources.

###### Customs

Trespassing on an Aslan's territory without permission is forbidden
and the landowner is within his rights to kill trespassers on the
spot. A visitor should either announce his presence or make a
proper petition when discovered by the landowner or his retainers.
The formal version of this petition is the phrase ' _si'yeikhteowetyu
kakhteiyatei'_ ( _I formally request the protection granted under the
terms demanded by your honor and beg leave to enter your domains_ );
informally, ' _fiya''_ ( _I am your vassal, sir and am obliged to you_ ). The
landowner, if he permits the visitor to enter, replies ' _ka'tei_ '.

###### Ihatei

The _ihatei_ are the vanguard of Aslan expansion and are of great
importance to modern Aslan culture and conquest. The word _ihatei_
translates directly as ' _second son_ ' but a more accurate translation
might be ' _non-inheriting son_ '. While male Aslan amount to less than
one in three of total births, the average Aslan landowner has three
wives and at least two sons. The elder son inherits the sire's lands;
the other males, the _ihatei_ , must find their own fortunes and territory
in the universe.

The son of a minor landowner might be given no more than
a weapon, a suit of armor and passage to the border. A luckier
_ihatei_ gets a Scout-class ship from his sire or clan, while the second
son of a richer lord might be given a warship and a host of armed
retainers. All the _ihatei_ flock to border regions, to warzones, to
unexplored territories where an ambitious young male could make
his name. Following in the wake of the _ihatei_ are Outcasts hoping for
redemption, lower-class males hoping to sign on as armed retainers
and mercenaries looking for work.

These border camps are the most dangerous gathering of Aslan.
Thousands of heavily armed, competitive and violent young males
all gathered in a single sprawling shanty town. The few females
present are technicians and weapons merchants. Each night, the
males gather around huge bonfires and listen to the boasts and
promises of _ihatei_ who are planning a war. One _ihatei_ might have
discovered a virgin planet, another has found an isolated human
world, a third believes that a nearby clan is weak and vulnerable and
a fourth _ihatei_ shouts that he will lead a crusade across the stars and
conquer the very heart of the Imperium.

Those gathered listen to the boasts and may rally to the banner of the
most promising ihatei. A successful ihatei gathers enough warriors
from the camp to conquer whatever territory he has found; an
unsuccessful one must return to the campfires another night or else
join the retinue of a more successful male. Along the borders, the
attacks of the ihatei are almost an annual event as a new generation
of young warriors fights for territory.

Most ihatei bands consist of only a few warriors and a single ship but
larger bands can number thousands or even hundreds of thousands.
If the Aslan believe that a world is worth conquering, then an army
of virtually any size can be gathered. Advanced and well-defended
worlds have fallen to the locust swarm of ihatei.

The ihatei occupy a curious place in Aslan culture. They are seen as
romantic wandering heroes and most Aslan popular entertainments
center around ihatei warriors and their retainers. The ihatei occupies
a place in Aslan society equivalent to the gunslinger or the ronin
samurai; they are heroic outsiders, bad boys, honorable without
being respectable. They have no formal political influence but
restraining or inciting the ihatei to a particular task is a key element
of any Aslan clan's foreign policy. They have no formal power in
a clan but a clan's expansion is determined by the support and
funding it gives to its ihatei sons.

#### RITES & OUTCASTS

At the age of fifteen years, an Aslan must undergo the _akhuaeuhrekhyeh_ ,
the Rite of Passage. This rite has several components, which vary
from clan to clan and between genders. Both males and females
are tested by the clan elders on matters of honor and tradition,
reciting epic poems from memory and recounting the deeds of their
ancestors. A cub's strength and determination are tested, sometimes
even resulting in injury or ritual scarring. Males must fight a duel
against a clan champion – victory in such a duel is almost unheard of
but as long as the young male demonstrates strength and courage,
he will acquit himself honorably. Many clans also have their young
males go through a series of aptitude tests.

Females are normally exempt from duelling but are given a much
longer series of academic tests to determine their suitability for
corporate or technical roles. Both males and females go through
certain secret tests that they are forbidden to reveal to the other
gender; these tests are unique to each clan.

After the rite, the young Aslan finds employment within the clan.
The sons of landowners may wait for their sire to perish or request
a scoutship from the clan and become wanderers.

###### Outcasts

It is possible to fail the Rite of Passage or to do so badly that no
one in the clan will offer the young cub a place. Such Aslan become
Outcasts, as do Aslan who shame themselves so foully that no
atonement is possible. Outcasts are stripped of their standing in
the clan and in society. Most large Aslan communities will have a
_rukhtaha,_ a ghetto where the Outcasts dwell. Outcasts are permitted
to perform various tasks seen as 'unclean', such as farming
vegetables or other foul jobs. _Rukhtaha_ are dangerous areas, as the
Outcasts are not above turning to crime to support themselves.

The children of Outcasts are also Outcast. Usually, a wandering _ihatei_
will accept some Outcasts into his retinue; if the _ihatei_ establishes
a new landholding, the Outcasts can be given an honorable place
there, restoring their standing.

#### GENDER IN ASLAN SOCIETY

The sexes have very different roles in Aslan society. Males (in all but
the lowest classes) are concerned mostly with military operations,
acquisition of territory and political affairs. Females, on the other
hand, are concerned more with industry, trade and commerce and
with the accumulation of wealth and knowledge. Females always
own and control corporations.

Upper class males have little concept of money and are literally
incapable of functioning in a technological society without aid.
They are seldom encountered away from the supervision of a wife,
mother or some other female relative or employer. For instance, a
typical Aslan mercenary unit will be organised by a wealthy married
female, who will then assign its operation, for a share of the profits,

to an unmarried female relative. The battle commander and most
of the troops will be unmarried males (many of them also relatives,
hired with promises of land grants and the opportunity to gain
honor, glory and reputation in combat). These males are capable of
operating most forms of high-tech equipment by rote as black boxes
but their expertise is limited to bravery, tactical skill and button
pushing. Tasks which require more than this must be entrusted to
males of very low social level or to females. Females of high social
level fill all staff, operations, supply and intelligence positions and
handle the administration of the unit. This example holds true for
most aspects of Aslan society.

Aslan tend to place great emphasis (generally unconsciously) on the
gender of those they deal with, whether Aslan or alien. They also tend
to make their evaluation of gender based on a cultural rather than a
biological basis. As a result, an Aslan can see a human as having a
perceived gender of male because she is a gunner, even though she
is biologically female. An Aslan might also classify a human male
navigator as female (because he considers navigator to be a female
occupation). Such judgements have strange ramifications, because an
Aslan will accept discourteous behaviour from the opposite sex, while
challenging to a duel a human believed to be of the same sex. Aslan
will also refuse to hire individuals of a gender inappropriate to the job
(qualified females will not be hired as pilots; qualified males will not be
hired as brokers); yet if the human's gender is not directly pointed out,
an Aslan will often assume correct gender based on skill qualifications.

Because the ratio of females to males in Aslan society is roughly
3:1, Aslan society tends towards polygamy (which tendency can be
traced to Aslan prehistory) when populations were small and a male
stood a greater chance of survival with more hunting females in his
family. However, a high proportion of females remain unmarried,
preferring to devote themselves to business, science or other
matters to the exclusion of marriage. Unmarried females remain
part of their father's or brother's families and in most corporations
it is the females who pledge to remain unmarried ( siyajkhaora ) who
get the top positions (since marriage would transfer the wife – and
the wife's holdings – to a new family, often outside the clan, to the
detriment of the clan's interest in that company).

In general, wives (like land) tend to be apportioned according to the
social level of the male. Lower class families usually consist of a
male with a single wife, while upper class families may have several
wives married to a single male. It is rare for more than four or five
wives to be found in any one family.

###### Sex, Love & Marriage

The Hierate is founded on the clans; the clans are founded on the
prides and the prides are founded on families. The family is the core
of Aslan society and its structure is inviolate. Every male is expected
to marry at least once and to support as many wives as his territory
will allow. Females are to serve males or their sires by doing all
that is needful and managing the servants; males rule and fight. As
long as an Aslan conforms to these expectations, everything else

is irrelevant. Same-sex relationships are not uncommon, especially
among Aslan women. As these relationships cannot give rise to
children, they have no bearing on an Aslan's social standing. A male
is no more concerned with a wife who sleeps with a female friend
that he is concerned by a wife who has lunch with a female friend.
It's just sex – and if there is an emotional component, this too is
irrelevant as she is not sleeping with another male.

Heterosexual relationships are somewhat more important, as they
can threaten a marriage. Unmarried Aslan may do as they wish

+ but if a child is conceived and the two prospective parents are
of comparable social standing, then marriage is expected. In cases
where a marriage would be improper (a landless Outcast and the
daughter of a clan head, for example), the pregnancy is either
terminated or the child is adopted by a married relative.

Extramarital relationships are not uncommon but carry a unique set
of risks. A married male may consort with unmarried females freely,
although if his existing wife or wives believe that his territory cannot
support another wife, then they customarily put financial pressure
on the male to desist. A married female may also consort with
unmarried males, provided they have their husband's permission
and ensure that conception is impossible. A rich male may offer
the use of one of his females to a successful warrior, although the
female is within her rights to refuse.

Secret extramarital relationships are tantamount to an attack on the
husband's territory. The crime, to the Aslan, is not a lack of fidelity
to one's husband, it is taking the risk of bearing a child not sired by
one's sanctioned mate.

The Aslan permit a form of divorce. A female can be reclaimed by
her clan if a male relative fights a duel with her husband. In more
progressive cultures, this duel is a purely ceremonial affair where
the husband is given a share of his wife's wealth in exchange for
submitting to her male relative. In older cultures, the wife must be
literally rescued from her husband's territory.

#### DRESS, ART & ARCHITECTURE

Aslan dress in loose tunics and kilts. Footwear is uncommon, as are
gloves or any garments which restrict the wearer's movements. Most
clothing is ornate, with etchings ornaments, golden or shimmering
threads and elaborate embroidery being used to decorate even
everyday garments. Males often wear small amulets and talismans
in their manes in a system of heraldic braids that displays the male's
clan and territory.

Among upper-class males, displays of wealth and power are very
important. The Aslan are not as obviously ostentatious as the Vargr
but they do appreciate demonstrations of wealth. A rich Aslan might
dress in silken robes and wear a heavy harness studded with jewels
and precious metals.

Aslan architecture and design tends to the organic and the rounded;
there are few straight lines, just flowing shapes. They favor artistry
over efficiency in the design of their buildings – every Aslan structure
is different, with its own variations and surprises. Even in mass-
produced housing, the residents will strive to make their territory
uniquely theirs. Human visitors have described the dominant trait of
Aslan architecture as unsettling – one is never wholly sure if one is
alone and unwatched. Every garden seems to have a hidden balcony
or treehouse where the owner can watch his guests, corridors twist
and turn unexpectedly and every room seems to have at least one
concealed entrance.

The two main strands in Aslan artistic endeavor are spontaneity
and tradition. The Aslan consider 'premeditated' art to be rather
lacking. An artist who spends months labouring on a single painting
must be lacking in inspiration. Some of the greatest works of Aslan
art were created on the spot and in some cases were drawn on a
random wall that the artist happened to be passing. Popular forms
of spontaneous art include weahakhil , poems similar to haiku that
are composed extemporaneously; tahuhakil, which are written
weahakhil where the glyphs reflect the action of the poem and
aeokhul , which are especially musical roars.

Traditionalist art includes epic poetry, jewellery-making, hair-braiding
and sculpture, all of which have been practised in roughly the same
form for hundreds of generations. Another popular traditionalist art
is yoyeaokhtef, epic poems written in the style of tahuhakil where the
calligraphy mirrors the action. Yoyeaokhtef are used as decorations
on almost all Aslan ships.

#### GOVERNMENT

Government in the human sense does not exist in Aslan space. There
is no central authority for the Aslan as a race and Aslan have little
concept of racial unity, purpose or pride. They do have a fierce pride
in culture; a human who adheres to the culture and traditions which
Aslan consider proper is considered closer in spirit than an Aslan
who has, for some reason, abandoned those traditions and culture.
Aslan have no racial prejudice but do have cultural prejudice, with
non-Aslan looked upon as tahiwihteakhtau (barbarians) unless they
embrace Aslan culture and behave as Aslan.

The Aslan equivalent of government is best equated with social
structure. The head of the family settles disputes between family
members. The head of the pride or a delegated male member of his
clan or a delegated vassal settles disputes between prides.

Disputes between clans are settled by clan wars, highly ritualised
affairs, which will function using specific rules, restrictions in
locale, tech level of equipment, combatants and many other
aspects of the conflict. Such disputes are overseen by an
earleatrais (referee) from a neutral clan. Such an appointment is an
enormous honor for the clan receiving it and the referee acts with
scrupulous objectivity; moreover, especially good referees will be

able to produce not only fair decisions but ones which will salvage
honor and pride for both sides.

At the top of the chain of family, pride and clan heads stands the
Tlaukhu. The term is used synonymously for the twenty-nine clan
heads who meet on Kusyu and for the twenty-nine clans which are
the most powerful in the Hierate. When the Tlaukhu was originally
established on Kusyu, they were an alliance of the largest and strongest
of the Aslan clans. Since then, the criteria for the composition of
the Twenty-Nine has been strength and land; population, military
strength, industrial power and landholdings are together considered
when evaluating relative rankings of clans. Of the original Twenty-
Nine, nineteen clans remain in it today; the remaining ten positions
have been occupied (some by a succession of clans) by new clans
which have risen in strength, power and population to replace the
others. Replacement of clans on the Tlaukhu occurs as the result of
clan war or when a clan falls in power and prestige to the point that
it must become vassal to another clan.

Representatives of the Tlaukhu meet continuously on Kusyu to
arbitrate disputes, settle matters of common interest and otherwise
interact with one another in the interests of their individual clans.
It naturally follows that their decisions affect the other clans of the
Hierate as well. A decision to cooperate in the development of a
new technology affects other clans when the technology becomes
available; a decision to settle a clan war affects other clans by creating
or removing trade barriers. Regardless of the effects of the decisions
of the Tlaukhu, it is in no way to be considered a ruling council. The
Tlaukhu makes no laws, decides no issues affecting the Hierate as a
whole, owns no collective bases, military forces or other centralised
institutions and has no power over any clan (except for the power
each individual clan in the twenty-nine has over vassal clans). The
closest analogy that might be found in human history is the League
of Nations, a body with no authority in which important issues and
disputes can be debated but not necessarily resolved, save by the
agreement of all concerned. Each clan is an independent entity
(but may also be vassal to another clan). It controls space within
each system in which a world is owned; when control of a world is
split among several clans, there is a balance of power in the system
as well. Each clan in such a case might maintain its own base, its
own colonies, its own space station, its own outposts. Each would
enforce such regulations regarding interplanetary flight as it saw fit,
with local law level serving as a good guide to its stringency.

Representatives of other clans (powerful allies, vassals or overlords)
exert some influence on any given world, as do large corporations.
These agents or envoys are most often found at the local starport,
watching out for the interests of their clan or corporation.

Starports are for the most part extraterritorial enclaves which are not owned
by any clan. The facilities are built, operated and maintained by corporations
which lease the land from a local clan. If a clan base is present, this will be
located at the starport but is under the control of the owning clan.

###### The Aslan Homeworld

Kusyu A8769H6-E T Industrial
The Aslan homeworld is Kusyu, located in hex 0305 of Kilrai'
subsector. Kilrai' is subsector G of I'aheako sector. Humans often
spell Kusyu as Kuzu in Anglic; Kilrai' is often spelled Kilane.

Kusyu orbits a close binary consisting of Tyeyo and its
companion Saietaie. Saietaie orbits Tyeyo at 4.2 million
kilometers with a period of about one eakhau.

Tyeyo is a G4 V star somewhat dimmer than and fractionally
smaller than Sol. Luminosity is 0.77. Effective temperature is 5,600°
K. Radius is 0.93 of Sol. Mass is 0.96 of Sol. Saietaie is a DA dwarf
star barely visible against the face of Tyeyo but becomes noticeable
when its orbit swings it up to two stellar diameters to either side
of its companion. Luminosity is 0.0003. Effective temperature is
14,000° K. Radius is 0.01 of Sol. Mass is 0.36 of Sol.

Kusyu orbits Tyeyo at 1 AU with a period of 320 standard days. It
rotates on its axis once every 36 standard hours (one eakhau).

Kusyu is 12,980 kilometers in diameter and has a standard
atmosphere tainted with industrial pollutants. Sixty percent of
the world is covered with water oceans. Kusyu has two major
continents, both in the same hemisphere and both straddling
the equator. Several large archipelagos lie off the continents'
shores. North and south polar icecaps, anchored by island
groups, cover about 15% of the total world surface.

Kusyu has minimal axial tilt and orbital eccentricity. Average
temperature for the world is about 9° C.

Kusyu has two natural satellites, each about 400 kilometers in
diameter orbiting at 51,000 kilometers and 96,000 kilometers
respectively. Several artificial satellites, including two LaGrange
stations, are also present.

Kusyu has a population of 4.6 billion, which includes the
population of the artificial satellites and of several undersea
colonies. There are less than 600,000 non-Aslan on Kusyu.

Humans classify the government of Kusyu as civil service
bureaucracy but Aslan classify it as split control, similar to
balkanised for humans. All of the 29 Tlaukhu clans (and about
300 others) have landholds on Kusyu. Weapons restrictions
are about equivalent to human law level 4 (military weapons
prohibited). Technological level is E and is about the maximum
to be encountered in the Hierate.

A large number of bases (both clan and Tlaukhu) are located on Kusyu.
Aslan consider land on Kusyu of especially great value and clans gain
both status and power from their landholds on the homeworld.

apology is sufficient atonement for a first offence. A fine or perhaps
donated labour for the family is called for in later offences.

For crimes with victims, current practice is to find an impartial earleatrais
to consider the case and present findings; appeals can be made to a
panel composed of the heads of the families of the accused, the victim
and the earleatrais. Penalties call for restitution at the very least and
often doubled or tripled penalties as punishments. Clans vary in their
treatment of cases where the victim is physically injured or killed; some
inflict a similar fate on the guilty party, while others require restitution
and punitive damages or terms of forced labour. Judgements in cases
involving money and males are often very lenient, taking into account
the lack of understanding most males have for money.

The Aslan do not have a police force to investigate crimes. If the
crime is of sufficient importance, the clan may assign agents to
seek out the criminals and bring them before the panel of judges.
For petty crimes, the victim must either take the law into their own
claws or else hire a rukt'hao, a private investigator.

For crimes of honor, judgement is made by the pride or clan head,
depending on the severity of the crime. Crimes of honor are the most
serious of crimes in Aslan society and penalties range from banishment
(at a minimum) through mutilation or branding to forfeiture of all
property and death. In practice, most crimes of honor are never tried: a
duel to the death disposes of the accused before a trial can take place.

On worlds where control is split between many clans
(Aslan government types H or J), transportation and
trade routes are similarly owned by corporations
that lease land from the clans through which the
routes pass. All destinations, however, would be
either clan territories or leaseholds established
by companies doing business on the planet.
Permission is needed to enter these areas for
individuals not of the clan (Aslan and non-Aslan
alike).

Representatives of clans and companies can be
found at the starport and other major transport and
trade terminals, from whom such permission must
be sought.

###### The Hierate

Although the Hierate has no central authority, it
is a single interstellar community. Outside the
Hierate exist several other Aslan communities,
including several large clusters of colonies in the Trojan Reach and
Beyond sectors and some to rimward of the Hierate. These colonies
are separate from the Hierate, isolated primarily by distance. The
Aslan of these communities are far closer, however, to the Aslan
social norm than most Aslan living under the Imperium or in the
Solomani Confederacy.

###### Justice

Criminal acts are rare but not completely unheard of in Aslan society.
Crimes are different from the insults or slurs that provoke duels and
are classified into three categories: crimes of passion, crimes with
victims and crimes of honor.

Crimes of passion involve misbehaviour prompted by temper, anger
or provocation (assault other than duelling, intoxication or rioting).

Crimes with victims involve taking of money or items of value (theft,
stealing, burglary, fraud, forgery, extortion) or violating the person
of another for profit (kidnapping, terrorism, piracy).

Crimes of honor involve failure to observe rituals established
for behaviour (ambush, failure to obey the _earleatrais_ in a duel,
abandoning responsibilities, lying in a clan council, perfidy). Originally,
all accusations of crime were judged by the head of the family, pride
or clan involved. Through time, other methods have evolved.

For crimes of passion, the accused is judged by the head of the
family, pride or clan involved. Who judges the accused is determined
by elaborate protocols which consider the ramifications of the crime
and the notoriety which it has received. Appeals may be made to the
next higher head. Punishments are minimal for first offences, with
escalating penalties for continued violations. Generally, a contrite

###### Aslan Megacorporations

Four megacorporations exist in Aslan space:

TlasayerlahelTlasayerlahel: : The largest existing Aslan merchant company is Tlasayerlahel (the name means Interstellar Merchants, in Aslan).
Tlasayerlahel is clan-controlled: it is operated and managed by Aslan females from the Yerlyaruiho clan. Aslan males from the clan
hierarchy provide basic policy guidance to the company but day-to-day management is provided by the more capable Aslan females.

Tlasayerlahel was originally established to provide transport service between worlds owned by or subservient to, the Yerlyaruiwo clan.
As the clan grew, the company grew as well and today it provides cargo and passenger service between major worlds in all sectors
of the Aslan Hierate.
Home Port: Kusyu.

Reastirlao:Reastirlao: The number two megacorporation in Aslan space is Reastirlao, an independent corporation which has grown from a
small trading company which served parts of Hlakhoi sector. During the clan war between Yerlyaruiwo and Tralyeaeawi (614 to 693),
Reastirlao provided transport support to Tralyeaeawi clan and reaped large profits. During the war, the company also established many
trading bases (often displacing existing bases belonging to Yerlyaruiwo clan's Tlasayerlahel); when the war ended, Reastirlao was
positioned to retain those bases and to build on the foundation they had created. By 900, the company had attained megacorporation
status with trading bases in all of the Hierate's sectors.

Reastirlao has retained its independence by prohibiting marriage by its higher level managers. Its female managers thus cannot be
influenced by the male leaders of various clans. Successful managers are rewarded with large cash settlements when they leave the
company and many of the managers pursue marriage and family after their career with the company is over.

Reastirlao, in addition to merchant operations, maintains a base of heavy industry in Hlakhoi and Ealiyasiyw sectors and its product
mix includes starships, machine tools and construction materials.
Home Port: Htyaaeirl.

Iyalil:Iyalil: The third largest megacorporation specializes in heavy industry and electronics and was for many centuries the backbone of
the Hierate's military-industrial complex. Iyalil is closely associated with the Hlewela clan, who founded the corporation in the early
days of Aslan space exploration, before the development of the jump drive. Iyalil benefited greatly from the rush into space, providing
hulls and other components for the Khaukheairl/Yerlyaruiwo jump engineers, as well as terraforming and life support gear for the
new colonies.

The Hlewela clan leadership argued with the corporate management during the Cultural Purge of the 2300s – the Hlewela males were
hidebound members of the _Tlaukhu_ , while the sympathies of the managers were with the outer colonies. Divisions grew until Iyalil
managed to tear itself away from the founding clan. It remained neutral in the war and is now owned by females from many different
clans. It is based in Staihaia'yo Sector.
Home Port: Eafoarei

Khtularoihowa:Khtularoihowa: This giant corporation is the youngest of the four great corporations. Originally founded to trade with human colonies
along the trailing border, Khtularoihowa adapted to supply weapons and ships to raiders during the Border Wars. Its clever managers
predicted (and some say, influenced) the course of the Border Wars and Khtularoihowa profited greatly from every phase of the
conflict. By the time the wars ended, the corporation's position was unassailable and today there are many worlds along Reaver's
Deep that are wholly owned by Khtularoihowa.
Home Port: Kusyu

###### Other Social Services

Many of the services which humans consider the province of
government are provided by the pride or the clan. Roads, public
works and justice are all provided by the local clan or pride, as is the
task of education.

Many functions are handled by corporations. Many tasks which
the pride or clan believes should be done are contracted out to
corporations. Throughout the Hierate, corporations run private
schools, security patrols, hospitals, fire protection and record
keeping services and are paid directly by the users or by fees from
the local clan or pride.

#### ASLAN CORPORATIONS

Commerce and industry play a large part in Aslan society, as it
does in any technological society. Corporations are the domain of
female Aslan. Males might be employed by a corporation as crews
of starships, mercenaries or (for the lower classes only) workers but
the direction and management of corporate affairs rests entirely in
female hands.

For this reason, corporations are not clan-owned, since the clan is
a masculine quasi-political structure. Instead, customs have grown
up to maintain corporate independence but also allow clan ties to
corporations, furnishing a continuity to the conduct of business.
Small businesses pass from clan to clan through the marriage of the
female business owner. Larger companies have safeguards built in
to avoid direct ties to a clan. That said, there are strong connections
between the corporate and clan spheres, leading some to compare
Aslan corporations to organised crime. It is not unknown for a
corporation to be granted exclusive trading rights within a domain
or for a landowner to block passage through his territory for all
goods except those handled by his sister's corporation.

Some companies may be owned by a female who has decided not to
marry. Ultimately, control passes to another female who has made
a similar pledge. An owner may always opt out of management if (or
when) she decides to marry; a successor is always being groomed
as a hedge against the possible marriage, death or disability of the
current owner.

In other cases, the ownership may indeed be clan-controlled, with the
upper levels staffed by the unmarried females and wives of the clan. In
such cases, marriage of an executive outside of the clan will result in
an exchange of assets; in essence, she will sell her stock in her native
clan's company to other executives of that company and buy stock
in her new clan's company as a condition of her marriage. If a large
potential monetary loss is involved, simultaneous cross-marriages
or other methods of equalising the value of the exchange may be
arranged or required. Marriages of this type are frequently more
complex than complicated corporate mergers within the Imperium.

A third type of corporation is the jointly-owned company, in which
executives may be drawn from many different clans and clan interest
in and control over such corporations is proportional to the power

of its females within the corporate hierarchy. The aim is to strike a
balance and this type of company strives to be beyond the possible
control of any one clan.

Finally, a single female might amass enough wealth during her lifetime
to elevate her to the circles of the large corporations. She may adopt a
conventional business organization, establish a unique organization
or simply allow the corporation to be broken up on her death.

###### Kinships & Secret Schools

Kinships are Aslan organizations roughly cognate to human guilds
or social clubs, focussed on a particular topic or skill. Kinships can
cross clan lines and are often one of the few peaceable connections
between warring clans. The oldest kinships were gatherings of
experts in a particular field. The Healers' Kinship was formed of
physicians from a dozen different clans, who gathered under a flag
of truce to exchange medical knowledge and secrets; other ancient
kinships include the Secret Schools ( hoaawli ) of the warriors, which
preserved secret fighting techniques and martial arts.

One of the most important kinships is the Brotherhood of Stars.
The Aslan jump drive was developed by the Yerlyaruiwo and the
Khaukheairl clans and the secrets behind its operation were held only
by those clans. Initially, the other clans had to pay the two starfaring
clans for passage on their jump-capable ships but as the demand
for star travel grew, the Yerlyaruiwo and the Khaukheairl could not
build enough ships to cope. They therefore formed a kinship, the
Brotherhood of Stars. Aslan admitted into this kinship were taught
to build and operate jump drives but also swore oaths not to reveal
these secrets and not to use their skills against the kinship's founders.
In this way, the two clans were able to open up the jump drive to
the other clans without losing their influence, while still avoiding an
otherwise-inevitable war for control of the drive technology.

In modern society, the kinships are close to the Traveller's Aid
Society in the Imperium. A member of a kinship may appeal for
aid or shelter from other members of the kinship. Membership of a
kinship cannot be purchased – it is awarded to talented students or
to family members.

#### THE SPACE FORCES

Space Forces are operated by any Aslan group which finds a need
for them. Most are operated by clans but some companies also
maintain Space Forces for corporate purposes.

Aslan Space Forces perform missions of a greater diversity than
does a corresponding human space Navy. In addition to military
operations, an Aslan Space Force provides transportation for clan
members (for colonization expeditions), conducts exploration and
scouting expeditions (usually to accommodate ihatei in search of new
lands), supports clan territory with transportation and by carrying
trade goods and even engages in merchant operations. Aslan Space
Forces also perform more traditional space Navy operations such as
space combat and offensive and defensive operations.

###### Types of Space Forces

There are typically three sizes or types, of Space Forces within the
Hierate:

Planetary Space ForcesPlanetary Space Forces are usually small and are restricted to a
single system; they are operated by a clan which controls only one
world or system. Such a Space Force will have few (less than ten)
starships, although it may have quite a few more non-starships.

Clan Space ForcesClan Space Forces are operated by a clan which controls more than
one system. Most Aslan Space Forces are in this category.

Tlaukhu Space ForcesTlaukhu Space Forces are operated by clans which are members of
the Twenty-Nine. _Tlaukhu_ Space Forces are more proficient, better
equipped and more technologically advanced.

###### Organization

The composition of crews on Aslan ships is dictated by Aslan
psychology and culture. Upper-class males command and hold jobs
such as pilot and gunner (those in which no more knowledge is
needed than that required to punch the right buttons or give correct
orders). These officers may be highly capable in the performance of
their duties, superb space tacticians and so forth but they only know
what to do, not necessarily why. Females hold all officer positions
that call for technical knowledge and lower-class males and females
are found performing maintenance and repair duties. While the
captain, an upper-class male, commands in combat, his female
executive officer runs the administrative details of the ship.

In combat, the Aslan are a tricky proposition. The average Aslan
combatant is more skilled than his opposite number; an Aslan
gunner has done nothing except learn to acquire and destroy targets,
an Aslan fighter pilot has spent years practising dogfighting and
attack runs. The downside is that the average Aslan combatant has
no idea how his weapons work and can be thrown off by even minor
damage or a change in circumstances. One probably apocryphal tale
from the early Border Wars tells of an Aslan ace who destroyed half-
a-dozen Solomani fighters in a single engagement without taking a
scratch – then flew his fighter into a star because he did not know it
would damage his ship.

###### Privateers

Clans involved in clan wars of very high intensity can (under the
elaborate rules of clan warfare) issue letters of marque and reprisal.
These letters permit a corporation to attack starships and spacecraft
of the enemy clan wherever it is found. Since the corporation is
involved in the operation for profit, such an attack tries to disable the
enemy vessel and then capture it; prize crews then board the ship to
take the capture and its cargo to port. Personnel on board the ship
are identified by clan: those not in the enemy clan must be released
safely; those in the enemy clan can be killed but more frequently are
ransomed (the profit motive is primary in a privateering operation).

Privateering is a business venture much like mercenary operations.
It can take place only in limited circumstances, however, so it is

relatively rare. In addition, the risk of losing a privateering ship is
great enough that it is usually undertaken only by corporations with
some ties (even informal ties) to one of the clans involved.

###### Space Hazards

In space, Aslan systems have a far lower risk of piracy and similar
hazards than many systems in human space. Piracy as a profession
is tainted with dishonor and most Aslan would never pursue such
a career. It is not, however, completely unknown; it is possible to
rationalise such pursuits with enough thought and effort.

More frequent dangers, however, are those of direct encounters with
vessels of a hostile clan or with privateers. When vessels belonging
to clans which are at war with each other meet, their actions are
governed by the particular rules applicable to the clan war. A chase
and battle may ensue; ritualised (but still deadly) games of coward
(collision courses, deliberate near-misses, ramming) may take
place; insults and threats may be exchanged; or nothing at all may
happen. When a clan war has escalated in intensity enough for there
to be open hostilities, then there is also the potential for privateers:
corporate-owned raiding ships licensed by a clan to raid the ships
and commerce of the enemy clan. Such corporate activity is profit-
oriented and considered a legitimate enterprise.

#### THE MILITARY

Each clan maintains its own armed forces to defend and protect it
and many companies own mercenary forces which are hired out to
clans – or to groups outside the Hierate – for profit. The necessity
for such forces is demonstrated by the fact that clan warfare is
constant in the Hierate; somewhere there is always a clan war in
progress. Although such wars are formal and governed by elaborate
rituals, they are no less deadly for the combatants.

External threats to the Aslan are infrequent (the last of the great Aslan Border
Wars ended in 380 Imperial) and also are handled on the clan level.

One problem Aslan sometimes have is recognizing that non-Aslan
are less likely to fight by the strict set of rules which govern Aslan-on-
Aslan conflicts. Until realised, the Aslan often fight at a disadvantage.
When they do recognize that the enemy is not abiding by the supposed
rules, Aslan tend to over-react and begin all-out warfare.

###### Organization

Military organization for the Aslan military places males in leadership
and fighting positions and females provide administrative or
technical support. Unit commanders are male, assisted by a female
executive. The commander leads the troops and determines tactics,
while the executive oversees logistics and has a strong influence over
operations through her creation of battle plans. Maintenance and
supply units are staffed by lower-class males and females. Fighting
units are staffed mostly by males, support units mostly by females,
although there is some crossover. Males of low social level in combat
units have some chance of social (and hence military) advancement,
while those in non-combatant arms have virtually none.

###### Mercenaries

Mercenary units are typically organised as business ventures by
a female (often as part of a corporation). The owner or a female
relation appointed to act as representative of the owner, negotiates
tickets and generally sees to business. This individual accompanies
the unit headquarters and is the ultimate source of decisions
regarding the employment of the unit. In practice, however, she lets
the (male) commander make the combat decisions, intervening only
when the male's lack of a balanced viewpoint threatens the best
business interests of the unit.

The profession of mercenary is an honorable one, since there are
usually more landless males (lower-class and _ihatei_ alike) than there
are positions in a clan's military force. Mercenaries win land, honor
and glory through their actions and females have run mercenary units
as a source of wealth since long before the Aslan went into space.

Some mercenary units are composed of highly trained assassins;
skilled less in mass warfare than in individual or small unit combat
techniques. These units need fewer females, since logistics and
similar operations are less a part of a war of assassins. There is
nothing dishonorable about such assassinations, as long as they
are part of a prescribed clan war. Such units might be comparable
to the ninja of Japan but without the stigma attached to ninja by
contemporaneous samurai society. All in all, however, assassins
and wars of assassins are far less frequent than more orthodox
warfare and military forces.

#### LANGUAGE & NAMING

All Aslan (with the exception of a few lost colonies) share a common
language and culture. However, this culture is highly complex and custom-
bound and individual names and words can become rather unwieldy.

The clan head of an independent clan (vassal to no other clan)
is known simply by the clan's name; where differentiation is
necessary, the particle ko (himself) is added. For example, the head
of clan _Hlyueawi_ would be known as _Hlyueawi_ or _Hlyueawiko_. At
the opposite extreme, an Aslan lower in the social order (but still a
noble) might be named _HlyueawifiyAhroay'ifiyWahtoiLayeauiwahfeak
telihlalikhtyeiteyahahtateisiyu_ , roughly meaning, 'unmarried
first son of the third son of the grandfather of the head of the pride which
holds the valley in the fork of the _Iwahfeal_ River, part of clan _Wahtoi_ ,
which is a vassal of clan _Aroaye'i_ , itself a vassal of clan _Hlyueawi_ '.

Females are named for their husbands, fathers or brothers, depending on
circumstances. Non-nobles are named for the nobles of whom they are vassals
or clients. Needless to say, while formal or ritual speech (which is frequent)
calls for Aslan to use their full names, nicknames are commonly used among
intimates and are absolutely essential if gamers are to play a _Traveller_ game and
get past the stage of introducing their character in a single session. Nicknames
usually commemorate some supposed virtue or achievement and can be
chosen and discarded whenever the holder desires.

In coming up with names or words for Aslan characters, places or
things, a simple system for generating random, Aslan-sounding
words is provided. This neatly avoids all considerations of syntax
and vocabulary. Simply generate a word as desired and assign a
suitable meaning to it, such as 'Killer of Ten Thousand,' or, less
bloodthirstily, 'He Honors His Ancestors,' or 'Place of the North
Wind'. Since Aslan does not translate well into English (most Aslan
words are an entire phrase of meaning, much like written Chinese
ideograms), meanings can vary considerably. Tehleikhoi is the name
of an Aslan mercenary regiment; it can be translated as 'Soldiers of
the Falling Night,' 'Knights of the Setting Sun,' or 'Warriors of the
Evening Star'. There is a great deal of latitude in the development of
Aslan words and names.

###### Aslan Language

The Aslan common language is called _trokh_. Humans find it difficult
to learn but quite beautiful to listen to. For the most part, _trohk_ is
a lyrical tongue, although there is the occasional dissonant growl
or roar. There are several dialects of _trohk_ ; all of the major clans
have their own version of the language and _trohk_ has been greatly
expanded by the females to cover scientific and economic topics.
Common _trohk_ can be understood by all Aslan but males are quickly
left behind when females start talking in the technical dialects. A
male dialect of _trokh_ exists; this is a highly formal language, used in
legal and political circles.

A few ultra-conservative clans preserve older Aslan languages, such
as _trow_ or _haeto_.

###### Aslan Script

The common Aslan writing system is composed of hundreds of
glyphs called tao. These glyphs were originally pictorial, coupled with
several symbols that are clearly derived from claw-marks but have
become greatly stylised. Common sentences can be understood
with knowledge of only three dozen common tao.

A scientific form of tao is used by females for technical purposes.
On board an Aslan ship, consoles used by males will use simplified,
traditional tao , while female controls will be labelled using the
female glyphs to provide more accurate information.

###### Aslan Mathematics

The Aslan have four fingers, so they naturally use base 8 mathematics
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 and so on). Powers of 8
are therefore nice round numbers to the Aslan. An Aslan epic poem
might say that 4,096 warriors died in a battle or that a warrior took
64 wounds before dying; these are not precise measurements but
the equivalent of a human saying 10,000 people fought in the battle
or that the warrior took a hundred wounds.

###### Generating Aslan Words

Words in Aslan, like English, have definite letter frequencies and
syllable patterns which are independent of information content;
it is possible to randomly generate words which look and sound
Aslan. Aslan syllables are composed of up to three elements: an
initial consonant, a vowel and a final consonant. The Aslan Sound
Frequency table shows the relative frequencies to be expected for
various sounds in the Aslan language. For example, the relative
frequency of f as an initial consonant is 5:87 and that of h as a final
consonant is 10:47.

Pronunciations:Pronunciations: This table is a guide to Aslan speech but many
Aslan sounds are not reproducible by human vocal cords.

Aslan has four syllable types: those consisting of just a vowel
(V), those beginning with a consonant (CV), those ending with
a consonant (VC) and those both beginning and ending with
a consonant (CVC). In Aslan words, their relative frequency of
occurrence is about 3:3:2:2. Out of ten syllables, three will be V,
three will be CV, two will be VC and two will be CVC.

A few rules govern how sounds are grouped together. No syllable
ending with a consonant can be followed by a syllable beginning with
a consonant. A single letter vowel can never be followed directly by
the same single letter vowel (dipthongs can); for example, aa should
not occur but aeae or even aeei could.

#### HUMANS IN THE HIERATE

Just as Aslan are found in the Imperium, so, too, humans may be
encountered within Hierate space. This can occur in two ways: the
humans may be outsiders or they may actually be part of the Hierate
social structure.

The reception of human travellers in a Hierate system depends
largely on their business there. If they are seen as being useful to
the clan, they will be welcomed. Otherwise, they will be requested
to refuel and depart as quickly as possible. Most probably, they will
be doing business with some local corporation, buying or selling
and humans spending large amounts of money are likely to be quite
welcome (at least as far as that corporation is concerned).

Most dealings within Aslan space require that characters seek out
influential Aslan patrons, either nobles or corporate executives, who
can smooth the way for them to travel in Hierate space. A lord might
give a party a letter of introduction to his vassals elsewhere or a vassal
a letter of recommendation to his lord. Corporate dealings would be
essentially contractual.

Tourism is not beyond the bounds of possibility, with corporations
providing guided tours of Aslan worlds (and paying part of the profits
to the controlling clan). Tourists would, however, be shepherded
closely by assigned guides. In general, most Aslan space would be
considered an Amber Zone for most humans, due to the dangers
associated in dealing with touchy Aslan individuals. A human's
best recourse is to attempt to understand and make use of Aslan
customs, to obey the judgements of Aslan lords and above all, to
fight for honor are the most important virtues a visiting human
can display. By and large, such humans have nothing to fear while
in Aslan space, as long as their own actions and intentions are
honorable and they behave with propriety and respect.

Humans may also exist as vassals of some Aslan clan. In such a case,
the humans thus encountered will be almost indistinguishable from
racial Aslan in terms of behaviour and culture, having thoroughly
embraced all aspects of Aslan culture. Others will be barbarians

who have been actively kept from interstellar travel by a locally
dominant clan.

Human characters who have adopted Aslan culture follow basic
Aslan character generation. Humans do not gain the various
physiological differences (enhanced strength and endurance, the
claws, bursts of increased speed, superior senses, and so on) but
are otherwise treated pretty much as Aslan. Men and women thus
generated will be much like their Aslan counterparts. Their drives,
motivations and ways of looking at things will be thoroughly Aslan.

## HHISTORYISTORY

The history of the Aslan race is a history of conflict and forced
development under the threat of law. Aslan technological
development and exploration of the stars are driven by clan strife
and the constant hunger for new territories. The result is a race
whose reach threatens to exceed its grasp, a vibrant dangerous
species who will either accomplish great things or dash themselves
to oblivion in endless wars.

#### PREHISTORY

From the earliest days when they were hunters on Kusyu's grassland
plains, the Aslan have had a curious dichotomy in their social
organization. Females were traditionally responsible for provisions
and improvement of life, while males existed largely for defence
and war. The early hunts were conducted by females and females
are generally credited as the innovators in the areas of toolmaking,
animal husbandry and eventually, agriculture (developed to support
herds of livestock, not for direct consumption). Males adopted
female innovations reluctantly but it was the female of the species
who strived always to improve the Aslan way of life.

The Aslan eventually hunted to virtual extinction most of the large
carnivores which threatened them on Tatohti, the largest of the
planet's continents. At this point, fire, metalworking, agriculture
and many other developments had brought the Aslan to the
verge of civilization and the security they now enjoyed permitted
development of a number of civilised communities on Tafohti.

The territorial instincts of the Aslan male made the general trend of
Aslan social development a feudal one. Families formed into prides
and prides formed into clans under the leadership of a dominant
pride. Clans practiced a variety of semi-feudal procedures of fiefdom
and vassalage which led to the development of a few very powerful
clans but this was generally the limit of social organization in most
Aslan civilizations. Although tradition and ritual gradually evolved
to curb the aggressive male character, wars were common as
clans sought greater power or greater territory and as population
pressure increased on Kusyu, wars grew both more common and
more intense.

#### THE DAWN OF THE HIERATE

By –167 Aslan (–2250 by the Imperial calendar), the Aslan had
attained roughly TL3, although their military technology was pushing
into TL4. Worse, the whole planet was now controlled by the ruling
class of landowners – there was no territory left for young Aslan
to expand into. Duels to inherit a father's territory became more
brutal; wars, too, became more common as the disenfranchised
males pushed to invade the territory of other clans. A permanent
class of _awkhea –_ landless vassal families – arose.

came to the place where <Holds-His-Ground-Son-of-Broken-
Tooth-Grandson-of-He-Who-Rules-The-Sunny-Valley> had made
his camp. <Red-Maned-Warrior> saw the signs of ownership and
he gave honor to <Holds-His-Ground> and <Holds-His-Ground>
gave honor in return and welcomed <Red-Maned-Warrior> to
the camp. Now, <Holds-His-Ground> had three wives and these
wives were out hunting.

The first wife returned at sunset and she brought back a <goat> she
had slain. The second wife returned when the fast moon rose and
she brought back seven <rabbits> that she caught with a cunning
trap. The third wife came back not at all, not even when the slow
moon rose, not even when the embers of <Holds-His-Ground>'s
fire became ash.

<Holds-His-Ground> said to <Red-Maned-Warrior>: <Third-Wife-
of-Holds-His-Ground> is missing. I shall search for her.

And because <Red-Maned-Warrior> shared his fire, he went with
<Holds-His-Ground> into the night.

They came to a fork in the trail and <Holds-His-Ground> went to
the left and <Red-Maned-Warrior> went to the right and in a cave
in the hills <Red-Maned-Warrior> found <Third-Wife-of-Holds-
His-Ground> and she was threatened by a ferocious monster who
had trapped her in the cave. With great bravery, <Red-Maned-
Warrior> leapt on the monster and drove his dewclaws into its
eyes.

That morning, <Holds-His-Ground> came to the cave and found
<Red-Maned-Warrior> lying by the side of <Third-Wife-of-Holds-
His-Ground> and he was greatly angered. He roared a challenge
to <Red-Maned-Warrior> and the two fought and <Holds-His-
Ground> slew <Red-Maned-Warrior>.

And in this way, <Holds-His-Ground> guarded the honor of
<Third-Wife-of-Holds-His-Ground>.

As technology advanced in a forced march, warfare became an
increasingly specialized field. Firearms, tanks, poison gas – while
the males who wielded these weapons did not know how they
worked, they still had to be extensively trained in their operation.
A clan who fielded armies of peasants would be easily defeated
by a single male with a belt-fed machine gun. Some clans took
to employing mercenaries who were trained in the new weapons;

others stopped fighting petty border wars every year and launched
devastating blitzkriegs every ten years.

While there were nigh-constant limited wars between clans, the
pressure continued to build. The larger clans built coalitions of
lesser clans and vassals, bound by honor and treaty to aid their
masters in time of war. The situation was broadly similar to that of
Terra's Europe in the early 20th Century, when webs of alliances and
treaties ensured that local conflicts would spark greater ones. The
situation on Kusyu was even worse, as the natural aggression and
territorial nature of the Aslan pushed the clans inexorably towards
a world war.

The first Aslan world war ended abruptly with the use of atomic
weapons. The defeated clans recoiled, retrenched and launched their
own crash programs to develop such bombs. The second and third
wars, following within a decade, were catastrophic for the Aslan.
Atomic and then thermonuclear bombs were used with abandon.
Over twenty million male warriors died in the war; the number of
female civilian casualties has never been precisely determined but
likely exceeded forty million. Worse, the wars pushed the battlefields
to new territories that were unaffected by the atomic devastation.

Kusyu barely escaped a global conflict of devastating proportions,
saved by two developments which took place at about the same
time. First, the Aslan instituted their Hierate – an agreement on the
part of the twenty-nine pre-eminent clans to meet and discuss their
differences on a regular basis, replacing the previous procedures
which dealt with each problem on a case-by-case emergency
basis. The Hierate was initially formed as a trade organization, as
female-run corporations desperately tried to rebuild the global trade
network in the aftermath of the wars but was quickly adopted by
male politicians and envoys who recognized the threat posed by the
new weapons and the lack of new territory. The Hierate's efforts
did greatly improve the flow of commerce, giving war-torn regions
a chance to rebuild.

One of the Hierate's first great innovations was the expansion
of the _earleatrais_ system of external judges for duels. The same
concept of limited conflict arbitrated by a neutral party was applied
to warfare. The decision of the _earleatrais_ would be backed not only
by the honor of the warring parties but by the political pressure of
the twenty-nine greatest clans on Kusyu. Where there were a few
large-scale wars, most of the clan conflicts in the century after the
establishment of the Hierate were resolved using limited forces and
without any atomic blasts.

Aslan scientific development flourished in that century. The
principles behind atomics were applied to power generation. The
Aslan developed computers, which allowed males to perform
much more complicated tasks than before. The first rockets were
launched and the Aslan began to explore their solar system. Some
in the Hierate began seriously discussing the possibilities of settling
other planets.

Others worried about the renewed threat of population pressure.
The rebuilding fuelled by the economic boom and opportunities
offered by new technologies had absorbed much of the surplus
energy of the males but now a new and much larger generation of
males was reaching the age of akhuaeuhrekhyeh and these males
demanded territory. Vicious duels were fought between sons to
inherit their father's estates and the number of second challenges
(where a younger son challenges the winning brother) rose sharply
for the first time in a generation. The Hierate's shaky political
system proved inadequate to maintain the tradition of limited war
in the face of such pressure. Something had to give.

#### THE HUNT OF THE STARS

About 96 Aslan (–1999 Imperial), barely a century after the Tlaukhu came
into being (the exact date and circumstances of the discovery remain
shrouded in mystery); the two most powerful clans (the Yerlyaruiwo and the
Khaukheairl ) cooperated to an unprecedented degree to produce a stardrive.
It opened the stars to the Aslan race. The Aslan developed the stardrive at
early TL7, before they even mastered gravatic manipulation technology.
They leapt out to the stars in ships that could barely break orbit.

Star travel was the ideal way to satisfy the territorial drives of the race.
Initially, the star drive was kept a secret and the two clans who

###### TLAUKHU STRUCTURE

Formally, the Tlaukhu is made up of the Twenty-Nine clan
heads who rule the twenty-nine largest and most powerful
clans. Each clan head brings a retinue including his wives
and other matriarchs, his eldest son, bodyguards and other
advisors, both male and female, as well as all manner of
envoys, scribes, lawyers, champions and other specialists.
Meetings of all the Twenty-Nine are exceedingly rare, though
and are called only in times when the whole Hierate must
agree on a decision. Most of the time, the clan heads work
through representatives ( koso ) who attend meetings on Kusyu
while the clan heads dwell on their respective homeworlds.
The delay in interstellar communications means that the koso
of distant clans have almost as much influence in the Tlaukhu
as the ko they represent.

In addition to the high council of clan elders, the Tlaukhu
has several sub-committees and associated groups. Each
clan dispatches a number of ministers ( fteaoko ) to discuss
specialized topics such as trade, war, technology, foreign
relations, legal matters and so forth. All these ministers are
appointed by the clan heads.

There are also honored Aslan who are elevated to council
for their own deeds instead of family connections. These
honored individuals are called to the ongoing Grand
Conclave to discuss matters of honor and tradition. The most
important duty of this conclave is to review the composition
of the Twenty-Nine every thirteen years.

possessed it used it to establish colonies on neighboring worlds
but their boastful males could not claim the territory on these new
worlds – an Aslan warrior who claimed that he had a vast estate
on another planet would be laughed at. They were forced to reveal
the drive's existence (although most of the other _Tlaukhu_ already
suspected that the two clans had some strange new technology).
The _Yerlyaruiwo_ and the _Khaukheairl_ kept their monopoly on the
drive but offered to transport colonists from other clans off-world.

The two clans built as many jump-capable ships as they could and
when their own factories were strained to the limit, they permitted
the female engineers of other clans to study the drive. The Aslan
flooded into space with eager abandon. After three hundred years
of monopoly, the _Yerlyaruiwo_ and the _Khaukheairl_ went to war
with each other and as part of the peace settlement, the Hierate
demanded that they share the secrets of the stardrive with the other
clans for the good of the race.

At first expansion was slow, limited by the gradual development
of jump technology. The Aslan colonized a chain of worlds within
Jump-1 range; few of these worlds were especially desirable as
colony worlds but they were virgin territory, unclaimed by any male
but some were garden planets. A landless male could become a lord
with a single lucky discovery but of course the only males who could

afford a jump-capable ship were scions of rich families, so the Aslan
social divisions between awkhea vassals and hahea nobles endured
even on new worlds. Aslan society did evolve though. One notable
change was the acceptance of primogeniture, previously used by
only a few minor clans. Now the first son was guaranteed to inherit
his father's domain, while his younger brothers would receive no
land and so would have to find their own. This consolidated the
estates on Kusyu and the older colonies, while providing a ceaseless
supply of eager ihatei explorers and wanderers.

Within three centuries, the Aslan developed Jump-2 technology and
a tiny hundred-ton scout vessel that could be crewed by a handful
of explorers, along with huge colony vessels that could bring tens of
thousands of females and workers to a newly claimed world. Every
new planet discovered opened new territories for colonization. The
era of 96 to 2100 Aslan (approximately –1999 to –242 Imperial) was
an era of expansion and cultural flowering not unlike Earth's Ages of
Discovery (1450 to 1600 AD and 2100 to 2300 AD).

There were still clan wars in this era, most of which heeded the
Hierate's call for limited warfare. New weapons were developed
instead to battle other species. The Aslan encountered several
other sentient species in this expansionist era. Primitive species
were enslaved or even eaten by the Aslan; the practise of treating
sophonts as prey continued for another five hundred years, until a
great philosopher named Aewier convinced the clans that this was
rukhiywe (un-Aslan) behaviour.

The most significant species encountered by the Aslan was
humanity – the first contact with a Solomani vessel came within
a decade of the development of jump drive. The Hierate's primary
expansion was directed to spinward, away from human worlds but
the Aslan still regularly encountered human worlds and ships. Some
of these contacts were peaceful – human traders penetrated Aslan
space as far as Kusyu, looking for new markets and trader clans and
corporations imported technology and luxury goods from [[Terra|Terran]]
space. An increasing number of these contacts, however, were
violent. The [[Terra|Terran]]s had superior technology but the Aslan had the
edge in skill and aggression.

Luckily, the Aslan had come on the scene during the Long Night
(342 to 2323 Aslan; –1776 to –30 Imperial) in human space: the
era between the Second and Third Imperiums in which humanity
was splintered into many rival states. As a result, the Aslan never
confronted any human state at a time when it was significantly
stronger than an Aslan clan. This was important, for the clans of the
Hierate were never (and are not now) capable of acting in concert
as a human empire could; clans each conduct wars on their own,
sometimes with the assistance of others, sometimes without but
never with a sense of central purpose or unity.

Some human worlds accepted Aslan domination as a superior
alternative to the chaos of the Long Night and now remain within
the Hierate with a human or mixed human and Aslan population
embracing Aslan culture and society.

#### RETRENCHMENT & KINSTRIFE

The rapid expansion of the Aslan from a single homeworld to an
empire of several hundred worlds threatened to transform their
society. Males were born on worlds that had never known territory
disputes. On new colony worlds, where every pair of hands was
needed, males learned technical skills and females learned to fight.
The epic poems of the deeds of the ancestors were meaningless to
the ears of Aslan who had never looked upon the plains of Tatohti
or the mountains of Ashria. Many of the new Aslan worlds had their
own cultures and beliefs.

The Hierate itself was under stress. Formerly minor clans that had
embraced space travel now commanded territory and resources
dwarfing those of the original _Tlaukhu_. These clans and even several
of the _Tlaukhu_ moved their clan centres off-world to their own
planets, diminishing the centralised power of the homeworld. The
Hierate's limited power to enforce the collective will of the Aslan
people was diminishing yet further.

A Grand Conclave of philosophers, poets and clan elders was
called on Kusyu in 2302. This conclave argued that the defence and
cultivation of traditional Aslan values was the highest expression
of honorable behaviour and that the deviant strains of Aslan
thought must be brought back into accord with orthodoxy. The
cultural conclave offered numerous concessions to the progressive
elements in Aslan society – enshrining clan heroes from the age of
exploration in new epic poems, loosening the strictures on lower-
class males who performed traditionally peaceful, female tasks and

honoring off-world territories of particular size and worth. The
conclave also tried to improve the standard of living across Aslan
space – the rights of non-Aslan sophonts were enshrined, along
with the possibility that non-Aslan who behaved in an honorable
fashion could be considered to have Aslan souls. Overall, though,
the recommendation of the Grand Conclave was that to be Aslan
was to act in accordance with tradition and the outer worlds were
not doing so. It was a brave attempt to gather the diversifying strains
of Aslan culture into one universal system.

The Grand Conclave had no legal weight behind it but its
recommendations were adopted by the Tlaukhu – which had no
legal weight either but did represent the majority view of the most
powerful clans. The Tlaukhu ordered that all clans adopt the Grand
Conclave's recommendations. They expected some resistance to
this edict.

They got aisekhokhe entse – kinstrife in the stars.

The Aslan have no term for 'civil war' – the closest equivalent is
aisekhokhe or kinstrife, where two families in the same clan fight
against each other. The cultural wars from 2512 to 2701 were inter-
clan wars but they had all the divisions and bitter struggle of a civil
war.

On one side was the majority of the Tlaukhu, the old great clans and
the militant clans who had 'sharpened their claws' in the Aslan Border
Wars (see page 60) against the humans and who 'still understood
the meaning of honor'. They were joined by a number of younger
clans who hungered for the respect and the trappings of power held
by the Tlaukhu and a small few ultra-traditionalist clans who had
been decrying the decadence of Aslan society for generations. This
alliance referred to themselves as Crusaders, khiraokhaor'ya.

Opposing the Crusaders was an even looser alliance of forces. There
were the nouveau riche clans who had grown powerful on their
colony worlds and eclipsed the wealth and power of the Tlaukhu;
there were 'deviant' or 'progressive' clans who had adopted their
own beliefs and customs (in many cases, copied from humans).
There were also a few Tlaukhu clans who believed that standing in
the path of progress and evolution was futile and who were therefore
throwing their lot in with the winning side (and were appalled to
see such decadent ideas as 'not eating humans' enshrined in the
Grand Conclave's recommendations). Dozens of names were
applied to this faction; most historians refer to them as the tsekho ,
the starborn.

Aisekhokhe entse lasted nearly two hundred and fifty years, although
there were long periods of relative peace or at least limited war
during this period. Most of the truly bloody battles happened in the
first century ( Uwaralyekose or Cultural Purge), when great fleets of
khiraokhaor'ya and tsekho warships engaged each other in systems
close to Kusyu. Clans that had endured for thousands of years
were wiped out down to the youngest male; both sides committed
atrocities not seen since the foundation of the Hierate.

###### The Jump Drive Question

Historians ask a number of questions about the development of
the Aslan jump drive. How did the Aslan leap straight to a working
Jump-1 model without first mastering gravity manipulation,
unlike every other Major race? How did two warring clans,
traditional rivals in every way, come to work together in secret on
what must have been a massively expensive and hugely difficult
crash program to develop a drive? Why is the development of the
Aslan jump drive – the most recent such development in known
space – so shrouded in mystery?

Some suggest that the Aslan did not discover the principles of the
jump drive independently but instead acquired them from another
race. The Vegans could have sold the Aslan the drive or a crashed
Vegan ship might have been salvaged (the same suggestion has
been made about the Solomani of Terra). For that matter, the
Solomani sent a number of expeditions into what is now Aslan
space and not all of these expeditions returned – and Aslan
technology is remarkably similar to Solomani in many respects.

Without archaeological evidence or other proof, of course, all
these speculations are meaningless. The Aslan exploded onto the
interstellar stage just as all the other races were falling into the
Long Night and none can dispute their claim to be a Major race.

On the _khiraokhaor'ya_ side, the bulk of their fighting forces was
drawn from the clans along the Solomani border and these clans
often had to divide their troops between the civil war and the Border
Wars with the remnants of the Second Imperium and, towards
the end of this period, the growing might of the Third Imperium
as imperial forces expanded out from the Sylean heartlands. The
_khiraokhaor'ya_ were initially more aggressive but they were trapped
between two fronts and could not afford to push too far into _tsekho_
space lest some human warlord mount an attack on the Aslan.

For their part, the _tsekho_ were unable to capitalise on any weakness
on the part of the _khiraokhaor'ya._ Their alliance was a very disjointed
one, united only by their opposition to the _khiraokhaor'ya._ Inter-
clan fighting was a constant problem, as the _tsekho_ leadership were
unable to get the various clans to swear loyalty to one another. Many
of the _tsekho_ had no desire to fight back against the Hierate, so long
as their traditions were not swallowed up by the Conclave's.

they were effectively broken as great powers. To end the strife, the
Tlaukhu was reformed. Ten new clans were included in the list of the
Twenty-Nine and it was agreed that the composition of the council
would be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it represented the
strongest of the Aslan.

United once more, the Aslan threw themselves into resuming the
Border Wars. Skirmishes related to the Cultural Purge continued for
many more years, as feuds worked themselves out and minor clans
continued to resist the Grand Conclave's decisions.

#### THE ASLAN BORDER WARS

The Border Wars lasted from 1100 to 2810 Aslan (–1120 to 380
Imperial), from the time the Aslan expanded into the border worlds
of the old Second Imperium to the rise of the Third Imperium
and the Peace of Ftahalr. There were few grand invasions or huge
battles during the Border Wars, except in the early stages (when
the Second Imperium could easily mount a strong defence against
the comparatively primitive Aslan) and the closing years, when the
Third Imperium was able to hold the border against the Aslan. Most
of the conflicts were between individual Aslan clans or ihatei raiding
parties.

The Border Wars still evoke terror in many of the worlds invaded by
the Aslan. The skies would darken with attack ships; huge golden-
furred monsters would drop down on grav belts to storm the cities;
children would be taken as slaves and those who attempted to
hide from the Aslan would be butchered or even eaten. As human
civilization slipped into the Long Night, their ability to build warships
to fight the Aslan diminished. The few human vessels capable
of withstanding an Aslan raiding squadron became wandering
mercenaries, swooping in to defend colonies from attacks. Often,
these mercenaries were just as damaging as the Aslan raiders, as
their prices rose to extortionate levels.

Not all the Border Wars were destructive. At several times during
the long period of the wars, Aslan invasions gave way to trade ships
and peaceful contact. Aslan mercenaries even fought on the side of
human colonies.

Towards the year 2600 Aslan (170 Imperial), Aslan raiders in Reaver's
Deep encountered surprisingly heavy resistance from human
colonies there. Undeterred, they pushed onwards. In a desolate
system, they stopped to refuel at the local gas giant – and then a
huge jump burst was detected by the Aslan sensors. A warship,
tens of times bigger than any human-built ship seen by the Aslan
in generations, had jumped into the system and was descending
into the gas giant's gravity well. Trapped in the upper reaches of the
hydrogen-rich atmosphere, the raiders were doomed.

The Third Imperium had made contact with the Hierate.

By 2432, over a third of the _tsekho_ clans had abandoned their
worlds and moved en masse to systems spinward and rimward of
the Hierate. The majority of the _tsekho_ who remained were willing
to adopt – grudgingly, in some cases – the Grand Conclave's
recommendations, now refined into a set of books called the
Codicils. The original twenty-nine clans making up the _Tlaukhu_
had been devastated – three of them no longer existed and another
ten to twelve had lost so much of their influence and territory that

###### INFAMOUS DEVIANTS

Over two hundred clans were wiped out during the Cultural Purges. Most of these clans were simply slaughtered; others integrated
themselves into another clan with more orthodox beliefs. Many others fled the Hierate and either founded their own small empires or
died in the emptiness of space. Those who established themselves had only a few centuries of peace before the expanding borders of
the territory-hungry _khiraokhaor'ya_ engulfed and destroyed them. All these deviant clans are gone – or so the Hierate says, anyway.

Awyraolr: Awyraolr: Perhaps the most fearsome fighting clan in Aslan history, the aggressive Awyraolr burned too brightly. The clan conquered
several worlds inhabited by sentient species, who they treated as non-people feedstock. Their allies grudgingly tolerated this behaviour,
until the Awryraolr leadership declared that the _khiraokhaor'ya_ were non-people and the whole clan turned cannibal. Defeated Aslan
warriors were devoured live on the battlefield. The Awryraolr's allies turned on them and the clan was destroyed by _khiraokhaor'ya_
and _tsekho_ forces working together.

Hfuah:Hfuah: This clan had a higher female population than other clans and its culture became progressively more matriarchal as it
expanded. They bred their males for strength and stamina and their females for intelligence. By the time of the Purges, the Hfuah
males were unintelligent animals fit only for procreation and their females had taken over every aspect of clan life. The Hfuah fled the
Hierarchy rather than fight, heading across the Rift to settle in the coreward regions. There are rumors that the clan survives, having
switched to a form of parthenogenesis to reproduce.

Trui'kt: Trui'kt: The Trui'kt were among the most powerful of the _tsekho_ clans, due to their mastery of technology. The Trui'kt had a technology
level considerably higher than the rest of the Hierate and their warships were almost unbeatable in a one-on-one fight. They
experimented with cybernetic enhancement and other dangerous technologies, including a much greater use of artificial intelligences
than other Aslan cultures.

The Trui'kt vanished abruptly in the middle of the Cultural Purge. Their colonies were found empty; hundreds of their ships were
discovered floating in space, empty and lifeless. Other vessels were never found again, leading to speculation that the clan had
migrated beyond Aslan space. Investigations hinted at the possibility that the Trui'kt found a way to upload their minds to a virtual
reality. Perhaps the clan found their home territory in the infinite expanses of the virtual realm.

Trui'ah:Trui'ah: An offshoot of the Trui'kt, the Trui'ah used genetic engineering to improve their stock. The clan elders were obsessed with
creating a superior breed of Aslan and each generation was altered and enhanced. For a time, the Trui'ah were a rising star among
the _tsekho_ – their technicians thought faster, their warriors had superior strength and reflexes, their children were free of diseases
and genetic weaknesses. Then the Trui'ah introduced a life-extending genestrain, increasing their lifespan by hundreds of years.
The following generation grew up in the shadow of nigh-immortal parents; there was no prospect of their sires dying and passing
their territory on. The younger Trui'ah were forced to strike out in greater numbers to conquer new territory. They pushed their
neighboring clans too hard, the other clans turned on the Trui'ah and the _khiraokhaor'ya_ forces were able to destroy the weakened
Trui'ah clan.

Khoafteirftah: Khoafteirftah: This minor clan was a unique aberration in Aslan society. Psionics are virtually unknown to the Aslan outside their
myths and legends; there are no psionic foundations or traditions in the Hierate and the Aslan have no concept of psionics as a
science. There is considerable debate as to whether or not the Aslan race even possesses the genetic or mental capacity for psionics.
The Khoafteirftah clan, though, are said to have vast psionic powers. They were always on the fringe of Aslan space with few close
allies and their own mysterious traditions, so the truth of the matter is hard to determine. The Khoafteirftah may have been able to
use genetic engineering to add psionic capabilities to their line or may have found an Ancient mental enhancement device or perhaps
they unlocked some dormant power in the Aslan mind.

Whatever they found, it died with them when a Syoisuis fleet turned their territories into molten glass.

In the years that followed, Aslan forces clashed again and again with
Imperial fleets. Unlike other human foes, the Imperium was more than
a match for any one clan, even a great clan and its vassal clans.
To win, the Hierate would have to marshal all its forces – and
that is impossible for the Aslan race. Several times, a clan tried to
rally its neighbors to drive back these new human foes but the
neighbors would wait until the aggressive clan was weakened
by the Imperium, then seize the lightly-defended Aslan territory.
Meanwhile, the Imperium pushed closer and closer to Kusyu – a
capital world dangerously close to the border worlds. The nerve of
the _Tlaukhu_ failed and they sent envoys to the Imperium to negotiate
a settlement.

The Peace of Ftahalr (2810 Aslan) established much of Aeitle Sakh
(Reaver's Deep) sector as a buffer zone between Aslan and Imperial
spheres of influence; the population in the buffer zone was left
independent of both interstellar communities. The Border Wars
were over.

#### CROSSING THE GREAT RIFT

The Great Rift limited Aslan expansion to coreward for thousands
of years until explorers from the Wahtoi clan equipped with the new
long-range Jump-5 scouts managed to plot a course to the far side.
The scouts and traders from the Wahtoi mapped several subsectors
of Iiyoihuakh (Riftspan) and Hlaoiroahaurl (Trojan Reach) and
established a few small colonies but it took many more centuries
before the Aslan began a serious push into this new territory.

The Wahtoi and the other clans that colonized Iiyoihuakh and the
neighboring sectors laboured to set up a series of fuel dumps
and waystations along the Rift, allowing slower vessels like colony
ships to make it across. They expected a flood of new colonies and
ihatei flotillas but the Aslan were expanding spinward instead of
coreward and a landless male could more easily carve out a territory
in Waroatahe or Etakhasoa instead of making the long pilgrimage
across the Rift. The rift crossing route was still vastly profitable,
thanks to trade in rarities such as dustspice but the Aslan colonies
across the Rift were left largely to their own devices. With extremely
limited communications back to the Hierate, the Iiyoihuakh clans
set up their own local version of the Tlaukhu ; the Ya'soisthea. This
organization was modelled on the Hierate's governing council but
never adopted the same reforms that the Tlaukhu went through
several centuries later.

Following the Cultural Purge, dozens of clans driven out of the
Hierate made the crossing. Wishing to keep the favor of the
Tlaukhu , the Ya'soisthea clans resisted attempts by these refugee
clans to integrate into the existing Aslan worlds. Most of the refugees
pressed on Spinward or Coreward, settling unexplored systems.
Others settled on the fringes of the Glorious Empire, conquering
human worlds that had fallen to the Long Night or pushing onto the
borders of the resurgent Imperium.

#### CONTACT WITH OTHER RACES

The Aslan have incorporated numerous minor races into the Hierate.
These species, ranging from the avian-descended Pol Nox to the
reptilian Z'kr to the Ulane. Races encountered by the Aslan early in
their expansion were usually enslaved or annihilated but modern
Aslan are more likely to incorporate other races into the Hierate or
trade with them. Incorporated races are permitted to form clans and
own territory and may even be treated as the equals of Aslan if they
behave properly, although few non-Aslan ever rise above the rank of
awkhea (landless serf).

The Hierate's relations with the Imperium are fluid, at best. The
Solomani have had the most dealings with the Aslan race and they
remember the Border Wars vividly. The Aslan respect the Imperium's
strength and most clans honor the Peace of Ftaheir.

The Vargr were first encountered by Aslan scouts exploring along the
Great Rift. The two races are naturally prone to aggression, which is an
explosive mixture. Aslan raiders have clashed with Vargr forces again
and again. The only reason there has not been a full-scale war between
the two races is the sheer distance between their respective domains.
The Vargr see the Aslan as pompous and deliberately antagonistic;
the Aslan hold that the Vargr are dishonorable warriors who deserve
extermination. Humans joke about the two species 'fighting like cats
and dogs' and stay out of the war.

Aslan merchants first encountered Zhodani when searching for
dust-spice in the Spinward Marches. Human behaviour is strange
enough to the Aslan even without introducing psionics into the mix.
Zhodani tend to find Aslan overly emotional and psionically jarring;
the Aslan consider the Zhodani to be too passive and confusing but
maintain diplomatic contact with the Consulate to use as leverage
against the Imperium.

Droyne are among the races incorporated into the Hierate and are
considered little more than amusing pets or pests.

The K'kree and Hiver worlds are on the far side of the Imperium to
the Aslan and so there is extremely limited contact between the two.
The K'kree vegetarians find the ultra-carnivorous Aslan distasteful.
As for the Hivers, the Aslan monomaniacal drive makes simple
manipulations easy but the Aslan's hidebound code of honor
poses a problem for a larger-scale rebuilding of society.

#### THE ASLAN CLANS

Clans in capital letters are part of the Tlaukhu, the Twenty-Nine. This
is by no means an exhaustive list of the clans – there are hundreds
of major clans and hundreds of thousands of lesser ones.

Aroaye'i:Aroaye'i: Gatekeepers of the Great Rift; the Aroaye'i have dug in
on their home world of Aulryakh and have held that key world
for centuries. The Aroaye'i are notoriously conservative and slow
to expand but they keep what they conquer. They are experts at
building fortifications and defensive emplacements, as well as
armed satellites and system defence boats; clan corporations are
sought-after experts in construction.

Ahroay'if:Ahroay'if: Dominant clan in the Tlaiowaha sector; rapidly rising in
power because of trade with the Imperium.

Hlewela: Hlewela: One of the original Tlaukhu, the Hlewela lost much of its
influence and many of its members when the clan leadership on
Kusyu was shown to be entirely out of touch with the needs of the
clan. The Hlewela are a cautionary example to other clans about the
importance of strong leadership and wisdom.

HLYUEAWI:HLYUEAWI: The Hlyeawi ascended comparatively recently to the
Tlaukhu. They were vassals of the Yerlyaruiwo, specialising in tactical
and political analysis and advice. During the Yerlyaruiwo/Tralyeaeawi
war, the Hlyeawi identified a weakness in their own faction and
betrayed their former masters. They attacked the Uawairlew, a fellow
ally of the Yerlyaruiwo and captured much of their territory and their
seat on the council. The Hlyeawi are mistrusted by many Aslan but
have an impressive ability to innovate and adapt.

HRASUAHRASUA: : A militant clan, the Hrasua were one of the major
belligerents in the Border Wars and were responsible for numerous
attacks on Solomani worlds. A Hrasua mystic once prophesied that
the clan would 'rip Terra from the stars' and claim it as Hrasua
territory and the clan fervently believes in this legend.

Hrakoea:Hrakoea: An offshoot of the Hrasua, the Hrakoea were virtually
destroyed by Imperial forces at the end of the Border Wars. The
survivors mostly migrated across the Great Rift to rebuild their
territories there.

HRAWOAOHRAWOAO: : Another offshoot of the old Hrasua, the Hrawoao rule
many worlds along the border with Reaver's Deep.

IKHTEALYOIKHTEALYO: : Allies of the Tlaiowaha, the Ikhtealyo made their
fortune from trade. They control Tyeyo Fteahrao Yorl.

KHAUKHEAIRL: KHAUKHEAIRL: Hereditary rivals of the Yerlyaruiwo, the Khaukheairl
are known as patrons of the arts and keepers of Aslan cultural traditions.
Despite their deep-seated antagonism to the Yerlyaruiwo, the two clans
both represent the older side of the _Tlaukhu_ and so agree on many
matters.

SYOISUIS:SYOISUIS: A notoriously secretive clan, the Syoisuis favor spies
and assassins over direct conflicts. They are also a deliberately
moderate force in the _Tlaukhu_ , aiming for the middle ground in all
matters to gather as many allies as possible.

TLAIOWAHATLAIOWAHA:: The Tlaiowaha are known for their ability to plan
for the long term. They are considered poor warriors but have vast
financial sway. They are closely allied with Syoisuis.

Tokouea'we:Tokouea'we: An infamously touchy and arrogant clan, the
Tokouea'we were driven out of Hierate space by their rivals, the
Yerlyaruiwo. They fled to the Trojan Reach and rebuilt their holdings
there; they eventually broke off from the Hierate entirely and formed
the so-called 'Glorious Empire'.

TRALYEAEAWI:TRALYEAEAWI: The Tralyeaeawi are 'alien-lovers' or 'accomplished
diplomats' depending on who you ask. They have the largest
percentage of non-Aslan members and have contacts with numerous
alien races. Although they are one of the older clans, they advocated
a progressive agenda during the Cultural Purge, an act that won
them the enmity of the traditionalist Yerlyaruiwo.

Uawairlew:Uawairlew: The Uawairlew clan was once considered great and
is one of the oldest extant clans. Five hundred years ago, they
were attacked by their erstwhile allies, the Hlyeawi and lost over
eighty percent of their territory including their capital world. The
few Uawairlew who survived swore an eternal oath of vengeance
and all members of the clan are honor-bound to bring down the
Hlyeawi. Unfortunately, the passage of five hundred years has
seen the power of the usurpers continue to grow.

Wahtoi:Wahtoi: The Wahtoi first mapped the route across the Great Rift
and have a strong tradition of exploration. They have colonies
everywhere in the Trojan Reach and are considered excellent traders
and diplomats. Their military forces, however, are notoriously
laughable (' khira ji a'Waitoi'he', 'you fight like a Wahtoi male' is
an insult in Aslan society) and they rely heavily on mercenaries for
defence. Vassals to Tlaiowaha.

YERLYARUIWO:YERLYARUIWO: Another ancient and august clan, the Yerlyaruiwo
and their vassals and allies make up the single most powerful
political bloc in the Hierate. They are a conservative clan, holding to
the old ways and were strong supporters of the Grand Conclave and
the ensuing purges. The Yerlyaruiwo clan itself is not as powerful
as it once was but it has gathered so many sworn allies around it
that its position as guardian of Tlaukhu honor is unassailable. The
Yerlyaruiwo are sought after as arbiters and earleatrais.

## EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

Aslan equipment is broadly similar to human items. While the
aesthetics are different – Aslan items are bigger and heavier and are
much more likely to include either natural materials like wood, fur
or bone or synthetics that resemble natural materials – both races
are physiologically similar and the Aslan borrowed much of their
advanced technology from humanity.

There are obvious differences between items made for Aslan males
and those made for females. Male items, such as most weapons, are
simplified to the point of elegance (or beyond). A human laser rifle
has a wealth of options and controls, allowing the user to set power
consumption rates, adjust the weapon's focus, connect the weapon
to different types of heads-up-displays or diagnostic equipment and
conduct field repairs. An Aslan laser rifle has an on-off switch and a
trigger. Nothing comes between the warrior and his kill. There are
no distractions, no fuss, no pointless women's work – just the kill.

By contrast, female Aslan items have a wealth of controls and
options and seem overcomplicated or even deliberately obfuscated
to human operators. This is partly because of the Aslan love for
decoration; every item of worth is engraved, gilded, bejewelled or
adorned in some fashion. It also serves to reinforce the cultural bias
of the Aslan that 'technical' topics are the preserve of females.

In cases where an item is designed for use by both genders, such
as a vehicle, there will generally be two sets of controls or else a
core control system and a wealth of secondary controls. In general,
though, the further one gets from the core Aslan worlds and the
influence of the _Tlaukhu_ culture, the more the two strands of Aslan
interface design merge – rough colony worlds do not always have the
luxury to accommodate what is essentially a cultural affectation.

The Aslan have reached TL14 but are well behind the Imperium in
several key fields.

###### Currency

While each Aslan clan once had its own currency (and some isolated
worlds may only accept their own clan's scrip), there are now only
three currencies in active use across Aslan space. The Yahai and
the Khaukhi are currencies sponsored by the Yerlyaruiwo and
Khaukheairl clans and are used in the Spinward and Trailing sides
of the Hierate respectively. The _Yahai_ is worth approximately 0.3
credits; the _Khaukhi_ is worth 0.5 credits. The clans of the _Ya'soisthea_
have their own currency, the _Soitshi,_ which is roughly comparable
to the credit.

All three currencies are minted in the form of metal or plastic discs
and divided into smaller denominations of ½, ¼, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/64th.
It is much easier to falsify Aslan currency than Imperial credits and
many traders along the Aslan border must carefully examine all the
coins before they accept them.

#### ARMOR

Armor is a much more common sight in Aslan society than it
is amongst Humaniti. Most upper class males will at least wear
ceremonial armor as part of their daily wardrobe and virtually all
military personnel will wear heavier body armor than a human
would feel comfortable in. Aslan armor is always ornately decorated
and includes furs and other natural materials.

Many suits of armor also include full-face masks that are made to
resemble the features of the wearer (or an ancestor of the wearer).
These masks are a sign of prestige among the Aslan and are worn
only by those of high status.

Unless otherwise noted, an Aslan may use his dewclaw while
wearing armor.

Su'aua'a (Aua-leather, TL2):Su'aua'a (Aua-leather, TL2): Aua-hide clothing is the traditional garb
of most Aslan warriors and the heavy, musky stench of the leather
is part of the bouquet of every Aslan world and starship. The Aslan
produce so much aua-hide that it is used for everything from armor
to cargo restraints to children's toys.

Khirsukha (Ceremonial Breastplate, TL3):Khirsukha (Ceremonial Breastplate, TL3): These ornamental
breastplates are designed to deflect the razor-sharp dewclaws
of an attacker and are not strong enough to stand up to a bullet.
Most Aslan nobles of Social Standing 9 or more will wear one of
these breastplates at all times – wearing such armor without the
requisite Social Standing is considered discourteous.

Khirshukaya (Ceremonial Armor, TL3):Khirshukaya (Ceremonial Armor, TL3): A full suit of khirshukaya is
a rare sight these days; only the oldest clans have preserved these
suits. They are worn by ceremonial honor guards and nobles.
Khirshukaya is roughly comparable to human plate armor. It is
reserved for those of Social Standing 9 or more or their guards;
wearing armor without the necessary standing is insulting.

Su'koir'yerl (Combat Flex, TL6):Su'koir'yerl (Combat Flex, TL6): Combat flex armor is made up of
interlocking plastic plates, designed to resemble khirshukaya. These
suits are worn by clan agents, mercenaries and even some Aslan
traders and explorers.

Soisu'hru (Assassin's Garb, TL8):Soisu'hru (Assassin's Garb, TL8): Assassin's garb consists of a form-
fitting body glove studded with small armor plates. It is designed
for stealth rather than protection and gives the wearer a +1 DM to
Stealth checks. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this
armor.
TL13:TL13: Modern garb replaces the armor plates with a reactive layer
that becomes rigid when struck and also incorporates the Vislight
Chameleon option, giving the wearer a +4 DM to Stealth checks.

Suya'uiyekh (Aslan Vacc Suit, TL9): Suya'uiyekh (Aslan Vacc Suit, TL9): The Aslan vacc suit is similar to human models. The Aslan find the open vistas of space to be highly
disconcerting and so most have narrower viewports than human models to compensate. A standard vacc suit provides life support for six
hours. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.
TL14: At this level, the standard vacc suit is self-sealing and considerably more lightweight.

Suya'uiyekhva (Aslan Heavy Vacc Suit, TL10):Suya'uiyekhva (Aslan Heavy Vacc Suit, TL10): Heavy vacc suits are designed for use in hostile environments, much like the human HEV
suit. The _suya'uiyekhva_ includes powered actuators to aid the wearer's movements, as well as a built-in artificial intelligence to advise male
wearers on correct operation. It offers twelve hours of life support. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

Suya'uiyekhyerl (Combat Vacc Suit, TL12):Suya'uiyekhyerl (Combat Vacc Suit, TL12): The _suya'uiyekhyerl_ is a combat variant of the standard Heavy Vacc Suit, incorporating extra
armor plating and weapons hook-ups. Aslan fighters and dropships are all designed with the bulky _suya'uiyekhyerl_ in mind. It has life
support for six hours. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

Su'yerl (Combat Armor, TL12):Su'yerl (Combat Armor, TL12): _Su'yerl_ armor is a common sight on the battlefields of the Hierate. It uses a sandwich of composite
materials over a 0.5cm layer of bonded superdense plating and is then coated in a reflec lacquer. The armor is too heavy for most humans
to wear and even Aslan warriors find long fights in _su'yerl_ to be difficult propositions. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this
armor.

A character without Strength 9 or more suffers a –2 DM to all physical actions while wearing _su'yerl._

Su'yerlva (Heavy Combat Armor, TL12):Su'yerlva (Heavy Combat Armor, TL12): Only the strongest and most worthy warriors can bear the weight of _su'yerlva_ armor. The armor
is even thicker and stronger than basic combat armor and is normally augmented with grav assist equipment. A character without Strength
12 or more suffers a –2 DM to all physical actions while wearing this armor. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

Htiwoyerlitoir (Aslan Battle Dress, TL14):Htiwoyerlitoir (Aslan Battle Dress, TL14): Aslan Battle Dress is bulkier and less advanced than human designs. It lacks the built-in computer
of human suits but does offer six hours of life support and protection from environmental hazards. It also has servomotors boosting
Strength by +6 and Dexterity by +3. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

###### Options

All standard options listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ (page 88) may be used with Aslan armor.

Claw Port (TL5): Claw Port (TL5): A claw port allows an Aslan to use his dewclaws in combat while wearing armor. Basic claw ports are flexible orifices that
are hooked onto the muscles at the base of the claw. When the Aslan unsheathes his claw, the movement pulls the claw port open. More
advanced claw ports, designed for use in hostile environments such as vacuum, allow the bony claw to be extruded without damaging
the suit. Aslan planning to use their claws in such environments should invest in Claw Coating (see page 68). A claw port costs Cr. 75 for
armors below TL8 and Cr. 500 for armors of TL8 or more.

Command Command Armor (TL12):Armor (TL12): This upgrade adds a specialized computer weave and communications system to any armor. This computer
runs Intellect/1 and Expert (Comms) 2, handling unit coordination and control. This upgrade allows a male to command his troops using
modern telepresence and communications without having to deal with technical problems. Command Armor adds Cr. 12,500 to the cost
of the armor.

Ornamentation (TL2):Ornamentation (TL2): Even basic items are decorated by Aslan craftsmen but a fine suit of armor deserves much more. Ornamentation
costs the Social Standing of the wearer squared x 100 credits.

Roar Box (TL6):Roar Box (TL6): The 'roar box' is a chest-mounted loudspeaker worn by male military commanders. The warrior's roar is amplified by the
box, intimidating his enemies and inspiring his allies with the strength of his war cry. A character wearing a roar box may make a Leadership
check at the start of battle; if successful, he not only increases the Initiative of his allies by the Effect of the check but also reduces the

Initiative of all foes within earshot by 2. The use of a roar box by a male without Territory is considered dishonorable. Costs Cr. 500.
TL11: TL11: The more advanced roar box allows the wearer to focus the sound produced, turning it into a sonic weapon. This attack has a
maximum range of Short and counts as an energy pistol for the purposes of skills but uses Endurance instead of Dexterity. If the attack is
successful, the target takes 1d6 damage and suffers a –1 DM to his next action if he suffers any damage. The roar box ignores any armor
that does not include ear protection (any Vacc Suit, Combat Armor or Battle Dress includes such protection). Costs Cr. 2,000.

Tail Armor (TL2): Tail Armor (TL2): An Aslan with a full tail can only wear armor that includes this modification. It adds 50 Cr. or 2.5% to the cost of the
armor, whichever is higher.

#### AUGMENTS

The Aslan of the Hierate frown on augmentation and genetic
engineering. Cybernetics are a necessary evil, as many Aslan are
maimed in duels or wars and need replacement limbs but attempts
to improve the species through technology are against tradition.
Other Aslan states such as the Glorious Empire are less conservative
and permit limited augmentation.

All the augmentations listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ are
available _somewhere_ in Aslan space but often at a cost of 50% higher
than normal.

Claw Coating (TL9): Claw Coating (TL9): This augmentation covers the Aslan's dewclaw
in a polymer seal that protects it from environmental damage such
as extremes of heat and cold. It costs Cr. 1,500.

Claw Hardening (TL10): Claw Hardening (TL10): Claw hardening weaves carbon nanotubes
and bands of tough synthetics into the claw, making it tougher
than most armor. A character with claw hardening can scratch a
starship hull or parry an attack from a chainsaw without damage. A
character with Claw Hardening inflicts 2d6 damage instead of 1d6
damage. It costs Cr. 3,000.

Claw Edging (TL11):Claw Edging (TL11): This augmentation sharpens the claw and lines
its cutting edge with a blade so sharp it approaches monofilament. It
also includes all the benefits from Claw Hardening and increases the
damage from a successful claw attack to 3d6. It costs Cr. 6,000.

Claw Implant (TL10):Claw Implant (TL10): Humans living in Aslan space are at a
disadvantage as they lack dewclaws. They can carry _hi'a'soi_ blades
or they can go all the way and have an artificial dewclaw implanted
into the forearm. The human claw is embedded into the forearm;
when unsheathed, it slides forward and projects under the palm.
A human with a claw implant may make claw attacks dealing 1d6
damage. Claw Implants cost Cr. 5,000.

Tail Implant (TL9):Tail Implant (TL9): Aslan with only vestigial tails or humans who
suffer from tail envy can have this augment. The tail is purely
decorative but can be upgraded to a Prehensile Tail. It costs Cr.
4,000.

Prehensile Tail (TL11):Prehensile Tail (TL11): This modification implants artificial nerve
and muscle cells into the tail, strengthening it and increasing its fine
motor control, allowing the Aslan to use the tail as a third limb. A
character with a prehensile tail may take an extra minor action in any
Combat Round, as long as this minor action can be accomplished
with the tail. Cr. 5,000.

Predator Modifications (TL12):Predator Modifications (TL12): This enhancement was developed by
the _Awyraolr_ clan during the kinstrife and is banned throughout Aslan
space. Nonetheless, some clans have kept the technology and even
refined it. The predator modifications suite sharpens the recipient's

senses and tweaks the endocrine system, restoring the predator
instincts to the Aslan. In game terms, the recipient's Strength,
Dexterity and Endurance are all increased by +2 permanently. The
user's Intelligence and Education are both reduced by –2 and the
user suffers a –4 DM to all Tolerance rolls, including reaction rolls.
The Predator Modification costs Cr. 100,000.

#### COMMUNICATIONS & COMPUTING

Boundary Box (TL7): Boundary Box (TL7): A necessity for any human traveller on an Aslan
world, the Boundary Box contains maps of the planet's surface as
well as a database of which territory is owned by which Aslan noble.
The box signals the user when he is about to cross into an Aslan's
territory, ensuring that he does not inadvertently cause offence. A
Boundary Box costs Cr. 150 and maps for a planet cost Cr. 25.

Clan Comm (TL7):Clan Comm (TL7): The standard Aslan personal communicator has
dedicated channels for the user's family, pride and clan in addition
to normal comm features. The gift of a clan comm to an outsider
is an expression of trust and honor; illegal possession of another
clan's comm is an insult. A clan comm costs Cr. 150.

#### MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Slashpatch (TL6):Slashpatch (TL6): The slashpatch is a specialized bandage for
treating dewclaw cuts. It glues the wound shut and releases
painkillers and clotting agents at a rate optimized to deal with
slashing injuries. If a slashpatch is applied within one minute of a
claw attack, it heals 1d6 points of damage. Obviously, the patient
cannot regain characteristic points that were not damaged by the
claw attack. Slashpatches cost Cr. 5 each.

Bio-adjustment Pill (TL8):Bio-adjustment Pill (TL8): Bio-adjustment pills alter the Aslan's
digestion, allowing them to metabolise alien meats. Different
planets require different types of pill, although there are broad-
spectrum ones that cover a variety of worlds. A month's worth of
pills costs Cr. 20.

#### ROBOTS & DRONES

Khyeseir (Mousebot, TL7): Khyeseir (Mousebot, TL7): These little drones are mobile food carriers,
designed to remind Aslan of natural prey on Kusyu. They are used
where live food would be impractical. Freshly heated meat is attached
to the khyeseir' s spikes and the drone is released to run around the
dining area.

Strength 1 (–3), Dexterity 5 (–1), Hull 0, Structure 1
Traits: None
Price: Cr. 50

Arerl (Slave Machine, TL12):Arerl (Slave Machine, TL12): These are humanoid robots, mass-
produced and used for labour. The Aslan could perhaps have
developed more efficient non-humanoid designs but the arerl
appeals to some atavistic instinct in the Aslan.

Strength 7 (+0), Dexterity 5 (–1), Hull 1, Structure 1
_Traits:_ Specialised Computer/1 running Intellect/1 and Expert
Trade/1
_Price:_ Cr. 30,000

Hikare' (Technician, TL14): Hikare' (Technician, TL14): A personal robot of great sophistication,
the _hikare'_ is capable of serving as an engineer on a one-man scout
ship or as a personal servant. On larger ships, they are used to
replace or aid female crew members. The _hikare'_ design has evolved
over time and older _hikare'_ are often encountered on backward
Aslan colonies.

Strength 7 (+0), Dexterity 9 (+1), Hull 1, Structure 2
_Traits:_ Specialised Computer/3 running Intellect/2, Expert
Mechanic/3, Expert Engineering/3 and Expert Steward/3, Integral
grav floater, Integral toolkit
_Price:_ Cr. 650,000

#### WEAPONS

A number of specific weapons available to Aslan characters are
described here. Both a generic (human) name and the original Aslan
name are given for each weapon.

###### Melee Weapons

FierahFierah (no strict human equivalent; often translated as thong, TL1):(no strict human equivalent; often translated as thong, TL1):
A strip of flexible material (originally hide, now frequently plastic)
approximately 1,500 mm in length. It is frequently worn like a sash
or belt. Weight is negligible. The _fierah_ can be used in a variety of
ways: looped, it can be used to snare or throttle an opponent; it
can also be used as a sling or the loose strands at each end can be
tied around weights to form an improvised flail or bolo (taking two
rounds). Each application is listed separately on the weapons charts;
skill applies equally to all applications. Highly decorated _fierah_ are
part of the traditional costume of a noble.

Sling Mode:Sling Mode: Inflicts 1d6 damage at range.

Snare Mode:Snare Mode: Target must make a Strength check or be unable to act
next round. Only works on humanoids.

Flail Mode:Flail Mode: Inflicts 1d6+3 damage in melee.

Bolas Mode:Bolas Mode: Target must make a Dexterity check or be unable to act
next round. Only works on humanoids.

YurletyaYurletya (Spear-Hook, TL2):(Spear-Hook, TL2): A combination of spear (at one end) and
four-pronged grappling hook (at the other). The yurletya is 2,500
mm in length and was a favorite duelling weapon of early Aslan
cultures. It is still frequently used for ritual or ceremonial purposes.
After any attack is made with the weapon, regardless of the result, a
second attack may be made in the round at a –2 DM.

One of the attacks must be with the spear end and is treated
normally. The other attack is with the hook and applies the enemy's
Strength DM as a negative DM to the attack; if successful, the
opponent is knocked down.

Taleryu (Crescent Blade, TL3):Taleryu (Crescent Blade, TL3): The taleryu is a symbol of a noble's
authority; it was traditionally used to execute trespassers but it
works well as a combat weapon. Taleryu are sometimes used in zero-
gravity combat in the same way cutlasses are used by humans.

Hi'asoi (Monkey Knife, TL3):Hi'asoi (Monkey Knife, TL3): Hi'asoi are ceremonial weapons used
by humans who have integrated into Aslan society. The blade
resembles a dewclaw and is worn strapped to the wrist. A human
with a hi'asoi can fight in duels, using the blade as his claw. His
chances of survival against an Aslan male are, of course, minimal.

Akhaeh (Throwing Edge, TL3):Akhaeh (Throwing Edge, TL3): A boomerang-like weapon with
a sharpened edge. Usually carried on a belt sheath, it functions
precisely as a boomerang. A thrown akhaeh which missed the target
returns to the thrower if the Effect is –1 or –2.
TL6: Akheahs have a core of explosive and a proximity trigger that
is disarmed by a radio beacon worn by the user. The weapon only
explodes if it is out of range of the beacon.

Yuhaih (Reaver's Axe, TL4):Yuhaih (Reaver's Axe, TL4): An oversized great-axe, the yuhaih is
a weapon of terror. It makes a thunderous noise as it is whirled
through the air. Dewclaws are needed to wield the yuhaih properly,
as the wielder's claws slot into round hole in the shaft, allowing him
to spin it at great speed before he drives it into a foe's skull.

Soisu'soi (Assassin's Blade, TL3): Soisu'soi (Assassin's Blade, TL3): The traditional weapon of an
assassin is a curved blade, often with funnels in the blade containing
poison. The delivery of a soisu'soi is part of the ceremony that begins
a War of Assassins.
TL10: TL10: A modern assassin's blade is made of sensor-baffling materials,
folds down to the size of a small coin and contains a poison tailored
to the metabolism and genetics of the intended family. An Aslan of
the target genetic family who is struck by a modern assassin's blade
must make an Endurance check at a –2 DM or suffer another 3d6
damage over the next 1d6 hours.

###### Slug Throwers

Khaihte (Pistol, TL7):Khaihte (Pistol, TL7): A semiautomatic pistol similar in nature to
the Body Pistol, though only occasionally designed as a concealable
weapon. The _khaihte_ cartridge is common to the _takhestah_ and the
_khaifealate_ as well. The pistol uses a 10-round magazine (the 20-
round _takhestah_ magazine will also fit). The _khaihte_ can be fitted
with a silencer.

Takhestah (Long Pistol, TL5):Takhestah (Long Pistol, TL5): The basic Aslan semi-automatic
handgun. It is similar in nature to the human automatic pistol but
uses a 20-round magazine. The _takhestah_ cartridge is common to
the _khaihte_ and the _khaifealate_ as well. The extended barrel for the
pistol gives enhanced accuracy to the weapon.

Khaifealate (Machine Pistol, TL5):Khaifealate (Machine Pistol, TL5): The Aslan equivalent of a
submachine gun. Magazines carry 32 rounds; ammunition but not
the magazine, is compatible with the _khaihte_ and the _takhestah_.
Performance is similar but slightly inferior to, most SMGs.

Uealikhe (Carbine, TL5):Uealikhe (Carbine, TL5): Virtually identical to the human carbine,
the _uealikhe_ makes use of a small calibre round; their magazines of
twelve rounds each are not compatible with other weapons.

Takheal (Long Rifle, TL5):Takheal (Long Rifle, TL5): The basic Aslan rifle, the _takheal_ makes
use of a 32-round magazine which is also compatible with the
_yeheal_. It can be fitted with a bipod, folding stock and electronic or
telescopic sights.

Yeheal (Autorifle, TL6):Yeheal (Autorifle, TL6): The Aslan automatic rifle functions much
like the human model. It can be equipped with a shoulder sling,

sights, a bipod and a muzzle brake and may be switched from semi-
automatic to full automatic fire as needed. Magazines are identical
to (and interchangeable with) the takheal.

The yeheal is magazine fed; using a dual magazine feed with an
internal mechanism which strips cartridges from one magazine
until it is empty and then proceeds to strip cartridges from the other
magazine. As a result, total magazine capacity is 64 rounds and the
weapon can be reloaded with one new magazine whenever the rounds
remaining is less than 32.

Eakhyasear (Hunter's Rifle, TL4):Eakhyasear (Hunter's Rifle, TL4): The weapon most often carried
by non-military Aslan who require a longarm. It is similar in many
respects to the takheal but is shorter, bulkier and uses a different
type of ammunition. Ammo comes in 16-round magazines and is
not compatible with other firearms. The eakhyasear may be fitted
with a sling, folding stock and telescopic sights.

Eakhyasears are available in a variety of qualities, with custom
engraving, swirl grain wood stocks, precious metal plating and
special attention to craftsmanship and quality; building on the base
price, such features may cost from up to 1,000% more. Noble males
especially consider it beneath their dignity to carry an ordinary
quality eakhyasear and will select a more ornate model. These special
features do not affect accuracy or reliability.

Taoyuhrir (Heavy Machine Gun, TL7):Taoyuhrir (Heavy Machine Gun, TL7): This is a massive drum-
fed machine gun that fires explosive bullets. In human terms,
it is a support weapon but an Aslan male can carry it and use it
as a personal weapon. The roar of the taoyuhrir heralds a hail of
destruction. The taoyuhrir requires the Heavy Weapons (MPA) skill.

###### Energy Weapons

Laser Weapons:Laser Weapons: The _trakhtyaua_ (laser pistol), _triluealikhe_ (laser carbine) and _trolitakheal_ (laser rifle) are functionally identical to human
designs and indeed were originally based on borrowed human technology. Only details to accommodate differing physiology have been
changed.

Wye'oiheasarl (Plasma Streamer, TL11): Wye'oiheasarl (Plasma Streamer, TL11): A more primitive version of a PGMP, this weapon lacks the magnetic containment needed to focus
the plasma blast into a beam. The _wye'oiheasarl_ is fired much like a flamethrower, vomiting a stream of star-hot matter over a wide area.
Proper use of the _wye'oiheasarl_ requires Strength 12 or more (each point of Strength below 12 gives a –1 DM to attacks) and proper protective
gear (the operator takes 6 points of damage when the _wye'oiheasarl_ is fired; this damage can be reduced by armor). The _wye'oiheasarl_ can
only be fired in full-auto mode.

Hlaulrakh (Gravity Spear, TL14):Hlaulrakh (Gravity Spear, TL14): This weapon is a recent breakthrough by the Aslan and is still largely experimental. It works on the same
principle as a gravity plate or repulsor, projecting a 'lance' of gravity forward. Anything within the path of the beam is subjected to a 10g
force pulling it towards or away from the _hlaulrakh_. The _hlaulrakh_ 's beam flickers on and off a dozen times a second and circles around a
small area, causing thousands of tears and fractures in the internal organs of the target.

Armor is no protection against the gravity spear.

#### VEHICLES

Vehicles are a necessity on most Aslan worlds, as settlements are spread out across a wide area. The Aslan have a variety of groundcars and
personal flyers, examples of which are given below.

###### Clawbike

The clawbike is an oversized four-wheeled dirt bike, used for both civilian and military purposes by the Aslan. The wheels are equipped
with long curved spikes that are normally held retracted inside the tire; these spikes can be extended like a dewclaw, allowing the bike to
scramble over especially rough terrain and even climb very steep surfaces. Driving a clawbike requires considerable strength, as the vehicles
are infamous for bucking or toppling if not properly controlled. A character with a negative Strength DM must apply it to any Drive rolls
while using a clawbike.

###### Crawler

Heavy tracked crawlers are multipurpose utility vehicles. The four track sections are individually powered, giving the vehicle considerable
agility at the cost of power and added complexity. The body of the crawler is dome-shaped but the dome is divided into sections and
individual parts can be folded down to provide extra storage space and the flatbed supporting the dome can be extended out on telescopic
rods. A crawler can be transformed into a cargo carrier with four times its base capacity.

The driver's cab is located in the front third of the dome. Military crawlers have less cargo space but have a second dome with an armed
turret.

###### Tank

This Aslan main battle tank exemplifies the race's fighting techniques. The tank is larger and heavier than comparable human designs and
has a crew of three – a male commander/gunner, a male driver and a female engineer/comms officer. The main weapons are a pair of turret-
mounted plasma cannon and the tank also mounts several small anti-personnel weapons to deal with infantry.

A more advanced design replaces the plasma cannons with a fusion cannon and removes the female officer in favor of a remote
telecommunications link to base.

###### Grav Platform

Grav Platforms range in size from personals discs one meter across to huge floating islands supporting whole cities. The Aslan appreciate
grav platforms and use them extensively on worlds capable of supporting them (TL11 for smaller platforms, TL14 for larger ones). Grav
Platforms all consist of a slab of super-strong material supported by one or more anti-grav units similar to those used on grav belts. Power
is provided from a battery or reactor mounted in the center of the platform. Smaller grav platforms can be controlled by angling the body
forward and inclining the leading edge of the platform, allowing an agile user to alter course just by shifting his weight. Larger platforms
have stability as a prime concern and so have more conventional controls.

###### Flypod

Flypods have been described as 'soap bubbles' by human observers. They are one-man flying machines, which fly by gravity manipulation.
A flypod's hull is mostly transparent plastic and light-weight synthetics, making the vehicle appear alarmingly fragile despite being able to
survive a hurricane with ease. Some models of flypod can be linked together to form a chain of vehicles slaved to the lead pod.

###### Grav Barge

A variation on grav platforms, grav barges are large, stately vehicles used by Aslan as semi-mobile bases when travelling through their
territory. The barge hovers using anti-gravity suspensors but is propelled by sails or drawn by beasts of burden like a giant flying chariot.
Most grav barges can actually move under their own power but it is considered gauche to actually _fly_ a grav barge; the whole point of the
vehicle is to slowly tour one's territory in a traditional manner.

## SSTARSHIPSTARSHIPS ANDAND S SPACEPACE T TRAVELRAVEL

The basic details of space travel remain the same whether in Aslan
or human space. The exceptions are noted here.

###### Interstellar Travel

A jump takes just over 5 _eakhau_ (or about 7 Imperial days) to
complete. Aslan ships use the same technology as human ships and
either race can use ships belonging to the other with a minimum of
difficulty.

Aslan have no special regard for luxury and do not have a separate
high passage ticket. All paid passages are considered middle or low.
However, any Aslan of Social Standing 9+ will receive the services
of the ship's steward automatically and the middle passage baggage
allowance becomes 500 kilos. Aslan nobles always have precedence
and usually bump passengers of lesser standing. Working passage
is common within a clan; working passage is rarely available to non-
clan members.

###### Lesser Known Aspects Of Space Travel

The following are customs within Aslan space.

Space Is Not Territory:Space Is Not Territory: No Aslan male may claim a region of space.
A traveller need not ask permission to enter any region of space

+ but before he puts a single foot on the ground, he must give all
traditional honors to the landowner.

Clan Hospitality:Clan Hospitality: There is a strong tradition within most clans that
'the clan takes care of its own.' If members of a character's clan live
on a particular world, these clan members will offer free food and
lodging and will provide a middle passage ticket with a successful
Difficult (–2) Persuade check.

Outcasts or characters who have been Outcasts, cannot claim to be
part of a clan and thus are not extended this hospitality. Referees
can determine the presence of an Aslan's clan on a world through
materials they have previously prepared; alternatively, roll 10+
modified as follows.

ConditionCondition DMDM
Local population 9+ +1
Local government type H +1
Aslan is member of one of the Tlaukhu clans +2
Per sector distant from the clan homeworld –1

Swapping Stories:Swapping Stories: Aslan with time on their dewclaws enjoy telling
stories of their exploits and adventures. During the long days of a
space journey, the passengers (and crew with no immediate jobs to
perform) meet in the galley or central lounge and take turns telling
stories of what they have seen, what they have done and what they
plan to do.

Participants in these story-swapping sessions gain acceptance
into the group as well as a diversion from the boredom of a long
journey. In addition, the stories told are often the source of further
adventures or expeditions.

###### Crews

Aslan crew standards vary since there is no central authority to prescribe
the number and type of crew required. The details of ship operation
mandate that the requirements for pilot, navigator and engineer be the
same as for humans in basic Traveller. Pilots are almost always male;
navigators and engineers are almost always female.

Stewards are not required. Most properly staffed ships will include
at least one because noble males taking passage on any ship require
the services of one steward per four of them and if no proper steward
is provided, they will co-opt another crew member for the position. A
well-prepared ship thus provides a steward in order to avoid losing
an engineer or navigator at the wrong moment.

Medics are not required; the position of medic is filled when the
ship's owner feels it necessary or when the crew demands it
forcefully enough.

Because of the nature of Aslan society and upbringing, most ships
have a male in formal command of the ship and a female who
deals with many details (specifically finances) which are beneath
the male's dignity. The male captain is almost always the pilot.
On military ships, the female is the captain's executive officer. On
commercial ships, the female is the purser. In both cases, she may
also be the navigator.

Purser:Purser: Each merchant starship engaged in commercial activity,
trade, commerce, cargo transport, passenger transport or charter
activity must have a purser. Invariably, the purser will be female and
she must have a minimum of either Admin 1 or Broker 1. The purser
is paid a salary of Cr. 5,000 per month.

Societal Standards: Societal Standards: Because of the expectations of Aslan society, all
but pirate ships will restrict crew positions to the proper gender. Only
males may be gunners and pilots. Only females will be navigators,
pursers, engineers, medics and stewards. Otherwise undefined crew
positions (security personnel, mechanics, technicians, small craft
pilots and clerks) are open to any properly skilled individuals, although
noble males will refuse most positions other than gunner or pilot.

###### Aslan Control Systems

Aslan controls fall into four categories – male, female, dual and
reconfigurable. Male controls are deliberately simplified and
abstracted, displaying only the most vital information. Female
control displays are overly complex, giving a bewildering array of
options to the user and requiring great skill to master. Dual controls

include both male and female controls in the one system; either the
male controls are a clearly demarcated subset of the female controls
or the control system is compact enough to have two entirely
separate interfaces. Finally, reconfigurable controls are the most
advanced and can dynamically change themselves to present the
appropriate interface.

On the largest spacecraft, the piloting and gunnery interfaces are male,
while all other control systems are female. Dual controls are more
common on smaller ships, where a smaller crew makes it more likely
that an Aslan will have to perform duties commonly associated with the
other gender. Ships built at TL13 or more always have reconfigurable
controls throughout. The need to have dual mode controls often makes
Intellect programs very common on Aslan ships

Males dislike automated piloting and gunnery systems, so few Aslan
ships come equipped with Evade programs. Aslan Fire Control
programs, whilst costing the same and having the same rating as
other Fire Control programs, do not allow the computer to make
attacks and only offer positive DMs to gunnery rolls.

#### ASLAN STARSHIPS

All these designs are common within the Aslan Hierate and have the
10% discount for common designs included in their cost breakdown.
None of these vessels are customarily available outside Aslan
space. Aslan ships are invariably heavily decorated with inscriptions
and clan heraldry; even control systems can be decorated with
gold, jewels or other art. Even on military vessels, the Aslan like to
decorate their surroundings.

###### SHRINES

An additional feature unique to Aslan vessels is that they all carry a
Shrine to Heroes, where Aslan go to meditate on and gain confidence
from, the deeds and philosophies of their ancestors. This is a small
private room, draped in tapestries and decorated with scenes of
conquest. In ship design terms any Aslan ship of 100 tons or over
must have at least one Shrine. Cost and size of the Shrine is the
same as a normal stateroom but it does not count as a stateroom
for life support running costs as it cannot be used for occupancy
as a normal stateroom. [[Capital]] ships must have at least one Shrine
per section.

###### Scout (Hraye class)

Using a 100-ton hull, the Aslan scout is intended primarily for exploration duties (the variant _Ihateisho_ class scout is a more common sight
outside Hierate space). The scout requires a crew of two: pilot and engineer/navigator (one individual with the Pilot, Engineer and Navigator
skills could also handle the ship). The ship can carry up to four individuals in double occupancy. The _Hraye'_ s cheap running cost means
that these vessels are often found serving as couriers or transports in small colonies.

###### Scout (Ihateisho class)

This is one of the most iconic Aslan vessels. Ships of this design are given to the _ihatei_ of nobles. The young _ihatei_ roam the galaxy, looking for
territories to conquer. The controls of the vessel are as automated as possible, to allow males who are less than technically adept to operate
without female help. The _ihateisho_ is capable of making four-parsec jumps, allowing it to reach systems beyond the range of a standard scout.
A typical _ihateisho_ exploration lasts two to three years, at which point the wanderer returns to the nearest _ihatei_ camp and gathers an army to
conquer the most suitable territory he has found during his wandering. The _ihateisho_ is then either returned to the clan or traded for a share in
a larger vessel. An _ihateisho_ can be considered especially lucky if its former owners have gone on to find good territories.

###### Trader (Eakhau class)

The _Eakhau_ is an Aslan tramp trader and is commonly found crewed by a single family. Nomadic Aslan families travel in this fashion as part
of a pride-fleet of a dozen or so ships and whole generations can be born, live and die on these cramped vessels before the pride finds a
suitable territory. The trader requires a crew of five: pilot, navigator, two engineers and purser. A steward, medic and up to four gunners are
sometimes carried. It can carry up to eight passengers and 16 low passengers. The _Eakhau_ is one of the few Aslan designs to carry escape
pods, which are seen as inviting failure. A true warrior will never need to flee.

###### Clan Transport (Khtukhao class)

Using a 600-ton hull, the clan transport is a large freight and passenger vessel used by clans and companies for service of major trade
routes. A 95-ton shuttle (capable of transporting 20 passengers and 55 tons of cargo) is carried as ship's vehicle. Cargo capacity is 156 tons
but the shuttle cargo bay is generally filled as well, increasing capacity to 211 tons. Six tons are available for fire control and other weapons.
The ship is unstreamlined. The transport requires a crew of six: pilot, navigator, three engineers and purser. Stewards must be added if
nobles are carried. A medic may be added if desired.

###### Courier (Ktiyhui class)

Using a heavily armored custom 200-ton hull, the courier is a fast, long-range ship used to conduct clan business across interstellar
distances. As the courier is often used to carry important dignitaries and nobles, it carries eight tons of luxuries, usually either a harem or
a holographic hunting ground. The normal crew consists of a pilot, purser, an engineer and 2 gunners.

###### Messenger (Iyeliy class)

The _Iyeliy_ class is the Aslan equivalent of the x-boat. The larger clans have a network of these vessels and some Aslan news corporations
have their own fleets to relay information across the Hierate. The Aslan network is much less extensive than the Imperial x-boat system but
the _Iyeliy_ is capable of five-parsec jumps and so moves faster. A normal crew consists of a pilot, gunner and an engineer/purser.

###### Cruiser (Aositaoh class)

Using a 1,000-ton hull, the cruiser is built for small-scale clan troop transport and combat operations. Ten triple turrets are installed. The
ship mounts 18 beam lasers, 9 missile racks and 3 sandcasters. The ship carries a launch, two pinnaces, four ATVs and two air/rafts. The
pinnaces can each carry two ATVs, allowing the cruiser to deploy a considerable fighting force from orbit. The cruiser requires a crew of
eight: captain/pilot, navigator, five engineers and purser (or the female executive officer). Up to 96 other people can be carried with double
occupancy; usually 10 gunners, 80 troops (2 platoons), plus 6 berths for small craft pilots, clerks or others as needed. Both this ship and
the _Ekawsiykua_ escort have low cargo capacities for their size and are often accompanied by _Owatarl_ tenders.

###### Escort (Ekawsiykua class)

Using an 800-ton hull, the escort is a military vessel employed by clans for space patrol and combat duties and is often encountered with
Aslan freighters. Eight triple turrets mount 9 lasers, 9 missile racks and 6 sandcasters. The ship carries two armed pinnaces and five fighters
for scouting and patrol duties. Cargo capacity is forty-one tons. The ship is unstreamlined.

The escort requires a crew of eight: captain/pilot, navigator, five engineers and purser/exec. Generally, a medic, eight gunners, eight small
craft pilots, two pinnace gunners and a boarding party of ten soldiers are also carried on board in double occupancy staterooms.

###### Tender (Owatarl class)

The _Owatarl_ class is used mainly for military tenders but is also used as a corporate freighter in regions where normal cargo ships would
be too vulnerable to attack. Three turrets provide basic cover, although many _Owatarls_ refit some of their cargo bays to carry fighter patrols.
The tender is unable to land, so it carries a shuttle for cargo transfer. Tenders assigned to supply other ships may replace the shuttle bay
with a suite of repair drones and smaller launches. Normal crew consists of a captain, 2 pilots, navigator, executive officer, 2 engineers,
small craft pilot and 3 gunners.

###### Seeker (Kteiroa class)

Using a custom 200-ton hull, the seeker is a prospecting vessel adapted to explorations in asteroid belts. Adjacent to the bridge is a Model/1
bis computer. There are four staterooms and four low berths – more than the crew needs but _Kteriroa_ are also commonly used as transports
in isolated systems. The ship carries thirty tons of mining drones.

###### Researcher (Hkiyrerao class)

Using a custom 400-ton hull, the researcher is utilised for the investigation of scientific phenomena or for conducting tests at newly
discovered worlds. The ship carries one pinnace and one GCarrier as vehicles. The researcher requires a crew of four: captain/pilot,
navigator and two engineers. When on missions, an executive officer/head scientist is also required. A staff of up to ten scientists can also
be carried.

###### Assault Carrier (Sakhai class)

These heavy carriers are designed for invasions and open wars. If a _Sakhai_ appears in the skies over a world, then that world will be under
the claw in a matter of days. The _Sakhai'_ s distinctive 'horseshoe' profile allows its ranks of beam and missile turrets to rake targets on either
side, while protecting the fusion bay mounted in the center. The normal crew consists of a captain, executive officer, 3 pilots, navigator, 4
engineers and 20 gunners.It can carry one hundred and sixty warriors in addition to its normal crew and there are another two hundred low
berths for frozen troops or captives.While the _Sakhai_ is capable of landing on a planet, it takes a skilled hand at the controls and a dedicated
team of engineers to keep the ship spaceworthy after a landing. A bad landing can warp the ship's dorsal struts, crippling it. Many Aslan
outposts have a downed _Sakhai_ at their hearts.

###### Slaver (Hkisyeleaa class)

Ships of this design are associated with the Glorious Empire but can be found throughout the Hierate. They are converted agricultural
transports. The low berths are actually double or quadruple berths, designed for freezing large animals for food. A _Hkisyeleaa_ would land on
an agricultural planet and load up on hundreds of live animals, then bring them to be devoured by rich nobles. The normal crew consists
of a captain, pilot, navigator, purser, 2 engineers, 3 gunners/drivers and 5 drivers. The Glorious Empire adapted their _Hkisyeleaas_ for slave
raiding. Unfortunate humans were captured by Aslan raiders riding ATVs or air/rafts and thrown into the freezing chambers. A fully-stocked
Slaver can carry more than 1,500 slaves if the captain is willing to cram as many bodies as possible into the low berths; 750 is a 'safe'
number. Slavers are comparatively lightly armed and have little protection from attackers, so they are normally escorted by more combat-
ready ships.

###### Bulk Hauler (Oukhaha class)

_Oukhaha-_ class freighters are the backbone of many corporations in the Hierate. The Hauler consists of a central 'drive spine' to which cargo
pods are attached using mechanical clamps. Fuel is stored in long fin-shaped tanks that can be collapsed and withdrawn into the central
spine when empty, to make it easier for shuttles to access the cargo pods. The freighter is unarmed by default but a common modification
is to add turrets to the prow and stern. The normal crew consists of a captain, pilot, navigator, purser, assistant purser, small craft pilot, 3
engineers and 4 cargo hands.

The freighter carries a single cargo shuttle with it, to service worlds without their own shuttle fleet.

###### Light Trader (Aoa'iw class)

A popular design inside the Hierate, especially in the Trojan Reach, the little _Aoa'iw_ is a 300-ton trader that combines a sizable cargo bay
with space for passengers, enough firepower to serve as a raider or defend itself from piracy and vehicles to support a flexible mission
profile. _Aoa'iw_ s are often owned by clans, as they can perform a variety of tasks. The normal crew consists of a captain/pilot, navigator,
purser, engineer and two gunners (one of whom also is a small craft pilot). Up to 4 passengers can be carried. On the border worlds, the
_Aoa'iw_ is nicknamed the 'pouncer', as it does resemble a crouching animal from certain angles.

###### Pocket Warship (Halaheike class)

The so-called 'pocket warship' is a small 1,200-ton spacecraft used by smaller clans for military operations. The _Halaheike_ is heavily armed
for its size, with a range of missile launchers, lasers and particle beams and carries a complement of ten fighters and two launches for
boarding actions and customs inspections. The crew consists of a captain, 3 pilots, a navigator, executive officer, 6 engineers, 12 gunners, 2
small craft pilots, 10 fighter crew and 2 warriors. The 126-ton cargo bay can be easily converted to hold more troops or some 200 low berths,
allowing the _Halaheike_ to serve as a troop transport. The design is known for maintenance issues and jump drive failures but the vessel's
main problem is that it tries to do too much in one package and to fit everything in it must use the most advanced Aslan technology, adding
to maintenance problems. The _Halaheike_ might be a carrier, assault cruiser, system defence boat and troop carrier but it is sub-par at all
those things. Larger clans that can afford specialist vessels rarely field _Halaheike_ s.

## EENCOUNTERSNCOUNTERS

Encounters are basically the same in Aslan space as they are anywhere
else. Some individual considerations are, however, slightly different in
Aslan space.

#### REACTIONS

Aslan have predatory instincts and cultural mores quite foreign to
the human mindset. To model Aslan customs, the Referee should
roll on the Reaction table to determine the reaction of an Aslan to
any encounter. This reaction will colour and influence the Aslan's
behaviour.

###### Using the Reaction Table

All NPCs should have their reactions governed by the Reaction
table. As an optional rule (particularly for characters new to playing
the Aslan), it is suggested that the player use the Reaction table
to determine probable responses to encounters as well. This is
especially true of Aslan characters adventuring in the company of
humans.

To use the Reaction table, roll 2d6, apply the relevant DMs from the
Reaction table and read off the result.

###### Reaction Table Results

Most results are the same as those used for human characters.
However, hostile reactions usually lead to 'discourtesy' rather than
violence. In such an instance, the response given by that reaction
would normally provoke hostility in return. Treat discourtesy as
grounds for a formal challenge (but Player-Characters need not issue

such a challenge – although this would take an enormous amount of
restraint for Aslan Player Characters).

An NPC who receives discourteous treatment may easily be
provoked into an attack. Such an attack may be immediate (which is
a violation of ritual and protocol) or may take the form of a challenge
to a duel, with the time and place specified. Duels are not (usually)
lethal; they are fought to first blood only. The embarrassment and
loss of honor one suffers in declining a challenge or refusing a
duel is far worse. In addition, for humans, the respect gained by
engaging in a duel to defend one's honor can be beneficial in a
struggle to fit into Aslan society.

#### SAMPLE ASLAN PATRONS

Wherever possible, the Aslan keep work within the clan – if a member
of the clan can do a job, then the patron is obliged to first offer it to that
relative. Aslan therefore only hire travellers when the work is too difficult,
dangerous or specialized to be performed by a kinsman or if the patron
wants the job kept quiet. As is standard practice for the Aslan, male
patrons have a wife or other female relative arrange monetary payments
but may offer vassalage and land grants as payment to suitable males.

Except where noted, all these patrons will employ both Aslan and
non-Aslan characters.

###### Hwaerol, ihatei wanderer

Required: Required: Mechanic, Survival, Gun Combat, Sensors.
Reward:Reward: Cr. 2,000/day or +2 Territory at the end of the mission.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Hwaerol is a young male who has spent the
last few years wandering the borders of Aslan space, looking for new
lands to claim. On the uninhabited southern continent of a minor
planet he discovered an area of rolling plains and thickly forested
hills that he wants to call home. He has sent word home to his
clan, informing them of his claim and a colony vessel is en route.
Unfortunately, Hwaerol was too hasty and needs to establish a fort
and a landing zone before the colonists get there. He wants the
characters to help him clear land and deal with any hostile native
predators.

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: Hwaerol has his own battered scout ship, with
a cargo hold full of prefabricated buildings and surveying gear. What
he does not have is a crew or any idea of the scale of the task ahead of
him. This young male has bitten off more than he can chew.

The characters are up against a time limit, as the fort must be ready
and the area secure before the colony ship arrives.

1. Hwaerol had a crew of four on his scout ship but they were
killed by dangerous predators native to the planet. At night, these
monsters emerge from the caves in the hills and attack. To complete
the mission, the characters will have to descend into the depths of
the earth and eliminate the breeding caves.
2. Hwaerol is actually an outcast and has no permission from
his clan to claim this land. The colony ship is on the way but it
is accompanied by an Aslan noble who intends to claim the world
himself. Hwaerol is hoping that by establishing his claim first, he
can force his clan into accepting him back. The characters need to
deal with any problems on the world and then battle the rival male
into submission.
3. There are already colonists on the world – human colonists. They
are distinctly unhappy about the idea of an Aslan outpost on their
doorstop and will do everything they can to sabotage Hwaerol's
colony.
4. The planet lies on the edge of the territory of two rival Aslan clans.
The clan leaders agreed to keep that planet as a neutral buffer world.
By establishing his claim, Hwaerol is breaking the delicate balance
between the two. As soon as Hwaerol lands, the two factions will
both send forces to claim the world. The characters can either fight
a three-way fight against superior forces or use diplomacy.
5. The planet has a much more valuable resource than Hwaerol
suspects, such as mineral deposits or a crashed alien vessel. The
characters have a choice between betraying their employer and
stealing the resource or helping Hwaerol into a fortune.
6. It is not a colony – it is a staging post for an Aslan invasion.
Hwaerol employed the characters to allay suspicion and intends
to have them killed when the 'colony ship' (a mercenary cruiser)
arrives.

###### Yhaniatoia, the Pilgrim

Requirements: Requirements: Diplomat, Steward, Medic; spacecraft.
Rewards:Rewards: Expenses plus Cr. 20,000/parsec travelled.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Yhaniatoia is an Aslan female who introduces
herself as an executive in an Aslan trading company. She needs to
travel home to Kusyu (or another Aslan clan stronghold) discretely,
avoiding standard liners and travel routes. She wants the characters
to bring her home (or to a transit hub, if the Referee does not want
to send the players so deep into Aslan space).

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: Yhaniatoia is a charming and urbane Aslan
but she hides a dark secret.

1. Yhaniatoia is dying and wants to make it back to her clan's hearth
before she perishes. However, she has to keep her illness a secret

or the news will destroy the reputation of the corporation she has
spent her life building. Initially, she keeps the illness a secret from
the characters but she falls ill on the journey, forcing the characters
to find treatment for her.

2. Yhaniatoia is returning home for marriage, a secret marriage
that will ally two powerful clans. A rival clan has learned of this
arrangement and plans to assassinate Yhaniatoia before she makes
it home.
3. Yhaniatoia is fleeing her husband, a powerful Aslan noble. He
refuses to let her go and will send agents after the Player Characters.
If Yhaniatoia can reach her clan's homeworld, she can have a male
relative fight as her champion in the divorce. Otherwise, one of
the Player Characters will have to fight an honor duel against her
husband.
4. Yhaniatoia has stolen money from the corporation she works for.
She is a wanted criminal and the characters are accessories to this
crime.
5. Yhaniatoia is actually an Aslan spy, who is carrying vital information
related to military operations along the border. Human agents and
Aslan mercenaries are both hunting her.
6. Yhaniatoia is an Aslan mystic. She wants the characters to stop
off at various shrines and ancient battlegrounds along the way.

###### Rukt'hao Iaychi

Required:Required: Streetwise, Investigate, Persuade.
Reward:Reward: Cr. 1,000/day plus a favor from his clan.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Iaychi is a rukt'hao , an Aslan law enforcement
agent for hire. He is a hard-bitten, two-fisted private investigator
who happens to be a seven foot tall space lion. His current cases
require more than claws and street smarts, though. A dame with a
mane like an aurora and fangs like diamonds just walked into his
office...

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: Iaychi will do a lot of the investigations
himself – he needs the characters for muscle, technical support
or dealing with humans. If the characters perform well, Iaychi will
continue to employ them for other cases.

1. An Aslan was assaulted by an Outcast and wants retribution. All
he knows about his attacker is that he had a Syoisuis clan badge
woven into his mane. Why would a clanless Outcast have a clan
badge? To investigate, the characters have to go into the local
_rukhtaha_ and find the attacker. After several dangerous encounters
in this ghetto, they discover that the attacker was actually a clan
agent trying to assassinate the victim – or else was trying to frame
the infamous Syoisuis clan.
2. As above but the victim of the assault was in the _rukhtaha_ on his
own nefarious business. As the characters pursue the case, they

learn that the victim is trying to recruit Outcast mercenaries for a
dishonorable sneak attack on a Syoisuis world. The attacker was
a Syoisuis agent and the victim hired Iyachi to find the agent so he
can be eliminated.

3. A free trader discovered that several cargo containers that were
supposed to be filled with trade goods are empty. Someone at the
starport or on board the freighter that delivered the containers is
a thief. The characters need to trace the container's route back to
discover the thief.
4. As above but the cargo containers were always empty. The
free trader is actually trying to find the source of a competitor's
dustspice. Their own attempts have failed, so they have hired a
private investigator.
5. A male suspects that one of his wives is involved with another
male. She is a partner in a corporation and regularly goes offworld
for business trips. The investigators need to work out a way to
follow her offworld (she uses a private courier ship) and discover
the identity of her lover, who turns out to be a noble in an important
clan. If the characters reveal this crime, they will become enemies
of a powerful clan.
6. An important computer file has been stolen from an Aslan
corporate office. The trail leads to a human diplomat. The Aslan
assumed that the human could not have stolen the files – diplomat
is a male occupation and no Aslan male should have the computer
skills to hack into the network and download the file.

###### Quearlo, Mercenary Staff Officer

Required:Required: Broker, Gunnery, Comms; Spacecraft.
Reward: Reward: Cr. 50,000.
Player's Information:Player's Information: The _Khailerfta_ (Battlefield Nomads) are a
successful Aslan mercenary unit funded by the Uawairlew clan and
old Quearlo is their cynical staff officer. She has seen a hundred
worlds and a thousand wars and is familiar with all the problems
that can befall a merc unit. Sometimes, she needs a crew and a
starship.

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: The _Khailerfta_ unit consists of three-dozen
male warriors, a dozen female technicians, two _Trehfealyuoa_ TL11
tanks and the command section of Quearlo and her mate Wiyrl.
They specialize in small brush wars and territorial disputes.

1. Quearlo needs the characters to transport the unit to their next
assignment. In order to surprise the enemy, Quearlo intends to use
a small ship. The whole unit will be frozen in portable low berths
and loaded into the cargo hold; the characters need to smuggle
them onto the enemy world. The target planet is several jumps away

+ the characters will need to somehow avoid customs patrols and
clan warships.
    2. As above but the enemy have a spy in the _Khailerfta_ and know
    what ship they are on. The characters' ship will be attacked as soon
    as they arrive at the target world – if they are going to survive, they
    will need to land the merc unit under fire and win a war.
    3. Quearlo hires the characters to obtain ammunition and other
    supplies for the unit. The clan that the _Khailerfta_ are fighting controls
    the local weapons market – the characters will need to make black-
    market contacts or else find another source outside the subsector
    before the mercenaries run out of supplies.
    4. As 3 but Quearlo wants the characters to steal the ammunition
    from the enemy. She knows that a freighter carrying weapons and
    other supplies is approaching the system and she wants to send a
    squad of her warriors on board the Player Characters' ship to hijack
    this freighter.
    5. Quearlo's next mission is in human space. She wants to hire
    the characters as couriers and messengers but also as advisors in
    human psychology.
    6. As above but Quearlo is injured during the first mission and none
    of the technicians are qualified to take over running the unit. If the
    characters want to get paid, they need to learn how to run a war.

###### Archaeologist Hkeilu

Requires:Requires: Science, Investigate, Stealth.
Rewards: Rewards: Cr. 1,000/day.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Hkeilu is an archaeologist, specialising in the
lost cultures of races destroyed by the Aslan during their expansionist
period. Few in her clan appreciate Hkeilu's work but she perseveres.
Currently, she is investigating an extinct species called the D'Gai
Pai, who left beautiful and eerie ruins behind them when the Aslan
wiped them out.

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: The D'Gai Pai were an advanced but peaceful
society when they made first contact with the Aslan. They had
explored their own solar system and even begun to colonize other
worlds when the Aslan warships jumped in and opened fire. Most
of the D'Gai Pai were exterminated but a few managed to hide in
underground bunkers. The D'Gai Pai's star had undergone a period
of intense flares several hundred years before the Aslan arrived, so
there was an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers. The D'Gai
Pai may have survived down there, in the darkness...

1. Hkeilu believes that the D'Gai Pai were more technologically
advanced than the Aslan when first contact occurred and that in
their zeal for conquest, her race destroyed scientific wonders.
She has located what she believes to be a buried research center,
protected by a series of security devices and robot guardians. She
needs the characters to help her break into the facility.

4. As above, only the D'Gai Pai are not helpless. They have been
waiting for the day when the invaders find their hiding places and
are ready to fight back. The characters are about to get caught
between a race of crazed troglodytes and an Aslan population who
is totally unprepared for an attack from below.
5. Hkeilu is secretly an agent for a rival clan. She believes that the
clan who conquered the D'Gai Pai used illegal biological weapons
to wipe out the aliens. Using such a dishonorable method of attack
would discredit the clan, even after all those centuries. Hkeilu wants
the characters to go into sealed underground vaults and search for
still-active viruses and plagues ... and then get her offworld before
the ruling clan finds out!
6. As above, only the plague is still active and infects the characters.
Maybe the clan who wiped out the D'Gai Pai has the cure locked
away in some secret vault.

###### Khauftireir, Aslan Noble

Requires: Requires: Diplomat, Steward, Streetwise; Spacecraft.
Rewards: Rewards: Whatever the characters can scam out of him.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Khauftireir or as he prefers to be addressed,
Khautifirier'ayukhautifanafiytaukhaotuar'fiyrehatyoroueiwea is a
middle-aged male Aslan noble from one of the wealthier trading
clans. His clan's territories are in the middle of Aslan space and
have not changed in generations. The clan's trading empire is too
important to the economy of the whole Hierate for other clans to
risk antagonising them but their military is exclusively defensive
and so Khauftireir has never fought for anything in his life. He was
a first son and inherited his vast estates from his sire. His life has
been dull.

A month ago, Khauftireir slipped out of his handlers' grasp and
wandered off into a spaceport. He bought passage on board a free
trader and jumped away. He is in search of adventure. Khauftireir
is carrying a huge amount of wealth, in both electronic and physical
form but has no idea how to use it. Now, he has just run into the
Player Characters in the spaceport. He wants to hire them to show
him some adventure!

Referee's Information: Referee's Information: Khauftireir is a typical upper class male; he is
pompous, quick to take offence, laden down with jewels and finery
and has no clue whatever about the value of money. He has a knack
for wandering off and getting into trouble. He is the sort of Aslan
who tries to buy a drink with a 50,000 credit note, trashes the bar in
the ensuing brawl and then offers the starport police a 5-credit bribe
to overlook the whole incident. He is Bertie Wooster trapped inside
the body of a seven-foot-tall furry alien monster.

1. Khauftireir has a holocopy of a dramatization of an Aslan epic
poem describing the exploits of Tyu'eas, a distant ancestor who
conquered a string of worlds. He wants to see these fabled worlds.
Unfortunately, the worlds were re-conquered by the Imperium
during the latter stages of the Border Wars and the name of Tyu'eas
is synonymous with slaughter and genocide on those planets.
    2. A cousin of Khauftireir is rallying a fleet of _ihatei_ ships. Khauftireir
    wishes to join his cousin's armada and conquer a domain for
    himself.
    3. Khauftireir wishes to see human worlds. He has a big map of the
    Spinward Marches and a pin. Unfortunately, he is colour-blind and
    cannot tell the difference between a Green Zone and a Red Zone...
    4. Khauftireir's handlers believe that the noble was actually
    kidnapped by a rival clan and a manhunt has been launched to find
    him. The characters are now being chased by dozens of clan agents
    and have a bounty on their heads.
    5. The noble is actually fleeing his family, as he believes that one of
    his kin is trying to kill him. He is wrong – half-a-dozen of his male
    cousins are plotting to murder Khauftireir. There was a bomb on
    board the ship Khauftireir was supposed to be travelling on. His
    plan is to keep moving until he can identify which relative is trying
    to murder him.
    6. Khauftireir is not half so clueless as he appears to be. He has
    been agitating for his clan to return to their conquering ways but the
    clan elders are too conservative to listen to him. Khauftireir plans to
    hire a mercenary force in secret but he needs to gather intelligence
    about lightly defended worlds. His little tour is actually a fact-finding
    mission and he will 'blunder' into a number of military bases and
    fleet depots.

###### Sullivan Ekh, Human Trader

Requires:Requires: Broker, Gun Combat, Engineering/Pilot/Gunnery/
Astrogation/Medic.
Rewards: Rewards: Standard crew pay x 1.5.
Player's Information:Player's Information: Ekh is one of the few independent traders
working the Aslan border. He is planning a trade mission deeper
into the Hierate, bringing human-made goods to the rich clans.
He has a Far Trader called the Androcles and a cargo hold full of
electronics and spices. What he does not have is a crew. Ekh is
willing to employ both human and Aslan crew (or even other races
who can deal with the Aslan culture).

Referee's Information:Referee's Information: Ekh is staking everything on this trade
mission. The Androcles is on the verge of being reclaimed by the
bank and his last crew quit after Ekh got them into trouble with the
Syosuis clan. He is down to his last few credits and will be paying
the characters out of the profits of this mission.

1. Ekh's situation is even more desperate than it appears. He does
not have a hope of making his payments on the ship – he plans to
vanish into Aslan space, out of range of any ship tracers or Imperial
authorities. If the characters stick with Ekh, they will be accessories
to his crime.
2. As above, only Ekh's planning to turn pirate. There are plenty of
Aslan clan wars; he can attack Aslan ships and steal from them and
pin the blame on the other side in the clan war. All he needs to find

is a shipyard that can fit the weapons currently stowed in the cargo
hold.

3. Some of Ekh's last crew did not quit – they were killed by assassins.
Ekh insulted an Aslan lord on his last trade mission and until he
atones, his ship and crew will be harassed and attacked.
4. Ekh actually wants revenge on the Aslan lord. He plans to
assassinate the Aslan lord by attacking him when he travels to
Kuysu for a meeting.
5. Ekh is actually an Imperial agent, sent to spy on the Aslan.
6. As above, only he is a double agent, about to betray the Imperium
and pass a militant clan all the information they need to launch an
invasion.

#### RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

In addition to random encounters, this section discusses the
difference between Aslan locations and their counterparts in human
space.

###### Aslan Starports

Unlike the ports in the Imperium, which are run by the Imperium
and are considered extraterritorial zones, Aslan ports are run by
the ruling clan or corporation. This makes doing business in the
Hierate a trickier business, as a clan can dictate the rules to visiting

spacecraft. Business rivals can be squeezed out of space or a clan
could restrict the size or nature of vessels permitted to visit its
starports. On planets whose control is divided between clans, there
can be multiple starports.

Only a fool or madman would attack an Imperial starport – doing
so is an attack on the Imperium and so would draw retribution from
the mighty Imperial fleets. Aslan starports have no such protection,
so an attack on an Aslan port is 'merely' an attack on the clan that
owns it. Their starports are therefore heavily fortified and equipped
with defensive weapon emplacements.

Aslan ports usually have berths reserved for clan vessels; strangers
must use lower-class berths. Aslan Class-A starports are the
prestigious possessions of their respective clans and invariably they
are lavishly decorated to impress visitors with the clan's power and
wealth. The architecture reflects this; statues of clan heroes tower
over the landing bays and the market sections overflow with rare
goods. On worlds with HighPorts, some nobles are even egotistical
enough to have holograms built into the station's viewports, so that
when a visitor looks out a window at the planet below, he sees the
outline of the noble's territory highlighted on the surface.

Small starports are obviously less important – class C and below
are local ports, maintained by the local population or a corporation.
Local ports have few facilities for visitors and may not even have
accommodation for non-Aslan.

###### Aslan Cities

The defining element of Aslan cities is open space. All but the
meanest homes are surrounded by at least a few meters of open
ground. Large structures are often supported on arches or at
high tech levels built on floating platforms, leaving open ground
beneath. The Aslan like to have room to run.

This need for open space means that Aslan cities are sprawling
affairs, much greater in sheer ground coverage than a human city
of comparable population (on average, the population density of an
Aslan city is a tenth that of a human one). The cities take up so
much space that they overlap with Aslan agricultural lands – it is
not an uncommon sight to see herds of food animals wandering
through the grounds of an Aslan civic structure or even a military

base. There is very little distinction between 'urban' and 'rural' for
the territory-loving Aslan.

When a city covers thousands of square kilometers, an advanced
mass transit system is a necessity. Every Aslan city has an extensive
light rail system, where fast-moving pods whisk passengers to their
destinations. This rail system also carries cargo and livestock, sating
the city's vast hunger for fresh meat.

Aslan architecture is rounded and organic. Every building is unique,
even the mass-produced ones. Concealed rooms, balconies, hidden
passageways and hideaways are common, as are bright open rooms
of great size. The Aslan prefer to use crystals to refract natural light into
their internal rooms. They have excellent night vision, so their culture
has never relied on artificial light sources as much as humanity.

###### Rural Areas

Aslan cities are so spread out that it is hard to tell the difference
between the city and the countryside. As the buildings thin out,
the traveller must be even more wary – rural landowners are much
less forgiving about those who trespass onto their domains. A
human traveller should have a guide or a Boundary Beeper to avoid
inadvertent insults.

The Aslan are much more accepting of dangerous wild animals
than humans are – they consider fellow predators to be a challenge
and worthy quarries in a hunt and have even imported predators
to worlds where none exist. The vast herds of livestock support
both the Aslan and any wild animals. The Aslan also use far more
labourers than a comparable high-tech human world – while they
do use robots, it is a sign of prestige to use living labourers or even
non-Aslan slaves.

#### ASLAN ANIMALS

The Aslan regularly import creatures from their homeworld of Kusyu to their new colonies. Most imported creatures are livestock, brought
to supply the race's ceaseless hunger for fresh meat. A few are predators hunted by the Aslan for sport or creatures useful for other products
or their place in the ecosystem.

Stii are small furry simian-like creatures about the size of a human child. They are omnivorous scavengers, eating almost anything
from fruit and nuts to fabric and bark. The Aslan consider them a tasty snack and also keep them as living garbage disposals in small
communities. Humans look like overgrown shaven stii to Aslan; a fact that never ceases to amuse them.

## WWORLDSORLDS

The physical details of worlds remain unchanged and the process is the same as in basic _Traveller_. Population is similarly unchanged. The
details of starport type, government type, law level and tech level are changed to more fully portray Aslan culture and society. The physical
details of world generation remain the same.

#### PLANETARY GOVERNMENT

In human terms, all Aslan worlds have a feudal form of government. Thus, one of several normal governmental codes might be assigned by
humans to various Aslan planets (0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B and C are all applicable) and these codes might be found in a human catalogue of
world types (Kusyu, the Aslan homeworld, is often assigned a government type 8 in this fashion). When mapping Aslan space, however, it
is possible to be more specific in the listing, giving a clear-cut idea of the distribution of power in an Aslan society. The Aslan Governments
table shows a 2d6 table for the generation of government types and an explanation of the individual codes.

###### Aslan Governments

G: Small station or facility. Either operated by an offworld clan or controlled by a company (the only instance where a world is controlled by
anything but a clan); population must be 3 or less.

H:H: Split control. Different parts of the world are owned by several on-planet clans. Analogous to human balkanised worlds.
J:J: Single on-world clan control. Other small clans may also be present but will be dominated by the major clan.
K:K: Single multi-world clan control. The world is controlled by a single clan whose span extends over several worlds, not necessarily
nearby.
L: L: Major clan control. The world is controlled by one of the Twenty-Nine.
M:M: Vassal clan control. The world is controlled (but not owned) by a vassal clan in fief to a larger clan.
N:N: Major vassal clan control. The world is controlled (but not owned) by a vassal clan in fief to one of the Twenty-Nine.

###### Factions

To determine the factions present on the world in addition to the dominant clan, roll 1d3, applying a +1 DM for H and a –2 DM for G. Next,
roll 2d6 to determine the strength and nature of the factions.

2d62d6 FactionFaction
2 Violent fringe group attempting to claim territory
3 Minor fringe group
4-5 Minor clan
6 Minor corporation, religious group, native species, alien population or other organization
8-9 Powerful clan
10 Powerful non-clan faction, such as a megacorporation
11-12 Tlaukhu clan presence

#### LAW LEVELS

Aslan law levels are generated by a 2d6 roll without modifications; government type has no effect on law level. The code means much less
for governing weaponry which may be carried than it does for human worlds; it may be considered a guideline to what is commonly carried
on that world, with no particular penalty extended to carrying weaponry of 2 or 3 levels lower on the human table.

The real use for law level, however, is to represent the touchiness of the local clan government. It continues to show the frequency with which
authorities may be encountered and should also be used as the basis for determining the initial reaction of any official encountered. Subtract
the law level from 15; this number is the reaction result for most officials who might be encountered in the line of duty. Other reactions and the
interaction of characters and NPCs proceed according to the encounter rules.

#### TECHNOLOGY LEVEL

Tech level codes correspond to the equivalent human codes but Aslan technology is somewhat more uniform through the Hierate than
equivalent human-settled worlds would enjoy. The Aslan have a maximum Technology Level of 14 (E).

The basic tech level roll for Aslan worlds is 1d6 +8, modified by the Tech Level DMs table:

FactorFactor DMDM
Starport
Class A +3
Class B +2
Class C +0
Class D –1
Class E or X –2
Population
3or less (unless government type G) –3
4-6 –2
7– 1
8+ +0

###### Atmosphere Effects

Certain atmospheres on worlds dictate the minimum tech levels, as described on page 179 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

#### BASES

When generating a world, bases should not be rolled for until the government type and starport have been determined.

###### Naval Bases

There are two types of naval bases, those belonging to clans of the Tlaukhu and those belonging to lesser clans. All are considered naval
bases but those of the Tlaukhu are larger and better equipped. All bases are maintained by individual clans.

Starport TypeStarport Type

M —/6+ —/7+ —/8+ —/9+ —/— —/—
N 8+/7+ 9+/8+ 10+/9+ 11+/10+ —/— —/—

The first entry in each column is the chance for a _Tlaukhu_ naval base to be present, while the number after the slash is the chance for a minor
clan or corporate naval base. Government type G can only have one type of base present, so throw for _Tlaukhu_ base first and if unsuccessful,
throw for clan base. For all other worlds, throw for both _Tlaukhu_ and clan bases.

When noting bases, code Tlaukhu bases as T and clan bases as R; U means both.

Corporate Facility (ACF):Corporate Facility (ACF): A highly important factory or corporate headquarters.

Research Station (ARS):Research Station (ARS): A clan-funded science facility

Ihatei Camp (AIC): Ihatei Camp (AIC): A camp for landless males looking for retainers or conquests.

###### Travel Zones

Travel zone classifications are not in general use in Aslan space. Class X starports are considered interdicted worlds but the interdiction is
declared by some individual clan, not by the Tlaukhu as a whole. Generally, worlds are interdicted by a clan so that some local resource may
be exclusively exploited, to prevent space travel by a native race or to exploit that race without outside interference.

Interdictions are hardly ever established to protect a world or race, only to benefit the acting clan in some way. However, the owning clan
may maintain starport facilities and a base at a class X world. Port quality is zero and the port is closed to traffic not of the owning clan.

###### Travel and Trade Routes

The Hierate has nothing to correspond to the Imperial x-boat network and no travel routes are plotted on Hierate subsector maps. Major
trade routes connecting high population worlds are often established by clans and clan trade routes may be plotted; they connect worlds
with population 9 +, usually calling at established A and B starports along the way.

Individual clans maintain high-speed couriers that relay news and information much like an x-boat but there is no coordination or central
authority. News travels across the Hierate as far and as fast as someone is willing to pay for it.

###### Territories

The boundaries between the territories of Aslan clans are indistinct due to the nature of their landholdings. World surface land can be easily
marked and held but because a world may have landholdings from several clans, each clan claims that world as part of its territory. Similarly,
early exploration placed the best worlds in the hands of certain clans and later explorations settled for less hospitable worlds. As a result,
the gross boundaries of clan territories overlap. For example, the territory of a _Tlaukhu_ clan may spread over several sectors but within that
territory the majority of worlds are held by other clans. Even _Tlaukhu_ clan territory boundaries can overlap.

At best, a single clan can be said to dominate a certain subsector or sector; a dominant clan owns or controls more worlds than any other
single clan and maintains power superior to any other single clan in the area.

## TTHEHE T TROJANROJAN R REACHEACH

It is called the Outrim Void. The Borderland. Wild Space.

If the Spinward Marches is an isolated outpost to the rest of the
Imperium, then the Trojan Reach is where the wilderness begins.
The sector is an expanse of uncharted worlds and petty, backward
barbarian kingdoms, a chaotic, treacherous zone of space teetering
on the maw of the Great Rift.

Somewhere, out there beyond the little one-world kingdoms and the
failed Second Imperium colonies, are the ferocious and fearsome
Aslan, unrestrained by the Peace of Fthair.

At least, that is the Imperial perspective. To the Aslan, the Trojan
Reach is a feast they have only begun to savor. As far as the eye
can see and the scout-ship can jump is a vista of worlds begging to
be conquered. These are not lifeless, rocky wastelands – these are
vibrant, rich worlds, living worlds. The Aslan know that expansion in
this direction must, inevitably, lead to conflict with the Imperium but
they welcome this challenge. The Reach is there to be conquered!

#### HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

If a historian were to sum up the whole sorry history of the Reach
in one phrase, it might be 'treacherous opportunity'. At first glance,
the Trojan Reach looks inviting – a whole sector of settled worlds,
ready to welcome the explorer, the trader, the colonist or the
conqueror, but almost every venture in the Reach founders and fails,
often violently. The Second Imperium never managed to tame the
Reach and its native kingdoms are beset by barbarism and their own
internal squabbles. The Aslan invaders, too, have been affected by
this strange curse of thwarted ambition ever since they set foot in
the Reach.

###### The Ancients

The mysterious Ancients were active across the Trojan Reach
but there is less evidence of their activities here than in the
neighboring Spinward Marches. This is largely due to the lack
of scientific investigation in the Reach – the little warring pocket
empires and barbarian kingdoms had little interest in the relics of
the past. The one obvious exception is the Ancient ruins on Floria,
the homeworld of the Floriani, a minor human species transplanted
from Terra thousands of years ago. There are other potential traces
of the Ancients, such as the patently artificial singularity in 627-301
or the Canals of Fomalhaut, but a full inventory of Ancient sites in
the Trojan Reach is a task for future generations.

###### Old Empires

The _Ziru Sirku_ never counted the Trojan Reach as part of its holdings
but Vilani scouts and colonists did settle a few of the worlds of the
sector. These colonies were left to fend for themselves as the First
Imperium began to decay and turn inwards and were ravaged by

Vargr raiders and their own disputes. There was little in the way
of organised trade in the Trojan Reach until the [[Terra|Terran]]s began an
aggressive colonization project here thousands of years later.

What most natives of the Reach refer to as the Old Empire, though,
is the Empire of Sindal, which ruled much of the sector from –2000
to –1400.

###### Vargr & Zhodani

Despite the distance between the Trojan Reach and coreward space,
both the Zhodani and the alien Vargr have a long history in the Reach.
Zhodani traders passing through the Spinward Marches in times
of peace have done more to cultivate relations with the barbarian
states than the Imperium, while long-range Zhodani military patrols
have been encountered 'snooping' around this region in the past.
Imperial analysts believe the Zhodani Consulate is capable of
launching a pincer attack on the Spinward Marches, simultaneously
attacking from both coreward and rimward using vessels hidden in
Egyrn or Sindal subsectors. The probability of such a pincer attack
is low but nonetheless the Imperium has always watched closely for
signs of Zhodani in the Reach.

Vargr are much more common and much more dangerous in this
region. Almost all the Trojan Reach Vargr are the descendants of
corsairs and raiders who migrated here millennia ago, during the
fading years of the First Imperium. These corsairs were drawn to the
rich shipping along Corridor sector, then skirted round the still-vital
Domain of Deneb and along the edge of the Great Rift until they
ended up in the Reach. Some historians blame these Vargr corsairs
for starting the tradition of raiding that blighted development in
the Long Night; while barely one in ten raiders is non-human, the
Vargr corsairs could have been the seed around which raider culture
formed.

###### [[Terra|Terran]] Explorers

While the Trojan Reach was neglected by the Vilani, the [[Terra|Terran]]s
embarked on an ambitious colonization project, settling more than
two dozen worlds in the sector. They also explored and charted the
whole region, stopping only at the abyss of the Great Rift. As there
was comparatively little Vilani presence in this sector, the Trojan
Reach attracted settlers who wanted virgin, untamed worlds instead
of trying to integrate into Vilani society. To this day, several worlds
in the Reach (such as Strend) are heavily influenced by 'pure' [[Terra|Terran]]
cultures.

In many ways, this eager expansion into the Reach was responsible
for the chaos that followed. The [[Terra|Terran]]s set up colonies that were
overly specialized and dependent on support from offworld. When
the Second Imperium abruptly collapsed, the Trojan Reach colonies
fell hard. Elsewhere in the galaxy, worlds cut off from the Imperium
became insular, refusing to deal with outsiders, but in the Reach

the colonies turned to raiding their neighbors. Agricultural worlds
attacked industrial planets for spare parts and machinery; mining
colonies were raided for raw materials, starports were cannibalised
and torn apart to find jump-capable ships, no matter how small.
With a little push towards diplomacy, perhaps interstellar society in
the Reach could have been preserved but every colony acted in its
own interest and chaos engulfed the sector.

The 'Raider' culture took hold in this era. Small bands of thieves
would jump into a system, land and loot what they could before
fleeing once more. As these raider bands grew more successful, they
acquired larger flotillas of repurposed civilian ships. At the height of
Raider culture, a single band could number a hundred ships (still
displacing no more than fifty thousand tons in total), which would
descend on an undefended world like a swarm of locusts and steal
everything they could pack into their cargo holds. Raiders were
beholden to no planet or government save their own captains and
were a twisted reflection of the modern free trader.

The prevalence of raiding not only ruined any chance for the Reach
to pull itself out of the Long Night by its own efforts but also blocked
any chance of external aid. The Trojan Reach quickly gained a
reputation as a haven of scum and treachery; a barbaric, chaotic
region. This was largely accurate but the image of the sector as the
'Outrim Void', an irredeemable and downright wicked region of
space, meant that when the Third Imperium expanded spinward
they ignored the 'dangerous' Reach in favor of developing the
Spinward Marches.

###### The Sindalian Empire

The threat of raiders did cause a few worlds to band together and
fight. The former subsector capital of Noricum was one of the most
advanced and stable worlds in the whole Reach and joined with the
neighboring planets of Thebus and Salif in a mutual-defence pact.
This pact quickly strengthened until Noricum found itself at the
head of a growing Empire.

The Sindalian Empire was formed by a coalition of [[Terra|Terran]] worlds
and had its seat at Noricum in the Sindal Sector. At its height, the
Empire covered nine of the sixteen subsectors of the Trojan Reach
and drove the raiders towards the fringes of the sector. The Empire
succeeded in building trade links and staving off collapse for a few
centuries but its focus was always on defence and expansion instead
of consolidation or scientific development. When the Empire ran
out of worlds to conquer, the central government became autocratic
and unnecessarily brutal towards the end of its reign. In the last two
centuries of its existence, the sole purpose of the Sindalian Empire
was the preservation of Sindalian authority over its member worlds.
Planets were bombed from orbit if they refused to render exorbitant
taxes and fees. Ironically, an Empire founded to defend against
raiders became the biggest raider of them all.

In the end, rebel worlds deployed a plague against the Imperial
forces and the Old Empire collapsed heavily in on itself. The
Empire's centralising influence meant that its member worlds were
unable to maintain their technological base without interstellar trade

and interstellar trade was dangerous because of the lethal artificial
plagues let loose in the final wars. Virtually all of the member planets
of the Empire slipped into barbarism and the Sindalian Empire was
remembered not as a tyrannical police state but as a golden age.

###### The Florian League

The Florian League is the oldest extant human civilization in the
sector. Florian history is quite similar to the Vilani – both groups of
humans were transplanted by the Ancients and lived side-by-side with
their alien masters for some time. The Floriani were the subject of a
multi-generation experiment by the Ancients to produce specialized
forms of Humaniti. The Floriani come in two forms – Feskals and
Barnai. The Feskals were designed for strength and endurance; they
are hulking brutes, standing more than two meters tall when fully
grown, and capable of incredible physical labour. The Barnai were
made to be supervisors and lab assistants. They are physically weak
and underdeveloped but have huge heads and are highly intelligent.
Despite the apparent inequity of this system, where the Feskals are
seen as little better than slaves to the Barnai, both subspecies are
content and respectful of each other's rights.

When the Ancients vanished, the Floriani way of life continued almost
unchanged. The Feskals deferred to the orders of the Barnai and
the Barnai organised and catalogued and oversaw the production
of food and industrial machinery but innovation and development
were virtually forbidden. The Florians had to develop agriculture
from scratch when the Ancient food-production machines broke
down and their progress remained stalled for millennia after that.
They changed their ways only when the last Ancient machine failed
and could not be repaired.

The Floriani developed the Jump drive from a crashed Aslan ship and
their Empire has expanded steadily but conservatively since then.
They incorporated a number of [[Terra|Terran]] worlds into their nascent
League and the influx of [[Terra|Terran]] innovation (the Floriani are perhaps
the only subrace of Humaniti to whom the ultra-conservative Vilani
seem dangerously radical) has helped push the Floriani a little
towards independent development and trade.

###### Memories of Sindal

The Old Empire still casts a shadow over the whole sector. There
are still signs of its faded glory if a traveller knows where to
look. On Oghma, the starport still bears the dragon sigil of the
Sindalians. Look at the controls of the water purification plants
on Yggdrasil and you will see a perfectly preserved example of
the old Imperial technical language. On Homestead, a villager
will greet a friend with a hearty 'peror's blessing upon ye' (where
'peror', the Homesteaders' deity, is derived from memories of the
Emperor of Sindal) and challenge a stranger by saying 'who goes
there, in the name of the Star Guard', even though the Sindalian
Star Guard has not flown a ship in two thousand years.

There are other memories too. Blast craters on Ace, mass
graves on Thebus and plagues on Lacidaeus bear testament
to the vanished Empire of Sindal.

By 500, the Floriani had settled enough worlds to require an
overarching government structure, so they formed the Florian
League in 506, adding an extra tier of lotteries to their existing
planetary governments. The Florian League is one of the most stable
and secure governments in the Trojan Reach and has also expanded
strongly into the neighboring Beyond sector.

###### The Ya'soisthea

The Aslan successfully crossed the Great Rift more than two
thousand years ago but other than a few tentative trade missions
and minor colonies, the Hierate never bothered to expand across
the difficult Jump-5 route until the era of the _aisekhokhe entse_ , the
kinstrife or Aslan Cultural Purge. When the 'deviant' _tsekho_ clans
were defeated, many fled across the Great Rift to the Iiyaihuakh

(Riftspan) or Hlaoiroahaurl (Trojan Reach) sectors. The existing
Aslan colonies refused to accept the refugees and so they moved
onwards. A wave of territory-hungry Aslan flooded into the Trojan
Reach and Beyond sectors.

Soon afterwards, a second wave followed – this second wave was
triggered by the Peace of Fthair, which restricted Aslan expansion
along the Solomani border. Without anywhere else to go, clans
crossed the Rift and began settling and fighting for territory in the
Reach. Other clans soon followed, hoping to take advantage of trade
with the Third Imperium and the newly contacted pocket empires.
Between these two waves of colonization, the Aslan went from
having a dozen colonies coreward of the Rift to holding hundreds
of worlds. Some of these worlds were unoccupied but others were
human colonies that were incorporated into the Hierate.

For the human colonies, this period was a grim reminder of the
military power of the Aslan race. The Third Imperium managed to
blunt the Aslan's claws in the Peace of Fthair but in some ways
all they accomplished was moving the war from the Dark Nebula/
Reaver's Deep to the Trojan Reach. The Aslan dared not invade
the Imperium directly but all the unaligned human colonies in the
Reach were fair game. Once again, the fearsome warships and giant
savage warriors of the Aslan conquered human worlds; once again,
dewclaws ran red with human blood.

During this expansionist period, the Aslan of the Trojan Reach/
Riftspan/Vanguard Reach and Beyond Sectors also formed their
own local government. In fact, this government had existed for
more than a thousand years, in the form of an organization called

the _Ya'soisthea._ The _Ya'soisthea_ was initially established by the
Wahoi and Aroaye'i clans and their vassals in –802, to cope with
the communications delay back to Kusyu. It was patently infeasible
for clans on the far side of the Great Rift to send regular messages
to their representatives back on the homeworld, so they established
their own local form of the _Tlaukhu_. Just like the original council,
this new council – the _Ya'soisthea_ – had no formal authority but
existed as a discussion forum and a method of structured political
hierarchy. The old _Ya'soisthea_ had fallen into disuse by the modern
era, due to increasing availability of J5 couriers but it was revived to
serve the needs of the new Aslan colonies.

The _Ya'soisthea_ is a far more fractious and divided body than the
current _Tlaukhu_ (of course, a large portion of the _Ya'soisthea_ comes
from clans exiled from the _Tlaukhu_ in the first place). Unlike the
_Tlaukhu_ , which meets only on the Aslan homeworld, the _Ya'soisthea_
moves from world to world, meeting on the home planet (or a
nominated substitute) of a different member clan each year.

###### The Glorious Empire

The Tokouea'we clan was one of the first to migrate across the Great
Rift during the Cultural Purge. Unable to settle in the existing Aslan
colonies, they travelled onwards until they reached Goertal subsector.
There, they embarked on an ambitious period of conquest. Goertal
subsector was full of easy prey – lightly populated, lightly defended
and comparatively primitive human colonies. While the _Tlaukhu_
had just outlawed slavery under the terms of the Grand Conclave,
the Tokouea'we embraced it. Human slaves drove the expansion of
the Tokouea'we clan, until it was the single greatest Aslan military
power in the sector.

As more Aslan moved into the Trojan Reach and established their
own clan holdings, the Tokouea'we were the loudest voice calling
for the formation of a new, local version of the _Tlaukhu_ – as the
largest, most powerful clan, the Tokouea'we would be assured a
prime place in this new council and would have the respect of the
other clans that they had long been denied. They proposed using
the old _Ya'soisthea_ as a model for the new government and used
their considerable influence to bring other clans on board.

However, they were, if anything, too successful. The _Ya'soithea_ was
opposed not only by the clans already present in the region but also
by the _Tlaukhu_ clans. When the Tokouea'we saw their old rivals and
persecutors claiming places in the new government, they cut off all
relations with the rest of the Hierate and declared themselves to be
an independent Empire; the Glorious Empire.

The Glorious Empire has survived, albeit somewhat diminished,
to the present day and still enslaves humans for brute labour and
cannon fodder.

###### The Imperium

The Third Imperium began tentative expansion into the Trojan
Reach within a century of the crowning of Emperor Cleon I but
this expansion soon stalled as the threat posed by the Zhodani

Consulate became obvious. Reconquering and pacifying the whole
of the Trojan Reach would require money, effort and ships better
spent fortifying the coreward border of the Spinward Marches. The
Imperium established two great fleet bases at Pax Rulin and Tobia
and then effectively declared that they would go no further.

Following the end of the Aslan Border Wars, word was sent to
Deneb warning them that the Aslan might expand into the Trojan
Reach now that they could not longer push into [[Terra|Terran]] space. The
Archduke did double the border guard and established a chain
of listening posts to watch for Aslan forces but as yet neither the
Imperium nor the Aslan have gone to open war in the Trojan Reach.
As the Aslan press every closer to the border, though, such conflict
may be inevitable.

#### STATES & PEOPLES OF THE

#### TROJAN REACH

The Trojan Reach is divided between two great powers, the Aslan
Hierate and the Third Imperium; two lesser powers of the Glorious
Empire and the Florian League; and innumerable minor states and
independent worlds. The Imperium has largely fixed its borders and
any expansion comes in the form of client states and defence pacts.
By contrast, the Aslan Hierate is aggressively pushing outwards and
its holdings in the sector are likely to grow by 10-20% in the coming
century, even by the most conservative estimates.

###### The Aslan Hierate

The Hierate in the Trojan Reach is quite unlike the Hierate on the far
side of the Rift. The old Hierate is a near-monoculture following the
Cultural Purge, which forced a single set of beliefs on all the clans. Here
on the fringe of Aslan space, though, there are clans driven out by the
Cultural Purge, clans who settled the trans-Rift sectors millennia ago
and newly arrived trades and militant clans. The Trojan Reach Aslan are
a wild and heterogeneous group compared to their cousins.

Aslan politics are opaque to outside observers. Attempts to paint
the Tlaukhu as a unified organization are futile – the Tlaukhu and
the Ya'soisthea have no real power and individual clans are capable
of independent action. Further, the clan leaders usually only make
short-term decisions and have little influence over either clan trade
(run by the corporations) or migrations and conquest (which are
largely in the claws of the ihatei ). Population pressure, not politics,
dictates much of Aslan military policy. As a new generation of
landless males reaches maturity, the Aslan clans must either fight
amongst themselves or push out to new systems.

Officially, the Hierate respects the Peace of Fthair, which states
that the Aslan will not encroach on Imperial territory. Their primary
goals in the Reach are guarding their own borders (mainly against
the Glorious Empire), protecting the trade route with the Imperum
and 'gathering' any unsettled worlds they can. In practice, the Aslan
protect their own – if the ihatei migrations do trigger a conflict with
the Imperium, the Hierate will commit military assets to the ensuing
war. The Peace of Fthair is a very weak brake on Aslan expansion

anyway – it only applies to the clans who fought in the Border Wars
and their vassals and those clans make up less than 40% of the
Trojan Reach clans.

Many Aslan see the Trojan Reach as a region of opportunity. There
are territories to be conquered here that offer little challenge to a
true warrior but are close enough to the Imperium and even the
Zhodani Consulate to be wealthy trade hubs in years to come.

###### The Imperium

There are three Imperial-dominated subsectors (Sindal's small
Imperial presence can be folded into Tobia), each of which has its
own unique character. Pax Rulin is dominated by the military and
the people there see themselves as the watchmen on the walls of
the Imperium. They are fiercely opposed to any Aslan expansion
into the Reach. Gazulin is the oldest settled sector and is considered
to be as close as the Trojan Reach comes to a bastion of culture and
civilization. Finally, Tobia is the subsector capital and ducal seat;
it has benefited greatly from trade with the Aslan and is the most
cosmopolitan of the three.

The Imperium has little knowledge of the rest of the subsector,
especially the Aslan-held subsectors and Menorial, Egryn, Yggdrasil
and Dpres. Surveys of Menorial were only completed in 1105 and
the Scout service rates all charts of the sector as 'questionable'.
The Trojan Reach has a poor reputation elsewhere in the Imperium,
especially in the Spinward Marches, where most people believe the
whole sector outside Pax Rulin is full of bandits, barbarians and
vicious Aslan marauders, when in fact it is at most half full of these
things.

###### The Florian League

For 300,000 years, the Floriani culture remained in virtual stasis.
Abandoned by their Ancient masters, the Floriani continued as they
had done, changing only when one or another of the machines
broke down. It was not until they recovered jump technology from a
crashed Aslan scout ship that they made any attempt at real change.
The Floriani are still highly conservative, expanding only to take
advantage of needed resources. They have never attacked another
interstellar power, although they have incorporated degenerate
human colonies into their League. That said, the Floriani are far from
pacifistic and have shown no hesitation in using nuclear weapons
and overwhelming force in war. They are guided by amoral logic in
all political decisions.

The Florian government works on a system of lotteries. Randomly
selected Barnai must serve a term on one of a number of councils
(municipal, provincial or world); after serving on a council, the
Barnai's name is removed from the lottery register so he will never
be elected again. Theoretically, this serves to ensure that no Barnai
can establish a political power base and dominate the government.
Leaving aside the fact that the very concept of ambitious, self-
centred Barnai is bizarrely incongruous, this policy results in
extreme conservatism as the elected officials spend most of their
term studying and learning in order to make informed decisions.

Florian criminal justice is equally unusual. Instead of determining
whether or not a crime has been committed based on the evidence,
their philosophy is to learn precisely what happened, then determine
if it was a crime. Killing another Florian might be murder or self-
defence or a charitable act or the most efficient use of resources.
The Florian system is utterly confusing to non-Floriani and their
equivalent of 'lawyers' would be philosophers on any other world.

The Florian League has an extremely utilitarian approach to trade
and contact with others. They trade only to acquire the resources
they need but cannot obtain inside their own borders; the League
has in fact closed its borders entirely in times of surplus. Similarly,
diplomacy's sole purpose for the League is to safeguard the League;
the leaders appear to have no agenda save maintaining the status
quo. The League has trade and diplomatic relations with the
Imperium and with several states to spinward in Beyond sector;
they have occasional diplomatic talks with the Aslan but refuse to
trade with most Aslan corporations.

###### The Glorious Empire

This breakaway Aslan state is ruled by a single Emperor. The Empire
declared independence from the Hierate in 650 following a political
dispute but disputes were brewing for centuries before that. The
economy of the Glorious Empire is founded on slavery – between
30% to 60% of its population are humans (exact tallies are hard to
come by, as the Empire is fiercely xenophobic), who were enslaved
by the Empire during its expansionist period. The rights of these
humans vary from territory to territory – at best, they are third-class

###### Great Clans of the Trojan Reach

Twelve clans make up the grand council of the Ya'soisthea.
Clan standings in the region are much more fluid than in the
Tlaukhu , so a clan can rise to the grand council for a brief
period and then be cast down again. The ruling Ya'soisthea
clans with an interest in the Trojan Reach are:

+ Ahroay'if: Ahroay'if: Centred in Tlaiowaha subsector, the Ahroay'if
    benefit greatly from trade with the Imperium.
+ Aroaye'i: Aroaye'i: This clan holds the crucial worlds on the Jump-
    5 route across the Great Rift.
+ Hrakoea:Hrakoea: A highly aggressive clan, the Hrakoae are looking
    to expand their holdings in the Borderlands subsector.
+ Ikhtealyo: Ikhtealyo: Another trader clan, specialising in dust-spice
    and other Imperial goods.
+ Yerlyaruiwo:Yerlyaruiwo: One of the _Tlaukhu_ clans; highly
    traditionalist.
+ Khaukheairl:Khaukheairl: A _Tlaukhu_ clan; guardians of Aslan
    culture.
+ Tlaiowaha:Tlaiowaha: A _Tlaukhu_ trader clan; patrons of the
    Ahroay'if.
+ Tiykhisto:Tiykhisto: Agitating for war with the Imperium.

citizens, at worst, food animals to be slaughtered on a whim. The
Empire's policy towards humans is only one of the reasons it is
ostracised by the other Aslan clans but it is an important one and
one that has shaped the attitudes of the human worlds of the Reach
towards the Glorious Empire. The Empire is feared and hated by
virtually every world that knows of it and tales of Aslan brutality are
told across the sector.

The Glorious Empire is almost always at war with the other Aslan
clans, the surrounding non-aligned worlds or the Florian League. Its
sole exports are mercenaries and its economy is stagnating due to
the lack of skilled technicians among the slave caste. The Empire
maintains diplomatic links with the Aslan Hierate and still has
the right to a seat in the _Ya'soisthea_ but has no trading partners or
real allies. The Imperium finds the Glorious Empire to be a useful
bogeyman with which to scare neutral worlds into line ('accept
our terms and we'll protect you from the Aslan monsters') but the
Empire is too far from the Imperium for either side to be a real threat
to the other.

Aside from practicing slavery, Glorious Empire culture is much
like traditional Aslan culture. Males are warriors and landowners;
females are technicians, merchants and advisors. Herding and
disciplining slaves is considered a male task.

Travel within the Glorious Empire is heavily restricted. Outsiders
must present themselves at a starport and contact the local
representative of the Glorious Empire; the bureaucracy to obtain a
visitor's visa is labyrinthine and involves a lot of bribery. Even then,
the visitor will only be permitted to travel to a limited number of
places and will be accompanied by Imperial observers at all times.

###### Minor States

There are several smaller polities in the Trojan Reach. None of
these have any reach beyond their individual subsector but are
considerable players within that subsector.

Belgardian Sojourate:Belgardian Sojourate: Located in the Egryn subsector, the Sojournate
is a desperately poor group of worlds ruled from Belgard. The
Sojourners are the descendants of a crew of a colony expedition
that stalled on Belgard; they raid surrounding worlds for supplies.
The Sojournate is also known as a pirate base.

Senlis Foederate:Senlis Foederate: In Pax Rulin subsector, the Senlis Foederate is a
protectionist trade pact opposed to the Imperium. The Foederate
is technologically advanced but contains only three worlds and has
very limited influence over the rest of the subsector.

Strend Cluster: Strend Cluster: The Strend Cluster is found in Menorial Subsector. It
is a group of worlds ruled by the totalitarian government of Strend.
They are techologically advanced and moderately powerful but
expend so much of their energy in futile cold wars with the Imperium
and the Florian League that their power is severely limited.

Dustbelt Worlds: Dustbelt Worlds: The Dustbelt is a string of worlds along the
Sindalian Main, a region of space once ruled by the old Empire of
Sindal. The Dustbelt worlds regularly war with each other, which
is unfortunate as the main trade route to the Florian League runs
through the Sindalian Main. If one world or another managed to
dominate the Main, it would greatly reduce the danger of trade with
the League.

Kingdom of Drinax: Kingdom of Drinax: Formerly the major human power in Tlaiowaha
subsector, the Kingdom of Drinax was smashed by the Aslan Hierate
in a recent conflict. When it existed, the Drinaxians were opposed to
Aslan expansion but were proudly independant of the Imperium.

###### Raiders

Piracy and raiding is endemic to much of the Trojan Reach. The
'raider culture' has plagued the sector for thousands of years and
the pattern has remained the same all that time. A band of raiders
jumps into the target system, which is usually a low-tech planet,
and loots whatever valuable and portable goods they can find.
Traditional raider targets are precious metals and gemstones,
electronics, radioactives, art items, starship parts and slaves. Once
their holds are filled, the raiders flee and jump back to their base or
a raider-friendly port. Raiding is not viable in the Imperium as the
Imperial Navy would hunt down and destroy such theives but there
is no law in the Outrim Void.

Imperial agents estimate there are fifty to one hundred raider bands
operating in the Trojan Reach, many of which are based on the world
of Theev. Their numbers are difficult to estimate, partly because
many smaller raids go unreported, partly because Aslan raiders
are sometimes confused with human raiders and partly because
many of the raider bands are seasonal. A farming village on some
backwater world might have an ancient and barely functional free
trader hidden in a cave or forest clearing. When the winter comes,
the villagers reactivate the ship and go marauding for a few weeks,
stealing from their neighbors in the next system over.

The average raider band, though, are professional looters. They
have three to five small ships and are well-equipped with personal
weapons and armor. They are more than a match for a TL6
world's military and so can fly in, loot and escape without risking
casualties. Such raiders may also find employment as mercenaries,
tramp merchants or adventurers when not raiding. There is a much
higher proportion of Vargr in the raider community than in any
other demographic; about 10% of raiders are Vargr, with 60% being
human and 30% Aslan.

Piracy is an equally large problem in the Reach. There are two major
trade routes running through the sector and both routes run through
neutral space. To protect against piracy, traders are advised to
group into large convoys and Imperial or Aslan warships escort the
convoys. Less than half the traders avail of convoy protection; both
governments charge a fee for the protection of their warships (and
many unscrupulous captains charge more when the convoy enters the
danger zone), it can take weeks for a convoy to gather and an escort to
become available and a convoy takes the slowest, safest route across
the sector, restricted to the jump capability of the slowest ship (usually
J2). Megacorporations can afford to provide or hire their own combat
ships. Independent traders who are unwilling to wait for a convoy
must make their own way across the sector without protection.

The jump routes across the sector are well known, so pirates prefer to lie
in wait for convoys, attacking just before the group jumps. With luck, the
pirates can catch a few freighters after the escorts have jumped out.

###### The Zhodani Consulate

The Zhodani are a constant if unseen presence in the Reach.
They have no worlds, no permanent bases (at least, none that the
Imperium knows about) but in any year, two to five Zhodani cruisers
make a patrol of the spinward reach. The Zhodani insist that they
are engaged in long-range survey missions and protecting their
trade interests (the Zhodani do have considerable trade links with
the Hierate via the Jump-5 Rift Crossing) but they have also had
secret talks with the governments of numerous independent worlds
in the sector, suggesting a longer-term plan to develop a presence
or at least a network of friendly worlds in the Trojan Reach.

#### WAR

War with the Aslan is inevitable. The desire for territory is irresistible
to the Aslan males, so sooner or later they must invade new worlds.
The only question is, when?

###### The Aslan/Imperium Question

The Trojan Reach is the borderland between the great power of Charted
Space – the Third Imperium – and an aggressive, expansionist power.
The Hierate has advanced to within twenty parsecs of the Imperial
border and shows little sign of slowing down. Every generation,
the Aslan come closer to Imperial territory. In two hundred years
at current rates, Imperial worlds – not merely client states but full
members worlds – will be seen by the Aslan as prime targets for _ihatei_
invasions. Neither side can easily avert this conflict.

For the Aslan, the problem is a cultural one – the young landless males
have to go somewhere and conquering new territory is preferable to
infighting within the Hierate. The clans might be able to deflect the
young warriors, sending them into Beyond or the unclaimed subsectors
of the Trojan Reach like Egryn, but this is a stopgap measure.

Analysis suggests that in most cases, the Imperium would win the
conflict. The Aslan clans have proved unwilling to co-operate on military
matters except in rare cases and no one clan is a match for the Imperium.
An Aslan war, however, would be immensely messy. There would be no
grand armadas pitted against each other in key systems, no precision
strikes against fortress worlds. Instead, the Imperium would face a few
Aslan capital ships, which would be formidable but not insurmountable
foes and a vast swarm of smaller raiders and ihatei warbands. These
warbands would sweep through Imperial space, conquering minor
worlds by the dozen. The Aslan are capable of mustering tremendous
fighting forces from among their male population and each Aslan is the
equivalent of a trained human soldier. The problem with a warrior race
is that they are all warriors on some level.

Such a mass invasion could be defeated but it would take decades to root
out every petty Aslan conquerer and guerrila fighter. The Aslan Border Wars
lasted nearly two thousand years; based on that model, an Aslan invasion
of, say, Tobia and Gazulin could involve three years of conflict and thirty
years of police action removing the Aslan invaders from backwater worlds.
It is a victory of sorts but would be hugely costly for the Imperium.

More pessimistic analysts argue that this confidence may be
misplaced. If an Aslan/Imperium conflict began, then the war
would draw warriors and mercenaries from all over the Hierate.
The population in the Trojan Reach would be swelled by recruits
from all over the galaxy. If the war reached a tipping point, then it
could escalate immensely. Projections show that the Hierate could
overrun the whole Reach within five years in the right conditions,
especially if the Imperium were distracted by another frontier war
with the Zhodani or a civil war.

The Peace of Fthair may block Aslan attacks on the Imperium.
Technically, the Peace only applies to the clans who signed it and
only a few of those clans are active in the Trojan Reach. The Aslan
may respect the treaty to honor those clans or those clans might
even attack anyone who breaches the treaty. More likely, though, the
Aslan will decide that the Peace only applies to the human 'clans'
who fought in Reaver's Deep and that the Imperium in the Trojan
Reach is too far away from the Deep to be honored in the same
way. While many in the Imperium, especially in Tobia and Gazulin
subsectors, hide behind the Peace of Fthair as if it guarantees peace
with the Aslan, a paper treaty may not be proof against the razor-
sharp claw of the invader.

Of course, Aslan infighting may render all these fears of a mass
invasion fanciful. The Cultural Purge of a thousand years ago
set Aslan expansion and development back by centuries and the
Ya'soisthea is at least as divided as the Aslan of that era were. If
another two or three clans break off like the Glorious Empire did,

then the ensuing conflicts would absorb the energies of the _ihatei_
for several generations.

###### The Aslan and Everyone Else

The Aslan are the thousand-dton elephant in the room when
considering the rest of the Trojan Reach. They are a highly advanced
and territory-hungry power; two-thirds of the Reach is made up of
small, lightly defended worlds ready to be conquered. Thus far, the
Aslan have been lazy when it comes to conquests, picking off worlds at
their leisure. Their ongoing wars with the Glorious Empire and Florian
League have also sapped some of their enthusiasm for conquest – but
any day, a particularly charismatic _ihatei_ or ambitious clan could launch
an invasion of any of two dozen worlds. Half the Reach worlds survive
solely because the Aslan have not yet bothered to conquer them.

Some worlds are aware of the Aslan threat but have failed to rally
any coalitions to resist the inevitable invasion. The Kingdom of
Drinax, the one independent coalition that acknowledged the danger
posed by the Aslan, was destroyed with almost casual ease by the
clans. Other defence pacts might be more successful at warding off
invasion, as the Aslan tend to go for the weakest targets first. Most
planets, though, are more concerned with internal or local politics
than the Aslan Hierate. For these unfortunates, the sign of trouble
will come when the Aslan warriors arrive and claim the planet as
their new domain.

###### The Glorious Empire

There is a saying in the Reach – 'when cats fight, Goertal bleeds'. The
Glorious Empire is fighting a losing war against the Aslan Hierate
and when the Empire loses worlds to its cousins, it tends to respond
by conquering more human worlds and enslaving the population.
The Glorious Empire's borders have moved six parsecs coreward
since it was formed as worlds change hands at either end.

The Empire's recent setbacks are by no means irreversible. A shift
in _Ya'soisthea_ politics could divide the clans battling against the
Glorious Empire, giving the slaves a chance to reclaim lost territory
or fortify their position and slow their decline. Conquering a few
more choice worlds like Colony Six or Delta Theta could also give
the Glorious Empire the strength to stall a Hierate advance.

#### TRADE

If there is one factor that might prevent the whole Trojan Reach
from slipping into war, it is trade. The trade route between the
Hierate and the Imperium is worth trillions of credits to both sides
each year. Both sides want this trade to continue – the Tliaowaha/
Ahroay'if axis has benefited hugely from the trade and both clans
have gained influence in the _Tlaukhu_ and _Ya'soisthea_ respectively.
Any major conflict between the Imperium and the Hierate will be
strongly opposed by these clans and their allies.

Trade has also improved the lot of many of the independent worlds
across the sector. The worlds along the Imperium-Hierate trade
route and, to a lesser extent, the Florian trade corridor have benefited
from the passing convoys. This has caused a shift from raiding to

piracy; piracy is damaging and costly but much less damaging in
the long run. If the sector remains largely peaceful for another three
centuries or so, then it may shake off its reputation as a chaotic
and dangerous place. Corporate development of the Outrim Void
section would help immensely.

###### The Florian Route

The main Imperium/Florian League trade route runs from Tobia to
Yggdrasil. Starting at Fist/Tobia, the route follows the Aslan route
for several jumps before diverging at Arunisiir. From there, the route
passes through Tlaiowaha subsector, via Blue, Torpol and Oghma,
then into the Sindalian Main via Thebus, then Acis and along the Main
to Janus, then a jump to the refuelling station at 291-540 and then finally
to Yggdrasil. For a jump-2 freighter, this is a journey of fourteen jumps,
taking on average 140 days. There are several faster jump-4 routes from
Pax Rulin or Glisten but these routes are extremely hazardous.

The Florian League provides no protection for traffic along this
route; Imperial ships do sometimes accompany convoys along the
corridor but most traders are on their own after leaving Arunisiir.
The Florian League imports radioactives, computers and electronics,
biochemicals, spices and medical supplies; they export advanced
manufactured goods, advanced vehicles, advanced weapons and
other manufactured goods.

###### The Hierate Route

The Imperium-Hierate trade route sees nearly five times more
traffic than the Imperium-Florian League route and is both shorter
and safer. Like the Florian route, most traffic starts at Fist in Tobia
subsector, then Wildeman and Cordan. Jump-3 ships can take the
shorter route from Acrid to Tech-World, while slower ships must go
via Argona and Sperle before reaching Tech-World. The final stages
of the journey are a jump to Paal and then onto Tyokh. For a jump-2
freighter, this is a journey of seven jumps taking an average of 55
days (the turnaround time between jumps is much higher on this
well-travelled route). Most ships will have escorts the whole way,
although most Imperial escorts take the shorter route from Cordan
to Acrid instead of Cordan-Argona-Sperle, making the latter two
worlds prime regions for pirate attacks.

Both sides are permitted to escort convoys as far as the other side's
border (Imperial ships from Fist to Paal; Aslan ships from Tyokh to
Wildeman) but in modern times it is customary for the Imperium
ships to go from Fist to Acrid and then Ahroay'if escorts meet the
convoy at Tech-World.

The Aslan import high-technology goods, spices and live animals;
they primarily export petrochemicals, textiles, precious metals,
crystals and gems and uncommon ore and raw materials.

#### CORPORATIONS

In the absence of any interstellar government, several corporations
have taken on added importance in the Trojan Reach. The General
Development Company is easily the most important of these,
followed by the Company of Grandmotherly Kindness, the Florian
Trade Company and PRQ.

###### General Development Company

_(Human megacorporation)_ GeDeCo, as it is commonly known, is much
more than a trading company. It was founded in the Year 700, in the wake
of the Civil War, with a mandate to foster trade and development in the wild
space along the Reft and Trojan Reach sectors. The company was formed by
nobles in Deneb, who purchased several failing shipping lines and combined
them into the new business. GeDeCo began by 'bootstrapping' backwards
and underdeveloped worlds along Reft, selling them progressively more
advanced technology in exchange for raw materials.

By the year 800, the standard GeDeCo contract had evolved. Sign the
contract and your world will be provided with a Class-C or Class-B,
technical knowledge, equipment and training to raise your world's
technology level at a stable and non-disruptive rate and a market for
your planet's raw materials ores, textiles and other low-tech goods.
All it costs you is a percentage of those low-tech goods, giving a seat
on your ruling body to GeDeCo and obeying various customs such
as safe passage for travellers, the Imperial rules of war and so forth.
GeDeCo made a moderately good return and brought civilization to
dangerous regions of the galaxy.

The Trojan Reach directorate of GeDeCo is based on Vorito and is
largely independent from the main office on Deneb. The company is
responsible for building and maintaining starports all over the sector,
especially along the Florian Trade Corridor and for sending trade
missions out to minor worlds, drawing them into the web of galactic
commerce. GeDeCo has been accused of questionable and even
unethical policies in the past; the influential Ahroay'if clan has accused
GeDeCo of espionage, piracy and anti-Aslan propaganda and now
refuses to trade directly with the megacorporation.
Home Port: Vorito or Deneb.
Territory: Deneb, Reft, Trojan Reach, Beyond.

###### Florian Trade Company

_(Human Sector-Wide Line)_ The FTC was founded by entrepreneurs
from Gazulin subsector, soon after peaceful relations were established
with the Florian League. The insular Floriani initially rejected any
offers to trade with outsiders for cultural reasons. The initial idea
came from a historian and archaeologist, Brahna haut-Vorhes, an
expert on the lost Empire of Sindal. Her research indicated that the
Sindalians occasionally traded with a strange race somewhere to
spinward, who were described as 'child-like'. She reasoned that this
description could apply to the Barnai caste of the Floriani and that
the old trade protocols and treaties used by the Sindalians and the
Floriani could be used to reopen trade links.

She gathered a consortium of merchants and investors, who sent out two
far trader-type ships armed with a copy of haut-Vorhes' _A New Appraisal
of Trade and Commerce in the Middle Period of the Sindal Empire_ and two
holds full of precious metals. The traders returned with a cargo of high-
tech goods and tales of a wondrous world full of Ancient ruins – Floria.

The FTC was launched to great acclaim in 171 and traded for nearly
thirty years, garnering vast profits, until the Florians suddenly
closed their borders. It was later discovered that the Florians made
contact with the Zhodani around the year 200 and that this incident

somehow led to the Florians recoiling from contact with the rest of
the galaxy for centuries. Three centuries later, when the Florians re-
established themselves, GeDeCo investors reformed the FTC.

The FTC today is an independent corporation, although GeDeCo is still a
significant shareholder. In addition to its normal trade runs, the FTC has
a number of J4 liners who bring rich tourists to visit the Ancient ruins on
Floria.
Home Port: Gazulin.
Territory: Trojan Reach.

###### PRQ

(Human Sector-Wide Corporation) This corporation began as a side
business – during the chaos of the late 400s and the Civil War, the
massive military base at Pax Rulin was left short of vitally needed
supplies and raw materials. The base quartermaster began using naval
vessels as trade ships, exchanging out-of-date military equipment for
steel, uranium, lanthanum and other goods. By the time the Civil War
ended and regular shipments were once again assured, the contacts
established by successive generations of quartermasters were too
valuable to be allowed to lapse. PRQ (Pax Rulin Quartermasters)
was spun off as an independent company, although it is still closely
associated with the Imperial Navy.

Today, PRQ trades in Pax Rulin subsector as well as along the
Florian and Aslan trade routes. It is seen as a safe company, mainly
because most of its crew are ex-navy and its ships are invariably
heavily armed. In a sector notorious for piracy, this is an excellent
reputation to have.
Home Port: Pax Rulin.
Territory: Trojan Reach.

###### Tobia Commerce Guild

(Human Sector-Wide Corporation) The Tobia Commerce Guide is a
conglomerate built to profit on trade with the Aslan Hierate. It buys goods from
across the Spinward Marches and Deneb, then ships them to the Hierate.
Most of the shareholders are nobles from Tobia subsector and the company
has the nickname of the 'Duke's Own', reflecting persistent rumors that that
the Duke of Tobia is heavily (and illegally) invested in the company.

Guild ships make up over a third of traffic across the Aslan trade route
and this proportion is growing. The Guild has recently put in orders
for another four 50,000-ton megafreighters, doubling its capacity
(diminished since the loss of the Yarrow in 1099 to 'misjump'). Some
observers fear that the Guild is flooding the Aslan markets in an
attempt to drive competitors out of business and the Tobia navy has
issued a warning that the Guild is sending more trade ships than it
has escorts to allocate.

The Guild is notoriously quick to take offence and has in the past claimed
that GeDeCo is engaged in sabotage and that PRQ is using its naval
connections to claim all the escort slots. The Duke of Tobia has intervened
several times on the company's behalf, furthering speculation of his
involvement behind the scenes. The Guild is the newest megacorporation
to open in the Trojan Reach and is rapidly eclipsing all the others save the

Company of Grandmotherly Kindness (technically, GeDeCo is still larger
but most count GeDeCo's Trojan directorate as separate to its Deneb
and Reft branches).
Home Port: Tobia.
Territory: Trojan Reach.

###### Company of Grandmotherly Kindness

Iyarl Ahkha'Re _(Aslan Sector-Wide Corporation):_ The trading arm of
the Ahroay'if clan, this company also has significant investment
from the powerful Syoisuis and Tlaiowaha clans. The corporation's
main business is selling imported goods from the Imperium
throughout the Hierate but it has diversified and supplies
everything from barbecues to warship hulls and fusion reactors.
The Company of Grandmotherly Kindness is known throughout
the Hierate but its main sphere of influence is on the coreward
side of the Great Rift in the Trojan Reach and Riftspan sectors.

The Company of Grandmotherly Kindness is run by a council of elderly
_siyajkhoara,_ so its actions do not always accord with the interests of the
clans who own it. The Company is extremely influential and can ignore
pressure from the _Ya'soisthea_. In the past, it has acted to snuff out wars
and territorial conflicts that threaten its trade routes. It has had a virtual
monopoly on general trade with the humans for centuries.

Lately, the Company has begun to face increased competition since
Tyeyo Dust-Spice Importers started carrying other human goods
and Glories Under The Claw is taking much of its business on border
worlds. The Company has grown fat and lazy and a new generation
of ambitious _siyajkhoara_ are plotting to overthrow the ruling council
and put the Company back where it belongs.
Home Port: Tlaiowaha.
Territory: Trojan Reach, Riftspan Reaches.

###### Glories Under The Claw

I'aok'soi ( _Aslan Subsector-Wide Corporation):_ This corporation
was originally founded by Aslan from the Yerlyaruiwo clan but is
now fiercely independent. The company's business is usually
described blandly as 'colony supply and commodities trading' but
in fact Glories Under The Claw is a one-stop shop for would-be
conquerors. It supplies everything from _ihatei_ scout ships, troop
transports and weapons to mining equipment, temporary and
permanent structures, kusyuforming technology (to adapt worlds
to support Aslan food animals and crops) and even slave collars.
Tellingly, Glories Under The Claw is one of the few corporations to
do extensive business in the Glorious Empire.

The corporation wields significant influence along the Aslan border
and is not above inciting _ihatei_ invasions and border conflicts to
grow new markets.
Home Port: Khtiyrlo.
Territory: Rimward half of Trojan Reach.

###### Tyeyo Dust-Spice Importers

Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr _(Aslan Sector-Wide Corporation):_ During the
period immediately after the Border Wars with the Imperium (380
to 500), Aslan traders found a large market for dust-spice, a novel

spice which appealed to Aslan tastes but which was available only in
the Spinward Marches of the Imperium. Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr (Tyeyo
Dustspice Importers) was established to import the novelty.

Since then, synthetic dustspice has become available and natural dust-
spice is a gourmet treat but no longer imported in great quantities. Tyeyo
Fteahrao Yolr instead seeks out and imports any novel or valuable trade
goods along the route from Mora in the Spinward Marches and the
Aslan capital of Kusyu. Its diversification into other trade goods puts
it in direct competion with the Company of Grandmotherly Kindness.
Currently, the Company is a bigger player in the Trojan Reach but
Tyeyo's business interests run from the Spinward Marches all the way
to the Dark Nebula sector. If a trade war between these two corporations
does happen, then the Dust-Spice Importer's vastly greater reach and
influence may give them the edge in the long term, even if the Company
can squeeze them out of the lucractive short trade route.
Home Port: Kusyu.
Territory: Dark Nebula, Ealiyasiyw, Riftspan Reaches, Trojan Reach
and Spinward Marches.

###### Five Shields

Khu Su'ikh (Aslan Sector-Wide Corporation) : Soon after the jump-
5 route across the liyoihuakh sector (the Riftspan Reaches) was
discovered in –1044, the Wahtoi clan staked its claim to many of
the worlds of the sector. Naturally enough, a trading company tied
to the Wahtoi clan soon developed a monopoly on trade across the
Great Rift. In about –750, however, the Aroaye'i established itself on
Aulryakh as the dominant clan; after a clan war lasting several years,
they forced Wahtoi clan to accept the Aroaye'i in partnership on the
trade routes across the Great Rift.

Over the years, the participation of Aroaye'i clan females has increased
to the point today that the two clans are equal partners in ownership
of Khu Su'ikh. Khu Su'ikh means Five Shields in Aslan; the name
refers to the five major worlds along the route across the rift.

Khu Su'ikh maintains a benevolent monopoly on rift passage
service. Its fleet includes large cargo carriers capable of jump-5 for
the rift crossing and it provides navigation information for ships
which are themselves capable of jump-5. Its even-handed treatment
makes rift crossings relatively simple. The company makes its profit
from repair and resupply services on worlds within the rift.
Home Port: Wahtoikoeakh.
Territory: Riftspan Reaches.

###### Acquisition of Things Not-Us

Gli! Fong! Uric! Ka (Florian Subsector-Wide Company): This is a Florian
merchant line, one of the few Florian companies to trade outside
the League. It has a number of long-range scout ships that wander
the galaxy, looking for items that would be of use to the League but
are not yet being offered by the FTC or any other trader. In the past,
Acquisition-of-Things-Not-Us has brought back items as diverse as
anagathics, Vargr artwork, library data, textiles and coyns. A canny
human merchant who shadows an Acquisition-of-Things-Not-Us
trader can predict what the Florian League will next demand.
Home Port: Floria.
Territory: Yggdrasil.

#### MENORIAL

Menorial Subsector sits uneasily between the Imperium and the rest
of the sector. It nestles against the Rimward border of Five Sisters
and sees a limited amount of Imperial traffic from that region,
mostly passing through to trade with the Florian League along the
'Florian Corridor' route from Szirp to Dustpan to Crescent to Viceroy
and then into the League. Worlds like Adhara and Fomalhaut see
only a handful of visitors per year.

The Imperium officially frowns on travelling into Menorial and patrols
the border with Five Sisters. It is easy enough for a free trader to slip
over the border and large caravans with Imperial escorts travel to
the Florian League once every three months or so.

The Florian League holds roughly a quarter of the sector. The worlds
along their border – Heath, Viceroy and the Arhada domains of
Arhada, Adhara and Hadara – are all protectorates of the League,
having agreed to give extremely favorable trading rights to the
Florians in exchange for defence. The Arhadans are the descendants
of a colony that settled on a watery moon; they have a highly tribal
culture, where respect for one's kin and family is the highest virtue.

The other major player in this sector is the Strend cluster, settled by
an independent Solomani trader named Lucien Strend in the 800s.
Strend and his followers were devotees of the ancient French culture
from Terra and French is the official language of the cluster. The
Strend planets are technologically advanced but politically isolated.
They have an ongoing cold war with both the Florian League (who
are simply confused by Strend culture) and the Imperium (Strend
and his followers are strong supporters of the Solomani movement).
There are rumors linking the cluster to various anti-Imperial
factions operating in the Marches and to occasional attacks on
Imperial shipping along the 'Florian Corridor'. If these rumors are
true, then the March dukes may eventually rally enough support for
a punitive war against the Cluster.

###### Dustpan A750779-9

Dustpan is a balkanised desert world, divided among six clans who
are locked in a constant struggle over the few usable water-bearing
aquifers buried deep beneath the sandy surface. These wars are
fought using short-range flyers launched from titanic aircraft-carriers
that crawl across the sand. There are ice-bearing asteroids in the
system which could be mined for water but none of the Dustpan
governments have their own spacecraft. Centuries ago, one of the
clans used satellite-mounted weaponry to rain down missiles on its
rivals, wiping out several thousand people. Since then, there has
been an absolute ban on any development of space technology and
it has become a cultural taboo to travel beyond the atmosphere.
Visiting traders planning to sell icewater to the thirsty Pansmen will
find that richer customers refuse to drink 'tainted spacewater'.

The planet's spaceport was built by offworld traders and is
considered neutral territory. Mercenaries are used to provide

security in the spaceport and there are some hopeful signs that the
starport will grow into a neutral meeting place for the clans and
perhaps eventually bring an end to the constant Dustpan wars.

###### Trossachs B897A44-C

The industrial planet of Trossachs is one of the key manufacturing
centres for the Florian League. Much of the vast planet's surface is
covered in factories, mines or cyclopean barracks for the billions
of Feskals who labour here. The Barnai population of Trossachs is
less than ten million – this is by far the lowest Barnai/Feskal ratio
anywhere in the League and there are some Feskals in the Barrack-
cities who have never even seen a Barnai. Strend agents have tried
to foment disputes and industrial action on Trossachs but the
notoriously stoic Feskals refuse to be incited.

Trossachs' natural ecosystem was long ago erased by the expansion
of the factories. A few species survived, adapting to their new
environment. Native creatures learned to hide in the crevices
between pipes or in pools of industrial sludge instead of in the trees
or swamps. The oceans are covered in a thick layer of chemical scum
and the atmosphere's taint is such that the Floriani are obliged to
build floating air scrubbers that slowly swim through the clouds,
filtering out the worst pollutants. Some Barnai fear that Trossachs
is about to plunge over the edge of an environmental cliff, leading
to billions of deaths and the collapse of the Coreward third of the
Florian League. The Florians' lack of understanding of life sciences
and ecology means that they will need outside aid to avert this
impending catastrophe.

###### Allemagne C688000-0

The jungle world of Allemagne is a failed colony next to the Strend
Cluster. The planet was settled some years after the initial landing
on Strend. Fifty thousand colonists moved to Allemagne over the
course of a five-year colonization effort. The jungle world seemed
welcoming at first, rich in resources and bursting with vitality. The
colonists built a starport and a city that they named Burgundy.

Unfortunately, the initial survey of Allemagne was incomplete – a
species of lethal predator dwells in the deep jungles. These predators
swarmed Burgundy in 865, overwhelming the Strend defences and
devouring the population. Only a handful of ships escaped the
slaughter, carrying tales of two-meter tall lizard-like humanoids with
a natural camouflage ability and enough intelligence or mimicry to
use guns. Today, only the Allegmagne starport is detectable from
orbit – all the other buildings are covered in thick jungle.

The Strend have returned to Allemagne a dozen times since that
initial catastrophe. No troops sent into the jungle ever returned,
even the elite Champions equipped with Strend-made battle dress
and advanced augmentations. Orbital bombardment remains
an option, although any attack powerful enough to wipe out the
indigenous predators would also render the planet's land surface
uninhabitable by humans. The Strend government is researching
other ways to bring the natives of Allemagne to heel.

###### Sable des Etoiles B000899-D

The asteroid field here is used by Strend as a prison. Criminals
from Strend are sent to mine the asteroid field. The prisoners are
given special belter vessels with severely limited power and oxygen
reserves. If a prisoner fails to bring his weekly quota of ore back to
the warden's ship, then the prisoner does not get a fresh oxygen
ration.

###### Strend B436ADA-F

The capital of the Strend Cluster is a beautiful world – from a distance.
Glittering cities float on shimmering grav fields; ornamental gardens
the size of continents stretch to the horizon, irrigated by canals of
marble and steel. It is an art deco wonderland; it is engineering and
science combined in tribute to thousands of years of [[Terra|Terran]] culture.
Many of the buildings are copies of famous structures from Earth,
rebuilt using Strend technology and vision. The _Tower Strend_ is a
space elevator two hundred kilometers tall that is a precise scale
model of the old Eiffel tower on Earth.

Unfortunately, the people of Strend are treated as little more than
mobile adjuncts to these wonderful cities. Genetic and cybernetic
engineering are commonplace – a child might be assigned his future
role at birth and then physically optimized for that purpose. Strend
cybernetics are both highly advanced and surprisingly beautiful,
resembling sculptures more than prosthetics but aesthetics cannot
excuse the crippling lack of freedom on Strend.

There is an underclass of unaugmented on Strend; _les miserables_. These
unfortunates are restricted to the sublevels of the floating cities and
to a few slums on the surface. Many are shipped offworld to labour
in the colonies of Sable, Pacques or Marseilles. Why the government
tolerates the existence of this underclass is a mystery but there are

many mysteries about the leaders of Strend. They are said to be the
original command crew of Lucien Strend's flagship, the Chevalier , who
have extended their lives unnaturally using advanced cybernetics. They
are referred to as les Mechanisms.

The Chevalier remains in orbit around Strend, where it forms the
core of the orbital Bastille station, the home of the not inconsiderable
Strend navy. The Bastille would be a tough nut to crack, even for
an Imperial assault squadron. It is equipped with TL15 weapons,
including spinal meson cannons of tremendous power.

###### Fomalhaut B510200-D

The surface of this dry, lifeless world is criss-crossed by thousands of
kilometers of artificial trenches. These trenches are all approximately
six meters deep and ten meters wide and made of polished stone
with a mirrored base. They form bizarre geometric patterns on the
surface; most of these patterns can only be appreciated from orbit.
Over 90% of the trenches are buried beneath layers of dust or have
been destroyed by asteroid impacts over millennia. The IISS dates
the trenches to approximately 100,000 years ago.

The only inhabitants of Fomalhaut are the devotees of an odd cult
who believe the trenches are a communication from God and that
their duty is to clear the blocked trenches and rebuild the damaged
ones. When the face of Fomalhaut is clear once more and the light
of the star is reflected from the canals, only then will the message
from the divine become clear. The cult members have temporarily
roofed over a network of tunnels in the southern polar region and
are using that as a base as they painstakingly restore the ancient
structures. At their present speed, it will take them thousands of
years to accomplish their goals, so the cult has sent out missionaries
to find more converts and to purchase robotic labour.

#### EGYRN

Except for the extreme coreward end, Egyrn subsector is largely
unknown to the public – most Navy and Scout data on this area is
classified. The sector was mostly first settled during the Ramshackle
Empire era (circa 1700 PI) and has since regressed to isolated low-
tech societies. The mid and rimward areas are part of the Outrim
Void. The subsector name preserves the original title of Ashley's
Rock. Sir Gildemar Tomas Ashley was a staunch supporter of the
Solomani faction who settled this world after the Solomani Rim War
(990-1002).

Most of the data that is available on the subsector is due to another
famous character, Bennett Lai da Santos, a gentleman-explorer
and rumored rogue of the mercantile persuasion. Regrettably, da
Santos' good reputation was abused by a writer, who published
a volume of entirely fradulent library data under his name. This
infamous document, _The Adventures of Bennet Lai da Santos_ , has
wormed its way into the databases of many ships. Travellers
are advised to disregard any library data that refers to solid gold
asteroids, planets inhabited by people who have no heads, planets
inhabited by brain-eating zombies or any battle tactics that involve
leaping into the barrel of a meson gun at precisely the right moment
to be teleported onto the enemy vessel and cutting it in two with
one's cutlass.

Of course, high tales of adventure and swashbuckling are preferable
to the truth of Egryn. The sector is a low-tech wasteland of regressed
colonies and barbarians. The Twilight still enfolds these worlds, even
after a thousand years. There are a few worlds with viable starports,
mostly along the Imperial border but there is precious little other
civilization worthy of the name.

The only local power in Egryn is a minor polity called the Belgardian
Sojournate. The small population of Belgard have limited interstellar
travel and have claimed several surrounding planets, although their
claim stands only because no other power has bothered challenging
them. The Sojournate's technology is barely capable of getting them
from one world to another, let alone mounting a defence of their
little empire.

###### Walei E7B4776-5

The world of Walei is unrelentingly hostile towards human life. The
atmosphere is poisonous and corrosive. Acid rain storms lash the
rocky, lifeless landscape and the temperature is nearly 90° at night
and much, much hotter during the day.

Still, a colony of some twenty million people thrives here. The world
was initially settled in the hope that it could be terraformed for easier
access to its mineral resources. The terraforming effort failed but
the industrious workers expanded the underground terraforming
base. Today, Walei's population dwell in thousands of kilometers
of buried tunnels. These are not mere shelters but beautiful wide
avenues between vast open caverns.

Strong magnetic fields in the tunnels play havoc with electronic
devices on Walei, so the population were forced to virtually abandon

electricity except in its most basic form. They have a few heavily
shielded computers for specialized purposes but have instead
turned to clockwork, steam power and other older technologies.
While Walei is listed as TL5, the inhabitants are capable of producing
TL7 or even TL8 devices that do not use electricity, including basic
computers. Waleian clockworks are obviously heavier and bulkier
than conventional equivalents but are works of art as well as being
perfectly functional.

###### Pa'an E649333-4

Pa'an's small population are the descendants of a long-range
Zhodani expedition that misjumped and was forced to settle on this
world. The lack of dry land on Pa'an limited their population growth
and they were unable to maintain their technological base. Today,
the people of Pa'an have only basic industrial techniques and have
little interest in advanced technologies.

Each island in the archipelago is ruled by a psionic noble family, that
keep the serfs in line using telepathic manipulation and clairvoyance.
Without technological distractions, the nobles of Pa'an have honed
their telepathic powers to a high level. The Zhodani speculate that
there may be an environmental factor on Pa'an that enhances
human psionic potential. Unusually, the psionic powers invariably
breed true – the child of two psionically gifted individuals is always
psionic. War is unknown, as the nobles can psionically suppress
violent thoughts or cause amnesia. Disputes between islands are
resolved by psychic duels. The only weapons on Pa'an are those
used for hunting.

Most offworld travellers are not welcome on Pa'an. Peaceful visitors
have their memories erased and they are sent on their way; violent
invaders are telepathically manipulated into fighting each other.

The Zhodani Consulate recontacted Pa'an some four hundred
years ago. The Pa'an nobles still considered themselves Zhodani
and welcomed their long-lost cousins. The Consulate visitors were
impressed by the nobles' psionic skills and set up a base to study
mental powers on Pa'an. Occasionally, a Pa'an prince will even
leave home and travel to the Consulate to study or serve in the
government there.

###### Belgard D371321-9

The name of this planet is probably a corruption of Beauregard,
which was the name of an infamous admiral who fled the Empire
during the Civil Wars, accompanied by a flotilla of ships. The fate of
Beauregard was a mystery for many years until the Sojournate was
discovered.

The lone settlement on Belgard is the city of Sojourn, located high
in the mountains. Sojourn is the site of the spaceport and the
home base of the Belgardian fleet, which is made up of ancient and
increasingly balky Imperial escorts and small military craft, none
displacing more than two thousand tons. The Belgardians do not
have the technology or the trained crew to maintain their fleet; the
skies above Sojourn are dotted with floating hulks and mothballed
or cannibalised warships. Their effective TL is 6 in most areas; TL9
refers to their spacefaring technology.

Menorial

The Belgardians believe that other starfaring humans are invariably
hostile and attack any vessels that enter their space. They have
conquered several neighboring worlds to loot them for resources
and occasionally press-ganged crew members.

The Sojournate government keeps the population in line through a
combination of xenophobic propaganda about an always-impending
Imperial invasion and a religious cult revolving around a 'sojourn' to
a promised land. As soon as possible, promise the rulers, the flotilla
will continue on its way to its ultimate destination, as laid down by
the Admiral all those centuries ago. Dissent against the government
is punishable by spacing.

###### Nabeth D326579-8

Nabeth is the most civilised system in the sector and is therefore
the de facto capital, at least as far as the Imperium is concerned.
The planet's population is restricted to a ring of spaceborne habitats
and hollowed-out asteroids that have been moved into stable orbits
around the little world. Each satellite is an independent 'state',
some of which have a population of only a few dozen. Many of these
satellites are so close together that the Nabethi have developed the
practise of physically leaping from one to another – most Nabethi

have a vacc suit and an 'orbit checker' that precisely calculates the
angle and force needed to hop to the next nearest satellite. Some of
these hops take hours to complete, leaving the spacewalker floating
in the void as he waits for his destination to approach him.

The Nabethi have a reputation as excellent if unscrupulous traders
and the bazaars of Nabeth are a good place to go for rumors or
to pick up curious artefacts from elsewhere in the Trojan Reach.
Visitors are warned to stay clear of Nabethi alcohol, which is
traditionally served in zero-gravity, a practise that causes digestive
chaos for those unused to it.

There is an Imperial scout base located in this system; the Nabethi
agreed to let the Imperium establish the facility here and to share
their knowledge of the Reach in exchange for the technology and
vitally needed supplies to maintain their orbital habitats.

As an Imperial client state, visitors from the Imperium are permitted
to jump from Motmos in District 268 to Nabeth but are prohibited
from travelling onwards. There are numerous Nabethi satellites that
specialize in arranging temporary flags-of-convenience, allowing a
trader to travel on into the Outrim Void without breaking Imperial
law.

#### PAX RULIN

More than half the worlds of this subsector are ruled by the
Imperium. Pax Rulin sector is dominated by a string of naval bases
and military outposts, a bulwark against aggression from the
Aslan or the barbarian cultures of the Trojan Reach. Despite the
sheer number of Imperial worlds and client states, the subsector is
administered from Glisten – Pax Rulin itself is the largest and oldest
naval base, although the world of Perrior is growing in importance
and has launched a bid to be named the new subsector capital.

Several of the inhabited worlds in this sector were originally settled
by Vilani explorers but all those colonies save Caraz died out. There
appears to be no single cause of these mass extinctions – the old
colony on Kydde died of plague, Islent of starvation, Doradon due to
solar flares and so on. Later explorers looking for worlds to colonize
were able to reclaim the now-empty Vilani colonies, although after
several hundred years, little trace remained of the Vilani on some
planets.

The Senlis Foederate is a small polity of three Solomani-settled
worlds which survived the Twilight relatively well by the standards
of the Trojan Reach. They retained comparatively high technology,
especially at the capital of Senlis and are capable of defending their
space against raiders. Foederate relations with the Imperium are
strained due to 'an alarmingly militant build-up of Imperial naval
assets along our mutual border' – in short, the Foederate has no
conception of the sheer size and power of the Imperium and self-
consciously believes that the vast Imperial fleet stationed at Pax Rulin
is there because of them. The Foederate was highly expansionist
until the Imperium established a presence in the sector – Bantral
was their next target until it obtained Imperial protection.

###### Berengaria B566644-7

The world of Berengaria is one of the more stable words in the Outrim
Void. It is an Earth-like world and was the recipient of significant
terraforming and engineering to bring it to its current state. The
planet's soil was enriched with phosphorous and other fertilisers.
Mountains were levelled to alter the weather patterns, ensuring
regular rainfall and lengthening the growing season. Silicon-bearing
asteroids were spun into solar mirrors and parasols, reflecting
extra sunlight onto the surface. By the time the terraformers were
finished, the world's agricultural potential was three times what it
had been.

The primary purpose of this epic feat of geo-engineering was to
create a highly productive agricultural world to supply the chain of
military bases along Pax Rulin but it was also a showcase for what
could be accomplished elsewhere in the Trojan Reach. The General
Development Corporation aided in the engineering of the world, one
of the few successful co-operative ventures between the Imperium
and its erstwhile agency.

While Berengaria's native technology is only TL7, the colony's basic
infrastructure was built at a much higher level. Every community has
high-speed holographic communications links to central computer
nodes (which also model the planetary weather patterns and adjust

the solar mirrors to compensate); the elected representatives of
each community meet in a virtual parliament.

Berengaria is considered a naval asset, as most of its food exports
go towards supplying the chain of bases along the border. The
navy has a permanent seat in the parliament and has occasionally
intervened to ensure that food supplies are not disrupted. This
outside interference rankles with the 'agricultural engineers' of
Berengaria and they have protested to both Pax Rulin and Glisten,
asking for outside arbitration.

###### Senlis B671633-A

Senlis is a dry world; the only body of water on the surface is the
Great Lake, an expanse of brackish, tainted water. The population
of Senlis dwell along great artificial canals that surround the Great
Lake. There are nine of these canal networks and at the head of each
canal network is a huge water-purification plant. The rulers of Senlis
control the water-purification plants and social status is defined by the
freshness of one's water. Higher-class citizens live further upriver.

Some three hundred years ago, the rulers of Senlis began experimenting
with adding drugs to the water supply. Initially, these drugs were
added to combat diseases and improve the general health of the
population but following a period of political upheaval and dissent,
the fearful rulers began using the drugs to sedate or manipulate their
emotions. When the Foederate goes to war, stimulants are used to
drive military recruitment and aggression; when the Foederate suffers
a downturn, then sedatives and appetite suppressants are pumped
into the only water sources on the whole planet. Different canal
networks have different drug mixes. On Senlis, politics is another
word for this narcotic and hydraulic despotism.

Beyond the canals, the landscape of Senlis is harsh and arid. Over 70%
of the planet is utterly uninhabitable without significant technological
aid. There are a few hardy hermits living in the wilderness. These
outcasts are free of the drugs that enslave the rest of the population
and are considered criminals by the Senlis government.

Of the other two worlds in the Foederate, Orsasch is equally dry
and the same system is used there. The recently conquered world
of Magen though, has enough surface water for the population to
escape the drugs and so Magen's population is considerably less
subservient. So far, Senlis has been able to keep the younger world
in line with the threat of force but opposition parties on Magen
continue to support leaving the Foederate and applying for Imperial
membership or at least protection from their former allies.

###### Pax Rulin A402231-E

The Pax Rulin naval base is the lynchpin of Imperial naval power
in this subsector. While only a few hundred people call the base
their permanent home, there are usually a dozen or more capital
ships in-system, along with hundreds of smaller craft. Pax Rulin
has no shipyard – construction facilities are at Perrior – but it is a
naval depot of great importance. It is designated a fortress world

+ in the event of a full-scale invasion of the sector Pax Rulin has the
stockpiled supplies and firepower to hold

out against almost any attacker and would provide a rallying point
for Imperial ships until a larger fleet could be mustered in the
Spinward Marches to relieve the invaded worlds.

Pax Rulin was founded early in the Third Imperium's history and the system
acquired an almost legendary reputation among those who remembered
the great Imperial navies of the past. Warships have been known to make
pilgrimages just to dock at the ancient and sacred asteroids of Pax Rulin.

Civilian traffic to Pax Rulin is discouraged. Warnings are broadcast
in all neighboring worlds, informing travellers that they may only
jump into specific regions within the Pax Rulin system. Jump traffic
outside these zones is treated as an incoming attacking force and
will be met with immediate hostility.

###### Caraz E111959-A

Caraz was never intended to be home to more than two billion
people. The rocky outpost was originally built as a refuelling station,
cracking water-ice into hydrogen fuel for the flood of Vilani ships
fleeing the Vargr wars of the –2100s. As the Vilani colonies in
Pax Rulin dwindled and died, Caraz saw fewer and fewer visitors.
Eventually, the ships stopped coming altogether, leaving a thousand
ice miners and their families alone in the dark.

The Caraz system had no lanthanum reserves and could not build
its own jump-capable ships. They did what they could, though.
They hollowed out most of Caraz Rock and built cities on the inside
of the hollow world; they ground asteroids to dust and developed
microorganisms from scratch to transform the regolith into fertile
soil. With resources so limited, everything in Caraz had to be carefully
measured and accounted. Economics, politics and religion are all the
same thing in Caraz Rock – every object and person has a precisely
calculated value and anything that costs more than it produces is
eliminated and recycled – including those people who fail to make a
net contribution to the Carazian economy. The rulers of Caraz are the
all-powerful Actuaries who decide on the worth of things.

Membership in the Imperium and the recovery of jump drive tech
means that Caraz no longer needs to conserve resources quite so
brutally, but an obsession with efficiency is ingrained into their
culture.

An Imperial naval base has been established at Caraz and a new
starport is under construction. Caraz will be upgraded to Class-A
status within ten years, assuming all goes well.

#### GAZULIN

Gazulin subsector would like to forget that it is part of the Trojan
Reach. It has been part of the Third Imperium for hundreds of years
and considers itself much more civilised than the barbarians of the
Outrim Void. The Gazulin worlds pride themselves on their cultural
and technological sophistication and over the last three centuries
the region has undergone a prolonged economic boom, further
emphasising the divide between it and the rest of the sector. It has
strong ties to Tobia subsector and is often treated as an adjunct or
even suburb of Tobia.

The primary x-boat route goes through Tobia subsector and from
there off to Vestia; this circuitous route means that it takes months
for news to reach Gazulin from the Spinward Marches, as the Vestia
route heads back along Deneb sector to the core worlds. There is a
secondary x-boat network via Bleak, primarily maintained not by the
courier service but by the navy but there is still comparatively little
traffic between Gazulin and Pax Rulin. According to stereotypes along
the border, Pax Rulin are all militaristic marionettes, while the Gazulin
are effete buffoons who have no idea how close they live to danger.

Politically, Gazulin is balanced between the 'Junction bloc' in the
center of the subsector and the Gazulin/Mirage pair. Junction is
actually a minor member of the bloc but sits in the middle of a knot
of rich industrial or agricultural worlds, making it a vitally important
trade hub. Old Gazulin tries to retain its pre-eminence in the sector
by controlling trade from Tobia and by emphasising its cultural
influence, but the nexus of power in the subsector slips coreward
with each passing generation. Mirage, once a vibrant world, has
slipped into drug-fuelled decadence and can no longer help Gazulin
cling to fading glories.

###### O'Keefe D879625-7

While the official name of this planet is O'Keefe, after the Solomani
explorer who first discovered it, millennia of linguistic drift has lead
to the mangled pronunciation Ochkeefee. This world is mostly bog

+ sea levels rose several meters in the past and are slowly receding,
leaving behind thousands of square kilometers of stagnant, muddy,
worm-ridden bog land. Structures are built on tall stilts and the
natives navigate the myriad shallow streams on flat-bottomed boats
and rafts. There are few large cities on the planet; the largest is the
aptly named Stiltown, surrounding the small spaceport.

The fens of O'Keefe produce some useful fungi and a sweet-smelling
moss that is used in luxury cosmetics. These items are gathered by
the poor inhabitants and dried in long smokehouses before being
sold through Stiltown. The chief threat to both this industry and the
fensmen are the worms of O'Keefe, which grow up to six meters
long and sometimes attack humans. The worms feed primarily on
fungi but also instinctively kill animals to provide the rotting corpses
that the fungal spores grow on.

###### Susanawo D68A430-5

The storms of Susanawo are legendary. A combination of massive
ongoing volcanic activity throwing dust and heat into the air, and the

planet's eccentric orbit, has created the sort of megastorm travellers
normally associate with gas giants. The Great Storm covers a fifth
of the planet's surface and has circled the globe once every four
months for the last two centuries and is expected to last for another
three at least. Lesser storms, apocalyptic by the standards of other
worlds, are common in most regions. The ecosystem has collapsed
in the face of this chaos, with extinctions across all native lifeform
groups running at more than 95%.

A small outpost was established on Susanawo, with the intention
of using the volcanoes as natural smelters and chemical factories.
The outpost was equipped with a stockpile of atomic mines, to shape
tectonic activity and powerful drill robots to create lava channels. The
vicious storms made it impossible for cargo ships or flyers to land
regularly and the colony collapsed. A few thousand people now live in
tunnels and caves, hiding from the winds that are strong enough to
tear a man's skin from his bones with thirty seconds of exposure.

The neighboring world of Mirage recently began using Susanawo
as a prison colony, dispatching political prisoners using one-way
drop shuttles. This punishment is reserved for the worst prisoners.

###### 627-301 E000120-A

This highly restricted system is a mystery to the Imperium. The
gravitational center of 627-301 is not the main star; it is a tiny black hole
that the sun orbits around. The research station orbits a gas giant that
orbits the star. Computer projections show that this arrangement is not
stable and that the star will be destroyed within half a million years. The
black hole is believed by some to be artificial but others theorize that the
singularity 'collected' the system as it travelled through space.

###### Neumann B876AA9-D

The Neumann system was settled by the [[Terra|Terran]]s, specifically by a
transhumanist sect who believed in the extensive use of cybernetics,
nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. The colony developed rapidly;
self-replicating robots transformed the world's surface into shining
cities and all-knowing machine minds guided development. Citizens of
Neumann were altered and upgraded and Neumann rose to Technology
Level F, verging on TL G. For a brief time, it seemed as though Solomani
ingenuity had finally triumphed over Vilani conservatism and that
humanity was about to make a great leap forward.

The disaster that then struck Neumann was not as dramatic as the
Maghiz that ruined the Darrian civilization but is was just as devastating.
A self-replicating swarm or 'grey goo' was released – by accident or
design, no one knows – and within days it had devoured much of the
Neumann civilization. More than three quarters of the population was
transformed into featureless, formless goo, their bodies pulled apart
molecule by molecule and remade into more of the swarm. City after
city was swallowed by the encroaching tide of destruction.

A few isolated research laboratories managed to stall the growth of
the swarm by releasing even more self-replicating swarms. The new
swarms were programmed to demolish the old swarms but replicated
themselves at a much slower rate. The tide of destruction stopped and
the few survivors began to rebuild as best they could. Much of their

technology had been lost and a new religious cult – the Shield
Church – took over the rule of the planet following the suicide of the
AIs who had controlled Neumann.

Today, Neumann is but a shadow of its former self but is still an
incredibly productive industrial planet. More than a third of the
surface is 'swarm zone', where different evolving breeds of nanotech
fight. Visits to the swarm zone are illegal without Shield Church
permission but daredevils have been known to try flying or even
driving across the warped and shifting zone of chaos. Few survive
and none survive unchanged. There are sometimes outbreaks of
swarmers even in settled areas – a building and everything in it

might suddenly sag and melt but the Shield Church's nanotamers
know the correct formulations and combinations to contain any
infestation. Visitors are advised to report any stains or moulds
discovered immediately, as they could be the leading edge of a
hegemonising swarm outbreak.

The Shield Church, led by the Immortal Protector (a semi-mythic
figure who is said to reincarnate into every new generation) is the
absolute master of the planet. The cult's primary goal is to hold back
the swarmers, which they do with their own swarms and with the
cleansing power of plasma fire. The Church also strictly controls
technology on Neumann, ensuring that no new technological
development threatens the world.

#### YGGDRASIL

The name 'Yggdrasil' only appears on old charts, such as those used
by the IISS. Most natives of the Trojan Reach refer to this subsector
by its common name of Floria Sector, for this region is the seat of
the Florian League. The Floriani were slow to start expanding, as
they only obtained jump technology from a crashed Aslan ship in
–225, by which time much of the sector had been explored, claimed
and then abandoned by the Sindalian Empire.

The Terra-derived Sindalian names for most of the worlds were
retained, hence the slew of planets named after figures from Norse
mythology. The desert world of Yggdrasil was the Sindalian capital
of the sector and when the Imperium made contact with the Floriani
in the 200s, Yggdrasil was returned to its former importance as the
primary trade gateway into Florian space.

Most of the inhabited worlds in this subsector are part of the Florian
Main, a Jump-1 chain of systems reaching from Ewoiftoil/Nora'a all
the way to Dpres and Connaught in Dpres subsector. Travel along
the Main is restricted by the Floriani – vessels should register with
the League at Yggdrasil or Kabal/Nora'a before jumping along the
Main. Ostensibly, this is to prevent piracy, which is an increasing
problem because of Aslan raiders, but the true purpose of this policy
is to maintain the privacy of the Florian race.

###### Floria A467942-F

Floria is one of the wonders of the Trojan Reach and attracts tens
of thousands of researchers and tourists every year. The Floria

discovered several Ancient installations that were still largely intact
and have preserved these ancient technological wonders for display.
Travellers gasp in awe at the Seven Towers and ponder silently the
primordial mysteries of the Well of Lights.

All the way through a visit to Floria, the traveller is aware of the
constant, unobtrusive presence of Barnai administrators and their
Feskal servants. If a tourist lingers too long in one section, the Barnai
politely suggest he move along to the next designated viewing area.
A traveller who tries to step outside the strictly prescribed route is
gently herded back to the tourist zones by a hulking Feskal. Visiting
Floria is an awe-inspiring experience but a curiously hollow one.
You are left with the feeling that you never saw the real plane; that
you have missed something.

That is exactly what happened. From the Starport of Welcomes to
the approved 'safe' tourist zones to the carefully sanitised Ancient
sites, the whole experience is designed to ensure that visitors do not
see the real Floria. This planet does not contain a 'few' Ancient relics

+ the whole of Floria's capital city is one vast Ancient structure. The
Florian researchers may 'only' be able to replicate TL15 devices using
the Ancient manufacturing complexes and matter synthesisers but
there are far more potent machines still functioning in the depths
of the city. A teleport grid connects different regions of the city,
allowing an individual to step across ten thousand kilometers as
easily as he walks across the room. Reactors draw power directly
from the fabric of the universe, powering cyclopean machines
that the Florians tend but do not understand. An Ancient warship
+ sentient and awesomely powerful – slumbers in a dock a hundred
kilometers below the surface. It is from this vessel, not any crashed
Aslan scout, that the Florians learned the secrets of Jump.

Here, too, are the clone vats where new Floriani are produced,
generation after generation formed from an organic soup and
carefully spun lattices of synthetic neural fibre. It took the Floriani
300,000 years to uncover a fraction of the secrets of this Ancient
city and they know that they have barely begun the work they were
made to do. If the other races – Humaniti in any of its myriad forms
or worse, the rapacious Vargr or the militant Aslan – found the truth
of Floria, then they would try to take it, to conquer it and rip out the
Ancient machines without understanding or reverence. The secret
of Floria must be preserved at all costs, even the death of every
Floriani and the destruction of all their colony worlds.

After all, they are only machines.

###### Vorn B611640-9

Most worlds in the Florian League have a surprisingly low law level.
They do not need law enforcement, as the rate of criminal behaviour
among the Floriani is much lower than among other humans. The
only breaches of the law on, say, the high-population world of Garnl
are caused by visitors. On almost every Florian world, the instinctive

caste system of the race where Barnai supervisors and thinkers
guide obedient Feskal labourers holds sway.

Vorn is different. Something on this icy, inhospitable rockball interferes
with the caste system. The Florian League settled Vorn in 102 but the
settlement fell apart within a few weeks as the Feskals rose up and
brutally slaughtered their Barnai. The Florians dispatched a military
force to pacify the rebels but as any Floriani military force uses Feskal
infantry, all this accomplished was handing the rebels a lot of heavily
armed troops.

Today, Vorn is an embarrassment to the League. They have to
maintain the B-class Highport in orbit, as Vorn sits at the junction
of a key jump-2 trade route and a jump-4 Florian x-boat route.
However, travel to the surface is forbidden, as the surface is an
icy wilderness where savage Feskal overlords rule feral tribes and
intruders are hunted down and murdered or enslaved. They torment
Barnai for sport in their underground lairs.

Although the Barnai do not dare send further expeditions down to
Vorn's surface, they do feel an instinctive responsibility towards the
deviant Feskals. Supplies are dropped from orbit on a regular basis
and they have occasionally employed outsiders to travel down to the
ice world and investigate current conditions. Some environmental
factor – a bacterium, a fungus, some quirk of radiation or perhaps even
some Ancient device buried in the ice – has caused Florian society to
fall apart on this one world and the cause must be found. Some Barnai
privately speculate that Vorn was created by the Ancients as a test for
the race, that it is a puzzle that can only be solved by the Barnai doing
the work themselves, instead of relying on Feskal muscle.

###### Yggdrasil B3507CD-8

The ruler of Yggdrasil, the Golden Queen, still styles herself Empress
of Sindal in Exile and Absolute Despot of the Stars, in addition to

more reasonable titles such as Supreme Goddess Incarnate and
the Mother of Water. When the Sindalian Empire fell, one of the
rulers fled to Yggdrasil and started the current royal line. For a long
time, titles were all that the rulers of Yggdrasil had – the planet is a
waterless desert, barely habitable at the poles, where fast-dwindling
ice caps provide some water for the famished population.

In Norse myth, Yggdrasil was the world ash, a magic tree that
supported the world. The World Ash of Yggdrasil is a space elevator:
six thousand kilometers of carbon nanotube and glassteel that rises
from a mountain on the equator into orbit. The royal family have
their celestial palace on the counterweight atop the elevator. During
the Sindalian Empire days, this space elevator and associated
highport made Yggdrasil a trade nexus and brought in vast wealth,
but few ships visited Yggdrasil for a thousand years.

The Imperium made contact with Yggdrasil in 151, during an Imperial
attempt to find a route across the Great Rift but this contact was
fleeting and unimportant. The real recontact came two generations
later, after the Imperium had encountered the fast-expanding
Floriani. The Florians refused to join the Imperium but were willing
to entertain trade links. Yggdrasil, with its space elevator and high-
capacity (if somewhat decayed) starport was the ideal place to
establish a trading post.

While the population of Yggdrasil are strong supporters of
this interstellar trade, the royal family of Yggdrasil have grown
increasingly disenchanted with the arrangement. They receive
far less tax revenue than they anticipated, thanks to the use of
flags of convenience by many traders passing through the Reach;
furthermore, the distant Imperial court does not pay them the
respect they are due – are they not cousin Emperors of like rank,
and so why is Yggdrasil treated as an obscure border world in the
middle of a moribund sector of space?

#### DPRES

Dpres subsector is an anarchic wasteland. There are a few lightly
populated worlds but there are no multi-world confederations or
interstellar governments. The coreward end of the sector is dominated
by the Trojan Bight, a starless region of space (the term 'Outrim Void'
is also applied to the Bight as well as to the coreward subsectors of
the Trojan Reach as a whole). The Bight is a near-impassable region,
devoid not only of settled worlds but of stars. The native race of Tktk
tell legends of a time when warring gods 'put out the eyes of night' and
fringe scientists have speculated about an Ancient weapon capable of
snuffing out a star, and that there might be frozen planets in the Bight
that were lost when their star was destroyed.

There are three Imperial client states in Dpres – Gabriel and Dostoevsky both
contain research centres, while Dpres itself is an outpost of the Imperium
placed to defend shipping and to civilise the subsector. The Gabriel facility
specializes in genetic engineering, while Dostoevsky's researchers are
exploring an underwater site believed to be of Ancient origin. The government
of Dostoevsky are divided on how to deal with the Imperium and the world's
long-term status as a client is very much in doubt.

291-540 is an automated starport built to support trade links with the
Florian League (291-540's Red travel code refers to the world below,
not the starport). The world of Tktk is shared between human colonists
and a native non-human species, also called the Tktk. These creatures
resemble Chirpers and may be a genetically engineered variant of that
race. The Tktk are unlikely to have evolved on this small worldlet but
human scientists have failed to find the Tktk's world of origin. The
IISS is considering mounting an expedition to Tktk and declaring the
world a Red zone to safeguard the primitives' culture.

Outside these small Imperial enclaves, the rest of the sector is in a
state of near-chaos. The chain of worlds from Janus to Acis – officially
the Sindalian Main but also known as the Dustbelt – has been the site
of hundreds of minor wars over the last few centuries. These conflicts
began when expansionists took hold of Tyr and invaded neighboring
worlds. At the height of their power, the Tyrian Lordships held the
entirety of the Dustbelt, as well as Dpres, Connaught and Solaria but
then exiles from Acis brought in Aslan mercenaries from the Glorious
Empire. The Tyrian Lordships ended in a bloodbath but the ensuing
wars continue to this day.

Janus and Sagan in particular have suffered horribly from these
conflicts; Janus was nearly depopulated by raiders from Tyr. Currently,
Tyr and Acis are the two dominant worlds among these warring states,
although the balance of power is being maintained by agents from the
Thalassans, covertly supporting one side or the other.

###### Dpres B631689-A

Dpres is the oldest inhabited world in the subsector and was the capital
during the fading days of the Second Imperium and the Sindalian
Empire. Since those days, Dpres has suffered terribly. The planet
slipped into a minor ice age, sending glaciers rolling down over the
once-fertile southern plains and freezing the harbours. The elected
government collapsed, taking the electoral system with it, leaving the
planet under the control of an unelected bureaucracy dedicated to
perpetuating the status quo. Without an effective government, many of

Dpres' naval admirals fled the world. Torrance, Delta Thega and Caldos
were all settled by unofficial expeditions from Dpres.

Through it all, the people of Dpres never lost their pride and tried
to maintain their reputation as a bastion of civilization and culture
amid chaos. It was especially humiliating, therefore, when Dpres was
conquered by invaders from Tyr. The Tyrians held Dpres for over two
centuries, during the period known as the Tyrian Lordships. During this
time, many of the monuments and art of Dpres, including artefacts
from Terra were stolen and brought back to Tyr, where they decorate
the palace of the Tyrant of Tyr to this day. The occupation was ended
when Acis deployed Aslan mercenaries against the Tyrians, forcing Tyr
to pull its ships back from Dpres to defend worlds closer to home.

Fearing another occupation by Tyr, Acis or even the Glorious Empire, the
Dpres Continuity Government searched around for allies and eventually
negotiated client state status with the Imperium via Gazulin subsector.
The coming of the Imperium and the establishment of a small naval
base at Dpres was welcomed and seemed to herald a rebirth of Dpres'
supremacy over the rest of the subsector. So far, though, Imperial policy
has centered around protecting trade routes with the Floriani and keeping
the Glorious Empire and other Aslan clans in check, not building a new
confederacy ruled from Dpres.

###### Torrance E360256-4

Two hundred years ago, Torrance's star entered a period of intense flare
activity. Plumes of flame licked out, incinerating the closest world and
searing the world of Torrance. The oceans boiled – not quite literally but
rising temperatures and radiation wiped out most life forms, including
a species of algae native to Torrance. The rotting remains of the algae
poisoned the seas, leaving the planet's water undrinkable without
extensive processing. Electromagnetic interference ruined the planet's
technological base, destroying their computers and plunging them
back into a virtually pre-industrial state.

Other worlds have investigated Torrance and found no survivors.
According to most travellers, Torrance is a dead world (and is noted
on many charts as 'Peroi', a Sindalian word meaning 'Lost').

Into this chaos came a man now known as Righteous John, who
rallied the survivors and led them into underground shelters
from the roaring fury of the sun. John is now the absolute ruler of
Torrance as he fights to keep as many people alive as possible. He
has a still-working spacecraft, an old scout ship from Dpres and
plans to launch it to seek out help from other worlds. The solar
activity is still so intense that the chances of a ship making it to the
hundred-diameter jump limit without suffering severe damage to its
sensors are slim but without aid from offworld, Righteous John and
his followers will be dead within a year.

###### Tlazolteotl D5409CD-7

This world was named Burgundy when initially colonized. Most of the
colonists were [[Terra|Terran]]s from various European and Asian countries, as
well as humans from second-generation worlds like Mars or the Centauri
colonies. There were also a few special-interest groups of a few hundred
people each who bought space on the colony ships – fringe religions fleeing
persecution, obscure subcultures looking for space to grow, explorers and

adventures and other splinter factions who thought that a new life out
on the frontier was preferable to live back in the Rule of Man.

One of these groups was an almost-forgotten band of a few dozen
settlers originally from Central America on Terra, who were devotees
of the vanished Aztec culture. They intended to build a community
modelled on the Aztecs in the jungles of Burgundy and vanished
into the thickly forested wilderness of the western continent.

The colony thrived for hundreds of years and was part of the Sindalian
Empire until its fall. Then, around fifteen hundred years ago, Burgundy
was hit by a double catastrophe. Pro- and anti- Sindalian factions within
the Burgundy government went to war and the war quickly went nuclear.
Roughly simultaneously, the Burgundy star entered a flare period,
scrambling computer systems and causing massive desertification. The
planet collapsed into anarchy and the people were open to any authority
that could bring order and peace, no matter how strange or cruel.

From out of the jungle came the descendants of the neo-Aztecs.
Their population had grown hugely and they were much more adept
at using low-technology weapons than the other factions. Within a
generation, they were able to pacify the war-torn world and establish
a new order on Burgundy, then renamed Tlazolteotl.

Today, Tlazolteotl is a major exporter of low-technology industrial
goods to all the worlds of the Sindalian Main. Aztec-inspired culture
and art is everywhere – the factories that rise out of the desert sands are
more like temples than industrial facilities, stepped pyramids decorated
with coiling dragons and leering warriors. Human sacrifice is practised
extensively and the government is in the hands of the priest caste. The
average citizen of Tlazolteotl knows nothing about the larger universe
(history books and educational texts were purged generations ago) and
believes that the universe is full of space devils and demons who the
priests ward off with their magic. Visitors to Tlazolteotl are advised to
land only at the starport/temple – landing elsewhere on the planet is
likely to result in bloody murder at the hands of an ignorant mob.

###### Thalassa B88A889-8

The oceans of Thalassa cover the entire planet – the only dry land is an
artificial island bearing the planet's spaceport and a few tiny islands too
small to support any sort of civilization. The Thalassan cities are built on

huge floating platforms of woven reeds, some of which are more than
twenty kilometers across and support hundreds of thousands of citizens.
Thalassan technology is almost entirely organic – the waterworld is rich
in life and the Thalassans have learned to use the alien biosphere to
support their agriculture and industry.

One of the chief Thalassan industries is snail farming. The sea-snails of
Thalassa have been bred for size and strength and now grow up to six
meters in length. Their shells are water-tight and strong as light steel and the
Thalassans have developed organic compounds allowing them to cut and
bond the shell material much as other cultures cut or weld metal. Various
forms of seaweed are cultivated for use as plastics, clothing, food or medicine.
There are a few resources that the Thalassans cannot obtain from their watery
world – they mine the asteroids and moons for vital metals and trade for other
items with other worlds. One key technology that the Thalassans obtained
from the world of Neumann was a genetic modification allowing humans to
breathe underwater. The amphibious families of Thalassa comprise a special
caste, respected but also feared by their fellows.

The Thalassan government is made up of a series of councils, each
overseeing a particular aspect of Thalassan society. Membership on
a council is given to those best suited to it – a Thalassan is elligible
for membership when an opening arises and is given a gruelling
series of exams and tests. Only the best and most suited serve on
the councils and even being accepted for testing is a huge honor.

The most important council is the Council of Cycles – as the cities
of Thalassa drift on the currents at different speeds and in different
directions, correctly calculating where each city will be and how it
should interact with its neighbors is vital. A city in the doldrums
might run low on food, so the Council of Cycles would arrange for
food to be transferred along a chain of cities to one which will soon
drift near the stranded community. The Council of Cycles effectively
specializes in using weather and the mechanics of currents to
optimize the planetary economy.

Their experience of anticipating and co-ordinating events has given
the Council of Cycles a talent for manipulation and subterfuge
that even a Hiver would envy. Thalassa will never be a military
power in this war-torn subsector but Thalassan 'envoys' and 'trade
representatives' have the ear of every ruler from Dpres to Acis.

#### SINDAL

The upper right corner of Sindal is held by the Imperium, with a
naval base at Realgar and trade routes out to Tobia subsector. That
section of the subsector is comparatively peaceful, in contrast to the
rest of Sindal.

The name comes from the Sindalian Empire, which ruled this sector
and those around it for a thousand years during the Long Night.
The Sindalians' authority was enforced with the fusion gun and the
atomic bomb and it was by the gun, the bomb and the engineered
germ that they were destroyed. Remnants of the Empire can be
found across the subsector – an automated beacon here, an ancient
tradition there, a once-magnificent starport or civic building on a
dying world – but the Sindalians have been gone for centuries. The
former Empire's seat was at Noricum but that world was blasted
back into the dark ages and has yet to recover. The Sindalian Empire
haunts this sector like a ghost.

The Sindalian Main (or Dustbelt) continues from Dpres subsector
into Sindal, terminating at old Noricum. Few of the worlds along
the Main are worth conquering, although raiders from Tyr, Acis or
the Glorious Empire are not an uncommon sight in those systems.
Rimward, a traveller will encounter the Oghman Clans, a barbaric
culture who have reduced Marduk and Borite to pre-spaceflight
technology levels through constant raiding, theft of equipment and
enslavement of scientists and scholars. On Borite, it is forbidden
to write down anything, lest the Oghman Clans decide you are a
scholar and steal you away. On Marduk, each island has its own
language and there is a cultural taboo against learning the tongue
of your neighbors.

The Imperial outpost in this sector is administered from Tobia. A
small amount of trade flows through Sindal subsector – traders
heading for Aslan space may take a longer route instead of the well-
trafficked path across the Borderlands or they can take the J2 route
to Floria along the Sindalian main. Most ships avoid the subsector
if they have any sense. Tlaiowaha subsector lies just over the border
and when the Aslan move coreward again, they will gobble up the
warring worlds of this sector in a single bloody feast until they hit
the Imperial border.

###### Ace 1719 E7A08B9-5

According to local tradition, the name of this world stems from
an old scout report, describing it as an 'Argon-CO2 Environment'.
The atmosphere is indeed rich in argon and is unbreathable by
humans. Storms or cosmic rays excite the gas, resulting in fabulous
multicoloured light shows that outshine the sun in their brilliance
and beauty. The Sages of Ace interpret these celestial portents and
it is said (in Sindal subsector, anyway) that their prophecies are
infallible.

Most of the people of Ace, though, never see the heavenly glories of
their world. The atmosphere is unbreatheable, so the population live
in huge habitation domes built centuries ago. The only trade between
domes is by tunnel or by the few nomads who possess sealed vehicles.
Most of these domes are in a poor state of repair but natural decay is
very much a minor problem compared to the threat of raiders from

Tyr. Pirates can hold whole cities to hostage with a single missile. Pay
up or the dome gets it and you will be breathing argon.

The ruler of Ace is not a hereditary position – instead, the king is
chosen by the sages. The last king was killed when Marga Dome
was destroyed by Tyrian raiders. The sages have declared that the
next king will be an offworlder and that blessed king will deliver Ace
from the threat of raiders.

###### Noricum D8867BB-1

Land on Noricum today and your spacecraft will scare the sheep.
The planet is entirely agrarian and the people live in wooden huts.
In the settled regions, you have to look hard for signs of Noricum's
imperial past. There are clues – a wall built from chunks of
ferroceramic instead of stone, an animal pen using strands of plastic
cabling, a woman's necklace made from chips of computer memory
crystal – but in the settled areas, the people have deliberately tried
to bury the past.

Land in the danger zones, in the ruined cities and you will scare only
the ghosts. Of course, open your airlock without a vacc suit and
you'll be scared for the thirty seconds or so before the viruses infect
you. After that, you have a few days of agony before an even more
painful death. Over thirty percent of Noricum is considered a death
zone, where no living thing dare go. Most of the great structures
of the Sindalian Empire were destroyed in the wars that ended it

+ there are now only radioactive craters where the Imperial Palace
and the Ministry of Justice once stood. There are rumors that
the treasury of the Empire was moved in the final days before the
end and buried somewhere in the catacombs beneath the capital
city. No would-be grave robber has ever returned – there are other
dangers than viruses in the ruins, such as mutated animals and the
last-ditch security systems left by the Sindalians.

The people of Noricum have learned to survive on their blighted
world. They eat no meat, as meat is likely to contain toxins. They
consume high doses of certain bitter herbs and boil all the water
they drink. When a man passes the age of forty, he is sent out into
the blighted zones to build a firebreak and keep the ashen barriers
between the farm and the deadly ruins intact. None survive this
ritual but a good man endures for a tenday or more before dying on
the far side of the ash fields.

The Emperor of Noricum dwells in a small hut and tends a vegetable
garden. His ancestors once ruled a hundred worlds with an iron fist
and a hundred miles from his garden there is a statue a hundred
meters tall that bears his family features, the face permanently
frozen into a cruel sneer. The Emperor of Noricum, though, has a
simple smile on his face as he tends his turnips.

###### Theev A434500-F

Most believe Theev to be a myth. The fabled thieves' port, the
pirate's refuge where lawlessness is king and the Imperium's police
cutters and patrols cannot reach – some tales place it in District
268, others in the middle of the Great Reft, others in Vargr space. In
truth, Theev is quite real and just as lawless and dangerous as the
stories claim.

Pax Rulin

Dpres

Tlaiowaha

Tobia

The planet is an unremarkable dustball, similar to Mars on a good
day. The main urban center, Blacksand City, is built on top of a series
of plateaus linked by sealed walkways. Ships are landed out of sight
in the chasms between the plateaus; bars and other entertainments
are built into the sides of these chasms. Anything and everything is
for sale in Theev – the city's main business is supplying raiders with
weaponry and fencing stolen goods, especially cargoes stolen from
traders heading for the Florian League or the Aslan Hierate. Theev's
shipyards are infamous, producing advanced models of corsairs and
equipping pirate vessels with cutting-edge military-grade weapons.

The city is lawless but the pirate lords who rule it punish those who
use excessive violence. Stab some fool in a bar and the body can be
dumped down the chasm and forgotten about, but bring anything
heavier than a laser pistol to a fight and you will be down that chasm
with your throat cut faster than you can say 'my, the pirate lords of
Blacksand City certainly have efficient assassins working for them'.

Theev's survival is something of a mystery. It is only three parsecs
away from the military base at Realgar, easily within range of
patrols. Any number of Aslan warriors has sworn to wipe out that
den of thieves and vipers and while most of these are idle boasts,
an aggressive Aslan could make it across the sector and strike at
Theev. Then, too, there is the mystery of how Theev started and
how it is always well stocked with the latest weapons and ship parts.
Someone is behind Theev, someone who is an enemy of peace and
civilization in the Trojan Reach.

###### Albe A540A98-E

This desert world was originally settled to exploit significant
lanthanum deposits. During the Sindalian Empire, Albe was second
only to Noricum in terms of power and was its superior in industrial
production and financial sway. The Dukes of Albe could buy and
sell the Emperors of Sindal, who were insultingly called the 'Dogs of
Albe' by some (a reference to the Dukes' proclivity to bring down the
wrath of the Empire on anyone who crossed them). With more than

two-thirds of the Empire's wealth pouring through Albe's coffers,
the planet underwent a disastrous population boom. A dry world
that could at most support a few million people safely overshot its
carrying capacity. At its peak, the population of Albe was almost one
hundred billion.

The greatest disaster to strike Albe was the last duke, known to
history as Gorluun the Undying. He reigned from before the start of
the last civil war to nearly ten years after its end, a reign of more than
eighty years. With the vast power and wealth of Albe, Gorluun might
have been able to stave off the collapse of the Sindalian Empire or
at least ensure that Albe became the new capital when Noricum
fell. Instead, Gorluun vacillated, refusing to commit to any course of
action. When the Empire ended, it took with it the trade routes that
kept Albe's teeming billions fed and watered.

'Gorluun's Feast', the ten-year period following the fall of Noricum,
took the lives of more than fifty billion people. Gorluun himself was
devoured by one of the cannibal bands that sacked Albe's capital
city. Generations of civil war followed, as Gorluun's heirs fought

over the scraps of power that remained. Eventually, the bureaucracy
rose up and put an end to the war. The last heir, Gorluun III, was
placed in a stasis field for legal reasons. He is unfrozen once a year
for a few minutes, just long enough to sign various documents
authorising the bureaucracy to rule in his name for another year.

The reconstruction of Albe took centuries. Through a series of austerity
measures, the bureaucrats were able to end the famine while still
having negative population growth. They opened up relations with the
Imperium, exchanging lanthanum and loyalty for help in rebuilding
their space fleet and help in terraforming the nearby Cordillion system.
Cordillion, when it is habitable, will be capable of supporting billions
of people, relieving some of Albe's crippling population pressure.
Hundreds of colony ships equipped with cheap one-shot jump drives
wait in orbit for the flood of colonists; thousands more are still under
construction. The Imperium expects Albe to be a stabilizing influence
upon the subsector – exactly what it should have been centuries ago,
if Gorluun had acted. His heir was ceremonially unfrozen to swear
allegiance to the Emperor a few years ago; his reaction was described
as 'somewhat confused' by observers.

#### TOBIA

As far as the Imperial government is concerned, Tobia _is_ the Trojan
Reach. Tobia is the ducal seat and holds the sector fleet. The main
trade route between the Imperium and the _Ya'soisthea_ clans of
the Hierate runs through Tobia and the sector has a considerable
proportion of high-technology, high-industry worlds. It is also a
highly cosmopolitan subsector, with a very large number of non-
human citizens. Ayldem is a Droyne-controlled world, while more
than 80% of the Hradus population are naturalised Aslan. Walk
through the cities of Tobia, New Moscow or Pryme and you can
see a half-dozen sentient species on a single street. Unlike Pax
Rulin, which perceives itself to be in a constant state of siege, Tobia
welcomes traders and visitors from outside the Imperium.

The Duke of Tobia is also Sector Duke and as such has vast influence
over the Trojan Reach. In fact, the sector is so isolated from the
rest of the Imperium that the Duke of Tobia effectively runs the
sector without any advice or guidance from [[Capital]]. Tobia subsector
nobility are all related, one way or the other, to the ducal family.

The main communication route back to the Imperium runs through
Usher subsector in Reft Sector, not through the Spinward Marches.
Hundreds of x-boats and naval vessels travel this route every year
and two subsectors – Tobia and Gazulin – rely on its security. In
recent years, the route has been disrupted several times. First, the
Droyne world of Ayldem closed its starport to visitors for unknown
reasons, forcing the Imperium to rapidly construct a new class-A
port on the unfortunately named Our Planet (the official name of
this world is Astrolabe but only clerks in the Scout service actually
use it; the builders of the starport then claimed the world as their
own and now live there). The Droyne reopened traffic four years
later, by which time a revolution on Simok destroyed the former
class-A port _there_ , along with two megafreighters. There have also
been numerous incidents of piracy and smuggling along the route,
forcing Tobia to divert more ships to patrolling the Berg cluster
instead of the border worlds.

The main trade route with the Hierate runs from Pandora and
Wildeman to the aptly named Fist and then to Imisaa, the trader's
world. From there, trade diffuses to the other Imperial worlds; half
the worlds around Imisaa specialize in repackaging Aslan goods for
sale in the Imperium, while the others specialize in stealing from the
first half or from traders.

###### Scaladon AAD98DK-A

Scaladon's oceans are toxic and lethal to human life; the whole
human population is clustered into a few rocky plateaus towering
above the caustic sea mists. The population density of Scaladon
is alarmingly high and some plateaus have collapsed because of
the sheer weight of the people and buildings clinging to them. The
government of Scaladon is a religious dictatorship. The Chosen have
the power of life and death over the people thanks to their mastery
of air travel – flying machines are highly restricted on Scaladon and
any flying vehicles not controlled or permitted by the priests are
shot down by anti-aircraft missiles (every Chosen temple includes a
concealed missile launcher). According to the beliefs of the Chosen,
God will one day return to take his faithful to Heaven and only those

who dwell on Scaladon will be saved. To live on, or more accurately
to clutch the rock of Scaladon for dear life as you teeter above a sea
of sulphur, is to be eligible for salvation.

Those who displease the priests are hurled to their death into the sea.
Lately, population pressure has forced the Chosen to adopt a new
policy – they randomly select people by lottery and throw them off
the cliff. Despite these measures, Scaladon's population continues
to grow and the amount of inhabitable territory diminishes. There
are skyscrapers a thousand floors tall built on plateaus barely fifty
meters across, crammed with the devoted faithful.

###### Empire B679334-C

There is little on this world except the naval base and the settlement
that supports it. There are mothballed vessels in orbit of Empire's
third moon, officially designated the Trojan Reserve.

The world is a pleasant and fertile one, though, with wide rolling
oceans and archipelagos of tropical islands. The administrators of
Empire base are actively seeking colonists to settle on this world and
retired naval crews are often offered fiefdoms here. This plan serves
multiple purposes – it secures the world, gives extra resources to the
base and the retired naval officers can crew the mothballed ships in
the event of an invasion. It has also had an inadvertent consequence

+ there is a growing cabal of ex-naval officers on Empire, a circle
of veteran officers who are concerned with the threat posed by the
Aslan and the chaos of the Trojan Reach. This group of officers,
each of whom has a private island and fiefdom on Empire and a
sizeable pension, has begun to plot measures to ensure the security
of Tobia and the Imperium.

###### Hradus B54699B-7

The history of this world begins many centuries ago and hundreds
of parsecs away, in the Uwaralyekose (Cultural Purge) in the Hierate.
The Esuaheakhahryoyulr clan were part of the tsekho or Progressive
faction; the clan had managed to wean their males away from the
obsessive pursuit of territory and instead social standing within the
Esuaheakhahryoyulr was based on contribution to the clan's fortunes.
It was impossible to completely erase the Aslan territorial urge, so
the clan granted fiefs to those who accomplished glorious deeds,
not necessarily military ones. When the culture wars turned against
the tsekho, the Esuaheakhahryoyulr fled the Hierate (breeding the
conquerer's instinct out of your warrior population tends to diminish
your clan's fighting capability). They crossed the Great Rift and
attempted to settle in the Ya'soisthea but were repeatedly attacked
by the Glorious Empire, forcing them to continue onwards.

Eventually, bloodied and broken, the Esuaheakhahryoyulr reached
Hradus. There was a small human population here already, who were
willing to negotiate with the Aslan, allowing them to settle the southern
continent. Less than a century later, Hradus joined the Imperium.

As Hradus is the world with the highest percentage population
of Aslan in the Imperium, several restrictions were placed on its
membership for 'security reasons' – there was considerable concern
that the whole Esuaheakhahryoyulr clan was a trojan horse and
would launch an attack

against the Imperium once settled. Therefore, Hradus' technology is
capped at TL7, even though the Esuaheakhahryoyulr have the capacity
to produce up to TL12 goods. Similarly, all Esuaheakhahryoyulr
vessels must be registered at Tobia and a portion of the clan's
military forces are always seconded to the sector fleet.

These restrictions have been in force for almost four hundred years
and many citizens feel that the Esuaheakhahryoyulr have proved
themselves over and over again. Other worlds with a high non-
human population are not so restricted and it was only the paranoia
of the Imperium in that era that required the Treaty of Hradus.
Esuaheakhahryoyulr Aslan have served both as warriors and spies
for the Imperium and their ability to produce Aslan-design ships has
been of great use in the past.

###### Imisaa B520867-6

Called the Trader's World, Imisaa's value comes purely from
its location on the main trade route to Aslan space. Convoys or
megafreighters returning from the Hierate arrive here and land at
the Imisaa's sprawling starport, where they are met by huge crowds
of traders, speculators and buyers, howling for rare Aslan goods and
exotic merchandise. The crossing to Aslan space is a hazardous one
and Imisaa is the last 'safe' stop before leaving the Imperium.

There is nothing outside the starport, apart from a few hermits and
smuggler caches. There is no planetary government on Imisaa – the
starport administrator is the de facto ruler of the planet.

The Imisaa naval base is a prestigious assignment, one traditionally
given to the heir to the Duke of Tobia or another favored noble.
In addition to providing escorts for trade convoys leaving for the
Hierate, Imisaa base maintains a squadron of Jump-6 couriers on
standby at all times, ready to jump for Tobia and alert the duke
in the event of an attack from the wilderness. Another squadron
is maintained in readiness at Nekrino and a third is scheduled for
deployment by 1110. These three squadrons are called the Border
Watch and were installed by a particularly paranoid duke who was
convinced that Aslan ships were lurking just over the frontier.

###### Fist B789430-C

This minor world is the first one encountered by a vessel travelling
into Imperial space along the main trade route from the Hierate.
Fist itself is an unremarkable world with a comparatively low
population and is best known for the asteroids which were moved
into position by an eccentric belter several centuries ago. These six
nickel-iron asteroids have been sculpted and lasered and are now
monuments to Imperial power. A ship heading to refuel at Fistport
will pass a sixty-kilometer-wide mural showing the crowning of the
first emperor or the launch of the first jump-capable vessel from
Vland. A seventh asteroid was sculpted, showing several notable
human victories including the Peace of Fthair but was moved into
the orbit of another world of the system following complaints by
Aslan envoys.

###### Simok DAA08CC-5

The only reason Simok has not been classified as a Red travel zone is
political pressure from the megacorporations and the Tobia dukedom

+ merchants would be less willing to travel through the Reach if they
knew that a world on the key trade route was in the middle of a
bloody civil war. For centuries, Simok was ruled by the Simokian
Pharoahs, a dynasty that arose after the collapse of the Sindalian
Empire. The Pharoahs were part of a long breeding program where
the current Pharoah was mated to the most intelligent, healthy
and beautiful members of each generation, chosen by a series of
contests. After nearly two thousand years of eugenics, the Pharoahs
were nigh-perfect specimens of humanity – wise, long-lived and
handsome.

Unfortunately, the last Pharoah's consort was a Zhodani agent, sent
to subvert the Simokian government (or at least, that is what her
enemies at court declared). The consort, Zillah, denied she was a
spy and the Pharoah supported her, sending the army in to seize her
accusers' estates. The nobles retaliated by detonating a primitive
atomic blast in the desert between the capital and their estates,
killing thousands of troops in their horse-drawn tanks (Simok lacks
any fossil fuels). Radioactive fallout blanketed the capital; among
the casualties of the ensuing riots, fires and starvation was consort
Zillah. The heartbroken Pharoah declared that every one of the
traitorous nobles would be slaughtered, along with their followers.

Both sides in the civil war brought in offworld mercenaries, while
the Imperium responded to the use of atomics by deploying marines
to pacify the region around the starport and restore order. Today,
war rages across Simok. The Pharoah is still alive but rumors
abound that he was rendered sterile by the radiation, ending the
two-thousand-year dynasty. The nobles are said to be so indebted
to their offworld allies that if they win, Simok will become a pawn of
another world and everyone is fighting the Imperial 'occupiers'.

The Duke of Tobia has given the various factions another year to
sort out their differences. If Simok is still at war at that time, he
will send more forces there to end the war. The last thing Tobia
subsector needs is a long-burning war close to the jump route back
to the Imperium.

###### Tobia A444A55-F

Tobia! The name should be enough to stir the soul of any patriotic
citizen of the Third Imperium.

Tobia! A world-girdling city, where mighty capital ships nestle in
docks entirely surrounded by towering skyscrapers, where aliens
from a hundred worlds meet to trade and wonder at the strength of
Humaniti's Third Imperium! Tobia! Where the ducal palace soars
like a glittering second sun over the landscape! Tobia! The bastion
of civilization in the Trojan Reach – not faded Gazulin, clinging to a
thin patina of culture to stave off decay and not militaristic Pax Rulin,
where the demands of defence override any other activity. Tobia, seat
of the duke and the most important world Spinward of [[Capital]].

It is a technologically advanced and highly cosmopolitan world but
critics of Tobia say that its culture is egotistical and self-obsessed and
that a succession of dukes has squandered the wealth from trade.
While Tobia garners trillions of credits every year from taxes and escort
fees, much of this money is spent on luxuries or financial investments
in the Spinward Marches and other coreward sectors, instead of on
maintaining the fleets, expanding the Imperium or civilising the

Trojan Reach. Serious questions have been raised about the readiness
of Tobia to hold out against a prolonged siege – especially with the
ongoing turmoil around Simok and Ayldem threatening supply routes
from deeper in the subsector.

Such concerns seem foolish to many – one needs only to look at
the soaring towers and shining fleets orbiting Tobia to see that this
world could never fall.

#### NORA'A

Nora'a was a battleground subsector until comparatively recently.
The region was only infrequently explored and little settled up until
around the year 500, when the Aslan of the _Ya'soisthea_ expanded
into the area, settling the rimward planets. Around the same time,
the Glorious Empire pushed into the subsector from Goertal and
the nascent Florian League settled several worlds in the coreward
quarter. All three factions met at roughly the same time and since
then the sector has been wracked by wars. Conflicts break out
roughly once every ten years, when enough _ihatei_ gather to form
an invading army or when a particularly charismatic leader arises in
the Glorious Empire. The Florians are rarely the aggressors in these
wars and have started only four conflicts in the last six hundred
years, all of which were campaigns aimed at recapturing worlds
previously lost to the Aslan.

Recently, the Florian League lost two worlds to the Hierate – Aftye
was a minor loss but Iryao was uncomfortably close to the Nora'a
transit point and the vital route to the industrial base at Vadada. The
League was able to conquer the Glorious Empire's planet of Lafkin
in the chaotic tangle that historians refer to as the Eahaw Campaign;
the Floriani moved in to secure Lafkin as a supply base, then kept it
when hostilities ceased. The Glorious Empire has suffered the most
casualties in recent wars, losing Yadawao, Eahaw and Woilreawau
to the Hierate and – in a horribly shameful episode – ceding the
world of Lafkin to the Floriani monkeys. They did manage to retain
their rich world of Alirar, their sole remaining clawhold in Nora'a.

The Aslan Hierate hold most of the subsector, although Yadawao
and Eahaw are both in peril of being recaptured and Floriani scouts
have been chased out of Khteiatloilr and even Ewoiftoil.

Several worlds in Nora'a are generally held to be 'prize' worlds,
worlds that even the Florian League are willing to fight over. The
real prize is Vadada, which is second only to Trossachs in Menorial
Sector in production capacity for the League's industry and is the
chief shipyard for the Floriani. Other prize worlds include the vast
lanthanum deposits on Khtyekt, the 'Floriani breadbasket' at Tanar
and Nora'a itself. Hierate scouts have mapped the whole of Florian
space and know that the Floriani Main starts at Nora'a. If they can
break through the border defences, then the Aslan can gobble up a
dozen or more lightly-defended worlds in a matter of months.

###### Nora'a A485645-9

The first settled world in this subsector is called Nora'a now but
has had many names. The Sindalian Empire called it Farhold; after
the Sindalian Empire fell, the scant few survivors called it Home for
another three centuries before their civilization fell to Technology
Level 1 and they fell into obscurity and the Floriani called it Humboga.
It was conquered by the Glorious Empire in 730 and recaptured by
the Floriani a century later, who for their own obscure reasons chose
not to change the name back again. When Imperial scouts reached
this distant subsector, they took this as the name of the subsector
for their charts.

Nora'a has several enviable agricultural zones – three major rivers,
each of which has a flow of more than 200,000 meters per second
(comparable to the Amazon river on Terra), all empty into the ocean
in a single massive river delta called the Trident, while the hills of
the south are thickly forested with fruit trees. The Floriani have far
too few Feskal farmers on Nora'a to fully exploit this bounty, so
the League is considering importing more labourers. The Barnai
overseers flit from farm to farm using grav platforms.

Nora'a's population is approximately 90% Floriani. Another 5%
are Solomani-stock from the Sindalian Empire; these hill tribes lost
their technology after the fall of the Empire and survived in a basic
agrarian society until the Floriani arrived. These Solomani have been
integrated into Florian society and they are treated as Feskals.

The other 5% are Glorious Empire Aslan, left stranded when the
League reconquered Nora'a. These warriors fled to the thick jungles
along the Kaelca river and have remained there ever since. The
Aslan have an approximate TL of 5; they can produce higher-tech
equipment but Florian hunter-killer squads have learned to home
in on radio emissions and heat sources in the jungle. The stranded
Aslan are trapped by the jungle that protects them; any attempts
to move outside the shelter of the canopy brings the Floriani down
on them within hours. The Floriani have little talent for counter-
insurgency warfare and may employ mercenaries to go after the big
cats in the jungle...

###### Suiaoir B6513G7-E

With two other dangerous foes in the subsector, the clans dwelling
in Nora'a cannot afford to fight open wars against each other. Doing
so would sap the strength of the clans and cost the lives of too many
valuable males (of course, the clans still fight open wars regularly – one
thing the Aslan have never been accused of is common sense). Instead,
they fight limited wars and Suiaoir is designated the battleground for
Nora'a subsector. The planet has a breathable atmosphere but few
other desirable qualities; it has no mineral reserves worth exploiting,
the native ecology tops out at fur-dwelling mites and slugs and the
few patches of surface water are tainted with heavy metals. As a place
to live, Suiaoir is not a good choice.

As a place to blow up, it is a far better one. The permanent population
of Suiaoir are all technicians, healers, military observers and
earleatrais judges (as well as a few outcast salvage teams). Conflicts
between clans from all over the Ya'soisthea are settled here, on the
muddy craters and stony fields of Suiaoir. The support teams can
build temporary structures for use as target practice or objectives
that must be captured and the topography is varied enough to cope
with most styles of combat. Simulated naval engagements can take
place in the small asteroid belts nearby.

Suiaoir's tradition of war games has attracted the attention of more
than a few Aslan lords. The Suiaoir starport is a known haunt of spies
and talent scouts. Some are agents, looking for promising warriors
to recruit for mercenary warbands or as commanders. Others are

###### Vadada A410944-F

The skies above Vadada are thronged with starships. This is the
core of the Florian navy and while their ship designs are perhaps
the ugliest in known space (the phrase 'flying bricks' comes to
mind, although bricks have a classic elegance and a lot fewer weird
flanges than Florian warships), their technological prowess cannot
be denied. The Vad[[Adan]] shipyards produce virtually all Florian naval
vessels and are the only shipyards capable of building their heaviest
designs.

Vadada itself is a lumpy world, with a fantastically high iron content,
which made it an ideal site for a shipyard. The surface deposits are
large enough and of such high quality, that the Floriani employ
mobile factories – effectively, cities on tracks that roll across
Vadada, scrape away the thin, rusty topsoil and then dig and refine
the ore. Some of these city-factories are self-replicating, so Vadada's
production capacity is rising quickly and would do so exponentially
if the Floriani were willing to use robots instead of Feskals for all
labour.

Vadada's moon, Jarno, is almost as large as the planet it orbits and is
more properly termed a companion world. The orbital arrangement
appears stable in the medium term but projections past a million
years show Jarno crashing into Vadada. The Florian League has
made arrangements for such an eventuality. Jarno is the site of the
Florian Naval Academy. The League has always had trouble with
creative thinking and leadership and tends to win wars by vastly
superior firepower, superior numbers, or both. The Naval Academy
is open to both Feskal and Barnai, although only truly exceptional
Feskals can qualify for the classes there. The Academy hires retired
naval commanders and other specialists from the Imperium and
pays quite astonishingly well, although teaching creativity and
tactical flexibility to Barnai is said to be a frustrating experience
(again, most similes involve bricks). Lecturers have also reported
odd headaches and unexplained cranial scars, although rumors of
a long-term Barnai project to harvest Solomani brain tissue and alter
their own genome are, of course, nonsense.

The Vadadan Defence Force, a dedicated unit of fast-response
interceptors and system defence boats, sees off regular Aslan
attacks. Most of these attacks are raids by ambitious _ihatei_ , aimed
at disrupting supply runs or hitting ships still in drydock. Larger
attacks are not uncommon, though, to the extent that the Floriani
have prepared a scorched-earth defence policy in the event Vadada
falls to the Aslan. All fusion reactors in the industrial belt are rigged

with self-destruct charges and a bank of gravity generators buried
beneath Jarno's surface wait to disrupt the delicate orbits of the
pair, sending Jarno crashing into Vadada in a matter of years, not
millennia.

###### Oihyeti'he B7797H5-E

Oihyeti'he underwent a period of warming in the last fifty thousand
years; its ice caps partially melted, causing a rise in sea level of
approximately ten meters. The planet is more than nine-tenths
covered in water but many of these seas are very shallow. The Aslan
have found evidence that Oihyeti'he was inhabited before they
colonized it; in some regions, ruined buildings emerge like weed-
covered skeletons from the shallow seas. The previous inhabitants
were an advanced humanoid culture, possibly a lost Solomani
colony. The Aslan believe that the rising waters drowned the older
civilization, although curious electromagnetic and sonic anomalies
in the deep ocean suggest that something may have survived in the
watery depths.

Oihyeti'he's largest surviving island, Ui'ila, is the site of the largest
ihatei encampment in the subsector. Here, more than half a million
landless second-sons and their followers gather each year, looking
for territories to conquer. Oihyeti'he is situated in the middle of a
cluster of worlds and the ihatei fleet that musters here is a formidable
fighting force. Most of the wars that regularly engulf Nora'a started
here.

###### Alirar A3555HA-C

This world is the last one left to the Glorious Empire in Nora'a Sector
and it is a world on the verge of collapse. During the wars, virtually
all of the Aslan citizens went off to fight and they died on Lafkin, on
Eahaw, on Woilreawau and in the cold of space. Two generations
of Aslan died, leaving only the aged, the very young and the infirm
behind. They also left behind their human slaves. The Glorious
Empire is built on the back of human slave labour and Alirar was
no exception. The fields of this agricultural world were tended by
slave-monkeys.

During the closing stages of the last war, Hierate forces attacked the
cities of Alirar in Open War, which permitted the use of weapons
of mass destruction. Alirar's already-limited industrial base was
ruined and its population decimated but the casualties were
disproportionately high among the urban Aslan compared to the
mainly rural human slaves. Once the dust cleared and the war ended,
the surviving Aslan of Alirar found themselves vastly outnumbered
by their slaves. Of the 900,000 people living on Alirar, less than
10,000 are Aslan.

The Aslan rulers hold onto their domain through brutality and
superior technology. Explosive slave collars, pain projectors and
gas bombs are standard issue for all Aslan citizens and the excess
human slaves have been rounded into concentration camps
and may be executed if they cannot be suitably contained. The
Aslan have begun gelding slaves to lessen the chance of some
charismatic liberator arising to lead a slave revolt.

Worse, they cannot appeal to the rest of the Glorious Empire for
help. The Empire was on the verge of abandoning Alirar as a lost
cause, until the Alirar leaders proclaimed that not only was Alirar
viable but it could serve as an ideal mustering point for another
invasion force. Empire ships and warrior hosts have already begun
to gather in the system and their numbers will only grow in the
months to come. If Alirar's human slaves revolt at the wrong time,
then the Glorious Empire's next play for power in this subsector
could be its last.

#### GOERTEL

This subsector has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most
dangerous regions of known space. The breakaway Aslan state
called the Glorious Empire holds half the subsector and is at war
with the other half.

Goertel was originally settled by the Sindalian Empire, who
established outposts as far rimward as Keawoaw. The subsector
capital was Goertel and was the headquarters of the Sindalian
fleet. As the Sindalian Empire slipped into despotism and orbital
bombardment, the population of Goertel rose up in protest against
government excesses (not to mention the undue taxation needed to
maintain the bloated military forces). The ensuing civil war ruined
Goertel and forced the Sindalian Emperors to pull their fleets back
to Noricum, hastening the decline and fall of the Empire. Goertel
was seized by a repressive religious cult, the Church of Nom, who
claimed the starport and any remaining space vessels. Interstellar
travel was restricted to the church members. The Goertel-subsector
colonies were cut off from the rest of the Empire and slowly slipped
into decay.

The Tokouea'we clan, one of the earliest Aslan clans to migrate
across the Great Rift, expanded out into this region in the 400s by
the Imperial Calendar. At the time, they were a minor clan, smarting
from a series of defeats back in the Hierate and looking for a new
start. Their long-range Jump-4 scouts first discovered the world of
Syoakh, which they claimed as their capital. While Syoakh's native
population consisted of only a few Chirpers, the generation of _ihatei_
who set off from Syoakh found the neighboring worlds populated by
humans – and unlike the resilient humans of the Solomani rim who
resisted Aslan conquest, these human worlds were technologically
primitive and easy prey. Within a century, the Tokouea'we gobbled
up every world from Keawoaw to Asyuh along the spinward half of
Goertel subsector. The humans of these worlds were enslaved and
this cheap labour fuelled further expansion of the Tokouea'we clan
holdings.

More Aslan clans moved into the Trojan Reach and political
differences sparked wars between the Tokouea'we and the
newcomers. The Tokouea'we rejected the Hierate and declared
themselves an independent polity, the Glorious Empire. War
engulfed the whole subsector. These conflicts have continued to the
present day – there are periods of relative peace and the Glorious
Empire has even sent representatives to the _Ya'soisthea_ on occasion

+ but in the period from 650 to 1100, the Glorious Empire spent
some 379 of those years at war with either the _Ya'soisthea_ , the
Florian League or the independent worlds in Dpres subsector.

Currently, the Glorious Empire is in retreat as its economy stagnates
(slave labour works very well when you are cultivating crop fields
and animal herds but less so when you want your slaves to build
Tech Level E warships or program computers). The worlds of
Hrahraiu, Hteakya and – disastrously – Hliyh have all been lost to
the Hierate in the last decade, while Goertel itself managed to throw
off the slaver shackles and is now human-ruled. The human slave
population of these captured worlds are treated differently by each
'liberating' clan. On Hliyh, the humans have been offered a place

in Aslan society, although the chances of any of them rising above
awkhea is slim. On Hteakya, the few thousand humans have been
offered the use of a clan colony ship to transport them offworld
to any planet within six parsecs. Finally, for the unfortunates on
Hrahraiu, the likely outcome will be extermination or at best slavery
under a different band of Aslan masters. Coupled with the loss
of Tryaoke a generation ago, the Glorious Empire is facing utter
annihilation within another twenty years unless it can reverse the
tide of fortune.

No major trade routes pass through Goretel. The Glorious Empire
trades little with the Hierate and its sole major export is mercenaries,
fighting in the wars of the Dustbelt worlds in Dpres. Imperium/
Hierate and Imperium/Florian League trade routes generally avoid
this wartorn sector.

Agents of the Imperium or independent human worlds may look
upon the carnage in Goertel and assume that this infighting
means the Aslan will never be a threat – any race that pits clan
against clan in endless internal feuds and turf wars can never rally
a truly formidable invasion force. In truth, the Goertel wars are
not emblematic of Aslan culture; it is the overweening pride and
ambition of the Glorious Empire that has divided the subsector and
turned the limited wars practiced by the Hierate into devastating
open wars.

###### Syoakh A6968MC-C

Or, more properly, Syoahkhaokhirtlaeakhhtahyu, World of the Most
Glorious Empire of Honorable Warriors. This earth-like world is the
capital of the Glorious Empire and is as important to the Aslan of
the Empire as Kusyu is to the Hierate. Like Kusyu, land-holdings
on Syoakh are considered to be of incalculable worth and only the
families highest in the Emperor's esteem may dwell here. The ratio
of Aslan to human Syoakh is more than nine to one; the few humans
are ceremonial slaves and servants.

Syoakh society is dominated by the government and the military. At
the head of the government is, of course, the Grand Emperor. The
title is not a hereditary one – any head of a pride may challenge the
sitting Emperor to trial by combat but the title has remained within
the Earatokouea'we pride for nearly three hundred years. In fact, the
Emperor is a puppet controlled by a junta of military officers, who
ensure that no prospective challenger (other than a few carefully-
vetted sacrifices to maintain the deception) gets close to the Grand
Emperor. The current Grand Emperor is a poetic young male named
Krial, who spends his days wandering the colossal Grand Golden
Palace and pursuing his hobby of archaeology. Krial is an expert on
the Sindalian Empire's decline and fall and perhaps he has read his
future in the human past.

The surrounding city is mostly taken up with bureaucracy and
the machinery of government. The Glorious Empire is absurdly
centralised – virtually every non-military decision of note is taken
by clerks on Syoakh. This policy, designed to ensure that the
Tokouea'we remained united, has limited the growth of the Empire
and forced them to maintain a vast fleet of J4 couriers. There are
only thirteen worlds in the Glorious Empire but the sheer amount of

jump traffic at Syoakh suggests there are thirteen hundred. The city
and starport of Syoakh are truly beautiful; one of the best examples
of high-Aslan art outside the Hierate, and the Grand Golden Palace
itself is testament to what you can do with a few genius artists and
architects, an unlimited budget and an army of slaves. Aslan weep
at its beauty; humans may weep at the hundreds of thousands who
died making it.

The military camps on the outer islands and in orbit are far more
important to the running of the Glorious Empire. The military junta
rule from a deeply buried fortress under the ocean, cloaked against
orbital attacks or meson weapons. The junta know that the Empire
is in a precarious position and are frantically plotting ways to deflect
the Hierate away from the Glorious Empire. Strategies under review
include sparking a conflict between _Ya'soisthea_ clans, forcing a war
between the Imperium and the Hierate and an overwhelming assault
on Vadada in Nora'a subsector and turning the Florian warships on
the Hierate. A junior faction of officers is agitating for the Glorious
Empire to open relations with the Hierate so they can negotiate for
limited wars; others are plotting what they will do when the Empire
falls.

###### Colony Six A68A541-D

This colony is, as the name suggests, the sixth of a group of colonies
seeded from Terra using sublight drives thousands of years ago.
Ark Six suffered damage and was forced to stop here, much earlier

than scheduled. The other five ships continued onwards and are
believed to be somewhere in Ziafrplians sector in Zhodani space.
The colony vessels were dispatched in –2445, before the [[Terra|Terran]]
development of the jump drive. While traders arriving at Colony
Six after its establishment brought jump technology with them, the
lack of lanthanum prevented the natives from developing their own
jump-capable fleets. Even today, Colony Six has only a handful of
jump ships.

The world is entirely covered in ocean, so the inhabitants are divided
into three castes. Sea-riders live in raft cities that sail across the
world-ocean; they are the most numerous caste and primarily
concerned with aquaculture and light industry. Even the planet's
starport is on a raft (ships are warned that they must keep their
m-drives operational at all times, as the landing pads are unable to
sustain the full weight of even a scout ship for long). Wind-riders
live on stationary platforms suspended using gravity generators
and are the home of the planet's universities, research centres and
heavy industry. Finally, the smallest caste is the spacers, who mine
asteroids and defend the system against the regular attacks from
Aslan or Glorious Empire raiders.

It is perhaps a tragedy that Colony Six never expanded out into the
Reach. It is a stable, peaceful and technologically advanced society
that could perhaps have counterbalanced some of the violent,
disruptive regimes in the sector. As it stands, Colony Six is critically
short of resources and will be unable to withstand a concerted attack
by any of its militant neighbors.

###### Goertel B6688DC-6

Goertel is a world with a long and bloody history. It is a world of
darkly wooded hills and slate-grey stone cities under a red sky, a
world of ghosts and secret passages and paranoia. Settled originally
by exiles from the First Imperium (the circumstances of their exile
are lost in the mists of history), the original Goertel colony was taken
over by Solomani from the Rule of Man and then became part of the
Sindalian successor state. Goertel reached its height in this period;
it was the headquarters of the Sindalian fleet and the subsector
capital. The secret police fortress in the capital city is still, after
thousands of years, the most impressive building on the planet.

After the fall of the Empire and the suicide of the last Duchess-
Admiral of Goertel, the Church of Nom took over running the planet.
The Church, always a bit player in Goertelan politics, had long
prepared for such a catastrophe and seized power in a comparatively
bloodless coup. One of their first acts was to outlaw space travel and
only permit sanctified technicians and ordained priests to serve on
starships. The Church is a messianic cult that believes that a divine
entity will one day arise from humanity's collective soul and that its
ascension can be hastened by fostering psionics. Most priests of the
cult have some psionic ability. The church believes that space travel
dilutes the collective psychic capacity of humanity and so space
voyages are undertaken only when absolutely necessary. The hatred
of the space fleet present when the Church took over may be the
origin of this belief.

Goertel was conquered by the Glorious Empire in 556 and the Church
of Nom was forced underground once more. The Glorious Empire
enslaved the populace and abducted many of the psionic priests.
Some of the priesthood fled to Delta Theta in Dpres subsector,
taking with them several antique Sindalian warships. The Church
began prophesying that Nom would arrive soon to deliver the world
from the Aslan slavers but for more than five centuries, Goertel
groaned under the Aslan yoke.

The world was delivered neither by the exiled space fleet, nor by the
coming of Nom, but by the Hierate. Attacks on neighboring worlds
forced the Glorious Empire to concentrate its followers elsewhere,
allowing an uprising on Goertal to take hold and overthrow Aslan
rule. The return of the old Sindalian fleet – decrepit and outdated
but still flying – from Delta Theta reinforced Goertel's independence.
Wisely it is said, Nom moves in mysterious ways.

###### Tryaoke D5569H8-5

The ultimate disposition of the Tryaokean populace will determine
overall Hierate policy towards the human minority of the Glorious
Empire. For hundreds of years, the population of Tryaoke was used

as a breeding world for slaves. The Aslan administrators, perhaps
inspired by the example of the Florian League's Feskals, tried to
produce a large pool of strong, healthy, tractable humans. These
efforts were less than successful, although they did succeed in
increasing the population of the world to more than eight billion. The
Glorious Empire also succeeded in crushing the spirit of the people
of Tryaoke – any scientific talent or curiosity was squashed and any
dissent or rebellion resulted in instant death.

The Hierate captured Tryaoke thirty years ago and is still debating
what to do with it. It is psychologically impossible for an Aslan's
spirit to be broken – the desire for territory and conquest is too
strong – and now they have a world of eight billion broken humans.
Other humans have been integrated into Aslan society but they
were willing to fight for a place and could be treated as equals or
almost-equals. The folk of Tryaoke are primitive, superstitious and
conditioned to obey the orders of any Aslan.

Some advocate putting the humans to use as slaves or at least cheap
labour. Others believe the Aslan should shepherd Tryaoke towards
independence or wipe the planet clean and divide it up into territories.

#### TLAIOWAHA

This subsector was explored by the Tlaiowaha clan, who then ceded
most of the worlds here to their vassals, the Ahroay'if. The Ahroay'if
control or strongly influence more than a third of the worlds in this
subsector. Their power is based on trade and the Ahroay'if have a
vested interest in preserving the peace. They strongly support _ihatei_
expeditions to settle or conquer worlds along the Hierate/Imperium
trade route, as long as such expansions do not interfere with trade.

In the last fifty years, the Ahroay'if have come under increasing
pressure from rimward clans, especially the Hkaaiheir. These clans
claim that the Ahroay'if have become fat and weak; more concerned
with protecting trade links than winning new territory. So far, they
have shied away from actually attacking the Ahroay'if, preferring to
claim territory on disputed worlds in Aslan space or to raid beyond
the borders of the Hierate but pressure is building to conquer the
neutral worlds in this subsector.

Solomani scouts also explored this sector and left several small
colonies. Many of these worlds were named by a famous explorer,
Jona Rhas, a devotee of ancient [[Terra|Terran]] science-fiction. Most of these
colonies were subsumed into the Sindalian Empire and survived
comparatively well when that Empire collapsed. There have been
conflicts between the human colonies in the past but the arrival of
the Aslan Hierate has unified them somewhat, following the loss of
Khusai (formerly Banks) and Kterioa (Stross) to the Hierate. Drinax's
king advocates forming an alliance against the Hierate, while the
worlds of Pourne, Hilfter and Paal are hoping to either negotiate
entry into the Imperium or the Hierate as equal trading partners.

There are two Imperial client states in this sector. Vorito is the local
headquarters of the General Development Company and was able
to obtain Imperial protection from Deneb. Camoran, by contrast,
applied for help from Tobia when the Aslan began attacking it.
Camoran's cloak of Imperial protection is a thin one and it is likely
that the Imperium will refuse to extend its thirty-year guarantee of
Mutual Defence when the treaty comes up for renewal in 1108.

The main trade route from the Imperium runs through this
subsector, entering from the Borderlands at Pohl or Herbert and
from there onto Tyokh.

###### Tlaiowaha B1209L4-E

The world of Tlaiowaha is owned by the Tlaiowaha clan. It is not
their clan seat, which is hundreds of parsecs away across the Great
Rift but it is one of the pillars on which their power rests. Tlaiowaha
Anchorage is the largest Aslan military base in the sector and is well
positioned to respond to incursions anywhere along the subsector
border. There are enough warriors and warships at Tlaiowaha to
conquer every world from Vorito to Pax Rulin and the fleets stationed
here outnumber those stationed at Pax Rulin and Tobia combined.
The Imperial fleet's total displacement is larger than the Tlaiowaha
fleet's total displacement but that is cold comfort to Imperial strategic
analysts who wake in a cold sweat from the nightmare of an Aslan
tide. The system is heavily fortified; in addition to the hundreds
of warships and the mighty fortress world of Tlaiowaha itself, the
system's asteroid belt has been mined to produce a host of system
defence boats and gun satellites. Any vessels arriving in Tlaiowaha
without permission are targeted for destruction immediately.

While Tlaiowaha is primarily a military fortress, the Aslan also uses it
for state functions. The inner chambers of Tlaiowaha Anchorage are
a zone of sybaritic luxury, a labyrinthine palace where holographic
projectors make every room appear to be a vast wilderness, where
beautiful consorts wait on scented pillows, where gold and iridium
and precious stones decorate every surface, where the full grandeur
and power of the Aslan Hierate are displayed for all to see. Imperial
visitors that the Tliaowaha wish to impress are invited to the
Anchorage.

###### Kteiroa C4601K4-8

Kteiroa is a cold world, a land of frozen tundra and carbon dioxide
glaciers. There are valuable phospourous deposits in the western
wilderness known as Ulkaodhianeak, the Land of White Bones but
neither the [[Terra|Terran]] scouts who first mapped this world, nor the
Sindalians who built the starport, nor the Aslan that now hold it
bothered to exploit this resource. Today, the port is maintained by a
small family of Outcastes and is a haunt of pirates, smugglers and
free traders looking for a back door into Hierate space.

In recent years, Kteiroa has seen more traffic from ihatei scouts,
who use this last Aslan world as a refuelling post before jumping
to the human worlds along the border. Five years ago, the world
saw a dozen ihatei at most; three years ago, a hundred. At high

summer this year (when, on a good, sunny day, the temperature
crawls to freezing at the equator), more than five hundred _ihatei_ and
two thousand prospective retainers and mercenaries gathered at
Kteiroa. If this trend continues, there will soon be enough militant,
landless Aslan at Kteiroa to launch an invasion... Asim is their most
likely target but the rulers of Drinax and Pourne should not rest
easy.

###### Drinax A33645C-F

Two hundred years ago, Drinax was the great power in this
subsector, second only to the Hierate. The Kings of Drinax ruled
over every world from Khusai to Paal and also claimed Torpol, Clarke
and Blue. A war between Drinax and the Aslan Hierate put an end
to the Kingdom of Drinax. The Drinaxians had marginally higher
technology but the Aslan fleet outnumbered them three to one. The
war was sparked by an _ihatei_ invasion of Asimov but conflict had
been brewing for years as the Drinaxians tried to muscle in on the
Imperium/Hierate trade.

The war shattered the Kingdom of Drinax. The other worlds had
chafed under Drinax rule for years and the Drinaxians had resorted
to the tactics of the Sindalian Empire of old, bombing planets to
keep them in line. The Hierate returned the favor tenfold – Drinax
was nearly glassed by the Ahroay'if.

The only surviving settlement on Drinax was the Royal Palace, which
floats above the blasted, lifeless surface on a huge gravity platform.
The only survivors were the Royal Family and their servants,
courtesans, guards, jesters, technicians, beauticians and other
hangers-on. Fortunately, the fabled Hanging Gardens of Drinax
could be quickly repurposed to provide food. The Kings of Drinax
are much humbler now, although Drinax did launch a successful
invasion of the nearby planet of Asim ten years ago, mainly to
obtain better food supplies (invasion is perhaps a grandiose term
for 'jump over, blast the Asimen from orbit and keep shooting until
they give you stuff' – apparently, old habits die hard for Sindalian
descendants).

The current King of Drinax is Oleb XVI, an accomplished pugilist and
swordsman, infamous for his taste in wine (strong reds), women
(ditto) and song (shouted lustily through a megaphone).

###### Tyokh B466AH7-E

Tyokh is the counterpart of Imisaa in Tobia subsector. Here is where
the Imperial ships come in, having made the perilous crossing of

the Borderlands. Tyokh's starport was rated Class-A but it is so
overburdened by traffic that it has been dropped by TAS to Class-B.
The shipyards there have been refitted into extra freighter berths.
Unusually for Aslan colonies, the area around the starport is heavily
urbanised and the cityscape could be any world from Deneb to the
core worlds. Those expecting an exotic, alien city when they land
on their first Aslan world will be disappointed. Once a traveller
gets away from the human-dominated starport district, the beauty
of Tyokh becomes evident. It is a hot, steamy jungle world for the
most part, where the organic curves of Aslan buildings rise lazily
above the treeline.

Tyokh is dominated by the Ahroay'if clan, who control roughly sixty
percent of the trade. The planet is also shared with half-a-dozen other
clans and hundreds of corporations have offices and outposts here.
To the Hierate's shame, a criminal organization called the Rea'a
Hrilkhir, an 'Aslan Mafia' of outcasts, also run black markets on
Tyokh and are rumored to have ties to the pirate bands elsewhere
in the Reach, especially in Borderlands subsector. The Rea'a Hrilkhir
also control the lucrative market in guides and interpreters to Aslan
culture; merchants who hire a guide on Tyokh are warned that there
is every chance the guide is spying on them.

###### Akoaft E898000-0

Akoaft is the site of an ongoing struggle between the Ahroay'if and
the Hkaaiheir clans. The world itself is a low-resource cesspit with
an ecology best described as 'more breeds of slime and mold than
you ever dreamed existed' and was never settled by any species. The
war here is not for control of Akoaft – instead, it is a proxy war for
the nearby Keaih system, currently held by the Htyowao, vassals of
the Ahroay'if. The conflict on Akoaft has ground on for four years,
with the Hkaaiheir currently holding the upper hand. The Htyowao
believe that the war will be lost within another four years and plan
to move en masse to another world.

###### Vorito E595ABB-A

Vorito was originally established as a forward base by the Third
Imperium around 500; back then, it was two hundred marines and
technicians sitting in a dome, half of them listening for radiation
bursts from Aslan scout ships and the other half listening to the
winds howling outside in the wilderness. A small colony grew up
to service the base and then the General Development Corporation
set up an office here. The protection and stability offered by the
corporate presence attracted more settlers from the war-torn
Kingdom of Drinax and from other worlds in the

Borderlands. Vorito rapidly expanded into a financial center,
a place for human traders to gather on the edge of Aslan space.
The Corporation invested in the planet's infrastructure and today
thousands of domed cities dot the planet's surface. Increasingly,
the government of Vorito and the executives of GeDeCo became
intertwined, until the world became a corporate asset. The Governor-
General of Vorito is appointed by the GeDeCo board.

Vorito Highport was completed in 991, signalling a new and bold
period in the world's participation in Imperium/Hierate trade and in
the development of the whole subsector. The Highport was a cutting-
edge class A, a Technology Level 15 starport and shipyard capable of
building new megafreighters and escorts for the Corporation.

In 1098, terrorists attacked and destroyed Vorito Highport. At the
same time, assassins killed sixteen GeDeCo executives, including
the Governor-General. Short of the Aslan landing marines on Vorito,
there could not have been a clearer declaration of war from the
Hierate on GeDeCo. Experts on Aslan culture point out that while the
use of assassins and bombs are permissible in a war of assassins, it
would be dishonorable to do so without first declaring such a war.
Therefore, either GeDeCo received such a declaration and ignored
it, or the Aslan do not consider GeDeCo worthy of respect, or the
attackers were not Aslan.

The current starport and Technology Level ratings of Vorito reflect
the damage done by these surprise assaults – GeDeCo estimates
that by 1111, Vorito should be back up to Starport A and TL13.

#### THE BORDERLAND

The Borderland subsector has grown vastly in importance in the last
five hundred years. Once a backwater in a backwater, Borderland
was virtually ignored by the old empires. The Vilani bypassed
it entirely; the [[Terra|Terran]]s dropped a few colonies along the way but
never really developed it and while the Sindalian Empire claimed
the whole subsector as part of their domain, they never explored
further than Byrni.

The Borderland was left, in the words of one scout, to fester. All
sorts of bizarre rumors swirled around this sector during the Long
Night and the early days of the Imperium. Some claimed that the
proximity of the Great Rift, of parsec upon parsec of empty space
drives travellers insane. Others insisted that a great pirate king had
his base in the Borderland or that a mysterious alien race held sway
over a number of worlds here or that jump travel was especially
unreliable and hazardous here. This last one may have some truth
to it – there is a noticably higher rate of misjumps in the Borderland
than elsewhere and Imperium scouts put this down to poor-quality
fuel. The establishment of a chain of Class-A starports with first-rate
refineries should put an end to this phenomenon.

The opening of trade between the Aslan Hierate and the Third
Imperium transformed the Borderland. The chain of worlds between
Tobia and Tlaiowaha subsectors became instantly of great strategic
and commercial value. The 'Borderlands rush' of the 500s brought
free traders, con artists, miners, developers and pirates flocking
to the subsector. Ironically, raids on shipping by both Aslan and
human rogues nearly put an end to the good times but increased
Imperial escorts and Aslan punitive raids helped lend confidence to
the megacorporations once more.

Chief among these megacorporations is the General Development
Corporation. While GeDeCo has interests across the Trojan
Reach, in Borderland it is a player on par with the Imperium or the
Hierate and GeDeCo executives are treated as lords here. GeDeCo
established many of the new colonies here and drove the pirates
into the wilderness once more. GeDeCo's headquarters is on Vorito,
in Tlaiowaha subsector and perilously close to the Hierate but they
have major facilities on Tech-World, Tanith, Acrid, Argona, Byrni
and Falkenberg.

The Imperial/Hierate trade route runs from Tobia subsector through
Cordan or Acrid, to Tech-World and then onto Byrni. Jump-2 vessels
must detour through Argon and Sperle before making a perilous
stop-over at Ergo and harvesting fuel from the local gas giant.

###### Byrni B955699-6

Byrni was established by the Sindalians as a watch-post and naval
depot. At that time, the Empire was threatened by raiders and
barbarians from the trailing stars, so Byrni was a major strategic
assignment. A strong tradition of military service was established and
the Knights of Byrni were considered the most loyal and honorable
soldiers in the service of Noricum. As the Sindalian Empire decayed,

the warships at Byrni were called home one by one, leaving only
a small garrison without the capacity to maintain its technology
or build new ships. Nonetheless, the Byrni endured, keeping their
system defence boats flying with increasingly elaborate patches and
jury-rigged electronics.

When the Imperium recontacted Byrni in 329, their scoutships were
challenged to stand down 'in the name of the Emperor of Sindal'.
Byrni's garrison had stayed loyal for more than 800 years. Once the
Byrni were appraised of the state of the rest of the sector and the
fall of Noricum, they declared independence from an Empire that
no longer existed and set about finding a new place for themselves
in the galaxy.

Over a third of the Byrni population today are Aslan – elements of
the Hkaaiheir clan settled there with the permission of the Byrni
and the Byrni are considered honorable humans by the Aslan. The
Hierate's military culture of duty and honor appeals to the dutiful
Byrni and having a human world as a trading post on the main
Imperium/Hierate convoy route helps the Hkaaiheir undercut the
Ahroay'if's trade monopoly.

In modern times, one of the chief Byrni occupations has been pirate
hunting. The world is one of those heavily invested in by GeDeCo
and the corporation has provided a small squadron of jump-capable
pirate hunter vessels to the Byrni. After two thousand years of
service, the Byrni are once more defending civilization in the Trojan
Reach.

###### Arunisiir B776530-6

Arunisiir was seized by an ambitious ihatei and his band of followers
in 809. The Aslan stormed the capital city, easily defeating the planet's
poorly equipped armed forces and executing the government from
the Prefect of Amalgo (the planet's original name) on down to the
police captains. However, as the Aslan began pacifying the outer
towns, a lucky shot from a revolutionary killed the ihatei leader of
the invasion.

Without a unifying leader, the invading Aslan began to squabble
among themselves. The invading force broke up into two-dozen
factions, each of which was forced to ally themselves with the
defeated humans in order to maintain their strength. The Aslan
warriors recruited humans as both footsoldiers and aides and
after a generation, the aides were effectively running the Aslan
domains, with the Aslan relegated to the roles of figureheads and
technicians.

Today, the ruling caste of Arunisiir are the human adjuncts to the
Aslan. There are less than a dozen Aslan families left on Arunisiir
and they are kept for the most part as pampered pets and symbolic
rulers. The Aslan have retained some of their technological
sophistication and Arunisiir is capable of producing a very limited
amount of TL12 equipment. In addition to the Aslan figureheads and
their oligarch servants, the other major political faction on Arunisiir

is the People's League, a revolutionary group dedicated to driving
the invaders offworld. The League is opposed more strenuously by
the oligarchs than by the Aslan.

###### Tech-World A455154-F

The first colony here – a Solomani outpost – was destroyed by
the Sindalian Empire's Punitive Armada. The world lay empty for
hundreds of years, until the GeDeCo funded the construction of
a starport here to encourage Imperium-Hierate trade through the
Borderlands. To reduce the costs of constructing the starport, they
contracted with renegades from the technologically advanced world
of Neumann in Gazulin subsector. While the world of Neumann
has the highest level of technology of any world in the whole sector,
its use is heavily restricted by the Shield Church. The heretics were
eager to take GeDeCo's offer of a world of their own and funding to
develop their science.

The human population of Tech-world is around four thousand. The
robot population is around a million and rising, depending on how
one tallies distributed-intelligence computer with numerous slave
bodies. Experiments in using nanotechnology, cloning and other
technologies of questionable legality are ongoing and Tech-World
is attracting increasing numbers of researchers who wish to pursue
lines of inquiry not permitted in the Imperium. GeDeCo refuses
to put pressure on the Tech-World rulers to rein in their scientific
experimentation, claiming that its contract with the Tech-World
government begins and ends with the starport.

The Tech-World starport is a minor wonder of the subsector – the
starport is a huge black ovoid that reconfigures itself dynamically
to cope with rising or falling traffic. The interior walls are actually
curtains of a 'smart' bioplastic that can move and reshape themselves
to create larger or smaller landing bays and warehousing. Every
visitor is assigned a guide robot programmed to their needs and
security is assured by keying everything to the user's genetic code.

###### Ergo X767500-0

Ergo is a great failure of the General Development Company. In
800, Ergo was a relatively prosperous TL7 world; primitive, feudal
and insular, certainly but much more stable than many of the other
worlds in this sector. The Council of Barons had even successfully
driven off bands of raiders from Sindal subsector using primitive
atomic missiles and was experimenting with redeveloping jump
technology.

GeDeCo contacted the world in 802, offering to help fund the
construction of a starport. The Council of Barons agreed to the
proposal and construction started immediately on a new Class-A
port. As the new structure neared completion, the Barons began to
squabble over trade and tax revenues. The dispute escalated until it
turned into open war. The Council of Barons dissolved into a handful
of warring feudal states. One of the earliest attacks destroyed the
starport, forcing GeDeCo to look elsewhere for a transit port (they
eventually established Tech-World).

The Ergo war lasted more than a century and ended when a famine
swept over the planet. The population dropped by more than nine-
tenths in a combination of starvation and nuclear winter. The
civilised area of Ergo is now a small region surrounding the ruins
of the starport, ruled by a largely ineffectual Council of Barons who
still dream of vast wealth from space traffic and plot to somehow
rebuild the port. The rest of the planet is a hostile mix of radioactive
wasteland, cannibal tribes and pirate bases.

###### Argona B612586-9

Argona is a mining colony established by the PRQ corporation. More
than three-quarters of the planet is covered in thick glaciers, so the
miners bore down through the ice using hot-drill vehicles or orbital
mirrors to reach the mineral deposits. In addition to zuchai crystals
and other gemstones, Argona has significant copper, tungsten,
uranium and platinum deposits. A whole colony has grown up in
the tunnel networks under the glaciers, administered by a board of
trustees nominated by both the miners' union and the corporations.
Argona has a strong tradition of industrial action; during the
infamous Strike of '38, miners using hot-drillers collapsed part of a
glacier on top of an executive transport ship, trapping the corporate
executives there until they agreed to negotiate.

The approach to Argona's starport is a harrowing one. The port is
located in a huge artificial ice cavern some two hundred meters
below the surface. Approaching ships must fight their way through
the near-constant hurricanes and blizzards, then navigate down the
right chasm in the ice and finally fly down a narrow borehole barely
wider that the ship's beam.

At the starport, visitors can hire a hot-borer and go prospecting.
The glaciers block conventional prospecting methods such as
satellite scans, so the only way to find new mineral deposits is to
bore through the ice and collect samples. A lucky borer might make

his fortune by finding a vein of uranium or platinum-bearing rock
beneath the ice. There are stories of strange monsters living under
the glaciers, of ruined structures from some primordial civilization
and of zuchai crystal deposits of incredible size and value but most
of these stories are just fables spun by drunken miners to impress
greenhorns at the starport. There are no ice worms and certainly
tales of a giant crystal called the Eye of Argona must be purest
fantasy.

###### Browne B750A96-9

Its isolated position on the edge of the Great Rift makes Browne
a singularly unlikely place for a colony, especially a colony of
some thirty billion people. A heavy scout from the First Imperium
misjumped, stranding it here thousands of years ago. The scout
could not be repaired, so its crew decided to land and settle the
desert world. Fortunately, the commander of the scout ship was a
singularly intelligent and far-sighted woman who realised that they
would have to immediately plan for the long term. She set up a policy

of information transfer, ensuring that the scientific knowledge of the
group would not be lost even though they had no industrial base
to work from and make water rationing part of the new civilization
from the moment of landing (the scoutship's fuel purifiers were
adapted to produce potable water). They also began broadcasting
a distress call, knowing that it would take decades for the signal to
be detected.

No rescue ever came. The colony was left alone throughout the
entirety of the Second Imperium and the Long Night. They did
manage to settle the neighboring system of Villag using sublight
ships but other attempts to colonize worlds or reach civilised space
all failed. Browne was recontacted only in 354, by which time the
descendants of those fifteen scouts numbered more than fifteen
billion. The system is too far away for most trade ships to reach it
but J5 couriers do bring vitally needed items to the teeming masses
of Browne.

#### RANIB

Ranib subsector is entirely controlled by the Aslan Hierate. The subsector
can be divided broadly into two regions. The spinward area dominated
by _tsekho_ clans, clans whose culture or practices are at odds with the
orthodox culture of the _tlaukhu_. Many of these lesser clans were caught
between the second wave of settlers from the Hierate (backed by the
victorious _Tlaukhu_ ) and the expanding Florian League. The spinward
section of Ranib is dangerous territory for the unwary traveller, as both
cultural differences and frequent minor wars can pose a threat.

The trailing zone worlds from Isysewekh to Stohys are more closely
associated with the nearby sector of Silraaihe and are ruled by
'traditionalist' Aslan. Many of the worlds here have strong ties back
to the old Hierate; Ranib subsector is known as a hotbed of political
intrigue and clan manoeuvring.

Between the two areas is a dangerous no-clans-land, where
territories regularly change hands.

The oldest Aslan colonies in the Trojan Reach are here in Ranib. The
subsector is only seven parsecs from the world of Aulryakh, where
the Jump-5 route across the Great Rift ends.

###### Ftyewirl B4564LA-E

Arriving at Ftyewirl is a confusing experience for pilots who do not
know the system. Jump in and you can clearly see the dot of the
mainworld on your screen – but the beacon from the starport is
located millions of kilometers out. Ftyewirl Port orbits the fourth
planet in the system, an uninhabited ocean world rich in hydrogen.
Most ships dock at the port, refuel and jump out again without ever
visiting the inhabited third planet.

Approaching Ftyewirl itself is perilous. The planet is located in the
middle of an asteroid belt (technically, it is passing through an
asteroid belt that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago in a
cataclysmic collision between two larger moonlets; most of the larger
rocks have long since fallen to Ftyewirl but there are still plenty of
smaller objects that present a hazard to navigation), so pilots must
be extremely cautious. There are approach lanes that are mostly clear
but pilots are still advised to approach Ftyewirl at low speed.

The planet bears the scars of millennia of pummelling. Huge craters
scar all three continents; life within a kilometer of the seashore is rare
and fragile because of repeated tsunami and the atmosphere is thick
with dust. At night, the sky lights up as millions of meteorites streak
through the upper atmosphere. The colony of some fifty thousand Aslan
dwell in sheltered valleys, underground bunkers or in a city protected
by computer-controlled repulsors. The colony is owned by the Syoisuis
clan, who value their privacy. Other clans suspect Ftyewirl as being a
secret training camp for Syoisuis spies. Visitors are discouraged.

The planet has several mines, where the Aslan excavate deeply
buried iridium-rich meteors. The settlers also practise limited
agriculture and light industry.

###### Yekhtia B2233H6-B

This small world was originally settled as a transit point for J2 ships
moving from Aehahr to the 'renegade worlds' of the coreward
cluster; an underground starport was built around the year 0 of the
Imperium, with access via the south polar region. The planet circles
around its star remarkably quickly, with a year of just fifty-two days.
The surface temperature on Yekhtia exceeds 400° Kelvin during the
day, making the surface almost uninhabitable.

However, several hundred Aslan do live on the surface of this
seared planet. Two centuries ago, an Aslan noble was driven off
his territory by a young upstart. The noble, Ktolaihuihwouftairl, was
stupendously wealthy thanks to trade but had grown fat and lazy.
Rather than attempt to reconquer his territory or find a new domain,
he retreated to another of his holdings – Yekhtia.

The Aslan do not consider underground bases to be valuable territory.
A warrior must be able to look out over his domain, to run through it,
to chase prey across a landscape that echoes the open plains of Kusyu
where the Aslan evolved. Hostile worlds may force the Aslan to burrow
underground like yoois (meat-worms, a reducer invertebrate common to
Kusyu) but a lord does not live in a hole. He strides across open terrain
and knows that everything from where he stands to the far horizon is
his and his alone. Therefore, Ktolaihuihwouftairl could not claim his old
social standing based on the underground base at Yekhtia.

Fifty kilometers away from the starport, Ktolaihuihwouftairl discovered
a wide crater left by some ancient asteroid impact. His engineers
covered the crater with a tent of highly reflective foil and sealed the
edges. The foil reflected most of the sunlight and insulated the valley.
Over the course of a decade, the engineers were able to make the
environment within the crater viable for supporting Aslan life and the
crater was wide enough to count as surface terrain. Ktolaihuihwouftairl
could once again stand tall beside his fellow nobles.

Since those days, another five thousand square kilometers of
Yekhtia's surface has been tented. The tent material is strong
enough to hold in a thin atmosphere and can heal small cuts and
holes automatically but the inhabitants are extremely paranoid
about any damage to their home. Therefore, visitors to Yekhtia are
asked not to bring any knives or blades out of the starport and Aslan
are expected to bind their dewclaws down to ensure a hot-blooded
argument does not result in a lethal tear.

###### Aehahr B1004M9-C

This world is owned by a vassal clan of the Khaukhearl, the Khtiatiyeea. The
starport is located on the airless moon of a gas giant named Hlaifieayaher
( The Eye That Watches Over Deeds of Glory ) by the Aslan and is a minor
port used mainly by ships travelling on to Nora'a subsector.

Aehahr is best known for the neutral research facility established by the
Khtiatiyeea in 704. The facility consists of a cluster of structures on the
moon as well as several orbital factories and research stations and has
a population of some thirty thousand scientists drawn from all over

the Hierate. The best Aslan students compete for the prize of a place
at Aehahr. Its main focus is on medicine, computing, environmental
engineering and other topics without direct military applications.

Deep beneath the surface of Aehahr is a second research facility,
this one run solely by the Khaukhearl and their vassals. While
relics of the fabled Ancients were found in Aslan space, the center
of Ancient activity is believed to be somewhere in the Spinward
Marches and the Aslan have found far more traces of the Ancients
on worlds coreward of the Great Rift. This second research facility is
dedicated to studying relics of the Ancients in a long project to locate
more intact Ancient sites. The Khaukhearl fear that Humaniti's
greater access to Ancient artefacts will give the Third Imperium an
insurmountable technological edge – they have seen the black globe
loom large in their future and shudder.

###### Ftoakh E673AHC-C

This highly populated world is a source of tremendous shame to
the Aslan. Ftoakh was settled by several clans, initially the Wahtoi
and Aroaye'I. As more travellers came across the Great Rift, Ftoakh
welcomed them. It was a world shared by a dozen clans – old and
new, progressives and traditionalists, _tsekho_ and _khiraokhaor'ya_ alike.
Territorial disputes and challenges were resolved honorably by
challenges, assassinations and limited wars. The nobility of Ftoakh
were honored by the Hierate for adhering to the best practises
of the Aslan, proving that it was possible to have a civilization of
warriors without constant destructive warfare and offering hope for
reconciliation after the excesses of the Cultural Purge.

The war that engulfed Ftoakh was not started by any territory-
hungry noble or clan invasion. For hundreds of years, the world had
been shared by Aslan of radically different cultural groups and clans.
Wahtoi whose ancestors settled Ftoakh in the first place rankled at
having to share the planet with every newcomer who just crossed
the Great Rift. Traditionalist Yerlyaruiwo, defenders of Aslan purity,
were forced to share a world with deviants like the Taukhaotuar.

Ahroay'if traders looked suspiciously at Hrakoea pirates. The planet
was a powderkeg that smouldered even as the nobles congratulated
themselves on their civility.

The war began with rioting and claw mobs and escalated to organised
ethnic cleansing. When the clan militaries stepped in to defend their
civilians, full-scale open war broke out. Fortunately, the Ya'soisthea
were able to negotiate a truce between the fighting clans relatively
quickly and a neutral police force – the Euikhter – was formed to keep
the peace. Three years of war took its toll on Ftoakh – the starport
was destroyed and has yet to be rebuilt and the planet's industrial
regions were heavily damaged. Over twenty million Aslan died.

The Euikhter is an experiment in many ways – the Aslan do not
normally have a police force and so the Euikhter is based on human
models. Travellers with law enforcement experience can find
lucrative employment on Ftoakh, if they are willing to deal with a
planet divided by a dozen distinct cultures and a billion unresolved
grudges.

###### Hkesuh BAA07K8-B

Hkesuh is a tremendous world; hot and heavy. It is almost entirely
dry – the only surface water is a few patches of ice at the poles and
some scattered lakes. 99% of Hkesuh's water is either underground
in vast aquifers or locked in the colonies of single-cell organisms
that make up the entirety of the planet's native biosphere. These
hkesuhoates form reefs in the desert that stretch for thousands of
kilometers.

The world is ruled by the Taukhaotuar clan, who arrived here in the
wake of the Cultural Purge. The Taukhaotuar were driven out of the
Hierate for practising an extreme form of ancestor worship – the
ruling caste of the Taukhaotuar are clones of past male heroes and
ancestors. The firstborn male in each family is always a clone of
the father and will inherit the father's estate. Natural-born second
sons may never inherit their sire's domain but may go off and

conquer other worlds (and, if they are lucky, win enough honor
and renown to be considered for the immortality of cloning into the
next generation).

This continuity of leadership makes the Taukhaotuar stable and
conservative compared to other Aslan clans and so their primary
business is banking. They are strong allies of the Tlaiowaha but feud
with the ultra-traditionalist Yerlyaruiwo.

They have adapted well to their adopted desert homeworld. They
are nomadic, criss-crossing the desert on motorised caravans and
sailing on sandships. There is a small asteroid belt containing mostly
chunks of water-ice in the Hkesuh system and a band of Taukhaotuar
ice miners supply the world with most of its drinking water. Some
of the ice is mined and shipped home in tankers but most of the ice
is dispatched in the form of atmosphere-grazing comets. Thrusters
are attached to a chunk of ice, which is then flown on a course that
grazes Hkesuh's atmosphere. The asteroid burns up, releasing a
cloud of water vapour that then falls as rain across the desert. The
nomads follow these sudden rain belts and their animal herds feed
on the explosions of greenery that follow an asteroid pass.

###### Stohyus A5678N6-E

Stohyus is the homeworld of the Ahroay'if, a vassal clan of the Tlaiowaha
and one of the richest worlds in all of the _Ya'soisthea_. The Aslan call it the
Golden World; ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect the yellow
light of Stohyus' sun, causing the world to shimmer in the light. Territories
on Stohyus are almost as highly sought after as land on Kusyu.

For all its prestige, Stohyus is located uncomfortably far from
the clan's main focus, over in Tlaiowaha subsector. The clan's
corporations and younger, ambitious members have moved away
from Stohyus, leaving the world to aging males and hereditary htatei.
If this trend continues, then Stohyus will be rendered irrelevant to
the clan's fortunes and a burden on the clan's military forces – the
planet is attacked regularly by other clans trying to capture some
of the rich territories. Many of those who remain on Stohyus are
part of the so-called Ascendancy faction, who believe the Ahroay'if's
wealth should be parleyed into greater standing back in the Hierate
and eventual promotion into the Tlaukhu. The New Horizon faction,
made up mostly of younger members and corporate executives,
holds that the Tlaukhu and the old Hierate are really irrelevant to
the clan's future. Many members of the New Horizon have begun,
scandalously, to ape human behaviour. They dress as humans,
speak Anglic more than Trokh and are said by some to have even
eaten vegetable matter willingly.

The leader of the clan, the Ahroay'ifko, is the only member of the clan
whose support can tip the balance between the two factions but he is
restricted to his palace on the Golden World. He suffers from a rare and
currently incurable genetic disorder which causes extreme fatigue and
fur loss. Doctors from all over the Hierate have tried to find a treatment
but none have been successful. The Ahroay'ifko is considering seeking
out medical treatment from the Imperium (the technologically advanced
Darrians might have the necessary skills to save him) but doing so
would be seen as tacit support for the New Horizoners and might tear
the clan in two.

#### SILRAAIHE

Silraaihe subsector is also entirely claimed by the Aslan. The main
trade route from the Imperium to the J5 route across the Rift runs
through it, from Haealroiea to Aoiyras to Stehasu and then onto
Hkea'as and these worlds see a great deal of space traffic.

Much of the subsector is politically unstable; Silraaihe is full of
ambitious _ihatei_ and Aslan lords looking to increase their holdings.
Some say that Tlaiowaha with its emphasis on trade and corporate
intrigue is a female sector, in which case Silraaihe is unashamedly
male. Here is a wild region of space, where an Aslan warrior with a
bloody sword in one hand and a smoking rifle in the other can make
a name for himself. Hither come the conquerors, to tread the rich
worlds of Silraaihe beneath their clawed feet! Many of the worlds
in Silraaihe were originally owned by the Glorious Empire. Eoiw,
Erasaso, Earlyu and Ouiyloi were all Glorious Empire worlds that
were recently conquered by the Hierate or else abandoned by the
Empire.

Silraaihe is known for having a number of extremely dangerous
worlds. No less than six of the planets in the subsector harbour
native predators that are dangerous to the Aslan, ranging from the
man-brutes of Ouiyloi to the giant sharks of Teiseirle.

###### Eoiw B3306K4-E

This world lies right on the border of the Glorious Empire and was
conquered by the Hierate in 1103. Hulks of broken Glorious Empire
warships still hang in orbit where they burned; broken domes
litter the landscape. The Empire fought a last-ditch defence of this
planet by sending their human slaves out with explosive collars and
handguns and there are still Glorious Empire Aslan camps in the
transdome tunnels below the surface. The attackers – a mix of _ihatei_
bands and Hroakoea clan troops – are still working to secure all the
surviving domes.

The military base in orbit was originally a Glorious Empire facility
and was wrecked in the fighting. The conquerors are working to
repair it; currently, an Aslan warship is stationed there at all times,
providing power to the base. On its own, Eoiw has little value but the
Hroakoea clan intend to use it as a steppingstone towards further
attacks on the Empire.

###### Earlyu B9898L9-D

Earlyu's loss was a bitter pill for the Glorious Empire to swallow

+ the planet is rich in valuable resources, especially petrochemicals
and an anagathic moss. _Ihatei_ warriors attacked the planet in 772,
conquering over a third of its land area and establishing a new
starport in the center of the Great Swamp. The Khaukheairl clan
saw the success of these _ihatei_ and offered to support their war in

exchange for vassalage. In 801, the ihatei were made nobles of the
Khaukheairl and Khaukheairl warriors flooded onto the planet.

Since its fall, Earlyu has become an integral part of Silraaihe's
economy. The industrial complex of Siroal is a city-sized factory,
producing everything from pharmaceuticals to clonemeat to
synthetic fabrics. The human slave population originally numbering
some five million, was reduced to less than 500,000 by the wars
and diseases from the swampy regions. The Khaukheairl have
restricted the humans to a reservation in the swamps, where they
have a cottage industry of making counterfeit Imperial goods that
the Khaukheairl sell as 'genuine' human-made items back in the
Hierate.

###### Aisaoawi BAC5000-0

Aisaoawi is a hellish world of volcanoes and boiling oceans of salt.
The atmosphere is an acidic, sulphuric soup. Surveys have shown
that Aisaowi has considerable mineral deposits, although getting to
them is virtually impossible.

There have been three attempts to settle Aisaoawi and all three have
ended in bloody slaughter. The first was by an unknown Aslan clan
who crossed the Great Rift over a thousand years ago (historians
believe it was most likely the Rayur clan, who migrated along with
their vassals following their elimination from the Tlaukhu ). They built
the original starport and a mining settlement high atop a plateau,
where the atmosphere is much thinner and less dangerous.

At some point in the intervening centuries, the Glorious Empire
discovered the world and reactivated the mines. They abandoned
Aisaoawi within a year. At the time, it was believed the Empire
abandoned the world because it was too expensive to exploit the
planet's mineral reserves using weak human labour.

Finally, the Tlaiowaha reopened the mines in 1080. Soon afterwards,
the colonists reported sightings of something moving out in the
sulphur mists. When the next supply ship jumped into the system,
the colony did not respond to hails. A landing party discovered that
the starport and mines were empty; there were signs of weapons
fire and close combat everywhere but no bodies. The environmental
seals were breached, flooding the tunnels with the noxious
atmosphere.

Something is living on this hostile world, some alien race capable of
wiping out three separate Aslan colonies.

into a major world and the effective sector capital. During the early
days of Irlaiw, there were too few spacecraft to allow the population
to settle other worlds and the effort of taming the planet was too
great to allow for open conflict. Land on Irlaiw is therefore given as a
reward for successful entrepreneurs and highly ranked bureaucrats.
Among the older inhabitants of Irlaiw, there is no distinction between
male and female Aslan; females may hold territory and males are
trained to handle technology and money.

The Irlaiwi had to veil their culture during the Cultural Purge but this
was a mere surface change. An Irlaiwi lord may pretend in public to
defer to his female financial advisor, while a female landowner might
employ a male agent when dealing with more traditional nobles. Other
clans do not follow the Irlaiwi gender practices but do honor the
planet's system of assigning territory based on merit, not conquest.

The planet is vastly overpopulated and relies on regular shipments
of food (especially meat) from offworld. The starport's Class-C rating
reflects the sheer backlog of traffic; most ships will be kept waiting
in orbit for three to six days before being assigned a docking berth
and Irlaiwi traffic control is notorious for impounding vessels that
dare land without permission. The lower classes on Irlaiwi are fed
synthetic meat and the planet's biotechnology industry is the most
advanced of its kind in the _Ya'soisthea._

###### Ouiyloi C5747L9-C

Ouiyloi is another world recently recaptured from the Glorious
Empire. It was one of the Empire's most productive agricultural
colonies; Ouiyloi's rolling farmlands were divided into thousands
of small baronies and plantations. An Aslan manor house stood in
the center of each plantation. The slaver lords oversaw their human
labourers using floating grav-platforms and skimmers. Produce
from the farms was taken to the capital, Ouiy, using high-speed
maglev trains. At least, that was before the war.

The war for Ouiyloi lasted less than a month. When the Hierate first
attacked, the government at Ouiy sent word to each manor ordering
them to send warriors to the various mustering points by train. The
attacking Aslan were able to divide and conquer the Ouiyloian forces
by bombing the rail lines. Defeating the planet's front-line warriors
was a much easier and less costly job than mopping up the guerrilla
forces left behind to defend the scattered manors.

The Glorious Empire Aslan of Ouiyloi were known for their slaver
raids. They sent ships to out across the Reach to purchase or capture

human slaves. They also used slavery to punish political prisoners.
The slaves were horribly mistreated, with malnutrition and disease
being widespread among the manor slaves. While the burden of the
human population has been partially lifted, the Aslan have not freed
the slaves. Approximately 10% of the humans on Ouiyloi are first-
or second-generation slaves, captured from human colonies along
the border of the Glorious Empire or the children of such captives.
The Aslan have agreed to repatriate these slaves but the rest have
nowhere else to go.

There are few dangerous predators on Ouiyloi but the forests are
still extremely hazardous. The Glorious Empire somehow captured
a number of Feskal from the Florian League and tried to use them
as slaves. Deprived of Barnai leadership, the Feskal reverted to
savagery and escaped into the forests. These Feskal have grown
especially large and strong, possibly due to meddling with their
genetic code. They do not distinguish between Glorious Empire and
Hierate Aslan and are strong enough to break the neck of an adult
male with a single blow. In addition to the physical threat posed by
the brutes, the Feskal are also a significant political problem for the
Hierate – if the Florian League discovers the enslaved Feskal, they
are likely to react with all-out war.

###### Awaweaw E8558N9-9

Awaweaw is located at the fringe of Aslan space and is newly
colonized by the Aslan. The world has a lush biosphere, dominated
by titanic saurians, floating gasbag-like 'sky jellyfish' and aerial rays
who have a wingspan of more than twenty meters and glide on
thermals. There is also a native sophont race, a species of scaled
humanoids who had reached TL2 by the time the Aslan arrived.
They call themselves the Yont and their world Yonta. There are
approximately two hundred million Yont on Awaweaw. The Yont
tribes that have encountered the Aslan so far believe the aliens to
be gods.

Today, Awaweaw is claimed by the Ahroay'if clan and is ruled by a
charismatic young noble who styles himself Prince Wauiatyakhiyw.
He is a second son of the Ahroay'ifko himself, showing the
importance the clan attributes to this new colony. While all of the
planet's land has been divided up into Aslan territories, the Aslan
colony has not yet begun to impinge on the Yont settlements. The
two races currently have very different goals; the Yont are slowly
learning that the Aslan are not 'sky gods' and are in fact potential
allies (or slavers), while the Aslan are busy building their colony
(including a starport) and exploring their new world.

Both Yont and Aslan are threatened by the predatory saurians of
Awaweaw. The Yont live in fear of hostile sky rays and great lizards
called Haums (the sight of an Aslan warrior killing a haum with a fusion
rifle was what convinced the Yont that the Aslan are gods). Prince
Wauiatyakhiyw has grand plans to hunt these mighty predators and to
use the Yont as a source of cheap labour. The planet promises to make
him and his clan even richer.

The Ahroay'if were not the first to discover Awaweaw. The world
was explored by the Imperial Scout Service centuries ago and there
is a small GeDeCo outpost hidden in the jungle. The GeDeCo
employees were investigating methods for bringing the Yont up to a
higher level of technology without destabilizing their primitive tribal
society; now that the Aslan are here, the GeDeCo team have had to
change their plans and are currently exploring ways to turn the Yont
against the Aslan.

#### HKEA'AS

The Hkea'as subsector is the trailing edge of the Aslan Empire in
this region of Charted Space. A trade route into the commercial zone
of Tlaiowaha runs from Ralaw to Ereah and then onto Aiwewakh.
The _Ya'soisthea_ base at Afteakter is also an important world in the
subsector but most of the worlds here are backwaters by Aslan
standards – second-rate worlds where second-rate lords rule or worlds
that have not yet become important to the clans who own them.

The Tiykhisto clan are important in this subsector, holding the
worlds of Heweko and Khtiyrlo at the moment. The Tiykhisto are
aggressive and ambitious and the Tiykhistoko (the clan leader) has
declared that the Aslan race have lost their way and become a 'race
of merchants and peddlers' when they should be conquering the
stars. He claims that ever since the Peace of Fthair, the Imperium
has been placating the Aslan with trade and lulling them into
weakness. Only by breaking off trade relations with the Imperium
and beginning a new period of expansion can the Aslan reclaim their
honor. The Tiykhistoko has many supporters and followers in the
_ihatei_ community and his sermons and speeches are avidly traded
in the _ihatei_ camps.

The trader clans, especially the Ahroay'if, are obviously strongly
opposed to the Tiykhisto. Following proof that the Tiykhisto were
behind a series of pirate raids in the Borderland subsector, the
Ahroah'if and their Tlaiowaha backers attacked the Tiykhisto and
conquered the world of Eaohfose. Adding insult to injury, the
Tlaiowaha established a naval base at Eaohfose specifically to watch
for Tiykhisto raiders.

Hkea'as is at the edge of the Great Rift. There is nothing beyond the
border for dozens of parsecs (apart from the two motes of matter
that make up the two stars of the Binary subsector). Perhaps it is
some spiritual cold, leeching in from interstellar space that makes
this sector so unappealing to most visitors. Perhaps it is the lack of
vitality – there are few worlds left to conquer here in Hkea'as. Five
hundred years ago, this was a wild frontier, an unexplored region
brimming with new territories but the waves of _ihatei_ who once
gathered in camps here are gone. Some have gone back to the wars
of Silraaihe or to fight the Glorious Empire, others have migrated
coreward to the Borderlands, Tlaiowaha and Goertel to find new
worlds. Hkea'as's glories are past.

The Aslan hold roughly 40% of the subsector. Most of the rest is
empty space, the beginning of the Great Rift but there are three
independent worlds in the subsector – Burgess, Tisilli and Gikarlum.

###### Ayayo B0006H4-D

The Ayayo Transit Point was established as a jump-2 link from the
crossroads at Stehasu to the Ya'soisthea base at Afeakter. Ayayo is
a system without any planets or gas giants, just a large number of
asteroids and comets. The hydrogen for the transit point is shipped in
by automated tanker from Ohraihah or gathered from the Oort cloud
by ramscoop probes. There are a number of belt miner communities
in the system, operating out of a large asteroid port called Tealreala.
Up until fifty years ago, Ayayo was a brief, dull stop on a Jump-2
crossing and the permanent population at the Transit Point was less
than a hundred Aslan.

In 1081, a miner on the fringes of the Lesser Ayayo Belt surveyed
asteroid A563-221-9439G. She detected an unusual concentration of
heavy metals, suggesting the rock was unusually rich. She deployed
a swarm of mining drones to chew up the rock and extract any usable
ore. When the lead drone activated its laser, the asteroid responded
with a pulse of energy that destroyed the drone, crippled the miner
and crashed computers across the system.

Aslan scientists ended up stripping away the rock by hand, as any
directed energy discharge near the asteroid caused a lesser but still
highly dangerous pulse. Beneath the rock, they found a pyramidal
object roughly thirty meters on each axis. The object is made out
of a superdense substance that resists all attempts to damage or
analyse it. There are 256 movable panels on each surface; each panel
is marked with a glyph. Researchers suspect that the object can be
'unlocked' with the right configuration of glyphs but the number of
potential combinations is astronomical. The researchers are looking
for more clues before they attempt to manipulate the device, which is
believed to be of Ancient origin.

Since the pyramid's discovery, several other smaller items have been
found in the asteroids of the lesser belt. Researchers suspect these
are tools or other debris left over from the assembly of the pyramid.
Access to the lesser belt is restricted and the system is patrolled by
Ya'soisthea ships to ensure no Ancient artefacts go missing.

###### Afeakter A69A6NA-B

Afeakter is a water-world officially owned by the Aroaye'i clan but it
has become the de facto base of the Ya'soisthea. The council of clans
meets on a different world each year but Afeakter is the home of
the council's bureaucracy and support staff. There are several naval
bases in orbit; it is here that combined clan task forces muster for
assignments such as convoy escort, war games or joint offensives.

Most Aslan bases on the surface are on artificial islands of ice,
cut from the icebergs at the poles and chemically treated to resist
melting. Some of these ice islands are hundreds of kilometers wide
and have lasted for centuries. Other bases are built in shallow water
or on floating platforms.

There are also approximately a hundred thousand Aslan living in
underwater habitats, who consider themselves the real inhabitants
of Afeakter and often feud with the bureaucrats and corporate cats
attached to the _Ya'soisthea_. The city of Owiykhtoih is the capital
world and is located one hundred meters below the surface.
There is a large surface platform floating above the city, linked by
flexible elevator tubes. The city is accessible by spaceship; visitors
may either land on the surface and dock there or fly down a larger
tube. Owiykhtoih is a beautiful city, dappled in blue light from the
translucent dome.

The lack of solid land on Afeakter is why the Aroaye'i were willing to
effectively cede the planet to the _Ya'soisthea_ several centuries ago.
Today, Afeakter is a much more important and valuable world and
the Aslan lords of the planet grumble that their clan gave too much
to the bureaucrats. The 'Free Afeakter' movement is growing in
strength, sponsored by the leading noble, Ulryalehuasiy.

###### Tisilli B78A945-A

Tisilli is a neutral world two parsecs outside Aslan space. The
population is a mix of Aslan colonists (75%) and human natives
(25%). The humans are descendants of explorers from Drinax and
had fallen into Dark Ages barbarism by the time the Aslan arrived.

The Aslan population are all clanless Outcasts and low-standing
_awkhea_ who settled Tisilli two centuries ago. Most are descended
from the followers of an Aslan prophet named Tarelriylr, who
preached a more egalitarian social structure and claimed that the
souls of the ancestors were reborn not in their direct descendants
but in those Aslan who faced the greatest challenges. In other
words, the poor and the oppressed were the most likely to be the
reincarnations of ancient heroes.

Tarelriylr's followers were joined by more Outcasts and _ihatei_. The
human natives of Tisilli were integrated into Aslan society and
are counted as equals, especially as they taught the Aslan how to
cultivate the fast-growing reef polyps used for construction. The
world's status as an independent free port proved attractive to
several Aslan corporations and the economy grew quickly.

The government of Tisilli is made up of landholding Aslan males
and human elders, as well as elected council of females from
both races. The two houses of government are deadlocked on the
question of clanhood – the male landholders believe that Tisilli's
population should apply for clan status from the Tlaukhu , becoming
the Tarelriylr clan. The females fear that entry into Hierate politics
would make their world a target and upset Tisilli's relationship with
the megacorporations who drive the economy.

###### Khtiyrlo DA887KA-B

This world is home to the Tiykhisto clan, who also control the
nearby Heweko system. They recently migrated to the world and
are still taming the jungles of their new home (the old Tiykhisto
homeworld was in the Riftspan Reaches). The world is rapidly being
transformed into a fortress, with buried meson gun emplacements
and cities that are half military base. The world is a rich one and
the Tiykhisto have attracted millions of settlers. It is estimated that
up to half a billion Tiykhisto warriors and vassals will migrate to
Khtiyrlo in the next decade.

A war of assassins has been declared between the Tiykhisto and their
Ahroah'if rivals. To defend against attacks, all ships visiting the world
are searched for assassins and all Tiykhisto nobles wear full armor at
all times. All their armor is painted identically in the clan colours and
HUD systems in the armor allow the nobles to recognize themselves.
The Tiykhistoko walks unseen among his nobles and in this fashion
he has avoided a dozen assassination attempts to date.

As the War of Assassins has yet to produce any results, the Ahroah'if
have begun a trade embargo against the Tiykhisto, cutting them off
from the Aslan industrial planets of the Riftspan Reaches. GeDeCo
is one of the few human corporations permitted to trade on Tiykhisto
and has found the world a ready market for high-tech and industrial
goods. The Tiykhisto ihatei are gathering for another invasion as
territory on Khtiyrlo is already growing scarce. The worlds of Burgess
and Gikarlum are both easy prey and well within range; Burgess is
likely to be the first target.

###### Gikarlum B110587-9

No one would willingly settle Gikarlum – it is a lifeless rock without
any notable resources. The unfortunate settlers here are the
descendants of a Drinaxian colony ship that was en route to Tisilli.
The ship's drives failed and it ended up making a soft landing on
Gikarlum (the world means ' Opportunity ' in the Drinax dialect). The
colony has spread out from the wreck of that ship, the King Hurg V.

The system of ranks and positions on the colony ship has become a
hereditary caste system, so the ruler of Gikarlum is the Captain and
there are castes of Engineers, Stewards, Navigators and so forth.
The lowest caste, Passengers, are made to labour in the hydroponic
caves.

A brilliant young engineer managed to rebuild the _King Hurg's_ jump
drive and install it in a smaller ship, allowing Gikarlum to re-establish
contact with the rest of the galaxy. Gikarlum once traded extensively with
Burgess (well, as extensively as you can trade with a merchant navy of
ten ships) but the recent expansion of the Tiykhisto clan into the area has
blocked this trade route.

###### Burgess B796633-6

Burgess colony was settled by exiles from the Kingdom of Drinax.
The bizarre world is dominated by species of fungi – there are
mushroom-like plants hundreds of meters tall in the fungal forests

of Burgess. The 'plains' are covered in a thick carpet of mold. The
atmosphere is tainted with quadrillions of spores that can infest the
lungs of a human; 'bursting' was the most common form of death
among the first settlers. Burgess scientists managed to tame their
world, establishing sealed cities and developing anti-fungal sprays
and filter masks. Edible mushrooms were cultivated, allowing the
population to grow swiftly.

Burgess has always been at war. Initially, the Burgess Emergency
Committee was at war with the Kingdom of Drinax; today, they are
at war with the Aslan Hierate. The population of Burgess are kept in
a constant state of paranoia and invasion drills are held every day.
Every adult citizen of Burgess is required to practise weapons drills
and is considered part of the army reserve. The Burgess forces are
equipped with 'puffball guns' in addition to conventional firearms.
These puffball guns fire especially lethal but short-lived fungal
spores that are engineered to devour protective filters and plastics.

#### BINARY

And then, there is Binary.

This is a starless waste, with only two inhabited
systems. The Aslan have utterly ignored Binary,
as it is out of range of even their best jump drives.
Only races with TL15 Jump-6 vessels can make the
hazardous crossing from world to world required to
reach Binary subsector.

In the 700s, a long-range Imperial scout vessel
discovered the world of Auitawry. Such a world could
not be hospitable – Auitawry orbits so close to its sun
that the daytime heat should have caused the oceans
to boil and the radiation is much too intense for any
life to survive. Nonetheless, the scout ship detected
liquid water on Auitawry's surface. Some of the crew
suggested it could be a sensor error but the captain
ordered the ship to investigate.

Assignment to Sarage base is seen as a punishment by naval personnel. The base is much too far away from any civilization for there to
be any action, on or off duty and the base is so secret that the personnel can never discuss their duties with anyone. The only excitement
comes when one of the scientists gets into trouble with an Ancient defence mechanism and that is the sort of 'excitement' that is normally
associated with disintegration.

Six months later, the scout ship arrived back in the Imperium and
the captain immediately demanded an audience with the Archduke
of Deneb. The Sarage naval base was established as soon as possible
to guard Auitawry and conduct research. Sarage is considered
Imperial property and is one of the most secure planets behind the
claw.

Auitawry is one of the best-preserved Ancient sites ever discovered.
The Droyne population dwell in a city of wonders. Everything is
controlled by psionic impulses, from basic facilities in every nest
to huge automated factories capable of assembling starships. After
four centuries of work, researchers have learned comparatively little
about Auitawry's purpose – the Droyne city appears to be nothing
more than an adjunct or possibly a control system for the vast
Ancient machinery buried deep beneath the surface.

#### ADVENTURING IN THE

#### TROJAN REACH

###### PLAYERS! THIS SECTION IS FOR THE REFEREE ONLY

The Spinward Marches is the default _Traveller_ setting and is ideal as
a starting point for adventuring. The Marches are a backwater of the
Imperium; there is enough law and civilization to keep the players
in line but not so much that they feel stifled. Roleplaying games by
their very nature need a little anarchy.

In the Trojan Reach, the 'anarchy' dial gets turned up a notch.
Outside of Pax Rulin, Gazulin and Tobia, there is no Imperial law.
The characters can do whatever they want – and so can anyone else.
The starport is no longer a haven of order and what you could rely
on as basic rights are no longer assured. Outside the Imperium,
might makes right. If the Marches are the dangerous frontier, then
the Trojan Reach is the badlands.

###### Under the Aslan Claw

The Aslan Hierate is going to invade the Trojan Reach.

This is inevitable. Even if the Aslan wished to prevent the invasion,
they have no choice. They are locked by cultural and biological urges

to expand and the Reach is too weak and vulnerable for them to
resist. A rising tide of ihatei will one day wash over the Trojan
Reach. Dozens of worlds will fall. Everyone who has the slightest
awareness of the politics of Charted Space can see this invasion
coming. It may come in five years, a decade or a century but it
cannot be stopped. The shadow of the cats lies over the whole
Trojan Reach.

Some worlds are preparing to fight the Aslan swarm. If they can
hold out and make themselves a prickly target, then maybe, just
maybe, the ihatei will go for another easier world. Others are
running to hide behind the Imperium's skirts, hoping that client
state status will protect them from the Aslan. The governments
of most worlds in the Reach are too consumed by local affairs or
their own minor squabbles to be aware of the Aslan; these worlds
are doomed.

For the Imperium, the question is where to draw the line. If it
holds its current position at Pax Rulin and Tobia, then it effectively
cedes the rest of the Reach to the Aslan and abandons the few
client states in the region. Worse, if the Aslan border is that close
to the Imperium, then it will mean a return to the Aslan Border
Wars as the young Aslan raid across the frontier. The Imperium
needs to maintain a buffer zone, like it did at Reaver's Deep – but
where the edges of this buffer zone should be, and how the Aslan
can be convinced to respect it, are matters that fray the nerves of
naval commanders and military analysts. The forces needed to
hold back the Aslan are also needed to protect against Zhodani
and Vargr aggression.

The only factor that might be able to stop the inevitable
Aslan invasion would be a civil war between the clans. The
Cultural Purge put an end to Aslan expansion for centuries,
so a war between clans in the Trojan Reach might give the
independent worlds and the Imperium time to build defences
against the Aslan flood. All-out wars are rare among the Aslan due
to their practise of limited conflict and honor duels and the one
thing that might provoke a civil war would be an insult so great
that extermination is the only option.

The clans who have the most to lose from an invasion of the
Imperium are the trader clans like the Tlaiowaha and Ahroah'if,
both of whom profit far more from stable, friendly relations than
from war and conquest.

###### Clan, Ya'soisthea and Tlaukhu

Aslan politics is notoriously confusing and unstable and this is
especially true in the Trojan Reach. An ambitious Aslan noble in
the Reach has to navigate the web of clan politics, dealing with
entrenched elder males who control the clan's territory and older
females who hold the wealth. Beyond the clan, there are vassals
and suzerains to command or obey, allies to placate or goad, rivals
to crush... and two separate quasi-governments.

As an institution, the _Tlaukhu_ is vastly more powerful and influential
than the upstart _Ya'soisthea_. The _Tlaukhu_ is the central authority of
the entire Hierate and determines overall Aslan policy. Defy the
_Tlaukhu_ 's commands and you defy the combined voices of the
greatest Aslan clans. Promotion to the _Tlaukhu_ is the ultimate goal
of every ambitious clan and the prestige and honor of _Tlaukhu_
membership are second to none. However, the _Tlaukhu_ is seated
hundreds of parsecs away and the fastest ship takes months to get
to Kusyu and back. It is a fiercely traditionalist group, refusing to
tolerate any 'deviant' Aslan culture.

The _Ya'soisthea_ is a much more ad hoc organization and has no
influence outside the Trojan Reach/Beyond/Riftspan Reaches zone
(and has relatively little influence within that zone, anyway). It lacks
the grandeur and prestige of the _Tlaukhu_ but is much more flexible
and tolerant of different beliefs. More importantly, the _Ya'soisthea_ is
based right here in the Trojan Reach. It may have less power but it
can bring its influence to muster much more quickly.

The _Tlaukhu_ has little interest in the Trojan Reach as long as
profitable trade is maintained with the Imperium. The _Ya'soisthea_
was originally formed in response to that official disinterest but
now has its own long-term goals, such as the destruction of the
Glorious Empire and the development of the Trojan Reach clans.
Currently, the two organizations' aims are not incompatible but if
the _Ya'soisthea_ thrives, it will raise the standing of all the clans in the
Trojan Reach – including the 'deviant' clans who fled Hierate space
during the Purge. The _Tlaukhu_ clans will not consider a deviant clan
to be their equal.

When the _Tlaukhu_ pulls one way and the _Ya'soisthea_ another, how
will the characters act?

###### Fading Glories of Empire

The Glorious Empire makes a fantastic villain for games in the Trojan
Reach – it is a fascist race of slaver cat monsters! Everyone, from the
Imperium, to independent humans, to Hierate Aslan, gets to shoot
Glorious Empire slavers and feel good about it. If you do not want to
start a war between the Hierate and the Imperium, then the Glorious
Empire makes an excellent substitute. The Empire might invade any
world within a dozen parsecs of their border, putting most worlds in
Goertel, Yggdrasil, Nora'a, Dpres, Sindal and Tlaiowaha subsectors
at risk. For a simple adventure involving the Empire, just have them
invade or raid a world when the Player Characters are visiting. The
characters have to escape the slavers or rescue their allies from a
horrible fate. For longer-term campaigns, the characters could be
involved in a war to reclaim a world conquered by the Glorious
Empire. The slave population means that human infiltrators can
hide in a Glorious Empire city while on a mission.

Currently, the Glorious Empire is licking its wounds after recent
losses but like any animal, it is most dangerous when cornered...

###### There Are Little Kingdoms

The tiny kingdoms like the Belgardian Sojournate or Strend Cluster
can be interesting places to set a series of adventures or a whole
campaign. Unlike the Imperium, where the characters are one band
of adventurers and traders among millions, they might be one of
a small number of free ships in such a small kingdom. As such,
the characters have much more influence than they normally would
have. Just having a functioning, jump-capable starship means the
characters are a potential threat to the government or perhaps they
can become special agents for the state and be sent on missions.
If, say, the Senlis Foederate wants to make contact with another
world in Tobia subsector, they might send their trusted agents on
this dangerous mission.

The little kingdoms let the Referee play with governments and
cultures that would not fit into the greater Imperium, like collapsing
civilizations, transhumanist groups or weird swords-and-starships
pulp kingdoms.

###### Convoys, Pirates and Raiding

Trade in the Trojan Reach is a much more hazardous endeavor
than in civilised space but the rewards are commensurately greater.
Ships departing Tobia or Tlaiowaha subsector travel in convoys of
a dozen or more and are escorted by the military of the Imperium
or Hierate.

In game terms, the Referee should give a positive DM when trading
in the Trojan Reach to reflect the fact that there are fewer traders
operating in the area and that it is possible to obtain rare items such
as Aslan or Florian technology

Characters engaged in speculative trade in the Reach risk attack by
pirates. There are dozens of pirate bands operating in the sector, using
corsairs or smaller vessels for the most part. Alternatively, characters
can launch careers as pirates themselves, in a sector where there is
far less danger of being exterminated by an Imperial warship.

###### The Unexplored Quarters

Menorial and Egyrn subsectors are virtually unexplored by the
Imperium, as are portions of the Borderlands, Dpres and Yggdrasil.
Scouts have mapped the subsectors but other than the result of a
cursory survey, little is known about the cultures and inhabitants
of worlds in this sector. The characters could be sent to gather
information on worlds in any of these subsectors – their patron
could be any group from the Scout Service, to Imperial intelligence,
to a megacorporation, to the Traveller's Aid Society, to a tour guide.
The choice of patron would determine what sort of information the
characters are sent to retrieve; a campaign where the characters are
Imperial agents looking for ways to prepare independent worlds to
resist Aslan invasion will be very different to a game where they are
wandering restaurant reviewers.

###### General Development Company

The General Development Company is the largest and most
powerful megacorporation operating in the Trojan Reach, outside of
those who trade only on the Aslan/Imperium trade route. Founded
in the wake of the civil war to encourage trade and development
in the fringes of the Imperium, GeDeCo is hailed as a benevolent
organization, something halfway between a trading company and
an investment fund. The company is famed for taking the long view
in its efforts to help isolated or backwards worlds develop and join
the interstellar community. In fact, GeDeCo takes a very long view
and its ultimate goal is something far more than mere trade.

The company's ethos changed soon after it established a second
home port on Vorito/Tlaiowaha in 841. The Trojan Reach directorate
was given a wide latitude by Head Office on Deneb to make decisions.
The Trojan Reach directorate hired a scientist named Gaemel
Jaskarl to advise them on long-term policy. Jaskarl was a criminal
under Imperial law, a psychohistory researcher who claimed to be
able to predict the future of the Trojan Reach. In 853, he produced
a document referred to as the Jaskarl Report. The full report is kept
in heavily guarded vaults on Vorito but some of his conclusions are
well known in GeDeCo. He predicted a complete take-over of the
Trojan Reach by the Aslan and that the whole Domain of Deneb was
in danger of collapse and anarchy unless steps were taken.

The Trojan Reach section of GeDeCo has dedicated itself to using
the Jaskarl Report to change the future. In addition to its standard
policy of recontacting lost or failed colonies and 'uplifting' them to
civilization, the company has embarked on a multi-century project
of averting this takeover – by any means necessary. GeDeCo has
fostered trade throughout the Reach – the Florian Trade Corridor is
one of its great successes, for example – but has also interfered with
the politics of many worlds and is engaged in espionage, supplying
weapons, genetic engineering and other 'black projects'. Agents of
the company are in place as 'advisors' or 'technical consultants' in
independent worlds across the subsector, preparing for the conflict
to come. Better a Trojan Reach eternally at war with the Aslan than
a sector under the claw!

GeDeCo's head office in Deneb has yet to realise that its Trojan
Reach branch has mutated from a state-sanctioned development
fund into a shadow government. They have noticed that the Trojan
Reach branch consistently underperforms compared to the Riftspan
branch and Denebian auditors are a bigger threat to the security of
GeDeCo's grand plans than any Imperial spy.

GeDeCo has continued to research and develop psychohistorical
techniques, in breach of Imperial law. Their main goal is to adapt
psychohistory to the Aslan, allowing them to manipulate the
different clans and trigger internal conflicts. Dr. Jaskarl (still alive
thanks to anagathics and cybernetic enhancement) believes that his
calculations are nearly complete. Three decades ago, he departed
with a team of researchers to consult experts in the Hive Federation;
he is expected to return in 1111.

Theev in Sindal subsector is one of GeDeCo's dirty little secrets. The
pirate planet is covertly funded and manipulated by the company,
who passes on intelligence about trade convoys to the raiders.
GeDeCo uses Theev to weaken its rivals and to force independent
worlds to accept GeDeCo development contracts. The long-term
intent is to force the Aslan to divert more resources to escorting
trade ships and less to conquering independent worlds.

###### Secrets of the Floriani

The Floriani were not merely transplanted by the Ancients – they were
created by the Ancients. The Floriani are not humans, they are androids
modelled on the human form. Three hundred thousand years ago, the
Floriani awoke in the cloning tubes where they were grown. While the
androids are capable of reproducing conventionally, over a third of
the Florian population is still produced in the cloning tanks.

Floriani age and die much like humans do, although they are capable of
living for up to two hundred years without anagathics. The Floriani are
nearly identical to one another; they all have the same blood type, for
example and have only small variations in facial features and behaviour.
The Floriani were created as an 'improved' version of base Humaniti,
specialized as lab assistants (Barnai) and labourers (Feskals).

Floria has far more active Ancient technology than visitors realise.
The Floriani claim that the sites they show tourists are the full extent
of the ruins but truth is that the whole planet is one vast Ancient
machine. There was no 'Aslan scoutship' that the Floriani found and
used to reverse-engineer jump drive technology; they discovered a still-
functional Ancient warship in a chamber deep beneath Floria's surface.
The Floriani have the keys to much of the knowledge of the Ancients.
Unfortunately, they have no idea what do to with it. The Floriani know
they were created for some purpose and some Ancient artefacts trigger
race memories, leading the Barnai to suspect that they are part of
some elaborate experiment. If they find the right artefact or place, then
perhaps the Floriani will learn why they were created.

The Floriani have an instinctive dread of psionics. Their first contact
with the Zhodani led to the League closing its borders for decades.

The mere hint of psionic activity causes Feskals to flee in a panic
and Barnai feel extremely ill and nervous in the presence of a known
telepath. Attempting to scan a Floriani mind causes painful feedback
in both the subject and the psion. The Barnai suspect that there are
Ancient secrets lodged inside their minds that are shielded against
telepathic intrusion.

While the Floriani have learned a great deal about physics and
engineering, their grasp of biology and chemistry is lacking – they
learned all their science from the Ancient devices left behind and
while the Barnai are extremely adept at memorising and categorising,
they have no ability to make intuitive leaps or be creative. They
have used human scientists to investigate Floriani biology (and
eliminated these scientists afterwards, before they could reveal any
Florian secrets). The results are deeply worrying – the Floriani grown
in clone-tanks show radically different brain activity to natural-born
Floriani. The colonists in the rest of the League are rapidly diverging
from the 'pure' originals on the homeworld. The two strands of
Floriani still behave in the same way and there are no other signs
of divergence but something strange is happening in the brains of
natural-born Floriani, as if some Ancient program is being corrupted
by genetic drift.

###### Ancient Legacy

The Floriani are not the only legacy of the Ancients in the Trojan Reach.
On the far side of the sector is the world of Auitawry, which also survived
the cataclysmic wars of the Ancients nearly intact. For one world to survive
from that time is remarkably – two within a few dozen parsecs of each
other suggests that some force protected the Trojan Reach from the worst
effects of the wars. If this is the case, if one of the Ancients shielded their
cities and planets in the Reach from destruction, then there could be other
Ancient facilities as-yet undiscovered. The Imperium has considered more
than two-thirds of the sector to be 'unexplored' and Auitawry shows that
the Ancients were willing to build on the most hostile and unlikely worlds.
The Ancients could be anywhere.

Ayayo, deep in Aslan space, may hold the key to this mystery. The
cryptic symbols on the black pyramid found in that system have
defied analysis by the Aslan but ten minutes of comparison between
the symbols and the glyphs on a Droyne coyn would show a distinct
resemblance. The pyramid can be activated by a sufficiently intelligent
Droyne; when switched on, it projects a spatial-distortion field that
completely protects those inside the field from the effects of gravity, no
matter how intense. A ship protected by this field could fly into a black
hole, like the artificial singularity at 627-301.

## AASLANSLAN ANDAND T TRAVELLERRAVELLER G GAMESAMES

This chapter discusses methods and ideas for using the Aslan race
in your _Traveller_ games, and is intended primarily for the Referee,
although players of Aslan characters may also wish to consult it.
Whether your games include a single Aslan wanderer or take place in
the very heart of the Hierate, there are certain factors that should be
taken into consideration.

#### ASLAN IN THE GAME

Aslan are very similar to humans in most ways, and are far less alien
than the Hivers or Droyne (or even, in many ways, the Zhodani).
They think in ways that are comprehensible to humans, have similar
social, legal and financial systems, and can use human technology and
equipment. The Referee can, for the most part, treat Aslan and human
characters the same way.

The question of territory is one that may affect games. Aslan,
especially males, are driven to acquire territory. In a game with
a mix of Aslan and human characters, the Aslan obsession with
territory may be an unwelcome distraction, especially if the group
travels extensively. The crew of a free trader are unlikely to want
to stop trading just because the Aslan character likes the look of
a frontier world and wants to claim it as his own. The territorial
drive should play a part in the game, but should not be allowed to
dominate it, any more than a noble character's political intrigues
or a psion's quest to master the powers of the mind should be
allowed to dominate the game. One adventure every few sessions
might showcase this aspect of the Aslan – perhaps a misjump
leads the Player Characters to discover a verdant and valuable
world, and giving the Aslan character a chance to improve his
Territory by claiming the world and setting up a settlement – but
the game should not revolve around Territory claims. Either have
Territory be the final reward when the Aslan character leaves the
game, or have him hire a seneschal to manage his domain while
he continues adventuring.

The male unfamiliarity with money and technology is another aspect
of the Aslan that should be treated with a light touch. Nothing is
more annoying than a player who seizes on one small trait of his
character and reminds everyone of it at every opportunity. Yes,
your male Aslan does not understand technology or money, but he
has seen a computer console before, and can survive for a day in
a technological society. He may not know how to handle money
without the Independence skill, but he knows vaguely what a small
and a large sum of money is (relative to his Social Standing, anyway).
The Referee should include the occasional moment of comic relief or
times when the plot turns on the male's cultural bias against using
money or operating complex technology, but for most situations,
assume the Aslan male muddles through somehow or one of the
other Player Characters helps him.

#### ROLEPLAYING ASLAN

For either gender, always remember that you are the youngest and
proudest of the major races.

You are not weak Hivers; you do not need to rely on conniving and
manipulating. You take what you want with your claws and teeth!
You are not pathetic Droyne; your race has carved out an empire
amid the stars. You are not cowardly K'kree; red blood surges
through your veins, and you know the thrill of the hunt, the kill. You
are not mongrel Vargr; you are the pure product of millions of years
of predatory evolution. You are not divided Humaniti, fragmented
into dozens of meaningless divisions and deluded by politics.

You are Aslan. This universe is your hunting ground. All you survey
is yours for the taking.

Look around you at the other Player Characters. Smell the fear
pheromones, watch the tell-tale pupil dilations and tiny twitches of the
muscles as the fight-or-flight reflex kicks in. Feel your dewclaws – razor-
sharp, harder than steel – flex beneath your paw. Look around at the
other Player Characters – which of them can you kill easily? Which of
them would be a challenging fight? And which, if any, can defeat you?

Establish your territory. Take all you can hold – no less, and no more.
Only respect those who are worthy of respect, and have them prove
their honor and courage by acting honorably and courageously.
Those who are not worthy of respect are not even people, they are
herd animals or possessions.

Never lose hope. If your situation is desperate, then fight back you
will survive. If your situation is good, then glory in your success
and feast. Patience is only a virtue if you are lying in wait for a foe.
Never give into inaction, never do 'nothing', even if all you are doing
is lying in the sun and sleeping. Remember that you are a lord of
creation, the anointed heir to the whole universe. Live with honor,
and you will be rewarded.

You are never alone. Your clan is your blood; the essence of the ancestors
flows through your veins. Honor your clan, and they will honor you.
Remember that when you speak, you speak for and with your clan. Weigh
your words carefully, for they reflect on your clan, but also remember that
when you speak, so too do tens of thousands, and so others should listen
carefully. Honor the clan ko and elders. Scorn the Outcasts, for they
have failed their kin and are now less than people.

###### Females

Female Aslan are in competition with one another from the day they are
born. There are three or four females to every male, so a female must excel
in order to be noticed by her parents and her clan. Find some aspect of life –
engineering, medicine, finance, sports, beauty, politics, music – and conquer
it. Be the best, because only the best females are worth anything at all.

Find a good male, but rely on him for nothing. Males are good only
for owning land, siring cubs and fighting.

###### Males

You are the spoiled god-king of the universe. A male Aslan is the
pride and joy of his parents, and wants for nothing when growing
up. The drive for territory consumes you – every relationship is
framed in terms of territory and dominance or submission. You are
the master within your own territory, but you must submit to the
masters of other territories.

#### CAMPAIGNS

This section discusses campaigns that do not center wholly on
Aslan affairs, but may include one or two Aslan Player Characters or
have the Aslan race as a component.

###### Travellers For Hire

The 'core story' or default style of play for _Traveller_ is that the Player
Characters own their own starship and are wandering the galaxy,
looking for interesting patrons and ways to pay off their mortgage.
Aslan Player Characters fit perfectly well into this style of play.
Perhaps the Aslan Player Characters are Outcasts, or their clan
wishes them to learn about human society for a time (or, most likely,
the clan does not particular care about a few young Aslan). There are
ways to drag the characters off to Aslan space for a few sessions, to
give them a taste of a very different culture to the Imperium:

+ A patron hires the Player Characters to deliver a cargo of
    rare dust-spice to an Aslan noble. The noble lives deep in the
    Hierate, and the dust-spice is being sought by several rivals of
    the noble, so it must be carried by a single ship for the whole
    journey.
+ The Player Characters sign on with a megacorporation to
    establish new trade routes in an unexplored section of the
    Trojan Reach.
+ One of the Aslan Player Characters is targeted by an assassin.
    A war of assassins has started between his clan and another
    clan back home, and the player character is one of the
    nominated targets.

###### Along the Aslan Border

The Trojan Reach (or a similar sector, such as Reaver's Deep) is a
very interesting setting for a campaign. The politics of the two great
powers, and the smaller worlds sandwiched between them, makes
for a much more dynamic and varied environment than a more
settled sector. Worlds change hands, alliances shift and break, and
the characters can experience a variety of cultures and adventures.

Divided loyalties can be an issue in this style of game if some of
the Player Characters are Aslan and some are human. The Referee

should try to avoid presenting one side as categorically right or
wrong, and include allies and enemies on both sides.

+ An independent world fears it will be the target of Aslan
    aggression, and hires the Player Characters to deliver illegal
    weapons and to train its armed forces.
+ There is a major summit between Aslan and Imperial
    nobles, discussing security, trade, border troubles and other
    issues. Several passengers heading for this summit hire the
    characters to transport them there. The passengers are a mix
    of nobles, bureaucrats, corporate executives, journalists...
    and no doubt, a few spies and assassins. The decisions made
    at this summit will shape politics in the sector for a decade, so
    if the characters can learn what is decided before anyone else,
    they may be able to get in on the action early.

###### Voyage into the Hierate

To fully immerse a mixed group into Aslan culture, send them on a
long mission into the Hierate. An ideal mission might start in the
Spinward Marches, and take the characters from there, through
the Trojan Reach and across the Jump-5 route over the Great Rift,
and from there through the Hierate to Kusyu. Along the way, the
characters get to experience a variety of worlds and challenges. It is
best to skip over whole sections of the journey – there is no need to
run through every jump-land-refuel-launch-jump sequence, instead
focus on exciting worlds and threats.

Potential threats include xenophobic Aslan, ongoing limited wars,
pirates and political intrigue.

+ The characters are hired to bring the body of a deceased
    Aslan noble back to Kusyu. The body is sealed inside a special
    casket. The noble died under mysterious circumstances in the
    Imperium, and returning the body untouched is the only way
    to prove he was not murdered by humans.
+ The characters have a passenger – a young Aslan male, heir to
    a vast domain in the Hierate. His sire was slain in battle, and
    enemies want the heir dead too. No one can be trusted.
+ The characters are hired by Imperial intelligence to gather
    information about the heart of the Hierate. Their 'trade
    mission' is a cover.

#### ASLAN CAMPAIGNS

Instead of having a mixed group of humans and Aslan, it is possible to run
an all-Aslan campaign. This style of game allows the group to highlight the
unique aspects of the Aslan race; territory and clan politics can play a central
part of the campaign. It is also possible to run a standard Traveller game
'flavored' with Aslan culture, casting the Player Characters as traders.

###### All Family

One intriguing option is to have all the characters be part of the
same family in the same clan. Ambitious players could even all be
part of the same pride, with one male and several female Player

#### PRESENTING THE ASLAN

There are several ways to present the Aslan race in a campaign. The Referee is advised to choose one approach and stick to it
throughout most of the campaign, as it lends character to the race.

###### Aslan as Noble Ally

The Aslan are a strange but honorable race. Their customs are not those of humanity, but they are not unusually cruel or violent.
Their practice of limited warfare means that Aslan conflicts are less damaging than might be expected. The Aslan reward heroism and
ambition, and respect humans who act honorably.
Emphasise:Emphasise: Ritual combat, heroism.
Inspiration:Inspiration: Star Trek Klingons (especially in the Next Generation era).

###### Aslan as Mysterious Other

The Aslan are a strange and nearly incomprehensible race. While not necessarily hostile towards humanity, their culture appears
primitive, archaic or unpleasant to human observers, but not to the Aslan themselves. What humans would characterise as ritualised
violence, cruelty, rampant sexism, an absurd obsession with owning land and extreme cultural conservatism are common in
Aslan society. Interactions can lead to conflict or confusion, even when both sides are well-intentioned and trying to communicate
honestly.
Emphasise: Emphasise: Cultural strangeness, the feeling of being in a foreign country.
Inspiration:Inspiration: The Jana'ata from Sparrow.

###### Aslan as Threat

The Aslan have attacked humanity again and again in the past, and even though relations are currently peaceful, such situations never
last. They are marauding monsters who hunger for new worlds to conquer. Even in peacetime, Aslan raiders and pirates are a constant
threat. Never trust an Aslan – their 'honor' only applies to their own internal politics, and they do not think humans are worthy of
respect. They see us as cattle.
Emphasise: Emphasise: Raids and piracy, savage attacks.
Inspiration: Inspiration: The Kzinti from the Known Space novels.

###### Aslan as Enemy

The Aslan are on the verge of attack! Already, their raiders and warships are prowling over the border, testing our defences. Soon,
their ships will appear in the skies over human worlds, and their warriors will storm our cities! The Aslan are monstrous slavers and
cannibals, who consider humanity to be an infestation on the territory they claim.
Emphasise:Emphasise: Animal brutality the constant danger of attack.
Inspiration:Inspiration: The Kilrathi from Wing Commander.

Characters. This means that the characters will be working together,
but also competing for the clan's favor. Ties of blood make inter-
party feuds and alliances much more interesting. The clan can be a
long-term patron for the clan, much like the Clan Agents campaign
idea.

+ The sole heir of an elderly Aslan lord dies in battle. The Aslan
    lord is known to be ill, and must name a replacement heir
    soon from among his kin. If one of the Player Characters can
    impress the lord, maybe they can be named the new heir.
+ An ancient feud erupts once more, threatening the characters.
    Do they join their clan, or try to bury old feuds?
+ An ambitious young Aslan proposes a radical new direction
    for the clan. Do the characters risk supporting this young
    upstart and share his fate, or stay safe and stick to the status
    quo?

###### Conquerors

The characters are all second sons and other landless Aslan, who
have just been given a ship and sent out to find their fortune. In
addition to the usual Traveller escapades of patrons and trade, the
characters are searching for a world worth conquering. Once they
find such a planet, they need to return to Aslan space, gather an
army, and then conquer the planet.

+ Finding the right planet should involve a tour of the whole
    Aslan border. If your campaign is set in the Trojan Reach,
    for instance, that would mean months of travel through five
    subsectors. In addition to unoccupied worlds, the characters
    may wish to try conquering a non-aligned, Glorious Empire or
    Florian League world.

+ To gather an army, the characters need to convince an _ihatei_
    camp that their prospects for conquest are better than any of
    the dozens of other scouts. This section should involve spying
    or sabotaging their rivals, roleplaying, logistical planning and
    tactical preparation.
+ The challenge of conquering the world depends on the nature
    of the target. Do the characters need to explore a hostile new
    world, or do they need to defeat the existing military forces on
    the planet?

###### Mercenaries

The constant conflicts within the Aslan Hierate means there is
plenty of work for mercenaries. The Aslan fight limited wars and
wars of assassins, so mere firepower is not always enough to win
a conflict.

+ The characters are hired to assassinate the ruling family of a
    minor clan, who live in an orbital fortress high above a heavily
    defended planet. Complicating the matter is the fact that the
    characters' patron is one of the family, so they cannot just
    attack the fortress directly.
       - A limited war between two clans has dragged on for too long.
          Both clans are ploughing money and lives into an increasingly
          pointless struggle, and the eventual prize for winning is not
          worth the cost. The characters are hired by a noble of one clan
          to sabotage his own side; he prefers a quick defeat to a pyrrhic
          victory. They need to end the war quickly; but covertly.

###### Clan Agents

The characters are roving clan agents. They are troubleshooters,
who go where the clan needs them. Missions range from counter-
espionage and guarding against assassins, to sorting out diplomatic
tangles.

+ An overly ambitious _ihatei_ has led a few thousand members
    of the clan to a world that is likely to be retaken by enemies.
    The characters need to go in and convince the new landowner
    to abandon his domain, then buy time for an orderly
    evacuation.
+ One of the clan's diplomats has vanished on a human world.
    The characters need to investigate his disappearance and
    solve the mystery, despite sticking out like sore thumbs in the
    midst of the crowds of humanity.

requires the traveller main rulebook

Dara Happa Stirs is a Gloranthan sourcebook and campaign setting of epic
proportions. Within its pages you will ʏ nd detailed information concern-
ing Yelm's empire: history, myths, and political structures for the empire in
Glorantha's Second Age. You will also ʏ nd new cults, new magic, expanded
character creation for Dara Happan adventurers, a full campaign spanning 10
years of Dara Happan history and
numerous story seeds for addi-
tional action and intrigue.

The eldritch isle of Melnibone and the Young Kingdoms across the sea
provide a wealth of strange places, deadly foes and potent spells for the Elric
of Melnibone roleplaying game. Sail the seas of fate into a demon-haunted
world where dragons ride the storm-racked skies and the price of dreams is
above rubies. Walk the streets of fabled Elwher, steal the lore of Pan Tang,
and cross the Sighing Desert as you
quest for eternal Tanelorn.

Enter the Hyborian Age. The civilised kingdoms at the heart of the world
make war on one another with massed ranks of mercenaries while idle nobles
chatter and gossip in the courts of Aquilonia and Nemedia. In the north the
barbarians of Asgard, Vanaheim and Cimmeria make war on anyone close
enough to raid and in the west the Picts savagely reject the encroachment of
settlers into their primeval forests. Pirates infest both the open ocean in the
south and the inland Vilayet sea, earning the ire of Stygian sorcerer-priests and
Turanian horse lords alike. This world of expansive plains, steaming jungles,
ancient tombs and otherworldly horrors gives no quarter - you must wrest
your destiny from it with the strength of your limbs and the edge of your
sword!

Traveller is back, and it is better than ever!

Based on the Classic Traveller rules set, this book has been streamlined for
modern roleplaying, and yet still retains that unmistakeable Traveller aura. With

complete rules for character and world creation, spaceships, encounters and
trading, it is your gateway into new universes.

The Traveller Main Rulebook is the cornerstone of all your Traveller games, to
be expanded upon with core supplements such as Mercenary and High Guard,
or used with different settings like Strontium Dog, Hammers Slammers, Judge
Dredd and, of course, the Original Traveller Universe.
