# The Sylean Main

The Sylean Main is one of the most prestigious trade routes in all of the Imperium. While the people of the Solomani Rim and Ilelish might argue about which sector has the greatest main, the fact that The Sylean Main is located in the [[Core Subsector|Core]] and includes  [[Capital]] enhances its reputation considerably.

In addition to being the seat of empire, the [[Core Subsector|Core]] leads the entire Imperium in exported goods. Its industrial worlds are among the most powerful in the empire. Perhaps the only thing that prevents the [[Core Subsector|Core]] from dominating the Imperium in all economic categories is astrographic happenstance. Its industrial worlds are spread out, often separated by stellar gaps of two to four parsecs, with few actually located on [[#The Sylean Main]] itself. As such, economic power is divided into clusters, each dominated by local governments and split among noble fiefdoms. These worlds share the bond of Imperial membership but in another sector – such as Deneb, known for its competing duchies – they might be reduced to infighting and fractiousness. In the [[Core Subsector|Core]], the influence of [[Capital]] draws them together and prevents greater economic dissolution from occurring. Being associated with  [[Capital]] is not just a point of pride but also a financial boon. The `Made in the Core` seal bestows considerable value upon goods that are manufactured in the sector.

In spite of the benefits, the state of economic unity in the [[Core Subsector|Core]] is fragile. The sector’s industrial worlds compete aggressively with one another. Each wants to be the dominant power and megacoporate leaders pull no punches when trying to outdo each other. Into this fray enters the [[Ase]] system, the leading world of the [[Shaaaki Cluster]] and aspirant to economic and industrial greatness.
