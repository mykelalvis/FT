## The Fringe

The Imperial Fringe is the edge of a large and sprawling interstellar empire. The
proper name for this region is the Spinward Marches, so named because they are
located on the very border of the Imperium, in the spinward direction when con-
sidering the rotation of the galaxy. This area of hundreds of star systems, shown on
the accompanying map, is to be the setting for this introductory adventure into the
universe of Traveller.
This adventure is written for the beginner and touches briefly on many different
aspects of the science fiction role-playing possibilities within Traveller. As referee or
player, you should read carefully Traveller Books 1, 2 and 3; as referee you should
read through this adventure to familiarize yourself with it. Once that is done, you
are ready to begin.
Materials: As Book 1 indicates, a wide variety of materials are desirable during
your adventures. For this particular adventure, lined notebook paper, pencils and
pens, and graph paper are especially helpful. Everyone should have a pair of six-
sided dice. The referee should have a folder or notebook to keep records of the
group's progress; the complete adventure should probably take quite a few sessions
of play.

CHARACTER GENERATION

The first step in playing Traveller is to generate characters. Book 1 provides
complete information on character generation, and each player should generate his
or her own character for this first adventure. Be careful to record all of the required
information on the individual and keep it handy on a note card or piece of paper.
The Scout: One person in the adventure should be a scout; the assumption in the
adventure is that one character has possession of type S scout/courier and thus
provides transportation for the group. The referee should suggest that one player
attempt a scout career. If, after all character generation has been performed, no
scout has a scout ship, one of them should be arbitrarily given a scout ship in order
to further the adventure.
Referee's Note: It is not unusual for a referee to arbitrarily alter circumstances
as they occur if they will help an adventure move along. Such alterations should not
change decisions made by the players, and should not be gifts or presents just to
make them better off; they should be presented when they are required by the
situation, and when there is no reasonable alternative.
If the referee desires, and is ready to alter the rest of the adventure to fit, there
are alternatives. For example, one of the group could be a merchant character with
a type A free trader; the adventure would then tend to focus more on trade and
commerce.
Once everyone has a character, the adventure is ready to begin. Since everyone is
starting out fresh, the best approach is to place all of the characters together in a
single situation and inform them of what is happening. The information in Mustered
Out (except for the sections headed referee's notes) should be explained to every-
one. Some, but not all, sections may be read aloud.

# Mustered Out

It's the end of one career for each of the characters, and the beginning of a new
one. They have just mustered out of their service careers, pocketed their final pay,
and gathered up any souvenirs or equipment of particular importance. And all
face the same question: "What do I want to do now?"
Each individual character has mustered out on Regina (1920-A788899-A), a rich
world and capital of the Regina subsector. It is a merchant hub, a naval and scout
center, and anyone in any service can reasonably expect to muster out here. It can
be assumed that everyone in the group knows each other, perhaps from years past,
perhaps from a chance meeting in the mustering out center, or perhaps from some
brief encounter. Obviously, everyone has decided to band together in search of
fortune, power, glory, or just entertainment.
That leaves the question still: where to next?

## EQUIPMENT`

Any character's first thoughts, what with all that mustering out pay burning a
hole in his or her pocket, should be for equipment. There are many different things
worth consideration, with a long list presented in Book 3. Many should be available
here on Regina. Each character should look at the list of available equipment in
Book 3 and the list of weapons in Book 1, and consider purchases. Almost any item
that is listed with tech level 10 or below (Regina is tech level 10) should be avail-
able for purchase. The only exception is that of weapons; because Regina is law
level 9, weapons are severely restricted, and even trying to buy them can result
in legal difficulties. As a result, weapons purchases should probably be postponed
until a more permissive world is found.

Referee's Note: If individuals have mustered out with weapons, they can prob-
ably be retained, though not carried. They can be left in sealed lockers at the
starport pending departure from Regina, or they can be left in the group's scout/
courier. If anyone insists on retaining his or her weapon (or on trying to buy
a weapon) while wandering around Regina, throw 9- (Regina's law level) for the
individual to be caught by the police, fined the value of the weapon, and the
weapon itself confiscated.

Individuals should consider the effects of equipment weight on themselves,
and on available cargo space in their ship.

Characters often share their money and equipment for the general good. Loans
of money to allow purchase of equipment are commonplace. Likewise, individuals
may purchase equipment for the general welfare (such as rations, communicators,
shelters) and allow all to use it. While this is laudable, such characters should also
keep records of their contributions, and try to recover such expenditures when
the group comes into money.

## THE SHIP
Someone in the group has a starship; probably it is a surplus scout service
scout/courier. Before the adventure proceeds any farther, the group should tour the

facilities and acquaint themselves with the ship that will be their home for the
next several months. The chapter on the scout/courier includes deck plans for the
ship, an indication of the interior fittings, as well as a description of the ship's
performance and its maintenance requirements.

Referee's Note: At this point, the character with the scout/courier should take
over for the tour. He or she can lead the group through the deck plan, establishing
which cabin is whose and where the controls and the air locks are. At the same
time, the scout can determine which characters are capable of assistance in the
operation of the ship. Asking who has engineering skill can determine who will be
engineer; asking who has air/raft skill will determine who will usually drive the
scout/courier's air/raft. After the tour, the adventure can move to the next phase.

## BEGINNING AN ADVENTURE

Even in a structured adventure such as this one, there is (there must be) room
for the characters to wander and operate as they want. Once the characters are
familiar with each other, and once they are reasonably well equipped, they must
still cope with their pressing question: what are they going to do? Typical responses
early in a Traveller game include a search for the Psionics Institute or engaging in
trade and speculation in search of a quick profit. If players know what they want to
do, then let them follow their instincts. Don't feel that the players have to follow
the planned adventure from the very beginning. Ultimately, they will decide to look
for a patron. When that happens, the adventure starts forward again.

The Psionics Institute: Finding a Psionics Institute on Regina will be difficult;
they occur only on worlds with population 9+, and even then only rarely. The
group may set out immediately for a world that does have population 9+. Once
they arrive, the search for the Institute is governed by the psionics rules in Book 3.
Referee's Note: Keep in mind that psionics is illegal, and that the group is
courting problems if it presses its search. Throw local law level or less for harrass-
ment by the police during the search. Once an institute is discovered, the group has
achieved an immediate goal, and can try to get psionics training.
Trade and Speculation: Buying low and selling high is a basic rule of commerce.
Whenever a ship moves from one place to another, there is the chance that its
crew can carry cheap goods to a place where they can be sold at a profit. The
basic process is governed by Book 2.

Referee's Note: Trade and commerce often becomes a goal all by itself. It
certainly offers the prospect of easy money, provided the individuals have enough
capital to start out. Early in an adventure, the referee may want to manipulate
the situation to set certain standards for the game. If characters need money, some
rules can be relaxed to make trade purchases easier (but avoid making easy or free
deals for them!); if it appears that trade will overwhelm the players' attention,
follow the rules strictly and make trade harder.

The Patron: Book 3 provides a standard answer in the search for something to
do: a patron. Use that procedure to seek out and find a patron who has some task
that needs to be performed.

Referee's Note: The specific patron situation on page 8 is already planned out
and ready to be used. Don't feel reluctant to use that patron even if the die rolls
dictate something different. Just roll the dice privately, look at the table in Book 3,
and then turn to page 8 and say, "You're all sitting in the Starhaven tavern.. ."

# The Brawl

The Starhaven tavern is one of many in Startown. It stands just outside the
employees' gate of Regina starport. The main thoroughfare through the gate
connects with the various spaceline warehouses, the scout base, the naval base, and
the shipyard construction areas. Consequently, this particular location is an ideal
meeting place for all types of persons. Some taverns cater to starport clerks, others
to ship construction workers, still others to naval officers. The Starhaven has a
clientele of primarily scout personnel.

It seems that one rather rowdy group of people here tonight is not only not
scout personnel, but they have an active dislike for the scouts. They somehow
picked the wrong tavern to drink their night away, and after perhaps 15 minutes of
rowdyism, a scout asks them to quiet down. They don't; they instead continue with
a loud and unflattering comparison between the scout service and the army. A
few minutes later, the same scout asks them to leave. Quite expectably, a brawl
ensues with everyone involved, including the band of adventurers.

Referee's Note: This is the start of a patron encounter. The brawl is the situation
which introduces the group to their patron. This brawl can be simply described as
fast-moving and interesting, or it can be fully fought out. If fully fought out, then
the referee will have to generate the group of rowdies and the other scout patrons
currently in the bar. Because few, if any, of these individuals will be of any impor-
tance, an abbreviated character generation system can be used. Roll for the first
three personal characteristics of each; roll one die minus 4 for brawling skill for the
rowdies. The rest of the personal information is unimportant, and it isn't necessary
to spend time generating it. As a suggestion, make the rowdies' group six in num-
ber, and make the scouts three in number; one of the scouts should be Admin-
istrator Galadden, indicated below.

```
Scout Galadden 8599A8 Age 42 6 terms Cr8000 Pilot-2, Vacc Suit-1, Shotgun-1, Computer-1, Mechanical-1.
```

With the fight over and the rowdies driven from the floor, there is naturally
a certain cameraderie to be expected. Someone sees to various wounds; the un-
conscious are revived. Tables are righted. A round of drinks is ordered. Finally,
introductions are made. One of the scouts introduces himself as Senior Scout
Administrator Galadden; he says he works for the scout service with an office in the
scout base within the starport grounds.

Several rounds of drinks later, he casually mentions that he has need for a
special survey to be completed. The need isn't especially pressing, but his own
scout forces are fairly well used. If he could find someone willing to take the
job, it would pay quite well.

He hands over his card, complete with communicator number and office address,
and encourages the group to come visit him in his office within the next week.
Maybe they can come to an equitable arrangement for such a survey. It promises to
pay reasonably well.

#### GALADDEN'S OFFICE

If the group shows up at Galadden's office, his secretary will be cool, and insists
that anyone wishing to see the senior administrator must have an appointment. She
can make one for anyone two days from the time requested. If called, she will make
an appointment for tomorrow.

Once an appointment is made and the group arrives to talk to Galadden, they
are ushered into his office after only a short wait. One entire wall of Galadden's
office is taken up with a brilliant black star map of the Spinward Marches. Various
worlds, systems, starports, and express boat lanes are clearly marked on the map,
and it is impressive.

Every twenty years (he begins), the scout service updates its survey of this region
by checking all of the essential data in its files. Normal routine calls for input
from many sources, including local governments, the navy, and other individuals.
But this special survey can best be looked at as an independent audit, designed
to turn up any discrepancies that might otherwise be overlooked. He covers some
other details, and then asks, "Are you interested?"

Assuming the group is, Galadden continues with the details of the task.

## THE SURVEY

This survey involves visiting every system in the Spinward Marches, determining
the universal planetary profile for the major world, and reporting it to a scout base
for forwarding to the office here at Regina. Detailed reports will be required.

Time: In most circumstances, a report can be written after about three days to a
week of data gathering. Some worlds will be easy to check out, while others will
cause some trouble. It is best to count on spending a week in each system. Each
jump to the next world will take about a week. In all, the group can expect to
survey one world every two weeks.

Time Limit: The scout service starts a new special survey every twenty years.
This one must be completed within twenty years; if not, the special bonus payments cannot be made.

Transportation: The group already has access to a scout/courier, and it will be
the vessel used to conduct the survey. All charges and costs must be paid by the
group, although (as is standard practice) refined fuel will be available to the ship
at scout bases free of charge.

Reports: The group must actually visit the major world in a system and then
determine its universal planetary profile, which must be substantiated by instru-
ment readings or evidence in the report.

Remuneration: For each report turned in, Cr50,000 will be credited to the
group's account. From that account, various sums can be drawn for living expenses,
fuel costs, salaries, life support costs, and other reasons. Once all 440 worlds in the
Spinward Marches have been surveyed, an additional Cr10,000 per world will be
paid; this last amount will be subject to deductions due to sloppy work, or lack of
detail in reports.

Travel Zones: Travel to forbidden worlds marked by red travel zones is not part
of this survey. Confidentially, Galadden indicates that he would also like to receive
reports on such worlds, but will not demand them. If the group does undertake to
produce reports on red zone worlds, then they must be hand-delivered to him on
Regina, and he will pay Cr100,000 for each, in cash.

## Scout/Courier Aurora

Welcome aboard Imperial Detached Scout/Courier S-16791 Aurora. This ship
was assigned to an ex-scout (one of the group) in recognition of good service and as
a reward for competent execution of duties. The assignment, however, also fills the
needs of the Imperium and of the scout service by making this vessel (and many
others like it) available to interstellar trade and commerce. The many jobs which it
may undertake are of great assistance to the economy of the stars. Less obvious is
the fact that the scout service routinely debriefs the ex-scouts who use these
ships and uses the information as part of its intelligence gathering operations.
Scout/Courier (type S): Using a 100-ton hull, the scout/courier is intended for
exploration, survey, and courier duties, with many in service throughout known
space. It mounts jump drive-A, maneuver drive-A, and power plant-A, giving per-
formance of jump-2 and 2-G acceleration. A 40-ton fuel tank supports the power
plant and provides sufficient fuel for one jump-2. Adjacent to the bridge is mount-
ed a computer Model/1bis. There are four staterooms and no low berths. One
double turret is installed on the ship's hardpoint, and fire control equipment is
present, but no weaponry is installed. One air/raft is carried in a specially fitted
hangar within the ship. Cargo capacity amounts to three tons. The hull is stream-
lined.

This scout/courier requires a crew of one, assuming the duties of pilot and
engineer. The ship cost MCr29.43 new and took 10 months to build. It is now 23
years old.

### FROM OUTSIDE

Looking at the scout from the outside, it can be seen as a streamlined wedge
37.5 meters long and 24 meters wide. It is 7.5 meters tall at its highest point, with a
sturdy tripod landing pylon system for support. From a distance, the upper surfaces
can be seen, including the vision ports on the bridge and the dome of the turret.
Close up, the underside of the ship is dotted with landing pylon doors, fueling
ports, and fuel scoop inlets.

Entry Points: There are seven basic entry points to the ship, plus two possibil-
ities. Iris valves are automatic power-operated portals composed of many plates
which retract much like the iris of a camera. The entry is oval or circular in shape,
and can be operated by pressing a small stud on the wall; it can be locked by the
computer or by a key. Hatches are manually-operated hinged portals secured by a
handwheel and locked by padlocks or simple steel bars.

The port side of the aft bulkhead contains an iris valve which leads into the now
empty commo bay (room 13). A retractable ladder reaches to the ground when
extended. This entry is the main point of access to the ship when it is landed on a
hospitable world. This iris valve can also be snugged to another ship, allowing
transfers between ships such as visits, boarding parties, and cargo transshipments.
The starboard side of the aft bulkhead contains a large sliding panel door open-
ing into the air/raft storage bay (room 14). This panel is controlled from inside, or
from a remote control director on-board the air/raft. Since the interior of the air/raft bay can be sealed off from the rest of the ship by the iris valve between the
bay (room 14) and the corridor (corridor 15), it can serve as an air/lock if required.
The center of the aft bulkhead holds an iris valve leading into the drive room
(room 12).

On the port upper surface of the ship above the now empty commo bay (room
13), a manually-operated hatch allows access to the ship exterior. This hatch is
intended for maintenance, and is normally secured with a steel bar and a padlock. It
allows routine access to the upper surfaces.

On the upper surface of the ship, along the central ridge just behind the bridge
vision screens, is a manually-operated hatch leading down into the upper gallery
(room 19). This area can be used as an air lock if desired.

On the lower surface of the ship well forward is a manually-operated hatch
leading into the forward avionics bay. This hatch is generally used for maintenance
of the complex electronics carried by the scout.

About six meters behind the avionics hatch is a second hatch leading into the
forward cargo bay (room 20). This hatch is used to load cargo, baggage, and rations.
The forward cargo bay can be used as an air lock.

In addition to the many ordinary access points, there are two other possibilities:
the turret and the landing pylons. The turret can be entered by cutting a hole in its
side, which is somewhat easier than cutting through the hull. From there, it is easy
to get into the gunner's position (room 16). The landing pylons are retractable
into pylon bays and covered by streamlined doors; it is possible to enter one of
these bays by climbing the pylon. Inside the bay, the intruder must then cut
through a solid bulkhead wall for entry to the interior.

### INTERIOR ACCOMODATIONS

The ship is divided into twenty areas. Each has its own form and function.

1. Avionics Bay. The ship's complex electronics equipment is carried in this

forward section of the ship. Most of the ship's communications equipment, de-
tectors, scanners, and sensors are installed here.

2. Bridge. The basic controls for the ship are installed on the bridge. Two crew

positions are present, although only one (the pilot's) must be manned. Exterior
vision screens, computer access, navigation equipment, and exterior sensor readouts
are all available to the operating crew.

3. Central Corridor. This corridor leads past the various crew staterooms to the

common area.

4. Stateroom One. This stateroom contains facilities for two persons, including

bunks, desks, closets, fresher, and other comfort facilities. Typically, stateroom
one is used as the commander's cabin, and includes a wall safe for holding cash and
valuables.

5. Stateroom Two. This stateroom contains facilities for two persons, including

bunks, desks, closets, fresher, and other comfort facilities.

6. Stateroom Three. This stateroom contains facilities for two persons, including

bunks, desks, closets, fresher, and other comfort facilities.

7. Stateroom Four. This stateroom contains facilities for two persons, including

bunks, desks, closets, fresher, and other comfort facilities.

8. Common Area. This large room contains the kitchen and mess area, as well as

storage for rations and perishables. There are also recreation facilities, exercise equipment, and other things to help pass the time in jump space.

9. Fuel Tankage. Surrounding the ship between the streamlined exterior and the

interior accomodations are fuel tanks. They are not normally accessible from the in-
terior.

10. Landing Pylon Bay. These two bays hold the landing pylons which support

the ship when it lands. A third pylon bay forward is not shown.

11. Gallery Access. This iris valve leads to the upper gallery. This position is

the crossroads of the ship, leading to nearly every position of importance within.

12. Drive Room. The ship's drives and power plant are contained in this

chamber. The engineer (if the ship carries one) generally performs any duties here.

13. Commo Bay. Originally, the ship carried large banks of data transmitters

here, and hauled messages to and from various minor worlds. Now, it is furnished as
a crew lounge.

14. Air/Raft Bay. The ship's air/raft is carried in this chamber. The craft can be

flown into and out of the bay with ease.

15. Ship's Locker. This dead-end corridor is used for storage of all the minor

equipment, weaponry, and gadgets that can be used on worlds or in space.

16. Gunner's Position. Currently unused, this position contains fire control

equipment and a gunner's couch for control of the currently unarmed turret.

17. Storage. This area is used for secondary storage of supplies and rations.
18.
19. Upper Gallery. This long corridor was originally used to hold sensor equip-

ment and repair parts. Now, it is largely unused except for storage.

19. Forward Sensor Position. Some of the ship's sensors are serviced from this

chamber. It can also be used as an air lock.

20. Forward Cargo Bay. This chamber is a cargo storage area and can carry up to

three tons of supplies and baggage.

### BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION

In addition to the tour, the ship's papers and the scout's experience provide the
following information.

Weaponry: The actual weaponry carried on the scout/courier varies with the
mission accorded the ship. Couriers generally mount a single laser and a single
missile rack. Exploratory scouts mount two missile racks. Detached duty scout/
couriers are provided without weaponry, but the crew generally acquires some sort
of firepower in a short time.

If weapons can be found, they can be installed with a minimum of effort.
Installation will require mechanical-2 or better. Wiring will take electronics-2 or
better. Final calibration will require gunnery-2 or better. The entire operation will
take perhaps a week.

Peculiarities: The major fault of the type S scout/courier is its air system.
Although of respectable quality for life support, it begins to smell after about
three weeks of use. Thereafter, the smell becomes increasingly obnoxious, and
most crew members find the smell intolerable after six weeks. The problem can be
corrected by flushing the air system, which operation costs Cr1,000 for parts and
components. Temporary respite may be obtained (for about a week) by replacing
the system's air filters (at Cr200). Both these processes also require a plentiful
supply of breathable air. Instead, the entire air system may be replaced with a
better model; it costs Cr70,000 and requires sacrificing one ton of cargo space.

The scout/courier includes a bay for four tons of vehicle, generally a simple air/raft with 00 kph cruise speed and unlimited endurance. This vehicle can reach orbit if required.

IMPERIAL SCOUT/COURIER (Type S)

Tonnage: 100 tons (standard). 1400 cubic meters.
Dimensions: Maximum— 37.5 m by 24 m by 7.5 m.
Drives: Jump 2. 2G. Power plant-2.

### Deck Plan Symbols

Costs: Just operating the scout/courier costs money.
Fuel (40 tons; a fill-up for the tanks) costs Cr20,000 for refined grade or
Cr4,000 for unrefined grade at most starports. Refined fuel can be obtained free
of charge at an Imperial scout base or way station; unrefined fuel can be obtained
at a gas giant (if there is one) or at an ocean (if there is one) for free.
Life support for the ship (assuming all four cabins are occupied) will amount
to Cr8,000 every two weeks. As long as the ship is occupied, these costs will be
incurred.

Routine maintenance for the ship is the responsibility of the scout who is using
it on detached duty. For this scout/courier, it amounts to Cr27,630; the mainten-
ance will take two weeks. Although it is usually performed at a class A or B star-
port, it can also be performed at a scout way station (possibly at half-price).
Crew salaries are an optional item on a ship such as this.

Berthing costs are unpredictable, but run perhaps Cr75 per starport. They
run within the range of Cr10 times 2D.

Income: Revenues from the operation of the ship are minimal. It is difficult to
carry passengers, and certainly not high passengers. Some cargo can be transported,
but the three ton limit keeps such revenues to a minimum. Carrying private messag-
es will not provide any great revenue directly, but may ultimately lead to patrons
and charters or missions.

Ultimately, revenue for the ship comes from chartered missions doing the
dirty deals or pet projects of patrons.

Operations: The scout/courier can reach orbit from a world surface in a matter
of minutes. It can move out to at least 100 planetary diameters in about 3 hours.
The ship can stand off a world in orbit and send its air/raft down to the surface
in several hours (hours equals planetary size digit). The personnel must wear vacc
suits for the journey.

# The Spinward Marches

The Spinward Marches consist of 440 systems in a region roughly 120 parsecs
from the center of the Imperium. Because of the the configurations of stars be-
tween the Marches and the Capital, however, trade and communications routes
wind over 176 parsecs and take nearly a year to traverse by express boat. As a
result, the Spinward Marches are a relatively independent component of the vast
interstellar Imperium, but nevertheless a vital one.

The Spinward Marches map included in Deluxe Traveller is a presentation of
the entire sector on one sheet of paper. The presentation of systems, bases, and
routes corresponds to the general system format given in Book 3. This map is the
focus of the entire adventure.

## GENERAL LAYOUT

Observing the borders shown on the map, it can be seen that the territory within
the Spinward Marches is divided into several areas, the most notable of which are
the Imperium, the Darrian Confederation, the Sword Worlds, the Zhodani Con-
sulate, and several sections which have no allegiance.

The Zhodani Consulate: Cronor, Querion, and Jewell subsectors contain worlds
under the control of the Zhodani — a human empire which stretches off the left
hand side of the map and controls 160 subsectors and perhaps 4,000 worlds.
The Sword Worlds: A loose confederation of worlds all colonized in the same
era about 300 years before the Imperium was established. The citizens of the
Sword Worlds are fiercely independent, and have long fought to maintain their
freedom from both the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate.

The Darrian Confederation: An old, varied group of worlds originally settled
from the planet Darrian about 1500 to 1000 years before the Imperium was estab-
lished. The confederation maintains diplomatic relations with the Imperium, and
depends on it for protection against both the Sword Worlds and the Zhodani.
The Imperium: The Imperium is a vast interstellar empire, of which the Marches
are only a small fraction on its spinward border. Trailing off the right hand side of
the map are an additional 277 subsectors and nearly 11,000 more worlds. The
Imperium is a strong government which is somewhat strained by the rigors of
control of so many systems.

Along the edges of the Imperium, the borders tend to become indistinct. District
268 is a subsector which has not yet been absorbed into the Imperium; the district
is administered as a territory pending settlement by colonists and upgrading of
facilities within.

Two pockets (Flammarion and Caladbolg) are under Imperial rule, but are
separated from the Imperium proper by great distances. They serve as stepping
stones to Five Sisters subsector.

Five Sisters is a subsector physically separated from the contiguous Imperium
by undeveloped territory and by the Sword Worlds. The area is under military rule
(under the Department of the Navy), with extensive naval build-ups, bases, and
many amber and red travel zones.

## Referee's Notes

The concept that binds this adventure together is the special audit of the Spin-
ward Marches by the characters in the scout/courier. The referee must handle
that idea on a continuing basis, regardless of what other adventures transpire. Some
basics must be addressed.

Dating Systems: The library data entry for dating systems describes the Imperial
dating system. That system should be used as a consistent system, if only because it
corresponds with the various dates presented in Traveller background and adven-
tures. For convenience, the beginning date for this entire introductory adventure
should be 001-1100: the first day of the year 1100. Days and weeks are incre-
mented as time passes, with years being 365 days long.

Library Data: Library data is information commonly available to characters,
typically through local computer data banks or information resource institutions.
The material in the library data section of this adventure is intended to provide
background for the universe, and to provide clues to interesting or important
situations and adventures.

Scout Way Stations: In addition to scout bases, a number of scout way stations
are presented on the Spinward Marches map. Way stations are large, well-equipped
scout bases capable of handling many ships and providing repairs if required. Their
general purpose is to support the interstellar xboat network which provides fast
message forwarding and is run by the scouts.

Surveying Systems: The appendix includes the universal planetary profiles for all
440 worlds in the Spinward Marches. This information is the data that the charac-
ters seek in their survey. However, obtaining the information should not be a
simple, straightforward task. In many cases, the crew could simply look up the
local UPP at the starport, copy the data into their report, and set off for the next
system. The result is not the intent of the audit; the characters will be required to
furnish proof of their results, and that proof comes from instrument readings
and survey records.

The characters should be required to actually survey the system even if they
already know the answers they seek. For example, Regina (1920-A788899-A is
the world on which the group begins. They could easily look up the UPP in local
records; such an answer does not include the necessary supporting data, and would
not be acceptable by the scout service. Instead, they should utilize the auditing
table to determine the information. The order in which the information is gathered
depends on the situation, but in general world size, hydrographies, and population
will be noted from orbit, the starport will be examined on site, and the atmosphere
will be analyzed from the world surface. Government, law level, and tech level will
be investigated in depth by the player-characters through interviews and simple
poking around.

# AUDITING WORLDS AND THEIR STATISTICS

## STARPORT

Value determined by examination of
starport from world surface. No varia-
tion from true value possible.
Three hours.

## SIZE

Value determined by examination
from orbit using ship's scanners. No
variation from true value possible.
Less than one hour.

## ATMOSPHERE

Value determined by examination
from world surface using ship's sensors.
No variation from true value possible.
One hour.

## HYDROGRAPHICS

Value determined by examination
from orbit by ship's scanners. No
variation from true value possible.
Three hours.

## POPULATION

Value determined from orbital scans
of world. Sensed value may vary from
true value based on local tech level;
referee may provide inaccurate readings
on first two readings made by the crew.
Three hours.

## GOVERNMENT

Value determined from contact with
local government, generally in the form
of communicator and personal inter-
actions. Referee may provide inaccurate
readings on the first two readings by the
crew.
Three hours times 1D.

## LAW LEVEL

Value determined from contact with
local government, generally in the form
of personal contact and interviews.
Referee may provide inaccurate results
on the first two readings by the crew.
Three hours times 2D.

## TECH LEVEL

Value determined by examination of
available materials on the world surface.
Referee may indicate specific items,
which the characters may match to the
tech level table in Book 2.

General descriptions of equipment
available for sale or seen in use should
be consistent, but may be deliberately
slanted to a tech level lower than
properly rated.

Three hours per description, or per
area investigated. Longer periods are
required in atmosphere 1- or A+.

Characters may attempt as many readings as they wish. Each reading requires
the indicated time; each reading may be performed by one person, and different
characters may perform different readings at the same time.

## Adventuring

This adventure is an excuse. It's an excuse for players and referee to begin a
Traveller adventure the same evening they get Deluxe Traveller. As such, it has to
fulfill certain basic requirements. First, it needs to present an already established
situation; it does that with the Spinward Marches. Second, it needs to present
things to do; that it does, in abundance.

Starting out to play Traveller should be a gradual thing. The basic rules cover
many interesting concepts, and each should be played to savor its quality. Thus,
many of the seemingly easy parts of the adventure should be played for the ex-
perience they give the players in playing and the referee in refereeing.

## BEGINNING ADVENTURES

Initially, this adventure and the basic rules provide several ideas for things to
do. They include:

Find a Psionics Institute: Looking for psionic testing and training is always
an interesting pursuit. The actual quest for the Institute is often a side venture
as the group travels on other missions.

Trade and Speculation: Engaging in commercial ventures appeals to the basic
profit motive that most players have. It enables them to progress in terms they
readily understand, and to use their rewards for other activities.

Arming the Ship: Since the scout/courier is unarmed initially, an early priority
for the group will be finding some sort of weaponry for the ship. This search can be
multi-faceted as the group seeks money for the job, and then tries to find a suitable
weapon. The precise types of weapons to be installed can be the subject of many
discussions; the possibility of surplus equipment can make the price lower, and
perhaps the equipment less reliable.

The Patron: Early on, the group should meet the patron and begin their survey
of the Spinward Marches. This encounter is the end of the early adventures, and the
beginning of wide-ranging activity.

## MORE ADVENTURES

Each world within the Marches presents the possibility for an adventure. That
isn't to say that each should be an adventure; many worlds are simply refueling
points or places along the way. But the referee can examine the details of the
universal planetary profile and can construct reasonable adventures based merely
on the information presented. For example:
Gerome (Rhylanor 2818-X573000-0): A moderate-sized world with a standard
tainted atmosphere and 30% water oceans, Gerome is unpopulated and has no
starport. Further, it is classified travel zone red. The interdiction of movement to
the world could be for any reason, but the lack of population makes it probable
that it is to protect as yet untapped mineral deposits. Rumors or patrons could
lead to the world, to prospecting and mining, and to clashes with the authorities.
The referee is responsible for creating various tables, maps, and charts which
would regulate the actual conduct of such a campaign.

Patinir (Aramis 3207-C000632-9): This asteroid belt could easily prove a loca-
tion for a cat and mouse game between pirates and the adventurers. Depending on
the referee's preferences, the situation could quickly escalate into the discovery of a
pirate base, a hidden Ancient site, a cache of military supplies left over from a
previous war, a lode of copper, or a graveyard of lost ships.
Similar scenarios can be generated from almost any world in the Spinward
Marches.

PREPARED ADVENTURES

Many published adventures are already set within the Spinward Marches. The
following is a cross-section indicated by location:
Regina Subsector: Adventure 1, The Kinunir, is a multi-scenario adventure
which takes place within the Regina subsector. Activity centers on several different
examples of the 1200-ton Kinunir class battlecruiser. There is an espionage mission
on Regina, a hunting trip to Knorbes, and a prison break.
Vanejen: Adventure 2, Research Station Gamma, deals with a single research
station. The standard plan, however, can be used to deal with research stations
anywhere within the Marches. Further, the library data in this adventure includes
reference to research stations, and is intended to spark curiosity about the stations.
The Spinward Main: Adventure 3, Twilight's Peak, centers on details of the
jump-1 route which extends to many portions of the Marches. The adventure
itself hits several levels of interest, from the quest for money, to Zhodani threats, to
deep dark secrets.
Mithril: Double Adventure 2, Mission on Mithril, deals with a group in a scout/
courier and their efforts to survey a single world in detail.
Dinom: The reverse side of Double Adventure 2, Across the Bright Face, is
a dash across the fiery hot face of a vacuum world to escape death at the hands of
revolutionaries.
Yorbund: Double Adventure 1, Shadows, involves the investigation of an alien
structure.
Keng: The reverse side of Double Adventure 1, Annie Nova, is an encounter
with a derelict alien starship and the steps taken to understand it.

## STILL MORE ADVENTURES

Many other sources of adventures are easily available. Supplement 6,76 Patrons,
contains an entire book full of situations for the referee to use in the course of the
characters' travels. The Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society regularly provides
scenarios (called Amber Zones) for use with Traveller adventures. And, of course,
science fiction stories and movies can easily provide inspirations for any number of
activities.

# Library Data

Library data is information obtainable from ship's computers, local reference
computers, or other sources of data in response to browsing or keywords. Only the
specific information requested should be given to requesting players; care should be
taken not to reveal additional data. The referee should read through the entire bank
of library data as background to the situation.

Ancients: Extinct intelligent major race of unclassified origin which pervaded
this spiral arm approximately 300,000 years ago. Archeological evidence recovered
from excavations of Ancient sites and radioactive dating of craters indicate that the
race died out during a two thousand year period of intense warfare, leaving only
ruined installations and shattered planets.
The Ancients were responsible for the wide dissemination of humaniti within its
current domain when (for reasons currently unclear) they transplanted humans
from Sol/Terra to at least forty worlds across a span of 360 parsecs. See Humaniti.
The Ancients were also responsible for the creation of the Vargr through genetic
manipulation of Terran carnivore/chasers. See Vargr.
Capital (Core 0508-A586A98-F): Central world of the Imperium and seat of
government since its founding. Situated in the center of the Imperium, its astro-
graphical location has proven to be ideal for controlling the vast area of Vilani
and Solomani dominated space that formed the main portion of the First and Sec-
ond Imperiums as well as the present Third Imperium. Besides being a communica-
tions hub, Capital is also a cultural and educational center.
Confederation: Group of independent states, worlds, or systems united for
specified purposes, while generally retaining more freedom of action than the
members of a federation. Other common names include League and Alliance.
Directions, Galactic: North and south do not work when referring to directions
within the galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have achieved widespread
acceptance when referring to direction.
Toward the galactic core is coreward; away from it, in the direction of the rim, is
rimward. In the direction in which the galaxy is rotating is spinward, while the
other direction is trailing.
These directions are in widespread use in describing Imperial features and
businesses. For example, the Spinward Marches is a sector at the extreme spinward
fringe of the Imperium; Rimward Lines is an important interstellar transport
company.
Finally, within the Imperium, the term coreward is also used to indicate the
direction of Capital, the Imperial core. There is some potential for confusion if the
term is accepted out of context.
Dating Systems: Three major dating systems are in use when referring to his-
torical events: Terran, Vilani, and Imperial.
Terran dates center on a year about 4500 years before the founding of the Third
Imperium. After that date, years ascend, and are suffixed AD; before that date,
years descend, and are suffixed BC. There is no year zero.

Vilani dates count from the year of the
establishment of the Pax Vilanica (using the
Vilani year, which is equal to 1.33 standard
years). Those before are suffixed PI (pre-
Imperium); those after are suffixed VI
(Vilani Imperium).

Imperial dates count from the year of the
founding of the Third Imperium, specifying
the year zero as a holiday year. Dates before
that are negative, dates after that positive,
with the sign usually suppressed. Imperial
dating uses a Julian system for days. Each
day in the year is consecutively numbered
beginning with 001. Thus, in the year 1105,
the first day of the year is 001-1105.

Zhodani dating is in olympiads (obviously a translation). Each olympiad is of
three Zhodani years; each Zhodani year is 0.75 standard years, and an olympiad is
2.24 standard years. The first olympiad corresponds to -6730; 1106 corresponds to
the 3498th olympiad.

Federation: Group of states, worlds, or systems, each internally independent,
joined into a union to which has been surrendered certain rights and responsi-
bilities, most generally to do with foreign affairs.

First Imperium (-4044 to -2219): The first major interstellar civilization,
politically and culturally dominated by humans originating on Viand. The jump
drive was discovered on Viand in -9235. Immediately the Vilani discovered a
number of interfertile and technologically primitive human races on worlds within
60 parsecs. These were gradually brought to a high-technology state with Vilani
help, and assimilated into a loose interstellar community bound by trade and
common culture. Eventually, the client races themselves explored beyond the local
sphere, contacting and trading with still more races. These new races gained their
technology without being assimilated into Vilani culture; the resulting increasing
friction eventually resulted in a series of wars, beginning about -5400. In response
to the threat, Viand began tightening its control of its trade sphere, finally organiz-
ing it into a centralized state in -5273. This marked the beginning of the First
Imperium. although there was as yet no emperor. During the thousand year period
of the Consolidation Wars, Viand conquered and absorbed its enemies until in there
were no longer any civilized states on its borders (except for a portion of the Vargr
Extents, isolated from the Imperium by the Great Rift). The last war ended in
-4044, and Vilani dating begins at this point. With no exterior threats, the Pax
Vilanica lasted for nearly 1200 years; at its height, attained soon after the end of
the wars, the First Imperium contained 27 sectors and over 15,000 worlds. How-
ever, the cost of maintaining centralized control over this vast expanse was cultural
rigidity; exploration had ceased with the beginning of the wars; now scientific
research slowed to a halt, and the beginnings of a hereditary caste system began to
emerge. Civilization was in decline. As long as there was no exterior threat, the
Imperium was safe; but gradually, despite all efforts, technology leaked across the
borders. New interstellar states arose, and the Imperium could no longer afford to
absorb them. Gradually, the Imperium lost territory along its coreward and trailing
marches. Then, in -2422, the Imperium was contacted along its rimward border by
the Terrans, recently emerged into space. Terran expansionism led to a series of
interstellar wars, ultimately resulting in Terran conquest of the Imperium in -
and the founding of the Rule of Man.

The First Imperium bore many names in its long life, including the Grand Imper-
ium of Stars, the Grand Imperium, and the Vilani Empire.

Frontier Wars: A series of interstellar wars waged between the Imperium and the
Zhodani Consulate for control of the Spinward Marches. The five wars (so far)
represent open flares of conflict in a constant struggle for supremacy.
Humaniti (old spelling: humanity): All of humaniti originated from human
ancestors on Terra/Sol, transplanted for reasons unknown by the Ancients through-
out this spiral arm of the galaxy. Most races have diverged only slightly from the
original pattern, and 80% of all human races are considered members of a single
species, Homo sapiens. The remaining 20% are other species of genus Homo. Of all
human races, three have gained major status: Vilani of Viand, Solomani of Terra,
and Zhodani of Zhodane.

Research Station: The scattered worlds of the Imperium manifest a wide range
of technological levels; this diversity is maintained by the distances between worlds,
the high cost of transportation, and the relative independence allowed to worlds
within the Imperium.

Nevertheless, the Imperium itself is constantly involved with research projects
at the forefronts of technology. While some new technology can be purchased from
advanced cultures beyond the Imperial boundaries, such high technology is expen-
sive, and still requires a solid technological foundation to allow its usage. Consider:
however useful solid-state chip circuits are, they still require a firm grounding in
electronics, and cannot be used on a large scale without electronics, individual
solid-state chip components, photo processing, and even crystal culture. It is vital
that the Imperium pass through many stages of technological development on the
way to achievement in higher tech level areas.

Imperial technological research is performed in two ways: under contract by
corporations, or in established Imperial Research Stations. The difference is that
the corporate (and equivalent privately financed) research is directed at specific
practical uses, while Imperial projects are breaking new ground on the forefronts of
knowledge.

Rule of Man (-2204 to -1776): Upon the conquest of the Vilani Imperium by
the Terran Confederation, the Terrans moved to establish government of the region.
At first, conquered regions came under the administration of the navy, under
martial law. Much use was made of the existing bureaucracy and former Vilani
administrators, with naval officers in scattered key posts. When the Confederation
civilian government attempted to transfer control directly to Earth, the navy
refused. From his headquarters on Dingir, the commander in chief of the fleet.
Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, proclaimed himself Regent of the Vilani Imperium
and Protector of Terra, with both states now united in the Rule of Man. Nearly all
the fleet instantly sided with him, evidence of his careful preparation, and the Con-
federation Secretariat was dissolved in a bloodless capitulation. Estigarribia never
actually assumed the crown, but after his death he was succeeded by his former
chief of staff, who was crowned as Hiroshi II. Estibarribia is therefore known to
history as the Emperor Hiroshi I.

Ultimately, the task of ruling the vast expanses of the Rule of Man proved
impossible. The Rule of Man continued to exist for four hundred years, constantly
trying (and failing) to stem the decay of the First Imperium's rule.

The Rule of Man is also known as the Second Imperium or (disparagingly) as the
Ramshackle Empire.

Sector: A mapping unit in astrography, equal to sixteen subsectors (four wide
and four deep). Sectors are broad measures of area, and are often used for rough
representations of relative size between interstellar empires. Average density: 480
to 640 worlds.

Sectors are also called Marches, or Regions. The Spinward Marches are an
example of a sector.

Subsector: A mapping unit in astrography, consisting of a rectangular area ten
parsecs by eight parsecs. Subsectors are also called Districts, Provinces, or Clusters.
Average density: 30 to 40 worlds.

Twilight's Peak: During the Second Frontier War (615 to 622), a payroll ship-
ment to the Marches disappeared, including the transport carrying it and three
escort vessels. Decades later (791), one of the escorts was found in the Treece/Lanth
system, out of fuel and power, and its crew of three dead. The only clue to its story
was the diary of one of the crewmembers, written in the form of an epic poem.

Infuriatingly, the epic told what had happened, but not where.

The transport was forced down in a mountainous region of a habitable world
(possibly in the Lanth or Rhylanor subsectors) and had to be abandoned after the
pilot botched the landing. The crew of one escort mutinied and attempted to take
the payroll for themselves. The other two escorts resisted; the mutiny was put
down, but the mutineers' ship was destroyed and one of the loyal escorts crippled.

The survivors transferred life support equipment from the wrecked ships to an
octagonal mountaintop structure of undetermined age and settled in. Long verses
describe the extensive subterranean passages accessible from this structure, and the
adventures of the group in making it safe for them. Finally, the functional ship set
out for help. One particular sequence referred to this location as Twilight's Peak,
and the name has continued in writings on the subject.

Additional clues in the epic poem lead one to believe that the mystery world is
from 8000 to 12000 kilometers in diameter, with a standard density atmosphere.
It probably is off the trade routes, and has little or no population.

Vargr: Intelligent race derived from Ancient genetic manipulations of Terran
carnivore/chaser stock. Vargr have long suffered from an inability to organize
themselves (to any degree or for any length of time) beyond the star system level,
and their empires rise and fall with unsurprising regularity. The only cohesive force
is an intense racial pride, which causes a slight tendency for racial cooperation,
although its major effect is to get individuals into fights with those who insult them.

The Vargr are scattered across most of the coreward edge of the Imperium in
many splinter empires collectively called the Extents. These states war with each
other as much as with non-Vargr, and there is constant strife as each tries to estab-
lish a position superior to the others. Some Vargr have been more-or-less allied with
the Zhodani for several centuries, and have participated in the Frontier Wars.
Others have maintained a strict neutrality, or even allied with the Imperium.

# Alien Races

The characters which the players have generated are assumed to be humans.
There are other races possible: both different strains of humans and truly alien
races. Some of the races to be encountered are described below; others are also
possible.

## ZHODANI

The humans of the Zhodani Consulate are quite similar to the ordinary humans
of the Imperium. The major difference characterizing the Zhodani is their practice
of the Psionic Heresy. Society is divided into three classes: nobles, intendants, and
proles. Nobles (social level B+) are the enfranchised ruling class, and are given psion-
ic training from childhood. Intendants (social level A) are the managers and admin-
istrators of society, and also receive early training. Proles (social level 9 or less) are
forbidden to use psionics or receive training.

Within this rigid class system there are two opportunities for promotion to a
higher class: all prole children with a high tested psionic potential are taken from
their families and adopted into the intendant class; intendants are rewarded for
great diligence, service to the state, or victory in the Psionic Games by grants of
noble titles.

Referee's Note: Zhodani characters are generated in the same manner as normal
human characters. However, all characters are provided with psionic testing at an
early age. All characters with social level A+ are automatically trained in psionics.
In addition, all characters with psionic strength of 9+ and social level below A have
their social levels raised to A and receive training. If a character receives +1 or +2
social level during the character generation or mustering out process and this would
raise his or her social level from 9 or less to A or more, the benefit is not received;
roll again.

The Zhodani present a problem to individuals within their territory. It can
be assumed that someone can read minds, and illegal or unacceptable motives
can be detected quite easily. Thus, characters wandering through Zhodani territory
must remain apart from locals, acquire psionics shields, or have only the purest of
motives.

Conversely, because psionics is firmly disliked within the Imperium, Zhodani
characters will not be commonly found within Imperial borders unless they conceal
their identities and origins.

## SWORD WORLDERS

The Sword Worlds Confederation is a human culture, and Sword Worlders are
quite ordinary humans. They do not share the Imperium's dislike for psionics, but
have no organized testing or training.

## DARRIANS

The Darrian Confederation is an old society established long before the majority
of the Spinward Marches were settled. It is currently recovering from a solar flare
which nearly destroyed civilization on the homeworld of Darrian about 2000 years
ago, when it had achieved a higher technology than even the Imperium now
possesses. Darrian citizens come from varied backgrounds. 60% are ethnic Darrians,
a human minor race, 20% are Solomani, 12% are of other human races, and 8% are
Aslan (described below).

## ASLAN

The Aslan are a race of intelligent beings who have settled in large numbers
within the Imperium. Aslan stand roughly human-sized, averaging 2.0 meters in
height and weighing about 100 kg. They are descended from four-limbed, upright,
bipedal carnivore/pouncer stock, originally adapted to a solitary arboreal existance.
The earliest Terran explorers saw in them a vague resemblance to the Terran lion,
and they have been described (by Terrans) as lion-like ever since, although there is
very little true similarity. The derivation of the word Aslan is unknown. There are
two sexes, male and female. The most notable external difference is the increased
size and mane of the former. Females outnumber males by 3:1.

Aslan have a single highly specialized claw under each thumb which folds back
jacknife fashion into a horny covering in the base of the thumb and palm.
A vast Aslan-dominated empire (the Aslan Hierate) lies far to rimward; but
Aslan themselves have ranged far beyond its borders, with many settling within
the Imperium and attaining full status as citizens. As citizens, they subordinate
themselves to Imperial authority, although they have remained culturally apart
from human society. Aslan serve in the Imperial armed forces; they achieve noble
positions; they pay taxes; they run businesses.

Aslan Society: The Aslan are a warrior race, proud and noble, devoted to
those in authority above them. An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family
(e'kho) of from 2 to 12 individuals under a patriarchal leader. Several families will
combine into a pride (ahriy), with one family dominant. A number of prides form a
clan (huiha) again with a top pride. Aside from military organizations and the ruling
council (within the Hierate), the clan is the highest social/political organization
among the Aslan.

A deep-seated territorial instinct causes the Aslan to have an inordinate (from a
human standpoint) concern with land. For male Aslan, owning land is a major goal
in life. An Aslan's stature is determined by the amount of land he (or her husband)
controls, and the amount any higher lord he may be vassal to controls. The lowest
classes of Aslan are landless, and provide the farmers, laborers, craftsmen, and
factory workers. A holder of a large territory will often grant authority over it to
vassals (usually sons, brothers, or male relatives by marriage) who administer the
land in his name.

The sexes have very different roles in Aslan society. Males (in all but the lowest
classes) are concerned mostly with military operations, acquisition of territory, and
political affairs. Females are concerned with trade, industry, and the accumulation
of knowledge. Upper class males have little conception of money and are literally
incapable of functioning in a technological society without aid, and are thus seldom
encountered without the supervision of a wife, mother, or other female relative or
employer. For instance, a typical Aslan mercenary unit will be organized by a
wealthy married female, who will then assign its operation, for a share of the
proceeds, to an unmarried female relative. The battle commander and most of the
troops will be unmarried males (many of them also relatives), hired with the pro-
mise of land grants (and the opportunity to gain honor and reputation in combat);
however, staff, operations, supply, and intelligence officers will generally be female.
The extremely deadly nature of any combat between Aslan has led to a rigid,
ritualized pattern of behavior designed to reduce conflict. Aslan are very polite and
formal, and must be dealt with in such a way as not to insult their honor. Although
most have learned to be patient with non-Aslan, accidental fights still occur. Dis-
putes between individuals are handled by the patriarchs, disputes between families
by the pride leader, between prides by the clan leader.

Aslan in the Imperium: Large numbers of Aslan have settled outside their
Hierate, and many have settled within the Imperium. Entire planets of Aslan lie
within the Imperium, swearing fealty to the emperor and holding land from him
personally. Aslan mercenary units are in great demand (even though they must be
employed in all-Aslan units because of their equipment requirements) and Aslan
merchant corporations trade throughout most of known space.
Referee's Notes: The player who chooses to be an Aslan should bear in mind
that while they have many similarities to humans, they are not human, and should
not be played as such. Two hints for the prospective Aslan:

1. The underlying characteristics of Aslan society (pride and loyalty) make

behavior much like samurai of the "Age of War".
2. Avoid actions that are out of character. Aslan, for example, are very loyal to
their friends, and it is inconceivable for an Aslan to desert a friend in danger if there
is a chance of rescue.
The six basic characteristics are determined as per Book 1, page 4, with the
following exceptions: add 1 to the strength and endurance throws; subtract 1 from
the dexterity throw. Social standing applies only to inter-Aslan relations.
Aslan of either sex may enter any service; females in the military will generally
be employed in staff positions, whereas males in the merchant service will usually
be hired as ship's gunners, bodyguards, or other similar positions.
The following DMs to the service die rolls in Book 1 apply: Males receive a DM
of -4 for enlistment and re-enlistment rolls in the scout and merchant services. All
Aslan receive a +1 DM on enlistment, re-enlistment, and promotion rolls in the
army and marines, but males tend to take unnecessary chances and receive a -1 DM
for survival in these services.
Skills may be acquired as in Books 1, 4, or 5. Brawling and blade skills automat-
ically become dewclaw skill. In combat, treat the dewclaw as a knife. Aslan receive
+1 to their morale throws if using Book 1, +2 if determining morale for a unit of
Aslan per Book 4.
Aslan can be presented to the players as an alien race to interact with and to
learn more about. Ultimately, some players will want to attempt playing an Aslan
character. The opportunity will present itself if a character dies, or perhaps retires.
The referee should utilize the situation to present an Aslan character for one of the
players to continue with.

# Appendix: World Statistics

The worlds of the Spinward Marches are presented in Traveller Supplement 3,
The Spinward Marches. Each subsector is given two pages in the book; one lists
each world, complete with name, location, UPP, trade classifications, and other
details, and the other page is a complete subsector map. In addition, details on the
history, background, or astrography of the subsector are included. That supplement
may prove useful as a handy guide to the Spinward Marches.
This appendix lists the 440 worlds of the Spinward Marches in the barest detail,
providing name, hex location from the map, and universal planetary profile.
Each hex on the map contains a four digit number, to aid in describing a world's
location. The first two digits give its horizontal position, while the second two
give its vertical position. Thus a world at 2309 can be found 23 hexes from the
left of the map and nine hexes from the top. Worlds are listed here in hex location
order within each subsector.
Book 3 completely explains the meaning of the UPP.
