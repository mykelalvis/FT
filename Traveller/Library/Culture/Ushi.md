Ushi is a language used throughout the [[Gushemege Sector]].

_Ushi_ is a hybrid language with its origins in the starport and spaceways of the [[Gushemege Sector]] .  Initially evolving along the [[Gushemege Main]] from [[Vilani]] and [[Anglic]] influence, it is a language that is part street slang and part ancient echo. It is spoken as a second language to Anglic on almost all worlds of [[Gushemege Sector|Gushemege]], and in some of the more isolated or unruly startowns it is the only language spoken. Uniquely for such a language, it is also favoured by the higher echelons of Gushemege society, partly to provide a link to the people, and partly to act as a display of Gushemege's individuality.

_Ushi_ translator chips can be obtained at all class A and B startports in the sector, but the rapidly evolving nature of the language, always full of new words or meanings of the moment, means that they should be used with caution.
