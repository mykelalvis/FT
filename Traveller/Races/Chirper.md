[[A2RSG-24.jpg|Chiree]]

The semi-intelligent minor race native to [[Vanejen]] is called (by the locals) the chirpers. Once, they ranged widely over the entire world, but have now dwindled down to a few scattered groups. Chirpers are omnivore/gatherers in the 25 kilogram class. Living in small groups with a limited social organization, they follow age old patterns of gathering fruits and berries in the wild.

Chirpers are intelligent to a point, and have been known to learn to speak. Their intelligence is more of a rudimentary cunning, devoted to stealing shiny objects or intriguing gadgets. Since this is usually keys, or shiny coins, or other small valuable items, the humans on [[Vanejen]] have never reacted well to the chirpers. Finally, chirpers are extremely swift, much more so than their size or build would indicate. They can dash and dart about virtually unseen, if they care to. If someone tries to catch one, it usually can get away.

[[Chirper]]s dwell in family groups of hunter-gatherers on the human-dominated continents, although there have been sightings of [[Chirper]] villages, which are primitive but show signs of agricultural and tool-fabrication skills. They are considered a nuisance, sneaking into settlements to steal food and shiny objects, which they seem to like. They are not wantonly destructive but can cause a fair amount of damage in their ingenious attempts to obtain something they want; usually food but they may be motivated by necessity rather than mischief, it is a problem for the locals.

The humans of Vanejen occasionally mount expeditions to drive Chirpers away from settlements and this has been generally successful. Perhaps not coincidentally, Chirper numbers seem to be falling.

Chirpers are small bird-like humanoids with vestigial wings and a reptilian tail, massing about 25kg and omnivorous in nature. They are semi-intelligent and capable of learning a few simple Galanglic phrases, although they mangle pronunciation horribly. Among themselves they communicate with bird-like chirps, hence their human name.
