# Blockade Runner

Based in the Mongoose 2e rule system for Traveler, This adventure is designed to take place during the 5th Frontier war in the Spinward Marches along the front with the Sword worlds or the Zhodani. The group should have access to a starship and be looking to make money on higher risk high reward cargos. Note that this will need to be modified slightly if the players are using a detached duty scout as these have been recalled to duty. The adventure is structured as a series of independent missions each mission with minor changes can be played more than once..

#### Resources

it is helpful if GMs have the following sources available and are familiar with them before running this adventure. However they are not absolutely required. I strongly encourage the use of The Traveller Map and the Traveller Wiki , much of this adventure is based on information that can be found there. When possible I have tried to remain consistent with existing material found in these sources listed below.

Mongoose Traveller 2E - Core Rules (required)

Useful but not required:

## Backstory

The Fifth Frontier war has broken out. Zhodani, Sword World and Vargr Forces have attacked across a wide front. Due to the lag in information and the normal operational security practiced by the Imperium, Travellers will not always know the current front lines or deployment of fleets. This "Fog of War" is useful to the Game master to make things fit the timeline he wants to present. but the general timeline on the Traveller wiki is used to set the sequence of missions in this module.

Running these mission will take @ 1 month of game time each. This includes 2 weeks in jump Space and time to load unload on each end, various administrative delays working with the ILSS. Actual Table time can vary depending on referee time spent on role play.

Applying the Extra Time rule , Players may opt to jump in further out from the planet or system and Drift in to minimize their sensor signature. as a house rule I have applied this as

- 12hrs -1 to opposing sensor roles.
- 1 Day -2 to opposing Sensor rolls
- Running "dark" (all system at minimal power) additional -1 to opposing sensor roles

Encounters do not always need to end in combat. Following the methods above the players may be able to slip in and out without detection. Referees are encouraged to build tension by having sensor contacts make course changes that have nothing to do with the players. reading a good book or movie on submarine operations in WW2 can give you a feel for the atmosphere of trying to slip in undetected.

### Recruiting Station

Any star port, preferably near Regina subsector shortly after the outbreak of the 5th frontier war. The players will be contacted by a Imperial official asking if they are interested in cargos paying "above standard Rates" on a ongoing basis for the foreseeable future.

The agent in question is a member of the imperial Imperial Logistics Support Service a civilian branch supporting the Imperial armed forces. There are many of these agents searching for small independent freighters in te region to help with the war effort.

If the travelers are interested he will give them a contact code in Regina to meet,

DM Modification - If the players are running in a detached duty Scout, the player who "owns it and the ship are subject to military Orders and will not get paid bonuses but thier salaries and operating costs will get picked up by the ILSS.

### Regina

Arriving in Regina the port is very busy with a large and active fleet presence. they will be scanned and possiblly boarded by a local patrol craft (use a gazelle close escort ) eventually the will make their way to the starport and reach out to their contact.

After asking around (ADMIN 6+) they are directed to a set of offices belonging to the ILSS they will be shown to a small room with a terminal and asked to complete form on it, (computer/admin) and left for a while. once the forms are complete a middle aged woman named Mrs. Laskin will come to the room and ask about thier ship, thier past experience as a freight hauler etc. with the preliminaries out of the way she will make the pitch.

"The ILSS is looking for small ships willing to take on some resupply mission into contested areas. the rates are at least double standard cargo rates and depending on the mission profile can be more. logistics and some operational support can be arranged with scout and naval bases depending on the missions. Operational areas will be assigned based on the needs of the service and basing may shift.

Based on the information given on their ship and expenses they will be offered a initial 6 month contract with a base monthly rate to cover operational expenses + 5 %. additionally they will be paid for specific cargo deliveries at a rate of 2-6 times normal cargo rates.

The referee should role play negotiations with the players trying to get the best deal for the Imperium while ensuring the have reliable ships to deliver goods. Allow players to use rolls to influence the negotiation. Assume the Mrs Laskin has Broker 2 , Admin 2 Diplomat 1 and Persuade 1.

Terms that are negotiable

- Term of contract min 3 months max 6 for an initial contract.
- Operation support bonus 5-10%
- Letter of Authorization to access Imperial facilities for repairs and fueling GM Note - this could be a very bad thing if the Zhodani find it in their records ) this is more of a yes/no negotiation but not taking it can be used to increase other factors.
- Types of Goods - non "war Material" will carry a lower rate.

## Mission 1 - A Lousy Location

Louzy (Spinward Marches 1604)

**Timeframe** Shortly after the recall of all scout forces on 206- 1107 by the IISS.

**Departure Locations** - **Boughene J3, Alell J2 or Uakye J**

**Risk factor - Low**

**Mission Profile -** The Travellers are to jump to Louzy and rendezvous with an Imperium System Defense Boat ( SDB). Payment will be 2 x Normal Cargo Rates paid upon return with a countersigned Manifest from the SDB. Rendezvous will take place in the planetoid belt, a set of coordinates will be provided on a data chip and will only activate once the players reach the system.

**DM notes** - Since this is a "first mission" the Travelers will be given supplies that are not considered
"War Materials" Primarily Food, Medical supplies and Entertainment disks, This cargo has a low value on the open market (less than the delivery fee) and is no risk for seizure. This cargo will be in standard sealed shipping containers using normal Merchant codes.

**Rumors** can be picked up While the Travellers wait for the Cargo or from talking to the Loading Crew,

Skills: Carouse , Streetwise

Roll Result

3 or less - no rumors'

4 - 5 The crews that have been "searched" by the Zhodani come back odd, ya know like zombies. That Psi brain control the Zhodani do to people messes them up! (FALSE)

6 - 7 The "Zods" are very good at detecting lies. better tells the truth or at least a version of it.

8 - 10 Zhodani boarding parties generally have a Psi aware member if you have to answer to them tell the truth or at least not a direct Lie.

11 - 12+ Any Zhodani who is a telepath will be an officer or an aide following the officer and they can generally detect a false statement. however statements that are true but maybe an incomplete truth can generally pass.

**System Status Description** - Efate

Efate is currently an active battle zone (see Siege of Efate) and the Travelers are advised to avoid it. Imperial Merchant vessels are subject to boarding and Search by hostile forces, any ships carrying "War

Materials" may be impounded. the Planet and inner system are held by the Imperium but there are Zhodani Squadrons in the outer system

**System Status Description** - Louzy

Currently the SDBs in Louzy are operating as scattered raiders. resupply drops from small blockade runners like the players are their primary source of food, munitions and news.

**Encounters Table**

Roll Result

4 or less - **Zhodani patrol corvette - If this is the Travelers' first time being stopped they will be searched and their transponder code flagged in the Zhodani database**

5 Zhodani Scout - will not Stop them but will scan from a distance and record thier transponder.

6 - - 9 no encounter

10 Imperial SDB

11 Imperial Scout

12+ commercial/merchant Ship ( it will avoid contact)

d6 1 Imperial 2-3 Zhodani 4 Sword World 5 Vargr 6 unknown

Referee Notes- All Encounters will start at Long or Very Long range. Assume any Zhodani, Vargr or Sword World Ships are Hostile. For the initial mission Assume it will be Zhodani and For additional Missions you can substitute appropriate Vargr or Sword World ships depending on the system and state of the War.

The travelers will be given a navigation chip and a data chip. The navigation chip will unlock once they reach the Louzy system and guide them to their rendezvous in the planetoid belt. Once the players arrive in system immediately roll for an encounter, Since they cannot optimize their jump plan due to not knowing the rendezvous point, travel time in system to the rendezvous can vary but will be around 1d6- 1 days (if less than 1 Day roll 4d6 hrs). They will need to wait at the rendezvous for the designated SDB to meet them (roll 7+ Sensors to detect it before it hails them) this will happen in 2d6 hrs.

Once the connection is made they will need to depressurize the hold and transfer cargo. ( 0 G operations 7+) this will take 4d6 man hours with 2 crew from the SDB can assist. While the cargo is being moved the Captain of the SDB will come aboard. He will express his thanks to the crew and ask for the data chip.

**ROLE PLAY** - Captain Mueller and crew are eager for news from "home" and will be very social, players making a carouse roll 6+ can get a idea of how things are going. Nothing he or the crew tells them is a secret to the Zhodani or the Imperium. Player that ask around (streetwise) may find certain luxury commodities that the crews are wanting that could be sold on the side. these can be certain foods or drinks that are allowed within regulations but just are not in the regular supply drops.

Example of the status Captain Mueller will share:

_"The SDB's have scattered into multiple groups at hidden bases around the system we are attacking their supply convoys and pickets. while they hold the main planet and starport we are forcing them to maintain a large force and escort their convoys."_

Once the transfer is complete the captain will give them a signed manifest ship so they can get paid. He will also give them a secured data chip to give to their contact. These data chips are essentially encoded
"mail"

Unless they ask about refueling he will then leave them **Note the starport is in Zhodani control and there are no gas giants.**

**if asked the captain will agree to send a tanker to refuel them if they are willing to wait but it may be a while as they are busy supporting the SDB fleet (1d3 days). the SDBs have access to ice mining in the planetoid belt for fuel but this is difficult without specialized equipment to capture the gas.**

**Referee Notes This same scenario can be run with minor variation in Yves and Menorb against the Vargr out of Boughene or against the Sword Worlders in a location like Rabwhar**

## Mission 2 - Up the Ante

Louzy (Spinward Marches 1604) or any other contested system

**Timeframe** Shortly after the recall of all scout forces on 206- 1107 by the IISS.

**Departure Locations** - **Boughene J3, Alell J2 or Uakye J**

**Risk Factor - Medium**

**Mission Profile -** The Travellers are to jump to Louzy and rendezvous with an Imperium System Defense Boat (SDB). Payment will be 4 x Normal Cargo Rates paid upon return with a countersigned Manifest from the SDB. Rendezvous will take place in the outer system, a set of coordinates will be provided on a data chip and will only activate once the players reach the system.

This will play out similar to mission 1 but they will meet on the outer fringe of the system with a captain Karnth.

**DM notes** - This time the cargo contains munitions. These are considered "War Materials" Crates of turret missiles. This cargo will be in standard sealed shipping containers using normal Merchant codes but if examined (opened). It will reveal the nature of the cargo. this would be bad if they are stopped by the Zhodani, Players may use Persuade, Diplomacy or deception. Assume the Leader of the Zhodani has Level 1 in Persuade, Diplomacy but no skill )-3) in deception due to the nature of Zhodani society. There is a 1 in 6 chance the Zhodani will have a telepath with Read Surface thoughts. in this case they will use this as an opposed role VS Deception. Any success will mean the Zhodani accept the paperwork and do not find the munitions. Failure will mean confiscation of the cargo and the ship will now be flagged for all Zhodani to stop and search.

## Side Adventure - Salvage!

Location : Any System

**Timeframe** Shortly during the 5th frontier war

**Departure Locations** - **Any**

**Risk Factor - Low**

**Mission Profile -** The Travellers have jumped into a system to make a delivery for the ILSS. at some point they will pick up a scanner hit for what appears to be a ship but it is not emitting any signal , energy or activity.

"scanners pick up a sensor return for a Beowulf class free trader. there are no signs of life or activity from the ship."

Approaching to Adjacent range the players can see signs of damage to the ship There is extensive damage to the Starboard portion of the engineering section and the starboard Cargo Hatch is missing

As you get close on the Nose you can see a ships name or Logo.

**Background**

The ship was hit by Vargr pirates several months before the beginning of the war as they were scouting the system. They killed the entire Crew and took the cargo. They also wiped the ships Computer to hide that they were here.

Any inquires will show the ship has been registered as missing with a reward offered for its location
( 1 0000 Cr) from a local Skip Tracer. Alternately the Crew could try to claim salvage rights but they will

- Have to recover the ship and bring it into a friendly port.
- Endure a legal fight with the Bank that owns 80% of the ship, the family of the crew and the Insurance Company that has paid a claim for loss to the bank. (Role Play - Dm may offer a buyout from one of the other claimants.)

**Exploring the Wreck**

**As you make your way into the wreck the lights from your vacc Suit show the area in the stark relief of vacuum with impenetrable shadow everywhere the light does not directly touch.**

**DM notes - The cargo is gone and the ship is lifeless. all areas are without life support. Players will need vac suit and 0 G to explore. The ship is without any fuel and all backups have died. Due to the**

**explosive de-compression most loose material will not be present in the ship, it is very barren.**

## Describe the damage based on the
