### Yafizethe

The Yafizethe are native to [[Kernal]], an agricultural world in the Star Lane subsector. The rear part of their long body supports eight pairs of short 'walking legs' whilst the front part is held upright and supports two pairs of longer legs used as arms or to clear a way through difficult terrain. The brain and primary sense organs are contained in the head.

Yafizethe possess above-average intelligence and the ability to 'see' electrical fields. They evolved in rocky badlands but have spread out to inhabit all of their world, which was gradually unified into a single world-state. This was achieved mainly through negotiation, requiring the creation of training programs to create vast numbers of skilled diplomats. In recent years, Yafizethe negotiators have found employment across the sector in corporate and political positions.
