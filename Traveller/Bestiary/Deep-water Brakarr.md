### Deep-water Brakarr

Known as the deep-water brakarr for its similarity to a shallow water dwelling beast encountered on some other worlds; in fact they are not related. The brakarr is a sinister-looking beast that looks like a fish with an armoured head behind which several manipulative tentacles extend. When moving at speed these are swept back but during an attack they grab prey and haul it into the brakarr's mouth. Brakarr over 1.5 metres long and massing as much as an adult human have been sighted in coastal waters. They are aggressive and can decimate farmed fish stocks if not driven off. They are also quite willing to take on a diver and usually win.

Fortunately, they seem to prefer deep and cold waters and are rarely sighted near Settlement Island. Despite the harsh conditions there is a fair amount of life on land. Much of it is small; crawling insects and so forth. Terran creatures seem not to have gained much of a foothold on Walston, whose local fauna is primitive. There are no major flying creatures, although several species of insect possess the ability to spread a 'wing' membrane and drift on the thin air currents. Some of these tiny flyers drift in swarms which can pose a hazard in inland areas. Prevailing winds keep the western side of Settlement Island clear of them.
