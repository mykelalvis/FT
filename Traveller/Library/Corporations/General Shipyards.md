# GENERAL SHIPYARDS


A subsidiary of [[General Products]], General Yards is a major contractor to the [[Imperial Navy]] and other bulk clients. It is based in [[Regina subsector]] with lesser facilities scattered across the sector. The firm has recently begun to emphasise commercial construction over military vessels, perhaps due to rumored Navy dissatisfaction with certain classes of vessel built by General.
