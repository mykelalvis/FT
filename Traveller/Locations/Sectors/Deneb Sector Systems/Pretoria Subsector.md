The Pretoria subsector contains 31 star systems, of which all but three are Imperial territory. The Imperial Coreward border runs diagonally across the subsector, with a mix of primarily human and Vargr worlds beyond. This border has traditionally been troubled, with the tumultuous politics of the Vargr Extents spilling into Imperial territory.

Even when there is no large-scale problem to disrupt the Coreward end of Pretoria, corsair raids and minor disputes are common. These do not originate exclusively from coreward; neighboring Aramis subsector in the Spinward Marches provides a route into Pretoria for raiders and troublemakers, as do the unaligned worlds of Lamas, to trailing.

Pretoria is at times seen as the politico-economic equivalent of a salient in a defensive line, with (often unrelated) threats coming in from all directions. Not all are of a military nature; a trade dispute just over the border can have serious implications for local industries and ship operators, which in turn can cause dissent on other worlds. There are times when the local nobility long for something as straightforward as a military confrontation. As they say in Pretorian political circles, 'Oh, for a clear target and nobody behind me with a noose'.

The world of Pretoria lies in the center of the subsector, well positioned for local governance but isolated from jump-1 trade by surrounding minor rifts. To overcome this problem, jump bridges were created to link Pretoria to Miwald and Caladib. These bridges are permanent deep-space stations where jump-1 ships can refuel and recalibrate their drives. It is thus possible to reach almost any world in the subsector aboard any jump-capable vessel. The stations are expensive to maintain but benefits to local trade are enormous.

The subsector was originally settled on a small scale as a result of the gradual outward creep typical of Imperial borders. In the 300s the pace increased rapidly as heavy investment was made in a cluster of worlds with impressive mineral wealth. As this local industrial base grew, trade expanded rapidly to follow.  This was not without difficulties; it was not until the 350s that the short-range trade lanes within the subsector were declared safe from piracy. Long-range links back into the [[Imperium]] were likewise threatened by raiders for many years, a problem that has never been completely eradicated.
