The Jewell subsector is where the [[Imperium]] and [[Zhodani]] Consulate meet. Politically, there are three distinct parts to the subsector. The spinward-coreward systems are mostly Consulate and form a thin strip of Zhodani territory projecting into the subsector. [[Farreach]], [[Clan]] and [[Chwistyoch]] are heavily fortified as naval bases and, along with [[Cipango]] in Cronor subsector, form what many Imperial observers call the [[Riverland Wall]].

Imperial holdings in the subsector are limited to eight worlds in the middle (in rimward-coreward terms). Like their [[Zhodani]] equivalents, these are heavily protected for the most part, with forward naval bases at [[Jewell]] and [[Mongo]], and [[Scout Service]] bases at [[Ruby]], [[Emerald]], [[Jewell]], [[Mongo]] and [[Lysen]].

The scout bases include maintenance facilities for the [[x-boat]] service as well as intelligence ships monitoring the frontier. Persistent rumors speak of covert operations launched from these bases, aimed at adjusting the attitudes of neutral worlds or countering [[Zhodani]] activities with similar objectives.

There is no Imperial subsector duke for the Jewell subsector. It is instead administered from [[Regina]] as an additional area of responsibility for Duke Norris.  However, there is a subsector fleet. This is the 212<sup>th</sup> Fleet and is somewhat over-strength for the area it covers. This force is backed up by Sector Fleet assets based at Jewell, which include battle squadrons and a contingent of cruisers obviously intended for raiding operations into Consulate space if war breaks out again.

The exposed nature of the deployment has earned the 212<sup>th</sup> the nickname of _Santanocheev's Tripwire_ and the suggestion that its role is simply to find out if the Zhodani are serious this time. The latter is a reference to the last two Frontier Wars, in which the Zhodani battle fleets were generally held at the frontier.

The remainder of the subsector is ostensibly neutral, although Imperial access to worlds behind the [[Riverland]] Wall is very limited, allowing the Consulate much greater influence over [[Condyole]] and [[Puparkin]], as well as non-aligned worlds in [[Cronor Subsector]].

Some of the worlds in the rimward end of the subsector are coming under the influence of Arden or, more accurately, the alliance of political and economic interest groups collectively calling itself the [[Federation of Arden]]. It is possible that some of these worlds may eventually become part of an alliance with Arden, although how the [[Imperium]] and Consulate will react to this development (if it occurs at all) remains to be seen.

[[Esalin]] is an unusual case. Located between the [[Imperium]] and Consulate, it was settled by the [[Imperium]] in 835 and captured by the [[Zhodani]] in 1082, at the beginning of the [[Fourth Frontier War]]. Imperial and [[Zhodani]] cultures have become intermingled since then and both generally get along amicably. As a result, a joint communiqu√© issued in 1098 established [[Esalin]] as a neutral and open world, which has since enjoyed good relations with both the Consulate and Imperium.
