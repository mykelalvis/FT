Despite the notion that an agent will work for anyone, there are a handful of powerful agencies that are always looking for new blood to pump into their veins. The next chapter is dedicated to four types of organizations that regularly use agents to achieve their goals.

There are many times where an agent’s role brings him into direct contact with the legal system, officers of the law and criminals. This book has a chapter dedicated to the various degrees of law and legal authority in the Traveller settings. Through the many law levels of standard designations and the people to talk to in order to serve or avoid them, this book lays the groundwork of the Traveller law system.

Governments are one of the leading employers of freelance agents, often sending them against one another in subtle ways; using information as much as bullets or lasers. The next chapter in the sourcebook covers the various levels of agent espionage. Computer warfare, the servants of lesser governments and counter-spy intelligence gathering are all facets of what an agent may be called upon to do. This chapter shows them how.

The most lucrative employment options for an agent normally come from behind the table of a megacorporation’s board of directors. The chapter focussed upon corporate dealings and contracts is an agent’s guide to working under the multi-trillion Credit powerhouses without getting swallowed up and digested.

Some agents work within the legal system... but not for it. These dedicated folk are called bounty hunters and this book gives them a small chapter of their own. This section looks at how an agent can make a living hunting down bounties and bond jumpers.

The book comes to a close with an armory of agent-related goods and technologies. Including a new stealth equipment, cybernetic enhancements and some personal long-range craft; this final chapter is where an agent should be able find something of use no matter what branch they serve.

## INTRODUCTION

The greater universe of _Traveller_ is a vast place that contains countless people with an infinite number of schemes, plots and agendas. Some of these agendas are personal things that are undertaken by a single individual but most are larger affairs that affect tens of thousands of employees, constituents or co-workers. When clandestine methods are needed to complete a task, an employer will call on third parties to expedite his needs – _Agents_.

Agents are a lot of different things for their employers but most of all they are problem solvers. They accept contracts that range from the simple policing of a neighborhood or investigating a rival corporation to the secret assassination of a wayward Imperial duke. They have to be smart, cunning, skilled and ready for the kinds of obstacles the galaxy has to offer. Hired by the likes of corporations, governments and nobles, an agent’s job is infinitely easier to define than it is to perform.

An agent does whatever the employer requires of him.

_Traveller: Agent_ is one in a series of career path sourcebooks that expand greatly upon the initial career as presented in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Where _Traveller_ players only had minimal information to completely describe their Agent characters previously, this book opens the floodgates of ideas, options and new facets to explore.

This book not only holds the key to fleshing out Agent characters but also adds several new elements to the entirety of the _Traveller_ gaming system. In most _Traveller_ settings you will find powerful corporations, criminals and conspiracy-laden governments to interact with. Putting their own agents in play like the pieces of a chessboard, this book gives Referees a collection of new narrative items, rules and ideas to use in their own games.

With the information found in this book, all _Traveller_ fans can discover the real benefits and drawbacks of the game’s most mysterious career path, the world they live in and the people they work for. _Traveller: Agent_ is the guidebook to everything revolving around the agent career.

##### USING THIS BOOK

From a game perspective, this book has a variety of new rules, setting information and equipment to expand the boundaries of _Traveller_. Each chapter reveals more about what it means to be an agent in the universe and allows readers to discover the insidious dealings that their employers are caught up in. _Traveller: Agent_ is designed to lift the veil of the most secretive of career paths.

The book begins with a chapter dedicated to expanding greatly on the Agent career path. Once only consisting of three sub-paths, this sourcebook offers a staggering twenty-one different paths based on seven Agent Careers. If a character wants to be a governmental handler of VIPs or the assassin that targets them; they can find out how in this chapter.

_Traveller_ has always been about the intersection of the vast forces of physics, history and economics and the tiny, personal stories of individuals. Travellers experience the fall of civilizations and the movements of empires in a uniquely personal way. As above, so below; the characters embody the actions of greater powers. The story of one tramp trader can be replicated a billion times larger to show the expansion of civilization and trade into lawless space. A galactic war that engulfs hundreds of worlds can also be two men in a ruined city, each trying to kill the other. _Traveller_ tells galactic history through the adventures of individuals and small groups.

Agents are the clearest example of this capacity for embodiment. They are literally the agents of greater powers – of the Imperium or of other governments, of justice and order, of megacorporations or other unscrupulous institutions. They are the human face of vast organizations or movements.

##### CHARACTERISTICS

Education and Intelligence are the key attributes for an agent. Agencies recruit the best-educated and most self-sufficient people they can find, especially those with useful or unusual backgrounds. A moderate Social Standing is useful to some agents, although agents may be trained in constructing cover identities from a variety of social standings. Strength, Dexterity and Endurance are important only to field agents.

The Agency Almost every agent works for a larger organization of some sort – a government department, a corporation, a world’s law enforcement agency, a spy network – and it is this agency that recruits and trains the agent. Successful agents can request more support from the agency; agents who fail the agency will be left out in the cold.

In the game, the agency functions much like a patron, assigning missions to the agent. The agency may also be able to provide help such as money, transport, equipment or support during a mission.

Trust In game terms, a character’s standing with his agency is determined by both his rank and his Trust, which measures how much his superiors trust and rely on him. Trust is acquired like a skill during character creation and through roleplaying thereafter.

_For example, Agent Yan has a Rank of 3 in the Ministry of Justice and a Trust score of 3. He can only request Rank 3 or lower assets from the agency but has a +3 DM when rolling to determine if he receives the assets._

# AGENT CHARACTER GENERATION

Cover Identities

Many agents choose or are ordered to create cover identities. Roll a separate Social Standing for each cover identity.

Cover identities are rated as follows: Very Weak (+0): The agent has a false name and forged identification but little else. Weak (+1): The agent adds secondary references like credit accounts and property deeds to his identity. Average (+2): The agent creates good electronic records that back up all of his physical accounts. Strong (+3): The cover identity is given a full background, including university or military records from an obscure but researchable planet. Very Strong (+4): The agent has made a complete second life out of the cover identity, including a full roster of Imperial background records that will pass most investigations.

Each cover identity has its own career path; events may permit an agent to roll on the skills or events tables for a different career taken by his cover identity, allowing him to pick up different skills and benefits.

For example, Agent Yan has two cover identities – one is a belter named Wild Bob, the other is a corporate executive and frequent traveller named Heran Wight. Yan has spent one full term maintaining the Wight identity, making it a Strong cover that is likely to stand up to considerable scrutiny. He has only spent a few weeks as Wild Bob
(just long enough to purchase a Seeker mining vessel and make a few contacts), so it is a Weak cover.

Networks Agents may also create networks of informants, contacts and allies. Networks must be cultivated over time but may pass on rumors and useful information to the agent or provide help in times of need. Networks are also rated numerically like skills and are acquired through events, skill tables or through roleplaying. Networks are as follows:

Leaving the Agency Mustering out of the agent career does not always mean that the character has left the agency. If the Referee approves, the character may actually be on a deep cover assignment, which can allow him to draw on agency resources while adventuring.

# AGENCIES

An agent in _Traveller_ exists by the contracts and dealings he makes with the agencies that hire him. Depending on who is signing the paycheques and who is calling the shots, an agent can take on nearly any role from paper-pushing desk jockeys at the nearest Imperial Justice Office, to gang-battling arbiters on a street-tough world.

Throughout the _Traveller_ game settings there can be countless different types of agencies that seek out and hire an active Agent character. This chapter is dedicated to some of the agency types that could hire characters that ended their Character Creation as Agents. Some of these agencies are widespread across several genres and styles of game settings, as we understand that not every game will be based in the original _Traveller_ universe of the Third Imperium of Man.

Each agency has its own pros and cons, its own viewpoints on the galaxy as a whole and specific rules that agents working within them are _supposed_ to follow in order to remain employed. They are what guides and directs their agents in their actions.

## IMPERIAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

The Imperial Ministry of Justice largely exists to enforce Imperial High Law. It is mostly engaged in apprehending felons who are beyond the reach of planetary governments, felons who travel from one world to the next to avoid the repercussions of their crimes. It also investigates corporations and governments and can, on occasion, operate on worlds requesting support for their local law enforcement. In all its activities the Ministry of Justice largely relies upon agents to enforce its authority.

The Ministry of Justice is the managerial authority over all transgressions and violations of Imperial High Law. So long as the event takes place within Imperial territory, which includes ambassadorial excursions and Imperial vessels abound, the Ministry is the ultimate power behind what is to happen to the criminal(s) in question. Emperor Strephon Aella himself handed the power to the Ministry to be the arbiters of his judgments in these matters.

It is the providence of the Ministry to arrange for ducal courts to be set up around the Imperium to take on the duties of criminal hearings and sentencing. The subsector dukes appoint powerful inquisitorial judges out of the noble bloodlines, creating local justices whose role is to weigh guilt versus innocence upon the scales of the evidence brought to them. The justices can appoint court legate advocates to assist them in particularly busy legal dockets but the final say and judgment of any Ministry sentencing is on the shoulders of the appointed judge.

Occasionally the Ministry will require the judge to head a Tribunal of Justice, most often in the cases of great import or media exposure. Too often are the noble judges raked across the coals of public opinion when they hand down the sentencing. A tribunal can help make their decisions seem more like a fair gesture rather than a heavy-handed punishment that might be confused as noble tyranny. No matter how many justices or judges work toward the acquittal or final sentence, it is Imperially binding. No re-trials, no appeals and definitely no questioning of the law.

The Ministry of Justice also is in direct charge of the Imperial prison system. Manned prisons and exile compounds are all created and monitored by wardens and overseers appointed by the subsector dukes. These officers of the judiciary system are trusted to manage and operate their facilities on their own with the resources rationed to them, sometimes coming up woefully short to handle the number of prisoners they are supposed to maintain.

Within the Ministry, the judges, wardens and their appointed arbiters are not as numerous as sometimes they need to be. Criminals must be captured and ferried to the courts, evidence must be acquired or transported; even simple sentencing can require manpower that the justices may not have on staff. Where planetary legal systems and police forces do their jobs adequately on a smaller, local level, the Ministry is too large to always efficiently staff every position it requires.

This is where the hiring of agents is important. For every subsector duke that has arranged for a judge to be appointed and a ducal court created, there are no less than two dozen agents working for that ducal office and the Ministry of Justice.

Ministry agents tend to be enforcers of the legal system themselves, sometimes police officers, investigators or bounty hunters that have been pulled into the Ministry’s employ on account of their exemplary records or reputations. Whether they are honest and upstanding is another matter but their positions require them to at least pay lip service to Imperial Law.

Agents employed by the Ministry of Justice are used in a variety of ways. They can expect their duties to include serving as stand-in tribunal members, travelling between planets or systems to serve as a Ministry notary, investigating the veracity of claims or evidence and even the acquisition and ferrying of criminals and convicts. When the judges do not have the manpower or resources, they will lean on their contracted agents to fulfil the necessary tasks. These agents carry credentials that make them the extension of a particular subsector duke and the ducal court.

In very rare cases, some agents of the Ministry of Justice are appointed or employed by the Minister himself. These agents are given written and data-fed Imperial Warrants empowered by the Emperor through Imperial Edict 97. This grants the bearer immunity to the local problems, legalities and bureaucracies of Imperial territories, making these warrants among the most powerful writs in the entire Imperium. An agent carrying an Imperial Warrant can come and go nearly anywhere without obstacle, flashing the warrant to get access to the most classified or top secret information. For this reason alone Imperial Warrants are not handed out often or lightly.

Working with the Imperial Ministry of Justice is lucrative and rarely dull because of the size and scope of the jurisdictions each ducal court covers. Never wanting for assignments, Imperial agents can look forward to dangerous missions and lengthy trips across entire sectors in the name of their employer. These agents are given a much broader scope of freedom to do their jobs; a by-product of being a cog in a judiciary machine that spans an empire.

This loosely monitored system sometimes breeds corruption amongst Ministry agents, as it becomes easier to accept bribes and ‘lose’ evidence when the closest supervisory officer might be ten parsecs away. Agents that bend or break the edicts they are being paid to adhere to play a risky game with their careers and their lives.

When trying to acquire a permit to search an Imperial Merchant Vessel (a Rank 2 action), he simply has to roll his Trust modified by his Social Standing and achieve the listed 8+. When attempting to employ Star Marines to help him breach a criminal stronghold (a Rank 4 action), he will have a –4 DM to that test. Acquiring a piece of local evidence (a Rank 1 action) however, would be made with an additional +1 DM.

## LOCAL POLICE FORCES

There are a seemingly endless number of communities that exist on the seemingly endless number of planets in the vast galactic population of star systems throughout Charted Space. Most of these places have created some form of civilization for themselves and civilization means order. Order means laws; and laws mean law enforcement. For most sentient beings, this means having a police force.

Police forces are localised (i.e. not interplanetary) agencies that exist to serve the powers that be, uphold the law and protect one another against the criminals of their specific area. They are the detectives, policemen, peace officers and criminal investigators of the worlds. They might go by different titles or organizational tiers but they generally all exist to serve the laws of their community. This is sometimes far easier said than done and many local police forces hire large numbers of agents to fill their ranks.

Every person in the service of the force is, technically speaking, an agent of the police. From the middle-aged beat cop to the rookie with a heart of gold, police of all sorts can be (and probably are) Agents. Depending on the legal structure for the local area, these agents can work openly and in uniform (or at least carry a badge) instead of behind closed doors and in secrecy. Agents working for a local police force are not always so upstanding or forthcoming but most police agents tend to be working for the greater communal good.

Leaving larger and more influential Imperial High Law in the hands of the Ministry, local police forces focus their attentions on keeping their own community safe and law abiding. A planetary constabulary will not worry about catching an Imperial traitor unless asked to do so by a higher department but might have an entire task force dedicated to keeping street gangs under control or dangerous drugs out of circulation. Just as the Ministry of Justice could not care any less about the miniscule happenings of some town on the far side of a subsector, the local police agents do not need to stress about that ducal magistrate’s treasonous appropriation of funds.

The agents working for a local police force must have three main considerations in mind when taking the job – the legal code they will be upholding, the public opinion of the police force and the severity of the criminal element they will be opposing.

The first consideration is what the local populace considers their level of law and punishment. A somewhat primitive community might have few laws but extremely strict punishments, whereas a different location might be extremely lenient toward non-violent crimes. It is necessary for the agent to know what will be expected of him; what sorts of laws he will be required to uphold and to what extent he can punish the offenders. A police agent that does not know the laws may accidentally break them while trying to do his job, putting him at odds with his own agency.

The next consideration an agent must pay attention to before hiring on with a local police force is the least vital of the three but important nonetheless. Police agents are always in direct contact with the populace of their communities, interacting with them as individuals just as often as they do as agents. This can be made much more difficult if the locals dislike the law enforcement agents, making it harder upon them to work within the confines of a populated area. Tyrannical governments that appoint hard-edged soldiers as their police agents may find the people are not helpful or even a hindrance out in the streets. Police agents do not ever want to have to fight their entire community, leaving the criminals to work their illegal trades at their leisure. Every police agent with common sense knows he needs the help of the civilians he is set to protect and serve in order to carry out job effectively and safely.

The last and most important consideration is the state of criminal affairs in the police force’s jurisdiction. There is a great deal of sway either way, with some communities having almost no regular crime and others seemingly ruled by criminal gangs and underworld syndicates. Areas with lighter criminal concentrations tend to be safer and lower-waged assignments that are somewhat dull to an agent looking for excitement in his career. Conversely, highly criminalized communities can have a better compensation scale due to hazard pay at the possible risk of one’s life. An agent looking to get hired onto a police force must know what they are getting into.

There are two main types of police force agents; those who believe wholly in the legal system and those who take advantage of their role within it. The former are the upstanding agents that do their best to make a law-abiding society they can be happy to live within. The latter are opportunistic and selfish, looking to only make the most for themselves and their friends at the expense of the legal system. Both types of police agents have a place in the greater universe, making interesting personalities to interact with on both sides.

Being a police agent also tends to be a career of long hours and few vacations. The police force knows it might need every agent available on short notice depending on the nature of the emergency. This often eliminates actively employed police agents from doing much galactic travelling, keeping them near their base of operations just in case. That is not to say that a police agent cannot be part of a larger investigation or operation that calls them away from home but this is a more rare instance than having a regular shift on-planet.

Local police forces employ roughly a third of the agents in Charted Space, some of whom later become affiliated with the Imperial Ministry of Justice. It is a good and solid career with which to make a living, offering a variety of skills and ongoing training to agents that hire on. It might not be the most glamorous form of employment but it is a staple necessity of any civilization.

### Agency Employment Summary

Agents working for a local Police Force...

...have a relatively small jurisdiction.
...do not normally have to worry about large scale conflicts (war, terrorism, and so on).
...often carry great respect with the local law-abiding populace.
...have a base of operations with moderate resources to call upon.
...have excellent access to avenues for training skills, gaining Contacts and researching Enemies.
...are frequently targeted by violent criminals.
...make people nervous when they are around and in uniform (if any).
...might be called on by their government to act against their own community’s people.
...are controlled and commanded by a single officer or small collection of officers; all of whom could be corrupted.

## THE MEGACORPORATIONS

Megacorporations are massive concerns which employ many agents, they are economic, commercial and occasionally political powerhouses that run entire subsectors through trillion-Credit deals and businesses. These ‘megacorps’ are like galactic empires in their own right; bowing to the company insignia and kissing the hand of their CEO instead of a nation’s flag or a king’s crown. Within some of these tremendously powerful organizations there are more employees and assets than many worlds.

In the same fashion as a galactic government or nation, the megacorps have their own laws, territories and managerial hierarchies that exist within the boundaries of each corporation’s ‘ruling’ board of directors. Instead of keeping track of a sovereign currency they watch the rise and fall of their stock prices. Knowing the lengths that some rivals would go to, the megacorps hire private armies and mercenaries to protect their assets and holdings while seeking out ways to take advantage of their rivals. They fight most of their wars with ledgers, publicity and advertising; though bullets and blades do come into play between the megacorps often enough. Megacorps have one basic rule they must follow – make profit for the company. If this means resorting to corporate espionage, sabotage and even violence; so be it.

Megacorporations employ hundreds of millions, even _billions_ , of workers throughout their various factories, offices, foundries and the like. These employees perform the majority of the tasks required to keep the business running and the profits coming. It falls upon the shoulders of additional agents to perform the assorted other duties the megacorp needs accomplished. Depending on the megacorp, these duties could be menial and benign; or they could be more demanding and of a highly questionable moral intent.

Agents working for a megacorp must ask themselves one question - what are they willing to do for their employer?

Some of the largest megacorporations in Charted Space, like Ling- Standard Products or Instellarms, have tens thousands of agents on their payroll. They are expected to report between missions to local branches or officers for new instructions, receiving their pay and perhaps bonuses based on the duties they perform. Retained agents like this are similar to how some private armies keep mercenaries on hand for special missions; the difference is that a mercenary is normally working a _legal_ ticket and the agent is being sent in to do something a common employee could not – or would not.

All of the megacorps carry a ‘Limited liability Imperial Charter’ or LIC. This Imperially petitioned, sanctioned and notarised license allows the corporation to travel and trade freely throughout the Imperium. They are allowed to house their own military forces to protect their worksites and merchant ships, so long as the number of capable troops and standard equipment issued is kept on record at the Ministry of Defence just in case the Imperial armed forces have to make a move against them.

Inter-corporation espionage and spying is commonplace; sending agents undercover into the workplaces of other megacorps in order to find out what they are doing, expecting and planning. In a conflict across red tape, writs and measures of profit, information is a better weapon than a meson projector on a traditional battlefield.

A megacorp agent signs a contract, non-disclosure agreement and privatization record with his chosen employer. These are what keep the agent (hopefully) from simply selling everything he learns from his employer to the next competitor, making a quick score before disappearing into thin air. Those who dare double-cross the megacorps are targeted with extreme prejudice. The kinds of researchers, investigators and bounty hunters a wronged megacorp can afford are not going to give up easily. A foolish agent who breaks his contract with a megacorp is rarely one that is ‘missing’ for long.

Not all megacorp agents are assigned underhanded company tactics or missions based on illegal activities. They are sometimes requested to serve as private, classified couriers or even testers for a corporate prototype the company’s research teams recently came up with. Agents are also tapped for their particular skills at times, sent out to find vital resources, information or asset leads that other employees may not be able to arrange.

Despite the fact legal actions are important to any company, most megacorps rarely utilise their agents solely in such a way. There is simply more money to be made by waging hidden wars against rival companies and competing megacorps. The use of agents to steal secrets from a competitor can greatly aid a megacorporation’s operations, and can provide an inexpensive shortcut, helping to avoid months of expensive research and development. Such actions are illegal in most civilizations but what government has the influence or money to commit a megacorporation to a trial? Even the Imperium often turns a blind eye to the despicable things that take place between the megacorps unless it directly affects their major assets.

Some of the major megacorporations that frequently hire agents are:

### Delgado Trading, LIC

Founded in 997 by the powerful Delgado noble family, this megacorp grew up around its masterful miniaturising of military goods. It now has heavy assets invested in mining, antiquities and toys designed for noble children.

### Instellarms, LIC

Established in the early 600s by a wealthy retired mercenary named Axel Murdoch, this controversial megacorp is based solely on arms and military trading. Considered to be the most influential and widespread source for mercenary arms in the Imperium, Instellarms is where anyone with the Credits goes for the next best weapon, vehicle or bomb.

### Ling-Standard Products, LIC

A massive organization with Ling-Standard Products, LIC –   a wide portfolio of products and services, LSP has been built using sound management and investment rather than some of the more dubious practices of some of its rivals. Nevertheless LSP does call upon agents to keep an eye on the activities of the  competition and to protect its own secrets, to fail to do so could  critically weaken the megacorporation..

### Naasirka

A high-tech research, development and trading firm of robotics, cybernetics and computer goods, this megacorp is of Vilani origin and management. This company is also the source for the X-Boat program’s powerful communications and sensor equipment.

### Agency Employment Summary

Agents working for a Megacorporation...

...have excellent access to resources.
...are well-paid and insured by their corporation.
...are well-informed as to the state of interstellar affairs.
...have access to excellent training for skills they might need on mission assignments.
...are well rewarded for exemplary service.
...will be asked to perform unscrupulous acts.
...are expected to stay employed for an as-to-be-determined amount of time.
...cannot talk about some of their work for fear of having their contract ‘violently terminated’.
...will only be told what the corporation feels they need to know and nothing more.

## THE ESCHATON MOVEMENT

The galaxy is a very large place populated by people whose beliefs range from the commonplace ideology of a higher power to the nihilistic view of an eternal nothingness and everything in between. Many cultures have some kind of prophesised ‘end’ to Creation and many of these beliefs point toward a strange root similarity. These similarities, over the centuries, have meshed into one collective ideal. This ideal is called the Eschaton Movement – the lifelong search for the final destiny of the universe; the end of everything.

The various galactic religions and belief structures all tend to view their own set of eschatological thoughts as the perfect way to end Existence. This collective thought pushes the religious forward in their actions, always believing that they will find eternal peace, nirvana or their own version of paradise when everything comes to an end. Some of these people actively work _toward_ that final moment. These are agents that are part of the Eschaton Movement.

Unlike those that work specifically for a company or organization, Eschaton agents work to uphold the ideals and beliefs of their own faith in order to ensure that their views of the End will be waiting for them when it comes to a close. This is not an easy path to follow but for those that truly believe in its message it is the only real choice.

Agents that serve their faith’s eschatological teachings are sometimes seen as zealots or fanatics but many work toward the end of all things with even heads and logical choices. For them, their decision to urge the universe toward its end is simply the right thing to do and acting upon that decision is matter-of-fact. Some of the most successful Eschaton agents never mention to anyone what their final goal is – they simply work toward the End as if they were any other normal galactic agent.

Unless an organised faith or church actually employs them, Eschaton agents are treated very similarly as freelancers. They work for whoever can help them set up their mission assignments and earn enough money to continue working toward their goals. Sometimes they must accept assignments that are not in the greater plan to reach the awaited End but an agent knows that he must be able to afford living and working if he is to continue his work.

There are thousands of different religions in the galaxy, many of which have Eschaton agents working for them in some fashion – whether or not they are aware of it. Some are very aware of the Eschaton Movement and happily supply agents with resources, contacts and information. Like the churches that supplied the holy crusaders of ancient Terran religions in their bloody conquest, several organised faiths in the galaxy do the same through their agents.

A few example interstellar faith organizations that employ Eschaton agents to do their holy bidding are as follows:

### Holy Order of Light

The Holy Order of Light is a widespread interstellar religion that prays to the wavelengths of light energy that move about the universe between the stars. They believe that the galactic light is what binds everything together as one reality. The Lightbringers believe that the universe will end when the pious absorb all of the light and leave the non-believers in eternal darkness and suffering.

### The Sesshayr Religion

Originating with the Esyyat (minor alien) on account of a prophet Sansdantka, the Sesshayr believe in bridging anything that has a gap between parts, making the universe one total structure. They believe firmly in an intergalactic apocalypse but that it will occur when they finally bridge the gap between life and afterlife – bringing the Heavens to mortal space.

### The Universal Truth Engine

A strange and convoluted religion, the believers of the UTE claim all of Creation is an unbalanced equation. They believe the actions of the inherently good and the inherently evil throw off the balance of things and only when true equality is reached will the equation be solved and the universe will transcend into perfection. UTE members believe in utter neutrality; including battling for or against the sides of good or evil depending on which side is currently throwing off the ‘balance’.

## FREELANCE AGENTS

There are many agents out in the galaxy that do not have one specific employer. Working for whoever can bid the highest for their services, freelance agents live a life of choice and chance. Without a constant employer to fall back upon, these freelancers tend to take any work they are offered; a dangerous position to choose to be in.

Freelance agents have the freedom of not having to follow a set of rules consistently; their individual codes of conduct change from employer to employer. One assignment might have the freelancer stopping a smuggler from bringing drugs across planetary lines; the next might require him to sell those same types of drugs to a local population. It is a varied and spontaneous life they lead but it also requires a flexibility that some people just do not have.

Most freelancers advertise in planetary bulletins or ensure their contact information ends up travelling by word of mouth to potential clientele. A single mission assignment might keep the agent’s power packs charged and vehicles running for a few weeks at a time – but the money always runs out eventually.

Some freelancers might claim that they specialize in a particular field or assignment style but the good ones make no promises or exceptions. A wealthy freelance agent is the one that never says ‘no’, taking on multiple jobs at once. It is a freelancer’s role to take on the jobs that others either cannot perform or do not want.

Agency Employment Summary Agents working as freelancers...

...answer only to themselves and their own choices.
...do not have to work for anyone they do not wish to.
...work at their own paces and risk level.

# THE LAW IN TRAVELLER

Where there is civilization in the galaxy, there are laws designed to protect it and make it operate safely and smoothly. The laws of each civilization differ a little from one to the next but there tends to be a pattern of similarities that outline what most sentient species consider to be right, just or at least tolerable enough to be _legal_.

In _Traveller_ , a planet’s primary culture has the strictness of its laws described by a code – the planet’s Law Level. While to some this is just a digit found in the long string of letters and numerals for a planet’s UWP, it can actually say a great deal about the cultural impact that crime and punishment have upon that world’s peoples.

This chapter is devoted to helping define how the law is handled across the galaxy, especially by the Agents that a culture or community may have on hand to help turn the wheels of legal justice. Agents tend to work on the razor’s edge of the law, hopping back and forth over what is necessary and what is legal in an effort to get their assignments done without finding themselves in restraints before the local judge. We have chosen to use this book to better detail the workings of the _Traveller_ legal system – from both sides of the law.

## LAW LEVEL

In the game system of _Traveller_ , there is a standardised rule put into effect that explains what is considered legal or not on specific planets and to what extent. This rule is called ‘Law Level’ and it is a relatively simple idea on the surface.

As it was presented in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ (starting on page 173), a planet’s Law Level is randomly determined by rolling 2d6–7 and adding another piece of the UWP, the Government characteristic. This results in a listed number that shows how strict the laws concerning that class of item or circumstance truly are; the higher the number (ranging from 0 to 9) the more tightly policed or controlled it is.

A quick description of the ten Law Levels is as follows:

0 (Lawless): 0 (Lawless): This is the absence of legal authority. Either through anarchy, barbarism or other assorted social fractures, this culture does not keep a set of laws to govern the indicated items.

1 (Light Limited):1 (Light Limited): The culture really only keeps restrictions upon the most extreme examples of item or action. Legal action is likely strict about the punishments concerning these light laws, however.

2 (Moderate Limited): 2 (Moderate Limited): Increasing the limitations on particular situations or items, a culture at this Law Level has begun to monitor things for the general well-being of their populace.

3 (Standard Limited):3 (Standard Limited): Safety laws begin to appear at this level, with the governing power trying to limit what is readily available to protect the general populace.

4 (Heavy Limited):4 (Heavy Limited): The first appearance of ‘common sense’ laws, this Law Level has thick restrictions on anything that might cause undue or irreparable harm to the common people.

5 (Strict):5 (Strict): The governing power has begun to set arbitrary limitations on things and situations now; likely based on personal politics rather than the good of the whole.

6 (Controlled):6 (Controlled): This law level represents the shift of freedoms from the people to the governing agencies. Some specialized items and services are made illegal, forcing the people to come to the government for aid in these areas.

7 (Tight):7 (Tight): The legal codes of this culture are designed to take away many specific options from the people as a whole. Most civilian items and services are now regulated by the government, ensuring that they are not readily available without legal means or authority.

8 (Enforced): 8 (Enforced): Total governmental control over most things; this Law Level represents most military states or areas under strict martial law.

9 or higher (Stifling): 9 or higher (Stifling): The epitome of legal tyranny. Nothing is accessible by the people and everything is kept under governmental control. Punishments for breaking these laws are likely the harshest possible; better to keep the populace in line with the legal regime.

> [!info]+ PLAYER CHARACTERS AND LEGAL TROUBLES
> Unless a Referee has a group of the most upstanding and morally abiding players and characters in his game, there will come a time when legal trouble is assured. Someone will hijack a car, hold up a merchant or simply commit a heinous act like murder in a way that cannot be ignored.
>
> Traveller is not a game that coddles characters that make foolish errors but rather a game that can punish those with little foresight when considering their actions. Few Referees want to respond to their Player Characters’ illegal behaviours by tossing them into a brutal shootout with the local police or spend the rest of their years trying to escape an Imperial prison but what happens when the players give the Referee no other choice?

> [!info]+ Legal Troubles
> Here are a few ideas on how to make Player Character legal troubles into interesting plotlines and gaming sessions:
>
> - A wealthy noble could buy them out of their legal troubles in order to force them into service for him. Perhaps this noble is a villain that needs them to do other nefarious acts on his behalf or maybe he has other reasons for helping them.
> - An entire campaign could be based around the survival of the Player Characters in a hardcore Imperial prison, especially as they slowly work their way toward escape. Player Character arrests could be a good lead-in to our _Adventure 2: Prison Planet_.
> - The Player Characters could be asked to become informants within the criminal element of the world, receiving adjusted prison sentences in exchange for what they can learn from their ‘peers’.

Types of Contraband and Illegal Activities
Added as an expansion to the table found on page 176 in the _Traveller Core Rulebook,_ the following sections explain in greater detail what the Law Levels mean in respect to each of the potentially regulated items, services and other facets of a culture. These are general views that might see a slight bit of variance from culture to culture but are good guidelines to follow when dealing with a _Traveller_ setting’s legal system.

The Law Level 0 has no descriptions, as there are no legal restrictions at that level to discuss.

WEAPONS 1 – 1 – Weapons (and other combat-oriented technologies) that are designed for massive indiscriminate losses of life are outlawed at this level. Weapons of mass destruction, chemical or biological weapons and the sorts of things that terrorists use to wreak havoc upon civilian targets all fall into this category.

2 – 2 – Weapon systems that can inflict massive bodily harm upon a target and likely generate radiation on a localised level are illegal. Lasers, fusion weaponry and plasma weapons cause enough visceral damage to be considered contraband.

3 – 3 – Weaponry that requires special training and military access, often with a remarkable rate of fire that can injure multiple targets in one volley. Squad-level support weaponry like heavy machine guns and anti-tank rifles are too dangerous for casual citizens to use and the government tries to make sure they do not.

4 – 4 – Personal weaponry with high rates of automatic fire such as light assault guns and submachine guns are, at this level, thought of as too easily acquired and abused to be in the hands of the common citizen.

5 – 5 – This legal level restricts all weaponry that could be hidden on the average person, making it much harder for non-authoritarian figures to be lethally armed.

6 – 6 – Leaving only projectile weapons that are nonlethal or originally designed for hunting, the government at this Law Level restricts all manners of other firearms.

7 – 7 – The government at this Law Level no longer recognizes the hunting applications of shotguns or low-impact black powder firearms, placing all slug throwers in the illegal category.

8 – 8 – This Law Level removes all manufactured weaponry from the hands on non-authoritarians. Knives, primitive projectiles and even stunning equipment become restricted. Without special consideration, being armed with something designed to harm or incapacitate another is not accessible to citizens.

9 – 9 – Nothing that can be considered a weapon in any circumstance is allowed to be carried personally. From a stone tied to a stick or a shard of broken glass carried in a menacingly manner – all implements of inflicting harm are forbidden.

DRUGS 1 – 1 – Only the most dangerous and physically addictive drugs are disallowed at this Law Level, deemed utterly unsafe by the governing medical minds.

2 – 2 – Drugs that are physically demanding or that can easily create dependencies are added to the list of what the government does not want accessible by the people.

3 – 3 – The possible medical ramifications of using combat enhancing drugs can turn regular citizens into serious problems for local law enforcement, which is why they are deemed illegal.

4 – 4 – Anything with an addictive property to its chemical structure is added to the illegal category of drugs by the government, who want to keep its citizens from becoming dependant on them.

5 – 5 – Powerful drugs that stem the effects of aging, anagathics are now considered dangerous in the hands of common citizens. At this Law Level they are governmentally controlled and kept watch over to ensure ‘safe’ usage.

6 – 6 – The potential for recreational use of medicinal drugs like Fast and Slow are brought into suspicion of abuse at this Law Level. The government feels that only medical professionals should make use of such chemical stimulants and depressants.

7 – 7 – This Law Level puts the government at a position where they want to keep all narcotics – both harmful and beneficial, medically speaking – out of the hands of the general populace. Only through governmentally sanctioned medical avenues can they be attained and only in minimum doses to avoid stockpiling.

8 – 8 – No longer even accessible through medical avenues, pharmaceuticals are considered to be governmentally controlled only.

9 – 9 – All chemical additives of any kind are restricted by the government. No medicines, no vitamins, no anagathics; nothing of the sort are considered legal in any way.

INFORMATION 1 – 1 – The government only cares about the use of artificial intelligences and intellect programming; anything that can make an inorganic thing seem sentient. Robots with lifelike programming that still remain non-heuristic are generally viewed as ‘optionally legal’.

2 – 2 – Software that hides codes, information and smuggled data in a normal computer is rarely used for upstanding purposes to begin with but this Law Level forces all Agent programming of that sort to be considered illegal. Even if being used to send encrypted messages or store classified data, these programs are not to be used.

3 – 3 – Adding software packages designed to break through other encryption software to the illegal list at this Law Level is supposed to help protect the government from hackers and data thieves. The government begins to set up censorship protocols to keep abti-government activists from learning too much about classified goings on.

4 – 4 – At this Law Level the government no longer wants the citizen public to have access to software that could keep them from seeing what the people are doing electronically. Security programs are solely owned by officials and spies, with everyone else’s data being public access.

5 – 5 – Technology is severely restricted. The usage of any professional software programs is tightly limited.

6 – 6 – Electronic information from other worlds has begun to be held as privileged data by the government at this Law Level, only allowing older facts that are less likely to truly affect their populace through the filters.

7 – 7 – True censorship begins to surface at this Law Level, with historic and off-world data suffering the greatest amount of editing by the government. The general populace also finds that they cannot spread their own data on mass media levels without governmental approval, which is always heavily edited.

8 – 8 – The government tightens its fingers around what the civilian populace can learn, filtering all information that can be researched by the people. Off-world data not deemed as necessary for everyday life is silenced and anything published or broadcast by the people is heavily edited and manipulated by the state.

9 – 9 – Total governmental censorship curbs all information from off- planet or even beyond the local level. All mass media is sponsored and fabricated by the controlling governmental agency.

TECHNOLOGY 1 – 1 – Making only the most dangerous and invasive technologies illegal, like full-body replacement cybernetics and self-replicating nanotech, the government keeps these devices out of the hands of those who could not handle the power or responsibility.

2 – 2 – Watching out for technologies that are designed and manufactured by alien species, the government sets laws against the use of alien sciences. This could be due to a protectionist view of their people’s goods or perhaps on account of some kind of xenophobia.

3 – 3 – Fearing that the common citizen cannot handle the responsibility for themselves, the government claims that all ultra-science technology (TL 15) is restricted without their clearance.

4 – 4 – The addition of advanced technologies (TL 13) to the list of unauthorized access removes several important medical procedures and useful pieces of equipment but helps keep the government in control of well-studied sciences.

5 – 5 – As the legal grip of the government closes to this Law Level, technologies thought of as general Imperial status quos (TL 11) are now restricted. Some useful applications, like drone design and chemical engineering, are outlawed for common use.

6 – 6 – The government no longer allows most spacefaring sciences (TL 9) to be practiced by their populations, leaving all jump technologies in the hands of the military and governmentally-sponsored officials. This is the beginning of the legal nullification of a learned populace.

7 – 7 – Officially keeping all important jump-theory science knowledge and equipment (TL 7) behind locked doors along with anything else that shows a modern look at invention and design, this Law Level forces its people to remain in a combustion engine era under penalty of law.

8 – 8 – Forcing its people to remain in the industrial era of technological advancement, the equipment and instruments that might lead to higher science (TL 5) are now forbidden. The government has managed to keep its citizens simple and likely blinded to the wonders of the galaxy.

9 – 9 – A state-imposed medieval culture, this Law Level only allows extremely simple mechanical equipment and the knowledge to use them, ceasing the legal use of steam works or industrial advances
(TL 3).

TRAVELLERS 1 – 1 – The government keeps open borders and allows free travel across them, only requesting travellers check in with local authorities when they land. Radio contact, even delayed response radios, is considered enough warning to allow a landing anywhere the ship can find room to do so.

2 – 2 – This Law Level begins to give the government the right to check passenger and cargo manifests before allowing a starship to land, normally doing so electronically while the ship is in orbit. The ship is not restricted in any other way.

3 – 3 – The transit authority system requires vessels to land at specified locations on the planet to ensure safe flights and inter-ship traffic. Starports, landing zones and berthing sites are registered with the government as available landing locations.

4 – 4 – The government keeps security ships and personnel around specified governmental starport locations, only allowing ships to make landings at these sites when cleared to do so. The starport monitors traffic and regulates its flow.

5 – 5 – The passage to and from the planet is now recorded for security reasons. Citizens going off-world must inform the government as to why and how long; incoming traffic must declare and register why they are visiting the planet. The government may or may not use this information to keep tabs on their populace.

6 – 6 – Making starport access stark, unattractive and business-only, the government creates laws at this level to try and keep off-world visitation to a bare minimum. Starports are no longer commonly accessible by the local populace, only those with special permission or clearance.

7 – 7 – The government officially limits the mingling of outsiders and the local populace at this Law Level. Citizens can only leave the planet if doing so at the behest of the military or government and any off-worlders are only allowed access to the militarily-controlled and secured starport grounds. Only government agents are allowed to do business with the off-worlders at the starport or electronically only.

8 – 8 – This Law Level closes the planet to the vast majority of outside access. Only those carrying Imperial transit authority papers or other interstellar documentation are allowed to land but are still restricted to starport locations only. The government keeps a minimal staff at these starports, further limiting interactions even between these Imperial agents and the population.

9 – 9 – Complete planetary transit lockdown. The government no longer allows off-world traffic to or from their planet, enforcing their laws with force if they have to. Only Imperial agents with business on the ground will be allowed to land.

PSIONICS 1 – 1 – With only the basest regulations on psionic abilities, the government feels it necessary to keep track of convicted psi-offenders or psions with particularly dangerous talents. The government does not restrict these abilities but needs to know who has access to them.

2 – 2 – Governmental control over psionic abilities is increased to a standard registration of all psions, noting who has access to which abilities in case they are to be utilised, monitored or apprehended. A new set of ‘psi-laws’ is put into place that seriously punishes those who use dangerous or overly invasive psionic abilities.

3 – 3 – This Law Level further restricts the psionic members of a population by requiring any and all practicing psions with the telepathy talent to be employed by the government. Telepathic use outside of government-approved services will be punished by anti- psi chemicals and inhibiting drug treatments.

4 – 4 – Due to the potential illicit use of such psionic abilities as teleportation and clairvoyance, the government has added these talents to the list of psionic restrictions. Only those approved by and registered with the government can use these talents without persecution.

5 – 5 – No longer seeing any distinction between the psionic talents, the government claims complete control over psions. Only those employed by the governing agency can use their talents, all others are chemically or surgically inhibited.

6 – 6 – This Law Level treats psionic-enhancing drugs and chemicals like any other dangerous narcotic substance. Possessing such substances is considered reason enough to prosecute the individual for ‘intention to break psi-restrictions’.

7 – 7 – The government no longer caters to psionic abilities in any way, seeing any use of them as a dangerous crime against the populace. Being a natural psion is likely to mean being forced to take chemical inhibitors by the state or being deported from the common population for ‘mental safekeeping’.

8 – 8 – This Law Level sees the use or manufacture of anything involving psionic technologies as a precursor to psionic revolution, banning their very existence under strict penalties. The only exception is often a government ‘anti-psi’ agency, which is likely armed with technologies aimed at nullifying psions.

9 – 9 – The government has a strict ‘no tolerance’ policy for anything at all related to psionic ability, technology or genetics. Psions are sterilised, lobotomised or worse.

##### LEGAL INVESTIGATION

The heart of the legal system, the ability to find and understand the evidence to convict offenders, is a major component of any law enforcement policy. Seeking out criminals in the darkest corners of the galaxy by following the right clues is what keeps the system functioning. This collective process, the investigation, is what separates a just and fair legal system from the heavy-handed tyranny of summary judgments and sovereign condemnation.

A good investigation into any sort of legal matter is comprised of three main components: Research, Discovery and Verification.

This section is devoted to the process of a full and thorough investigation; the kind used to build cases against criminals. The results of this process will help in the pursuit of Justice, later in this chapter.

It should be obvious that the most important _Traveller_ skill in a basic investigation is Investigate but there are several other skills that can be used to some great effect while embarked on an ongoing case. The following subsections give a variety of other skill tasks characters can undertake while trying to accomplish a proper target- based investigation.

Research
The investigator must make sure he is looking into the right crimes, criminals or clues before going off to begin the case. If they begin their search with the wrong man, place or object, the entire investigation could be undermined from the very beginning.

It takes three successful consecutive Research-related skill tasks to ensure the investigator is looking into things properly. The investigating character may not progress into Discovery without them.

ASTROGATION
Tracing a ship’s potential travel route: 1-6 Hours, Education, Difficult (–2).

CAROUSE
Learning the basic information to begin the investigation from the target’s peers: 1-6 Days, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

COMPUTERS
Finding an electronic signature to start researching: 10-60 Hours, Education, Average (+0).

Create a false software signature to begin hidden research from: 1-6 Hours, Education, Difficult (–2).

PERSUADE
Convince local law enforcement officers to give you a good starting point: 1-6 Hours, Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

RECON
_Find the root of the investigation:_ 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Average (+0).

SENSORS
_Looking through sensor data to find the root of the investigation:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Average (+0).

_As an example, Marchus has been tasked by his commissioner to uncover the truth behind a missing person’s case that has just been upgraded to murder. He chooses to use his extensive background in technology, rolling at first a Sensors skill test that takes him all night... which he sadly fails. Seeing that only putting in personal face time will work with this criminal, he instead tries Carouse, Investigate and Recon; all of which he succeeds at. He now knows where he must begin to seek out the criminal in question, an Aslan called Iklaugh._

Discovery
The majority of the investigation is made up of ‘discovery’. This is the physical process of the investigator going out and looking for clues, evidence or other factors that will eventually lead to the unveiling and capture of the target in question. During the discovery process of an investigation, every facet of the target must be pored over. Missing one small detail or clue could cost the investigator many days’ worth of travel and legwork; even the case altogether if the clue is important enough. Discovery is the most important part of the investigation process and can take weeks, months or even years to come to fruition depending on the case in question.

Each successful Discovery-related skill task (including common uses of the Investigate skill) will add a single piece of Evidence to the investigator’s case. The final Evidence number is important for the application of Justice, covered later in this chapter.

ADMIN _Searching through bureaucratic files and memos for clues:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

ADVOCATE _Finding legal precedence in past files for specific avenues of investigation:_ 10-60 Hours, Education, Routine (+2).

CAROUSE _Talking information out of someone at a bar, restaurant, etc:_ 10-60 Minutes, Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

_Initiating a rumor mill to force truth to surface:_ 10-60 Hours, Intelligence, Average (+0).

COMMS _Poring over recovered communication logs from hard storage:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Average (+0).

Eavesdropping on comms signals: 1-6 Minutes, Education, Difficult
(–2).

COMPUTERS Finding electronic connections that lead to the target: 10-60 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

Write a search program that finds the target’s use of specific electronic devices: 1-6 Days, Education, Very Difficult (–4). This skill task will produce two pieces of Evidence.

DECEPTION Fast-talking a law enforcement agent to give you information: 1-6 Minutes, Intelligence, Average (+0).

Tricking someone into pointing you in the right direction: 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

GAMBLER Losing in a jovial manner to loosen tongues and learn rumors: 1- 6 Hours, Intelligence, Routine (+2). This will also cost 1d6x10 Credits.

MEDIC Performing a forensic autopsy or wound analysis of a violent crime: 10- 60 Minutes, Education, Difficult (–2).

PERSUADE Intimidate a witness to give over information: 1-6 Minutes, Intelligence or Social Standing, Average (+0).

Convince bystanders to explain what they might know or have seen: 10- 60 Minutes, Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

Convincing target’s peers or relatives to help case: 1-6 Hours, Intelligence or Social Standing, Very Difficult (–4). This skill task will produce two pieces of Evidence.

RECON Follow a successful visual cue at the crime scene: 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

SENSORS Discover a sensor mark or anomaly that leads to a clue: 10-60 Minutes, Education, Difficult (–2).

STEALTH Shadow an informant or ally of the target until they reveal previously unknown information: 1-6 Hours, Dexterity, Difficult (–2).

TTTHEHEHE L L LAWAWAW INININ T T TRAVELLERRAVELLERRAVELLER

STEWARD _Cater to others until they blurt out information:_ 10-60 Hours, Education or Social Standing, Average (+0).

STREETWISE _Go see a knowing informant:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence or Social Standing, Routine (+2).

_Canvas all the normal rumor mills and gossip chains:_ 1-6 Days, Intelligence or Social Standing, Average (+0).

_Bribe local criminals to give up information about a target:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Very Difficult (–4). This skill task will produce two pieces of Evidence and will cost 2d6x50 Credits.

SURVIVAL _Fully search a rural crime scene or other area for clues:_ 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Average (+0).

_As an example, Marchus continues his hunt for Iklaugh. Using Advocate, Carouse, Computers, Persuade, Recon, Sensors and Streetwise, he spends seven and a half days gathering clues and information. His final tally is ten pieces of Evidence against Iklaugh._

Verification Once the investigator has everything he needs he can then present his case to the authority that has jurisdiction over the target. This can be a local constabulary, an Imperial agent, the leader of a criminal syndicate or a noble family patriarch, depending on why the investigator has put together the case in the first place. The verification component is where the investigator double-checks all of his findings, making sure he has the right target and nothing obvious has gotten past him. Effectively, this component to an investigation is proper fact-checking, data cleaning and editing out what is not needed to make the case.

The investigating character must attempt three of the following Verification skill tasks to make sure his Evidence will affect the Justice the target will receive. Each failed Verification skill task will remove 1d6 pieces of Evidence from the character’s overall case.

ADMIN _Fact checking with a bureaucratic assistant:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

ADVOCATE _Check all evidence against local or Imperial legal codes:_ 1-6 Days, Education, Average (+0).

COMPUTERS _Make evidence database to cross check evidence:_ 10-60 Hours, Education, Difficult (–2).

DECEPTION Trick legal advisor or Imperial advocate into commenting on your evidence: 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

STEWARD Host a social event with an Imperial judge or justice to weigh evidence prior to the case: 10-60 Hours, Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

As an example, Marchus is informed that Iklaugh has been captured and is being held, awaiting trial by ducal court. He books his flight to the planet where the trial is to occur and takes a day to gather his evidence and ensure that it checks out properly before going. Knowing that time is of the essence, he chooses to use Admin, Computers and Persuade. Unfortunately he fails his Persuade check, costing him 2 pieces of Evidence (result of a d6) before going on to the ducal court.

The Evidence Gathered The investigation is concluded either when the investigating character is ready to do so or when the accused party is captured. Whether this is by the local authorities, Imperial agents or the investigating character, the case is now ready to move onto the judiciary stage. Sometimes this is as easy as handing the information over to the local police agency or an Imperial judge; but it might mean stating the case in front of the arbiter. Whatever the situation, the evidence collected against the target is integral in determining whether or not the system works.

Corporate conspiracies, government cover ups and the glossing over of certain things by the nobility can all be factors that can lead to bogus Evidence being left for the investigator. In these cases, the Referee may even want to grant a bonus to the character – and another Investigate check to notice how easily things are falling into place. Perhaps this awareness will begin a different plot all together...

### JUSTICE – THE TRIAL

When a suspected criminal is apprehended, after an investigation is made into their guilt or innocence, they are subjected to the local judiciary system. Hopefully the system will function as it is supposed to, sending the guilty criminals to be punished and shining light upon the innocence of the wrongly accused. It does not always work out this way, especially when larger beliefs and biases get involved but it is the basis by which the law is enforced.

In most _Traveller_ settings the law can be simplified by the Referee by skipping to the punishment part of this section; summarily deciding how the judiciary system deals with the offender in question. Alternatively, the Referee may want to create a storyline or plot based on the investigation and presentation of the legal material.

This section is designed to allow characters to be involved with the exacting of the legal system, arguing their own points if need be and gives Referees a system to simulate law enforcement and punishment.

Determining what the justice system finds in a specific case is a five step process.

- The Investigation
- The Argument
- The Defence
- The Deliberation
- The Punishment

Other than the Investigation, which was covered in an earlier section of this chapter, the steps to determining the findings are detailed in their own subsections below. They are listed in the order they take place, making it easy for Referees to move through the process page by page to achieve a final outcome.

The Argument Once the case has officially been opened and brought before some form of judicial power, the representative of the prosecuting party must try to convince the judge, justice, arbiter, or other court authority, of the accused party’s guilt. The prosecuting individual must bring forth the evidence and explain what it is, where it was gathered and why it is relevant to a conviction.

It is the prosecution’s hope that the evidence gathered is enough to sway the judiciary, get the conviction and then qualify for the relevant punishment. Most importantly however, is that the argument made toward convicting the accused party can go a long way in making up the judge’s mind.

The simplest part of the judicial process in game mechanics, the prosecution’s Argument can be summed up by a single skill task chosen from the ones below:

ADVOCATE Argue your evidence properly to a judicial agent: 10-60 Minutes, Education, Average (+0).

DECEPTION Use manipulation and subterfuge to sway a judicial agent: 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

PERSUADE Appeal to personal beliefs or thoughts to get evidence accepted by a judicial agent: 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence or Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

The result of this skill check is important to how well the rest of the case will proceed. Success means that the Argument was persuasive and all of the Evidence discovered during the Investigation is accepted and will carry on toward the next part of the Justice process.

Failure however, will force the prosecuting character to make a single 2d6 dice roll, adding their Social Standing DM (or alien equivalent) to the result, consulting the table below to see how much of the prosecution’s Evidence has been thrown out by the judiciary agent’s reactions to the failed Argument.

2d6 + 2d6 + Social Social Standing Standing ResultResult Failed Argument ResultsFailed Argument Results 0 or less Evidence is null and void; case is cancelled and the accused is released. 2-3 –2d6 pieces of Evidence. 3-4 –1d6+3 pieces of Evidence. 5-6 –1d6+2 pieces of Evidence. 7 –1d6+1 pieces of Evidence. 8-9 –3 pieces of Evidence. 10-11 –2 pieces of Evidence. 12 –1 piece of Evidence. 13+ Judiciary agent is unconvinced; re-roll Argument skill task using different skill.

Unless the case is cancelled due to the failed argument, the judicial agent will then ask the accused party to defend himself – moving on to the next part of the Justice process.

_Continuing the example from above, Marchus is called to argue the case against Iklaugh, bringing forth all of the evidence. Deciding to avoid using his limited Advocate skill in favour of his natural aptitude for Deception, Marchus is caught in a misleading statement and the Argument fails. He then rolls 2d6 and adds his Social Standing modifier of +1 for a total of 10; a good argument but still sees two pieces of Marchus’ Evidence thrown out of court._

THE DEFENCE After the prosecution’s representative has managed to get as much of his evidence allowed into the judiciary agent’s decision-making process through his Argument toward conviction, a representative for the defendant gets a chance to speak.

Trying to sway the judicial agent against some of the evidence, this representative (which could be the accused party himself) can take several standpoints against specific pieces of Evidence being used to make the case. Unlike the prosecution, which must try to convince the judicial agent of the evidence’s worth to the case, the defending representative merely has to explain why certain things are invalid, do not apply here or are otherwise useless in determining the accused party’s guilt.

In game terms, the Defence is made up of a number of individual motions brought up by the accused party’s representative. The number of these motions is dependant on the Social Standing of the representative, the Social Standing of the accused party and the Law Level of the society the accused party is said to have wronged.

Use the table below to determine how many motions the Defence will be made of.

Social Standing Social Standing of Defence of Defence RepresentativeRepresentative^1

Social Standing Social Standing of the Accused of the Accused PartyParty^1

Law Level Law Level being being Applied to Applied to CaseCase

Number Number of Motions of Motions GrantedGranted 1 1-2 9 –5 2-3 3-4 8 –2 4-5 5-6 7 0 6-7 7-10 6 1 8-9 11 5 2 10-11 12 4 3 12-13 13 3 4 14 14 2 5 15 15 1 6

(^1) Both of these columns still apply individually if the Representative and the Accused Party are the same person. _Iklaugh sits in the court, hands in thumb-cuffed manacles but his appointed advocate stands and bows deeply to the court, particularly to the Imperial justice sitting at the stand before him. The advocate has a Social Standing of 8 (2 Motions) and is being tried for crimes against Law Level 5 (2 Motions). Iklaugh’s Social Standing is a miserable 4 (_ – _2 Motions). Looking at the table, the appointed advocate will have a net total of 2 Motions to try and get some of Marchus’ evidence thrown out of the case._ Once the defending representative has determined how many Motions with which he has to defend the accused, he can decide how to use them. Motions can be spent for the following effects:

- Spending 1 Motion can have a case cancelled if the number of
  Evidence pieces is currently 0.
- Spending 1 Motion automatically reduces the number of
  Evidence pieces by 1.
- Spending 2 Motions will allow the defending representative to
  roll Advocate (9+); success reduces the number of Evidence
  pieces by 1d6.
- Spending 4 Motions automatically reduces the number of
  Evidence pieces by 1d6.
- Spending 10 Motions automatically reduces the number of
  Evidence pieces by 2d6+1.

After the defending representative has used up all his Motions and the final number of Evidence pieces has been determined, if the case is still active the judicial agent (arbiter, judge, jury, or other court official) will then have to take all remaining evidence and begin its Deliberation.

Iklaugh’s advocate talks it over with him on how best to use their 2 Motions and they decide to gamble. Spending both remaining

_Motions on the Advocate roll, the representative succeeds! His 1d6 roll unfortunately only comes up a 2 but that reduces Marchus’ Evidence pieces to only 4 before deliberation begins._

THE DELIBERATION After the Defence uses its Motions, the case is left in the hands of the judicial agent to be deliberated over to ultimately determine the guilt or innocence of the accused individual. This is the Deliberation; the last and most tense moments someone has before the system lays down its final judgement.

Depending on the culture or government of the area, this can be as fast as a summary judgment or a long and drawn out jury debate that takes place behind closed doors, sometimes for days at a time. It will be at the end of this Deliberation that the accused party will find out what is to happen to them.

The time that the judicial agent(s) are in Deliberation is decided at random. This is partly for completeness of the justice process but it also gives characters a chance to possibly make some kind of non-case related difference. A long Deliberation could give someone enough time to find the real offender, bribe the judicial agents involved or even break out the accused. It might not mean anything to some situations but having all the facts about the Justice process can be a useful bit of information for players and Referees alike.

To determine how long the Deliberation is, roll the dice listed on the table below based on the case’s Law Level modified by the number of Evidence pieces that the prosecution got past the Defence. The harsher the Law Level is, the faster the judiciary agent will come to its decision but the more Evidence presented can lengthen that time dramatically.

Marchus sits down after the Ducal Justice gathers up his papers and exits the room, leaving the two sides of the case to stare at their chronographs. As the Justice serves a Law Level 5 court and the prosecution had only 4 pieces of Evidence left, the table shows that the justice will be in deliberation for 1d6 hours. The Referee rolls the maximum, a 6 and explains to Marchus that he will be waiting for the verdict for quite a while.

THE VERDICT
The most important part of the Deliberation is the actual outcome of the case itself. So long as the prosecution manages to keep enough evidence viable for the case, they should have a good chance of getting the verdict they desire.

The Referee can simply choose what the verdict will be according to what he needs in his story or he can leave it partially up to fate by using the following system.

In a perfectly balanced situation, there will be even odds that the judicial agent will return from deliberation with a guilty verdict. This means that the Referee rolls 2d6 and compares the result to the table below.

2d6 Result2d6 Result VerdictVerdict 2-6 Not Guilty 7-8 Guilty – Minimal Punishment 9-10 Guilty – Common Punishment 11+ Guilty – Maximum Punishment

There are a number of modifiers that can affect the verdict die roll, helping sway the judicial agent’s final say.

(^1) A Summary deliberation means that the judiciary agent hands out the verdict instantly, without leaving the room

- +/–1 per 1,000 Credits spent in bribing the judicial agent(s)
- +1 for every 2 pieces of prosecuting Evidence
- +1 for every Law Level rating above Law Level 6.

Once the judicial agent has reached a verdict and the time for deliberation has passed, the case is either judged as Not Guilty and no further proceedings are necessary or Guilty and the case must then be passed down into the next stage of Justice – the Punishment.

_In the continued example, the court waits with baited breath as the Imperial justice returns to the room. The Referee gives a long sigh and explains that he rolled initially 6, a Not Guilty result but Marchus’ 4 pieces of Evidence pushed the justice over the limit. Although Iklaugh will only be getting the minimal amount of punishment, he is still found Guilty._

THE PUNISHMENT A Guilty verdict in a case brings about the next and final stage of _Traveller_ Justice – the Punishment of the offender. This is possibly the fastest and simplest part of a case, as it requires really only one die roll modified by the case circumstances.

The _Traveller_ Justice system will allow the guilty party to either pay a hefty fine directly to the judiciary agent immediately for some crimes. Listed on the tables below as an ‘Equivalent Fine’, these financial penalties essentially eliminate the need for the listed Punishment. Some crimes do not have an Equivalent Fine, as noted below; these punishments cannot be avoided.

When the guilty party does not have access to the listed amount, they may seek the aid of a bail bondsman. A bondsman forces the guilty party to pay 10% of the Equivalent Fine, of which he puts up the remaining 90%. After 30 days, if the guilty party has not come forward and paid off the loaned balance, the bondsman turns them into the judicial agent as
‘delinquent’ and bounty hunters are sent to fetch them. Once captured, the listed Punishment immediately goes into effect.

To determine what sort of punishment a guilty offender receives, the Referee rolls 2d6 on the relevant table below (determined during Deliberation) and applies the following modifiers (if any apply).

- –2 if the crime was classed as ‘petty’ (non-violent, thefts worth
  less than 10,001 Credits).
- –1 if the crime was non-violent but worth more than 10,000
  Credits.
- +1 if the crime was violent with no loss of sentient life.
- +1 if the Deliberation was a Summary judgment.
- +2 if the crime was violent and ended in the death(s) of a
  sentient being.
- +4 if the crime was treasonous against the government,
  Imperium, and so on.

The following are definitions or descriptions of the punishments listed above, helping readers understand what actually happens to the guilty when sentenced.

Local Community Service – Local Community Service – The convict does not leave the station/ ship/planet for as long as it takes to perform basic labour and menial tasks toward fulfilling his sentence.

Local Incarceration – Local Incarceration – The convict is placed in a jail, stockade or brig for the set amount of time. He receives basic amenities, visiting rights and an average amount of comfort; but cannot leave. Convict earns two days worth of imprisonment for every day without incident.

Imprisonment – Imprisonment – The convict is sent off the world, station or ship he was tried upon and shipped to a prison planet, Imperial stockade or other long-term incarceration facility. Visiting rights are extremely limited and quality of living is below average to poor. Convict earns two days worth of imprisonment for every ten-hour enforced work day he puts in without incident.

Genetic Tagging – Genetic Tagging – The convict has a full biological workup done and put on file with the correctional facility. This information automatically counts as 10 pieces of Evidence toward any future Justice processes made against the convict.

Life Sentence/Double Life Sentence – Life Sentence/Double Life Sentence – The convict is sentenced to a specific number of year’s worth of imprisonment in a maximum- security facility. Convict earns two days worth of imprisonment for every ten-hour enforced work day he puts in without incident.

Chemical Sterilization – Chemical Sterilization – The convict is drugged heavily to nullify any potential problems. Psions are given psionic dulling injections, physically strong convicts are given tranquillisers and the overly cunning are given heavy anti-psychotics to numb their minds. Receiving the injections every seven days, they are potent up to 1d6+6 days after each dose.

Psionic Solitary Confinement – Psionic Solitary Confinement – Also called mind-wiping, the convict is telepathically scoured of free thought. They become a living automaton, barely aware of their surroundings and answering to simple commands. In cultures where psionics are banned even for government use, treat this as a Death Sentence instead.

As the example concludes, Iklaugh stands and awaits his punishment with a snarl on his face – giving an evil eye toward Marchus and the prosecuting team. The Imperial justice sees this unspoken threat and gives his sentencing with extreme prejudice. The Referee rolls 2d6 on the Minimal Punishments table and laughs as he rolls a ‘10’. This, adjusted by the +2 for Iklaugh’s murder charge, makes the result a ‘12’, a roll on the next table! The Referee rolls a 7 (+2 again for the murder charge resulting in a 9) and the resulting 2d6x10 years gives Marchus satisfaction for a long, long time. The justice grins at the shocked Aslan, explaining that he will be spending 80 years in an Imperial prison out on the galactic frontier.

### INFORMANTS

In the greater scope of law enforcement throughout _Traveller_ , there is nothing more useful than some person willing to hand over details to an investigation, providing invaluable aid towards capturing a criminal. These loose-lipped individuals are collectively called ‘Informants’.

Informants are a specialized version of Contact available only to characters with the proper skill prerequisites. They are fonts of knowledge about a specific set of skills and backgrounds, offering bonuses to the character calling upon them. Unlike Contacts however, Informants do not always help the character out of altruism. Most often they require some form of monetary compensation.

A character can choose to utilise any of his active Informants by first paying the ‘costs’ listed next to the skill benefit desired. Once paid, the character gains the listed benefit to that skill for up to 3 tests made in the current and following day. This is to signify that the information given by the Informant is not always the most recent or precise and quickly becomes outdated.

Whenever a character receives a new Contact, whether it is in character creation or during play, they may decide to try and make them an Informant instead of a common Contact. This requires the character to pass a required ‘Relationship Roll’; a particular skill test at a set difficulty that will either chase the potential Informant away _or_ seal the relationship with them, adding them to the character’s stable of Contacts, Allies and now Informants.

Each Informant entry below is made up of the following information:

Informant Title – Informant Title – The narrative type of the Informant.

Relationship Roll – Relationship Roll – The skill test required to acquire the Informant.

Description – Description – A brief narrative description of the Informant.

Skill Benefits/Costs – Skill Benefits/Costs – The types of skills that the Informant can modify and how much it costs to do so.

The Informant Types The following are all of the main types of Informant that a character can gain access to. This list is extensive but by no means complete. We encourage Referees to come up with Informants of their own, using our list here as a source or template for inspiration.

##### CASE FILES

The following are a handful of prearranged, pre-made legal case files for Referees to add to their existing games or for players to attempt to become involved with. Each case file includes all of the basic information needed to get the Player Characters started on their own investigation and/or trial gaming sessions.

Each Case File is made up of the following information:

Case Designation – Case Designation – The name of the case being investigated.

Law Level – Law Level – The Law Level of the case; all references to Law Level during the Investigation and trial are set at this level.

The Accused – The Accused – The individual being investigated and sought for the trying of this case file.

Wanted For – Wanted For – The crime or crimes the accused is being investigated for.

Description – Description – A brief narrative description of the case in general

ETC – ETC – ‘Estimated Time to Capture’; the amount of time the character(s) have to fully complete the Legal Investigation portion of the case.

# ESPIONAGE

It is an agent’s role to perform duties for his employer that might otherwise seem underhanded, shady or illegal. Amongst the most common of these less moral of practices is espionage. For some employers, agents are just useful tools with a high (or not so high) price tag attached to them – making it very easy to send them into dangerous or morally questionable situations.

Espionage is defined as being the systematic use of spies and other operatives to acquire government, commercial or military secrets. In _Traveller_ , secrets can be just as deadly or powerful as a laser rifle, killing careers and making heroes just as easily.

This chapter is dedicated to the use of agents in the role of spies, data thieves or other providers of illicit services; specifically in a position that works against a government. With the information revealed here, any agent on a government’s payroll gains new tactics, schemes and ways to get away with doing the questionable.

## SPY VERSUS SPY

In the ultra-competitive arena of agent-based espionage, it is inevitable that these manipulators and obfuscators will clash against one another at some point. This is the nature of an agent’s career choice and sometimes they have no idea what or who they are really up against.

This section details how agents can work against one another in Traveller. Unlike the army infantryman or a naval fighter jock who merely have to out-shoot or out-fly their foes, an agent often has to
‘out-spy’ his enemies. An agent’s skill base is his primary weapon; here we explain how opposing agents duel with the potent weapons at their disposal.

One of the most efficient and ‘hands free’ methods of protecting one’s own assets from intrusion by enemies is to hire a professional intruder to set up your defences. There is a large market for professional defence specialists, ‘white hat’ hackers, security system testers and other professions based solely on getting past someone’s defences to show where they need bolstering.

These infiltration professionals are used to set up amazing lines of anti-agent defences. This sets the bar a little higher for opposing agents to have to bypass their peers’ work, constantly testing and adapting to the evolving defensive arenas they must work within.

This style of how agents work against one another puts the character at odds with the environment itself. Alternatively, this could place a Player Character agent in the role of setting up their employer’s defences against other operatives. Whether the character is being hired to arrange for, or safeguard against, infiltration could make for an interesting mission for any agent in Traveller.

No matter which side of the contest the character is on, most skill checks used in these situations are going to be Opposed skill checks. The character arranging for the defence of the area or item in question makes note of what skills he is using to protect the target, explaining each one to the Referee as he does so. When finished, the defensive environment is considered set.

When another character tries to get past the defensive environment, the Referee may not want to have an entire gaming session based around the Agent working his way through these defensive obstacles one at a time. Player Character groups consisting of many different character types may not want to spend too much time watching the Agent get all of the Referee’s attention. To make a scene like this easier to deal with, he can use a faster system to narrate the process. While it is possible for each individual measure of the defensive environment to be overcome with a single skill check, this combined testing system allows a Referee to run a series of singular events in a shorter amount of time. This creates a more openly narrative approach to the intrusion but still retains the varied elements involved.

The Referee creates a list of skills that will oppose those used by the defending character. When the list is complete the Referee has the characters battle one another in an extended contest of Opposed skill checks; one for each skill used to set the defences. The party

EEESPIONAGESPIONAGESPIONAGE

scoring the most total Effect over the other is the victor, and ends with the intruder getting past the defensive environment or simply getting caught.

_As an example, Sergia, the corporate spy, is preparing to break into the secure offices of his target. The target is a high-powered megacorp with a skilled team of anti-intrusion experts working security. Although the Referee could decide to have Sergia roll a single Stealth skill check with an appropriate modifier to bypass security, he instead decides to make it an extended Opposed skill check to avoid his player getting caught out by a single bad die roll. He also makes the narrative scene more exciting by setting up a handful of specific obstacles for the spy to test herself against: a camera yard, a computerised gate and pressure plates on the floor. Sergia rolls Stealth, Computers and Athletics (co-ordination) to bypass these obstacles respectively, adding up his total Effect. The Referee rolls Investigation, Computers and Sensors for the security team, adding up their Effect. Depending on the comparison between the two total Effect values, Sergia may or may not have a situation on her hands inside the megacorp facility..._

The best method of thwarting an agent is to ensure you have a more skilled agent on your payroll. This time-tested approach to counter- agent measures is demonstrated in the number of skills that can be used to oppose each skill used. If a talented and well-trained operative is in charge of making sure other agents or spies do not get past them or their obstacles, the employer is safe – until his enemies hire someone even more skilled or well-trained!

The Opposed Skills table shows many of the skills commonly used by agents, operatives and spies in their line of work. It shows what sorts of skills can be used in an Opposed check to foil another character’s successes in that skill and gives an example or two to describe how they would work. This table is by no means complete but it is a good reference point for Referees and players.

## DATA ANALYSIS – A GUIDE TO EXCELLENCE IN ESPIONAGE

The goal of espionage is to acquire information. This can come in the form visual surveillance, hardcopy memos, data files or even scientific research collation. Anything that can be learned from the target by the operative can be the goal of the spying effort; the more valuable to the spy’s employer, the more successful the agent has been. It all depends on exactly what the spy manages to acquire, what it means to his employer and how it fits into the greater scope of their schemes.

Any agent can be told to break into someplace and steal ‘the green box from the CEO’s desk’ or ‘plant a listening device in the men’s room’. These elite espionage agents are good at data analysis while on a mission, giving them better options to steal the best secrets in the same amount of time it would take a lesser spy.

The key to data analysis is a wide basis of knowledge and a trained eye that can spot what others might not. Knowing the best communications line to tap, seeing the most profitable files to take from a safe, grabbing up additional prototype schematics while in a competitor’s R&D department; these are the sorts of actions good data analysis skills bring to the mission. Performing the extra work on a mission can be the difference between getting the job done and getting a bonus from your employer for exemplary service.

Data analysis is a two-step process. It requires foreknowledge of the types of information the agent is looking at and the ability to extrapolate its worth to his employer. Just because a concealed file is priceless to its current owner does not mean the agent’s employer will be able to make any profit from it. A good spy knows what to take and what not to take; it is a fine line between acquiring good intelligence and accidentally leaving a trail behind.

In game mechanics, any agent placed on an Espionage mission targeting a specific kind of ‘data’ will need to have the right skills to analyse the information he is gathering if he wishes to better profit from the mission. The targeted type of data for each mission will match to a specific skill used to analyse it, detailed below.

This table shows what skills are used to analyse the importance of data and the skills used to determine its secondary worth to the agent’s employer.

So long as the character passes this first skill check to calculate what data would be of the most importance, they may take the second analysis test anytime after the data has been gathered but before turning in their report.

_Secondary Espionage Data Analysis_ ; 1-6 hours; Intelligence or Education; Difficult (–2 DM)

Depending on the outcome, the Effect of the secondary data analysis test is then used as a modifier to the payout of the Espionage mission he was working on. This modifier is not optional – if the character tried to analyse what his employer wants instead of just following orders, he had better hope he claimed the right information!

The modifiers to Mission Payout are as follows:

- Marginal Success Marginal Success (+1 DM; but only if the Mission Payout roll is
  a 3 or less)
- Average Success Average Success (+1 DM)
- Exceptional Success Exceptional Success (+2 DM)
- Exceptional Failure Exceptional Failure (–2 DM; minimum of 1)
- Average Failure Average Failure (–1 DM; minimum of 1)
- Marginal Failure Marginal Failure (–1 DM; but only if the Mission Payout is a 4
  or higher)

It should be noted that the rules for Data Analysis can also apply to agents undertaking an Anti-Corporate Mission that is targeting any form of Research, Product or Prototype.

## HACKING – PIRATES ON A SEA OF DATA

A society’s inevitable move into the computing age manifests in many important ways. Information transfers from pages in a book to electrons stored on a hard drive, vaults full of hard currency turn into a flash of digits in formless online bank accounts and virtual lives spring up in an invisible world connected by fibre optics and transmission airwaves. As this evolution of computer technology grows, it adapts to encompass more and more of society’s needs.

Eventually the use and reliance of computer technology permeates the commercial and governmental arenas of a culture. The vast stores of data that exist within the invisible ‘network’ is more than any physical library could ever hope to hold and more wealth exists as ones and zeroes in the ether than has ever been minted in the ages previously. These advances in computer technology make the world a better place in most regards but it also creates new problems. Just as petty crimes evolve to match how the world works, so too does the world of computers.

Once a culture in _Traveller_ reaches a high enough technology to begin using computers for many of their day to day activities (around TL 8) a new type of agent that arises. As companies change their business practices to use computers for data storage, communication and

other routine utilities, the need for skilled computer technicians rises at the same rate. Technicians that learn to use their skills for data theft, informational sabotage and other nefarious electronic activities go by a new and often hated moniker: hacker.

Hackers are specialized computer experts that make a living by cruising the superhighway of cyberspace wherever and whenever they want, breaking through protective firewalls with ease to navigate the virtual world. Like agents that specialize in physical infiltrations, hackers have their own repertoire of individual practices that help them succeed. Some are subtle and stealthy, like a computerised cat burglar. Others are far more direct, ploughing through opposing encryptions like a battering ram.

There are four classifications of hackers that exist in computerised societies: black hats, white hats, hacktivists and apocalysts. Each of these four types has individual reasons for devoting so much of their lives to breaking codes, inventing software loops and eavesdropping on other networks’ data streams. Their various methodologies set them distinctly apart from one another.

Black hatsBlack hats or ‘crackers’, use their impressive computer skills to break into other networks for their own desires. Data theft, bank fraud, identity alteration/theft or just malicious vandalism of other people’s software are their common arenas of expertise. Most black hats begin their careers by playing pranks and seeing what they can accomplish as a hobby. Once they begin to make advances that can earn them money, fame or power they turn it into a profitable job. They begin stealing money from bank accounts, selling fake identities and stealing proprietary information from behind their keyboards. Black hat hackers are rarely ever hired for anything other than their ability to break encryption and firewalls, stealing whatever it is their employer requires.

White hatsWhite hats, also known as ‘white knights’, are the opposite of black hats. Instead of using their aptitude for electronic intrusion and software breaking for illicit gains or malice, they help others protect their networks from criminal hacking. Knowing all the best ways to get past computer security allows a white hat to test a network’s defences, making notes where holes and weaknesses need to be ‘patched up’. A white hat agent has a plethora of private contracts and security positions waiting for them if they are open to employment. Despised by all other types of computerised criminals for being turncoats against the ‘hacker way’, these helpful hackers are constantly persecuted by their peers.

HacktivistsHacktivists are cyberspace propaganda experts that are fighting a war against a specific agency, group or idea. Committing criminal computer intrusions in order to broadcast political messages, silence propaganda sites, corrupt data streams that are contrary to their agendas; hacktivists are similar to black hats in that regard. They stick to a code of electronic ethics that targets the government, media or corporate authority that they are trying desperately to change. They are not above stealing or erasing funds from their

‘enemies’ but they are not common thieves – everything they do is aimed at their foes. Unlike both types of ‘hats’, hacktivists are not normally hired by outside agencies. Unless their employer is also angled against their targets, they act alone.

ApocalystsApocalysts are the terrorists of the hacker world. These much-hated computer specialists spend all of their time designing and devising new and terrible ways to corrupt, erase or otherwise destroy the computers of the world around them. They are technological cannibals, using computer viruses and one-way decryption programs to get into restricted networks and then taking the parts of the software and code they find there. Like a cyberspace strip miner, the apocalyst destroys all unused data or code left behind in the networks they go to. They live for ruining the computerised assets of others, caring only for what they can use to inflict more damage upon their next hapless victims. Few employers would ever support the use of an apocalyst agent; they are too erratic and careless in their work. Agencies that do set these cyber-berserkers on their enemies do so at their own risk; an apocalyst rarely cares if the consequences of his actions do harm to his employer.

Hackers are the villains and heroes of the computer world and a skilled agent that knows how to apply these skills in his missions properly can become very wealthy and powerful.

Characters as Hackers Any character that is adept at the Computers skill can technically attempt to ‘hack’ using the basic skill check system described in the core rules (see page 54 of _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ) but true Hackers have access to special skill tasks and bonuses that other mere dabblers do not.

To be considered a Hacker, a character must have all the following prerequisites:

- Computers 3
- Engineer (electronics) 2
- Physical Sciences (electronics) 1
- A network-capable device with Computer/1 rating or higher

Any character that takes on the specialized career of Hacker gains access to a new world of software and influences that exist within their subculture. This is represented by a number of special skill tasks that only true Hackers can perform without penalty. Any non- Hacker characters that attempt these skill tasks have an automatic
–4 DM penalty.

The special Hacker actions are as follows:

_Bypass secure software measures on an equal Technology Level network:_ 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Routine (+2).

Implement a program that will conceal all traceable information that the hacking took place: 1-6 Minutes, Education or Intelligence, Average (+0).

Electronically manipulate any automated system on a network: 1-6 Minutes, Dexterity, Difficult (–2).

Emulate any use of the Comms, Remote Operations or Sensors skill using a networked computer: 10-60 Minutes, Education or Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

Once a committed Hacker character increases his Computers skill to level 4, they may then choose to take on one of the four specialist roles described above. Each of these specialist roles has two unique Computers skill tasks, a special boon and a drawback.

BLACK HAT Single out important data stream and copy specified files (gain +1 DM on Espionage Mission Payout roll): 10-60 Minutes, Intelligence, Average (+0).

Copy electronic identity of another known individual: 1-6 Hours, Education or Intelligence, Routine (+2).

## IMPERIAL AGENTS

The Third Imperium of Man did not grow to an epic interstellar governmental powerhouse by laying all of its cards on the table and not keeping its own secrets. Important and influential information is found, gathered and kept safe by the Imperium’s most well travelled, respected and universally feared agents.

Imperial agents are permanent employees of the Imperium, sworn loyal to the Emperor himself and given the legal documentation to perform their business anywhere within his vast territory. Empowered in such a way, these agents are considered a direct extension of the Ministries of the Imperium even if their methods go beyond those which would be considered legal under Imperial law.

The territory that must be covered is vast and varied, forcing the Imperium to employ agents from every walk of life to do the job properly. Law enforcement specialists, spies and assassins alike are

hired by the Imperium to fulfil the duties required of them. It is an attractive opportunity, working for the largest governmental power in Charted Space. Any agent worth his wage will jump at the chance to do so.

Law EnforcementLaw Enforcement agents are the long arm of Imperial law, falling under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice as its field agents. Like the road marshals of the frontier, Imperial law enforcement agents work for justices and legal authorities to capture criminals who have broken Imperial Law. These agents answer to the nearest Imperial noble with judicial rights but they rarely care at all for the laws of a local culture.

Imperial investigator agents, called InquisitorsInquisitors, uncover anything hidden from the eyes of the Emperor and the Ministries. Inquisitors are in charge of making sure Imperial agents remain loyal, testing them constantly to ensure they are not traitors in disguise. They are employed equally by the Ministry of Information and Communication as well as the Ministry of Justice, serving them as their prying eyes in the galaxy.

Corporate AgentsCorporate Agents within the Imperium’s employ are employees of the Ministry of Commerce. These licensed agents keep track of the megacorporations, ensuring that these financial and economic superpowers do not work against the greater good of the Imperium. These agents are universally feared by the business community; it is upon their recommendations that companies lose their LIC (Limited liability Imperial Charter) if their reports reveal any anti-Imperial findings. Imperial corporate agents are not common but they are a steadfast reminder to the megacorporations of the Emperor’s ability to neutralise them if they must.

Thought of as the most powerful of agents, Imperial SpiesImperial Spies are the secret workforce of the Ministry of State. Suitably called ‘Shadows’ by those who know of their existence, Imperial Spy agents serve one primary role – Know Thy Neighbour’s Secrets. Used to keep tabs upon Imperial citizens as often as they are deployed in foreign space, Shadows are allowed to do whatever they must to gather the information they need. If they have to lie, cheat, steal or even kill matters not at all to the Ministry, so long as the job is done.

Imperial AnalystsImperial Analysts are given an elevated amount of personal power and social influence to keep them active and recognized within the circles of nobility and planetary governments. Imperial political analysts are the chief agents sent to work within a newly acquired
(or re-acquired) Imperial colony, bringing the new regime to power hopefully without dissent.

Used in small numbers by the Ministry of Justice, Bounty HuntersBounty Hunters are rarely granted full Imperial licenses. They serve as freelancers or are individually employed on a case-by-case basis, as the ducal justices preferring to use their own law enforcement agents to catch criminals before giving a full license over for a few bail jumpers. There have been examples of Imperial Hunters in territories with

high criminal activities; those from the Ship Tracer or Thieftaker paths helping speed up the justice system.

The Third Imperium of Man makes extensive use of its agents, sending them on missions they could or would never trust to a freelancer. Working directly for an Imperial Ministry is nothing short of a lifelong commitment.

The Power of Imperial Credentials Upon employment, the agents of the Imperium are granted one or all of four official licences; the Imperial Sanctioning, the Raghemandi Key, the Styryxian Allowance or the Shadow Badge of Humaniti. Each of these licences grants a different set of rights and privileges to an agent of the Imperium. Licensed Imperial agents benefit from the added power that their employing Ministry can give them.

Granted only by the power of a Subsector Duke or higher, the four Imperial agency licences, their descriptions, requirements and benefits, are found below:

THE IMPERIAL SANCTIONING Representing the root of Imperial legal powers, the Imperial Sanctioning is the badge of office used by law enforcement agents. It allows the agent to exact justice in the Emperor’s name, doing

whatever is necessary to see Imperial law upheld. It is the Imperium- wide equivalent of a sheriff’s badge.

Requirements: Requirements: Trust 2+, Advocate 2, Investigate 2, at least one term in a Law Enforcement Agent career path.

Benefits: Benefits: +1 Social Standing. Agent can pass an Advocate skill check
(8+) to justify any action taken while upholding Imperial Law or undertaking an Imperially-sanctioned mission.

THE RAGHEMANDI KEY This licence is named after Palant Raghemand, a famous commercial agent who uncovered an anti-Imperial plot within a powerful megacorporation. The Raghemandi Key grants permission for agents to have complete access to commercial territories, financial records and security logs of any company or LIC corporation with holdings in the Imperium.

Requirements: Requirements: Trust 3+, Admin 2, Trade 2, at least one term in a Corporate Agent career path.

Benefits: Benefits: Agent can pass an Admin skill check (8+) to bypass security of any kind (electronic, physical, etc) on the territory of a commercial entity in Imperial space.

THE STYRYXIAN ALLOWANCE The licence given to agents assigned to blossoming governments, the Styryxian Allowance is named for the Imperial Emperor who reigned from 945-989. The Allowance is a document that grants agents the power to aid planetary authorities using Imperial resources. It also empowers the recipient with control over any decisions that could affect the Imperium, allowing the agent to create or interpret local laws differently than they were intended.

Requirements: Requirements: Trust 3+, Admin 2, Diplomat 2, at least one term in an Analyst Agent career path.

Benefits: Benefits: +2 Social Standing. Agent can pass a Diplomat skill check
(8+) to act as a legal superior to any local governmental agency.

THE SHADOW BADGE OF HUMANITI The Shadow Badge of Humaniti allows its bearer to break any and all laws the agent feels he has to in the course of his duties. Whatever it takes to succeed in his mission, this licence will protect the agent from local and Imperial prosecution. The Shadow Badge is why Imperial spies are feared throughout Charted Space. Imperial spies are empowered to do whatever they must; their missions are of a higher priority than morality and legality.

Requirements: Requirements: Trust 4+, Investigate 2, Stealth 2, at least three terms in any Agent career path.

Benefits: Benefits: Agent must pass a Social Standing check (6+) to justify any action taken while working on an Imperially sanctioned mission.

EEESPIONAGESPIONAGESPIONAGE

Special Note: Special Note: Each Shadow Badge comes equipped with a potent dose of tri-chloride nerve inhibitor – a deadly poison. The ring can either be triggered manually as a Significant Action or by radio remote within 50km. The poison requires three successful Endurance (10+) checks to survive the dose. This is normally only used when the spy is captured.

Becoming an Imperial Agent Not all agents have what it takes to serve the Imperium. Petitioning the Imperial Ministry, being accepted, getting tested and finally being licensed is a time-consuming and difficult process that many agents may not be ready for. It can take months or even years for an agent to get their opportunity.

There are four steps to becoming an Imperial licensed agent. They are listed below in order; with success at the fifth and final step granting any Imperial Licences (see above) the agent can qualify for.

**Step One – Petition the Local Ministry Offi ce** The agent must find a recruiting Imperial Ministry office and physically appear there to fill out a notarised petition for a licence. This requires an Ally, Contact or Network (Politics) or the character to succeed in an Admin skill check with an Effect of 4 or higher. Once the petition is made, the agent goes onto the waiting list for interview.

**Step Two – Interview with a Ministry Clerk** 2d6x5 weeks after making the petition, the Imperial Ministry office will send a courier for the agent to sit down to a personal interview. These interviews are always face to face with a ranking Ministry official and require a cumulative total of 8 Effect from performing the following four skill checks (all 8+): Admin or Advocate, Deception or Persuade, Investigate or Computers, Carouse or Streetwise. If the agent cannot acquire 8 Effect from these skill checks he is rejected and must wait an additional 2d6x5 weeks for another interview. If successful, the agent is admitted to the testing grounds to see which Imperial Ministry he is best suited to work for.

**Step Three – The Testing Grounds** 1d6x5 days after a successful interview, the agent is shipped off to an Imperial testing ground to be subjected to dozens of gruelling examinations of his body, mind and aptitudes. The agent may choose six Skills and two Characteristics. He must then take normal checks (all 8+) on all of these, hoping to pass no less than five of the tests. Failure results in the agent being rejected and sent back for a new interview (see Step Two). Success grants the agent a limited agency agreement with the Imperium.

**Step Four – Qualify for an Imperial Licence** Once given a limited agency agreement, the agent officially has 2d6 standard months to meet the requirements of any of the Imperial Credentials (see above). During that period (2-12 months) the agent may ‘call in’ his qualifications to receive any of the Imperial

Credential licences he currently meets the requirements for. In order to gain new Credential licenses later in the agent’s career he must return to Step Two and re-apply for a new interview.

## GOVERNMENT AGENTS – THE LOCAL AUTHORITARIANS

On a citywide, national or planetary scale, there are ‘localised’ governmental structures put into place to serve as the authority of the local populace. Even in nominally Imperial territories there is a local power structure that serves as the ‘grass roots’ power base in the area. The local government is merely a stand-in for proper representation of the nobility and governing forces – especially when there are Imperialists nearby.

Just as the Imperium needs far-reaching hands to manipulate its territories, a local governmental agency needs employees to manage their own affairs. While they do not require the stable of agents that the Imperium keeps, they still need operatives to cover their needs. A city government might only need a few law enforcement agents and an investigator; whereas a planetary agency will want numerous spies and analysts to help them work with neighboring planets. Each government finds room for those with the skills and the will to use them.

Agents are granted the responsibility to undertake missions for their government, no matter how small. Their roles diminish rapidly when an Imperial agent comes to the area, sometimes sent to operate in league with the locals, but the local agent still remains the true authoritarian to the people. Unless there is a significant Imperial presence to support them, the citizenry will always side with ‘their own’ instead of an ‘foreign agent’. This is what makes local governmental agents so important.

It is variable as to what sorts of agent will be called upon to work for a specific government. The local agency’s ethics and social or technological advancement can influence exactly what kind of agent they need to hire at any given time. Even the most pious or seemingly moral governmental office may find themselves in need of a ruthless spy if the situation was dire enough. There are three groups of local government operatives most agents can be categorised into: Domestic, Foreign and Classified.

Domestic Agents A government that wants to be secure employs operatives to serve as its eyes and ears at home. The politicians may not be personally equipped or trained to manipulate the masses directly, so they hire agents. There are several different jobs that can be fulfilled to reinforce the local authority. These jobs require several types of agent, varying based on role.

The most numerous and commonplace of domestic agents are Law Law EnforcementEnforcement operatives who hold the populace to the legal codes created by the government. They are also in charge of ensuring the

general safety of the population, protecting them from the criminal element as well as other dangers from within.

Working hand in hand with law enforcement, InvestigatorInvestigator agents solve the government’s issues by revealing the unknown about the populace. Sometimes seen as meddlesome snoops by the local police forces, these agents are not paid to be liked – just provide information.

There are always a number of CorporateCorporate agents working with any highly commercialised government, making sure business practices stay fair and safe for the general population, at least from the government’s point of view. A Corporate agent is less useful when businesses are not large or powerful but a local government _must_ watch its economic foundations.

SpiesSpies do not turn their abilities inward upon the government’s own people as often as they are deployed as foreign agents, but they still exist as domestic agents. These undercover operatives keep the politicians apprised of secrets and scandals occurring between their borders. Revolutions, coups and other acts of sedition are thwarted by domestic spies.

Important to a localised governmental agency, AnalystsAnalysts are the direct servants of the politicians. They help the government officials operate more efficiently and protect them from harm, both physical and political. Anyone who holds an office in the public eye will want to have at least one Analyst agent on his payroll.

Appearing when the legal system cannot handle its own workload, domestic Bounty HuntersBounty Hunters fill very specific roles within the government’s employ. They become more plentiful as the government becomes larger, a reflection of the increased need for criminal-tracking abilities within the increased territory. Governments with high Law Levels or strict punishments will need agents to plug the holes in their justice system, and often use Bounty Hunters. They keep law enforcement from getting bogged down with the tasks of chasing down fugitives or bail jumpers, and keep the system functioning efficiently.

Domestic agents are how the government watches, manipulates and protects itself from the people it was formed to protect, serve and lead. Without them, it would not be able to govern effectively.

Foreign Agents Larger or better-connected governments use their agents abroad, sending them to function within other governments’ territories. This is not always done as a subversive or espionage-based function, especially when that other government is a close neighbor. The trading of active agents between borders is a sign of honest trust between allies and is conducted to maintain relations.

Unlike their domestic version, there are few foreign Law EnforcementLaw Enforcement agents. Other cultures and territories are bound to have their own legal systems and justice agencies to police their peoples. This

makes additional foreign agents an unwanted presence, sometimes implying the ineptitude of the local agency. The exception to this is a government is in crisis, asking for aid from their neighbors and allies. Domestic Law Enforcement agents can be turned into foreign ones for as long as they have to work abroad, especially when they are requested in large numbers.

Foreign InvestigatorsForeign Investigators are more commonly used than their Law Enforcement brethren. They are deployed outside of domestic borders to gather information for their employers about foreign territories. When they are used uninvited in foreign lands, Investigators are seen as no better than spies. This is an exaggeration; they are rarely used for anything malicious or underhanded. Foreign Investigators are for the gathering of the public information that a government does not have direct access to from within their own borders.

Governmental economics require constant attention as to what the market and competitors are doing, having a profound effect on the commercial entities within a society or culture. Guessing what outside corporate personnel are doing in the market is not good business, making the use of foreign CorporateCorporate agents a necessity for any commercially or economically sound government. They travel away from their employer’s areas of influence, learning about what the competition is doing and reporting back to adjust economic plans accordingly.

There are not any foreign SpySpy agents – those are all reserved for the Classified Agents grouping (see page 64). Spying is simply not a field open to scrutiny by outsiders.

EEESPIONAGESPIONAGESPIONAGE

AnalystAnalyst agents working with foreign governments are hired in two main varieties – aides and adjustors. Aides are agents sent to help an allied government work with the employing one. Making treaties, arranging for diplomatic trades and serving as loyal bodyguards on foreign soil are what analysts are empowered to do, helping strengthen governmental relations. Adjustors are Analyst agents that are tasked with taking over the reins of a lesser or smaller government being subsumed by the agent’s employer. Aides are used to work better with allies; adjustors are used with governments that _will be_ allies.

Bounty HunterBounty Hunter agents are popular in foreign climes. They venture out into other governments’ jurisdictions with their permission in order to catch runaway criminals, ships and bail jumpers. There are thankfully few governing powers that actually want criminals and troublemakers hiding within their borders, so allowing Bounty Hunters to come and do their jobs is commonplace. Just as these agents help keep the legal system flowing well at home, they can do the same abroad.

The use of agents in foreign territories is not the cloak and dagger espionage that people think of when the topic arises. Many times they are requested by the other government in order to reinforce relations between neighbors or allies or even create alliances where there were none before. Trading agents with foreign powers can turn a budding alliance into an ironclad union.

Classified Agents Foreign agents are sometimes unfairly stereotyped as the spying, sabotaging operatives working undercover on secret orders from an unscrupulous government. These types of agents do exist however, and in large enough numbers to support such stereotypes. Agents that work outside of the normal channels on behalf of their government, deep within the territories they are not supposed to operate within, are called Classified Agents.

The most common classified agent is unsurprisingly the SpySpy. Spies are sent into outside areas on missions of information gathering and data theft, strengthening their government through the weakening of their rivals or enemies. Missions targeting megacorporations, governments and even the mighty Imperium are undertaken by the spies of smaller governments as they try to grow bigger and more powerful. It is a dangerous game they play but their training and their loyalty to their employer can allow them to survive it.

Used in similar classified roles are InvestigatorInvestigator agents. These agents are inserted into opposing environments to gather as much important information without attracting undue attention. They are not bent on harming the target government or organization; they merely need to know more about it, what it is up to and whether it poses any threat to their employer.

Bounty HuntersBounty Hunters see a surprising amount of classified action. They are sent as classified agents into places from which the employer needs targets extradited – without anyone knowing who has arranged it. The agent must track down the target, capture it and then return back to the employer without getting caught or killed.

CorporateCorporate agents take on a new persona when they are sent on a classified mission. They become commercial spies of a sort, breaking into the competition’s headquarters physically or electronically to gather the secrets they find there for their employer. Many Black Hat hackers are classified agents due to the inherent illegality of their careers. For more on what corporate ‘spies’ do for their employers, see the next chapter.

AnalystAnalyst agents are not suited to work in classified fields, as their role and training requires them to work with politicians and government agents. Only if the politician they were working for was also considered classified or secret would this assignment make any sense. There have been spies that have portrayed Analysts in order to get closer to a governmental target, performing their true duties behind closed doors and acting the part of Analyst while under open scrutiny.

The only Law EnforcementLaw Enforcement agents that end up working on classified missions are those with special operations training and moral flexibility. They are not sent to uphold the law as much as they are sent to enforce their employers’ idea of the law. When another government will not punish its own criminals enough for the tastes of the employer, these agents are sent in to exact justice as the law dictates. Such actions might be considered illegal to the targeted society but the agent’s government believes it is a small price to pay.

Classified agents are the backbone of any espionage campaign undertaken by a smaller government; performing the missions that are too risky or amoral for other types of agents. The government could be infiltrated by foreign agents at any time, especially if they are not prepared to deal with such intrusions.

## REGIME CHANGE

No government can be totally safe from the winds of change. Even the mighty Imperium has seen its fair share of coups and political upheavals. Whenever the current government in power is toppled and replaced by another, there is a period of awkwardness, loss and adjustment. This places everyone formerly employed by the old government – especially its agents – in a position of mistrust and possibly danger.

The new regime that has taken over has to consider two things when looking at the roster of agents once employed by the former power: whether to try and keep an agent on their payroll or end their service; this is the dilemma they must overcome.

If an agent was only loosely affiliated with the old government, they can still be trusted to work with the new authority. Average agents might need to prove their loyalty through a series of tests. The staunchly loyal will need to be tracked down and dealt with before they can inflict any harm upon the new regime with their extensive knowledge of the system.

In gaming terms, whenever an existing governmental power or corporate entity for which agents actively work is overthrown or taken over, all employed agents will immediately be brought into question. The results of the new authority’s views upon old agents are based on the agent’s Trust rating with their recently overthrown employer.

The following tables are based on the Agent’s Trust level. Roll 1d6 on the appropriate table, subtracting 1 for each Ally or Network the character possesses that is related somehow to the former employer.

The narrative and rules descriptions of what the above Regime Change Effects are as follows:

Continued Employment: Continued Employment: The agent is allowed to continue working for the new regime. Nothing is changed as far as the agent is concerned; just the name on their paycheques.

Interview: Interview: There is a question as to the potential loyalty of the agent to the new regime. They must sit down with a representative of the new authority and prove their worth. The character in question must pass two of three skill tests taken from the following list: Admin, Carouse, Deception, Persuade or Streetwise. No skill may be tested twice during the interview. Failure means the agent is let go, as per Terminate Employment (see page 66). Success means the character is allowed to maintain his contract as per Continued Employment
(see above). If there is a Dice Modifier listed in the table entry, these skill tests are made with that modifier.

Test Mission: Test Mission: The agent must be put to the test directly, ensuring his loyalty and helping establish the new regime’s power base in the process. The agent must roll a random Espionage Mission (see page 66), adding their Trust to the Mission Difficulty table to determine how challenging a mission is required. If the agent fails the mission, they are fired from employment as per Terminate Employment (and suffer the Failed Mission Mishap!). If they succeed, they are allowed to maintain their contract as per Continued Employment but still do NOT get to roll on the Mission Payout table.

Test of Loyalty: Test of Loyalty: The agent is required to perform a questionable or reprehensible act for the new regime to ensure they are going to work well with them. If the agent chooses to do this, he sacrifices either an Ally or Network (any), for his new employers. If the agent does not have access to one of these to sacrifice, they must instead sacrifice a family member, reducing their Social Standing by 1.

EEESPIONAGESPIONAGESPIONAGE

The agent may alternatively try to fool the new regime into thinking that they have made the sacrifice by passing Deception and Persuade skill checks with any Dice Modifiers listed in the table entry. If they fail to kill for the new employer or fail to fool them, the agent is immediately fired, as per _Terminate Employment._ If the agent successfully does these things, he can remain employed as per _Continued Employment_.

Terminate Employment: Terminate Employment: The agent is seen as too much of a liability due to his connections to his past employer. His contract is immediately terminated, he must return any items of equipment owned by the former employer and has ten days to repay any debts outstanding. Failure to do these things will result in this result being upgraded to _Exile Employee_.

Exile Employee: Exile Employee: The agent is seen as too great a problem or threat to be allowed to live locally. He is granted a single week to leave the new regime’s territory and never return. Failure to do this for whatever reason will upgrade this result to _Terminate Employee_.

Terminate Employee: Terminate Employee: The new regime cannot allow the agent to live. Assassins, bounty hunters and freelance hit men are dispatched to kill the agent and will do so for 1d6 years; or until reports say the agent is dead.

## ESPIONAGE MISSIONS

Agents make their livings by completing missions for their employers, sometimes doing so for a regular wage or special financial bonuses. Missions are the regular duties that agents must undertake to stay gainfully employed.

In Traveller , a mission can be a long series of gaming sessions that allow the Referee to narrate and maneuver his players through his pre-planned plotline. Conversely, a mission might take only a few hours of a single game session to portray. It is up to the Referee to decide what is right for his own Traveller game.

This section reveals a quick format for agent-based missions in the field. In many Traveller games there tends to be a lot of ‘down time’ for some characters while others are training, performing mercenary tickets or are otherwise occupied. We have created a simple system that allows agents to roll up a single mission to perform while they are in between gaming sessions or perhaps during the down time created by other characters.

How to Generate a Mission The Referee should walk the agent through the following steps, in order:

- Generate Mission Type
- Generate Mission Target
- Determine Length of Mission
- Determine Difficulty of Mission
- Determine Agent Success/Failure
- Determine Mission Payout if Successful; otherwise Determine
  Failure Mishap

Generate Mission Type The following table shows the types of Espionage missions that are available for agents. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose which kind of mission the agent will be undertaking. An agent with a Trust level of 3 or higher with their employing agency can add 1 to their die roll if they choose to.

1d6 Result1d6 Result Espionage Mission TypeEspionage Mission Type 1 Legal Action 2 Ongoing Investigation 3 Corporate Action 4 Political Action 5 Underworld Action 6 Covert Action 7 Destructive Action

Each of the Mission Types is defined by a group of four listed skills. The agent will need to take each of these skill checks (in any order), and note the Effect of each check to later determine the success or failure of the mission.

Legal Action: Legal Action: This is a mission based around the law enforcement agencies of the area. This mission will put the agent in contact with the justice system and its elements, perhaps dealing with convicts or local law enforcement. The agent will be using Advocate, Investigate, Persuade and Streetwise.

Ongoing Investigation: Ongoing Investigation: This is a mission that requires the agent to aid with the information gathering or surveillance of another agent’s mission. This mission will force the agent to deal with others in order to gain data on the target. The agent will be using Carouse, Deception, Investigate and Recon.

Corporate Action: Corporate Action: This mission requires the agent to work within the ruthless world of inter-corporate warfare. The agent will need to be able to blend in with the company men and get around within the corporate system to work the target properly. The agent will be using Admin, Computers, Deception and Trade.

Alternatively, the Referee could also refer to the rules for creating an Anti-Corporate Mission and use them instead of using a Corporate Action.

Political Action: Political Action: This mission places the agent in the middle of an active governmental operation. The agent will be working amidst politicians and government operatives, making social interactions to get closer to the target. The agent will be using Admin, Carouse, Investigate and Persuade.

Underworld Action: Underworld Action: This mission requires the agent to become involved with a dangerous criminal syndicate. The agent will need to be able to deal with his target without raising suspicions, or the mission – and his life – could be compromised. The agent will be using Carouse, Deception, Persuade and Streetwise.

Covert Action: Covert Action: This mission is top secret and cannot be discovered by anyone outside of the agency. The agent will need to be a ghost; never seen or heard. The agent will be using Deception, Investigate, Recon and Stealth.

Destructive Action: Destructive Action: Normally reserved for when espionage fails, this mission requires the agent to make a brutal example out of the target. This forces the agent to isolate the target and cause massive physical damage to it in order to send a message. The agent will need to use Athletics (any), Explosives, Gun Combat and Stealth.

Generate Mission Target The following table shows the types of target that Espionage missions will be aimed toward. These groupings are general in order for Referees to better include them in their own campaign; altering the exact nature of the target to their own desires and tastes. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine which kind of mission the agent will be undertaking. An agent with a Trust level of 3 or higher with their employing agency can add 1 to their die roll if they choose to.

RollRoll Espionage Mission TargetEspionage Mission Target 1 Location 2 Public Data 3 Private Data 4 Item, Common 5 Item, Rare 6 Person 7 V.I.P.

Location: Location: This mission targets a specific location; a building, an address or possibly just a set of co-ordinates. The agent must interact with that location in a specific way for their employer.

Public Data: Public Data: This mission targets a specific piece or collection of publicly stored data. The agent must copy, erase or steal the data for his employer. This target grants a –1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Private Data: Private Data: This mission targets a specific piece or collection of data that is stored somewhere inaccessible to the average person. The agent must copy, erase or steal the data for his employer. This target grants a +1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Item, Common: Item, Common: The mission target is a specific item in a place that relates to its surroundings (a storage disk in a computer lab, a chemical in a lab, and so on). The agent must research, steal or destroy the item for his employer. This target grants a –1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

EEESPIONAGESPIONAGESPIONAGE

Item, Rare: Item, Rare: This mission targets a specific item in a specific place but the item is rare enough it does not belong where it is being held (a book in a vault, a firearm buried in a forest, and so on). The agent must research, steal or destroy the item for his employer. This target grants a +1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Person: Person: The mission targets a specific person that the agent must interact with. The agent will have to converse with, spy upon, kidnap or even kill the person in question for his employer.

V.I.P. (Very Important Person): V.I.P. (Very Important Person): This mission targets someone who is (in)famous in their field and is well-known throughout their area. The agent will have to converse with, spy upon, kidnap or even kill the individual in question for his employer. This target grants a +1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Determine Length of Mission The following table shows how long the Espionage mission will take for the agent to complete. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine how long the agent will be working on the mission.

1d6 Result1d6 Result Espionage Mission LengthEspionage Mission Length^1 1 1d6x3 weeks 2 1d6x2 weeks 3 1d6 weeks 4 1d6x5 days 5 1d6x3 days 6 1d6+1 days

(^1) The amount is doubled if the mission is interplanetary in nature
(Referee’s discretion) Determine Difficulty of Mission The following table shows how difficult the Espionage mission will be for the agent to accomplish. This is measured in a total amount of Effect the agent character should have to generate from his successful skill checks (based on the Mission Type, above) during the Mission. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine how difficult the agent’s mission will be in terms of Effect necessary. Additionally, the difficulty may or may not have a modifier to the Mission Payout if successful. 1d6 Result1d6 Result Espionage Mission DifficultyEspionage Mission Difficulty Mission Payout Mission Payout ModifierModifier 0 Training Level (1 Effect) –3 DM 1 Very Easy (3 Effect) –2 DM 2 Easy (5 Effect) –1 DM 3 Routine (7 Effect) — 4 Medium (9 Effect) — 5 Challenging (11 Effect) +1 DM 6 Difficult (13 Effect) +2 DM 7 Arduous (15 Effect) +3 DM Determine Agent Success/Failure Once the agent has determined how difficult the Espionage Mission will be for him to complete, he must then attempt all four of the skill checks listed in the Mission Type category. These checks are made with the standard 8+ difficulty required of them but can be modified with any characteristic; so long as the agent can describe the check sufficiently in regards to the Mission Target. For example, a physically-minded agent placed on an Underworld Action targeting a Person might attempt to modify his Carouse, Persuade and Streetwise rolls all with his superior Strength modifier. He does this satisfactorily by saying that he is using his muscular bulk to show off in a bar (Carouse), intimidate an informant
(Persuade) and rough up a local gang member (Streetwise). Once these skill checks are rolled and the total Effect is calculated, the agent checks his total against the amount required by the Mission Difficulty. If the total is equal to or more than the amount required, the mission is a success and the agent may now Determine Mission Payout. If the total is less than that required for success however, the agent has failed and must instead roll upon the Failure Mishap table, subtracting –1 for each point of Effect they were lower than the required amount for success. Determine Mission Payout The following table shows how well the agent will be paid for his successful Espionage Mission. Most of the mission payouts come in the form of a cash bonus but some have additional benefits attached to them similar to the Mustering-Out Benefit Rolls gained during _Traveller_ character creation. The Referee should roll 2d6 or choose on the following table to determine how well the agent is compensated for a job well done, remembering all modifiers from the earliest parts of the mission, character adjustments and so forth.

# THE DARK SIDE OF CORPORATIONS

One place an agent always knows he can find work is within the cutthroat world of corporate politics. In _Traveller_ , most corporations that have grown to a size to require agents are also large enough to have made many enemies on their rise to power. The ascension of new corporations, the ironclad dominance of the megacorps and the sinister behaviours of those looking for bigger profits; these are what corporate-employed agents are paid to deal with.

This chapter reveals the inner workings of the corporate world and how it wields its agents against one another. Their conflicts range from invisible electronic skirmishes over hacked computer networks and data stream virus-bombings, to R&D sabotage and direct employee assassinations. From the outside looking in, the competition between corporations may seem robust but the truth is often far more brutal.

This mentality toward secrecy and hidden maneuvers are what have steered corporations toward the almost exclusive use of spies, saboteurs and other hidden operatives. Agent missions are where the front lines of the corporate wars are, inflicting wounds on the competition that bleed resources or reputation like an arterial wound. The most powerful and cunning of corporate entities know this; they are the ones that keep the best and greatest agents on their payrolls.

Corporations begin their conflicts with one another for a variety of reasons. Most often it is due to both companies serving in the same arena of business, setting each other up as the direct competition. Rival products or services can stem financial flow on both sides, creating tension between the two companies. Tension leads to blaming the other for losses (which may or may not be accurate) and blame eventually blossoms into conflict.

The Stages of a Corporate War Any war between corporate entities, from national companies to galaxy-spanning megacorporations, escalates in the same fashion. The scale simply changes in relation to the size and scope of the sides involved.

The first time a pair of established companies clash it is normally due to one party expanding their business into the existing territory of another. This can be a physical territory, like delivery grounds and planetary resource tracts, or it can be a more figurative territory like similar styles of weapon research or type of clientele. One company looks at the expansion of the other and takes it as a threat to their ability to do business, which sparks the unpleasant relations between them.

After a corporate conflict has begun, the next step for both sides is to start gathering intelligence on the other. Bribery and favour- dealing with the competition’s employees starts the cycle of ground level research, finding out what their new ‘enemy’ is all about. What begins with innocent fact finding missions and pocket lining quickly changes into hiring professional spies to gather information illicitly.

When spying missions reveal that a competitor is becoming a greater threat (or perceived as one), the corporate conflicts evolve from mere intelligence gathering to more direct maneuvers to gain leverage. Spies are no longer restricted to just reconnaissance; data theft and corruption being called upon to hinder opposing growth while stimulating the employer’s. Active marketing to the competition’s consumer or employee base rises to a primary advertising and recruitment scheme. Anything that causes the

## CORPORATE WARS

Just as the nations of a fractious planet might do, corporations also wage their own wars with one another. Unlike the wars of a battlefield or naval engagement, corporations attack each other with weapons of information, sabotage and covertness in order to inflict casualties. Heroes are made, lives are crushed and casualties occur. The soldiers of these corporate wars are their ranks of loyal agents, ready to go out and fight the good fight in their own way.

The battle for higher market share is a distinctly different atmosphere than a blood-and-bullets conflict. That is not to imply there are no physical engagements between corporations; it is just not as common. The majority of corporate conflicts are performed under the table, away from plain sight where a corporation’s image could be harmed in the public eye.

TTHEHE D DARKARK S SIDEIDE OFOF C CORPORATIONSORPORATIONS

opposition to lose market share and profits is a useful tool in this stage of the corporate ‘war’, but neither side is ready yet to inflict physical damage upon the other.

For a corporate conflict at this level to take the next step into sabotage and industrial warfare there has to be an unexpected shift by one side. One of the competitors must suddenly feel threatened by their opponents; threatened enough to escalate to malicious action. When that happens, the first sabotage or industrial vandalism starts a chain reaction of retributive missions by the other party. These sorts of underhanded attacks go back and forth between the competing companies, the damage incurred on both sides adds up. Each mission pushes the line of tolerance a little further and eventually one side reaches their breaking point and takes the first violent action toward the competition.

Once the corporate war moves to violence there is no turning back. Agents are no longer sent into ‘enemy territory’ to take or destroy data; they are tasked with inflicting real damage upon the company. Attacks on key employees or destruction of important property fill mission dockets. Local authorities must be bribed or avoided, employees begin to wear armor to work and damage reports become part of the CEO’s morning meetings. This is not the final stage of a corporate war but it is the most dangerous to both sides’ employees. Missions target the company’s most important resource

- its workers.

Some corporate wars never reach the last stage of a corporate conflict; they are content to exist in the previous stages for decades or are ended by other circumstances. Those that escalate to the final level of the war begin to emulate an actual battle. Corporations hire soldiers and mercenaries to go out and do direct battle with the martial forces of the other. Only the most powerful corporations have the clout and influence to fight their competition this way. A war that reaches this point will end in only one way; the utter defeat of one side of the conflict.

Corporate Alliances Not all corporations are fighting against one competitor. Like smaller nations caught in the path of a superpower, companies that are not singularly powerful enough to deal with the competition will seek allies in the market. Adding other smaller companies to their side of a corporate war can create a unified front that may tip the scales in their favour – or cause the fall of several minor entities at once.

Companies must be careful when creating or joining alliances in this way. Standing with another corporation places resources, information and other important assets in the alliance’s collective grasp. Should an ally become swayed to the side of the enemy during the course of the conflict, their treachery stands to weaken the whole alliance tremendously. Not only will they feel the loss of an ally but also the betrayal itself can be a mighty blow to the war efforts.

It is common practice for any corporate entity to thoroughly investigate a prospective ally, sending agents into their midst like they would any other corporate target. These spies are expected to be thorough and careful not to do any harm in case the company does become an ally but they must also be fast enough to make a decision quickly as to whether or not the alliance should be offered.

For the companies that are suitable and become part of the war, the newly formed alliance is always put to the test. Specific missions, information sharing and resource re-allocation are good ways to ensure the new ally is ready to go to war. Once proven to be a useful part of the alliance, the new company will be responsible for its own part of the war effort from that point forward.

Corporate Militaries or Commercial Mercenaries Most corporate wars never reach the stage of open conflict, remaining at the level of subversive missions and employee harassment for the duration. The rare instances where a corporation moves to direct violence require the acquisition of a skilled military unit. Most companies cannot simply arm their employees and hope to win a shooting match with most enemies. This requires the hiring of professional fighters. A company involved in open warfare has two options if they want to continue doing business and not simply give in to the opposition.

The first option is the easiest but most expensive. Hiring temporary mercenary fighters with a legally-binding mission ticket (for more on tickets see, Traveller: Mercenary ) means placing the company’s trust in the skills of professional guns-for-hire. This means the employer will be spending a high amount of funds to acquire talented mercenaries and bind them to their role within the war. Unfortunately this practice comes with its own worries and flaws. A ticketed mercenary company cannot work for the opposing company but will be exposed to company secrets and potential information that might be tempting for them to later sell – once the ticket is fulfilled. Hiring mercenaries to fight the violent battles of an escalated corporate war is expensive and risky but they are skilled enough to do the job properly.

The second option may be more time consuming and risks more company assets but can be less expensive. Some companies hire, train and maintain a standing military force within the corporate structure. Normally hired on officially as ‘special task force security’, the company hires and trains a capable military unit and keeps them ready to serve their various needs. In times of peace the corporate military units are used to protect company assets and real estate, only gearing up and going to battle if their employer gets into a real war. Corporations that have offices in hostile territories or war-torn areas will hire military units as a constant presence. There are some megacorporations that have standing armies larger than those of small nations; a point of interest to the actual governments that they do business within. Having a corporate military is not as expensive as

TTTHEHEHE D D DARKARKARK S S SIDEIDEIDE OFOFOF C C CORPORATIONSORPORATIONSORPORATIONS

having to hire professional mercenaries in the short term but can be costly over years or decades of paying their meagre salaries.

It is the difference of having the constant presence or protection of staff on hand with a corporate military and the quick ability to arrange for true professionals to deal with a competitor. It depends greatly on the size and resources of the company in question.

Some sample statistics and hiring/wage fees for corporate military assets are as follows:

Commercial Fighter: Commercial Fighter: This is a standard mercenary hired to assault enemy corporate holdings, eliminating normal resistance with standard munitions. The cost to hire a unit of commercial fighters
(standard is 5 men) is 2d6x1,000 Credits per mission. These fighters do not have a wage cost; they are hired for a set number of missions.

Commercial Unit Leader: Commercial Unit Leader: An additional member of a standard commercial fighter unit, the unit leader is better equipped and trained. Each commercial unit leader hired to lead an existing commercial fighter unit costs 5,000 Credits per mission and has no ongoing wage cost. There is a maximum of two leaders per fighter unit that can be hired.

Commercial Sniper: Commercial Sniper: An upgrade made to a member of a standard commercial fighter unit, the commercial sniper is a trained killer working at long range with a high-powered rifle. Replacing one of the five fighters in a normal unit, a commercial sniper costs 2,500 Credits to hire in addition to the cost of the regular unit per mission. Like other commercial mercenaries, snipers have no ongoing wage cost. There is a maximum of one sniper per fighter unit hired.

The Aftermath – Higher Profit Margins or

Hostile Takeover? Unless a corporate war is too evenly matched, permitting it to go on indefinitely, one side will eventually get the better of the other and the conflict will come to a close. The end of a corporate war leaves the victor asking itself many questions as to what to do with their defeated competitor. To the victor goes the spoils, but there are times where taking on a broken and battered company’s resources also means taking on their debts and shortcomings.

Once a clear victor has been declared, the aftermath of the war must be determined for business to resume as normal. Every bit of manpower dedicated to the war effort is a slight loss to the company’s overall profitability, making the change to post-war functions a marketable necessity.

The winning corporate entity has several options they can choose from; shaping what is to become of the losing side’s employees, assets and identity.

ACQUISITION When a company defeats another in a corporate war and believes that their former opponent(s) still have a future in their industry, the victorious corporation can choose to consume the other into part of their collective being. The old company no longer exists in the same form that it once did; it instead is now a part of the greater corporation. This is the most common result of a corporate war.

DISSOLUTION Sometimes a corporation defeats its competition so solidly and completely there is not much of a company remaining to make use of. Some malicious corporations relish the thought of utterly destroying a rival company. Resources are scattered, employees are let go and forgotten and all records of the company are frozen or destroyed.

PARENTING Thought of as the most merciful of aftermaths, the choice to take on a defeated company as a separate entity within the influence of the victor is called ‘parenting’. The victorious corporation believes it can stand to make good profits from the defeated competition

by keeping its identity and sovereign management as long as it continues to answer to the parent company’s CEO or board of directors. Only wars that end before the violent stage of conflict have this as their outcome.

RESOURCE COMPENSATION It is common for a short corporate conflict to end with one side demanding the other pay for any damages, spent resources or lost income they incurred during the war. This option is normally offered as part of an ultimatum made by the victorious company; ‘Pay for all our repairs plus 25% or we will dissolve your Imperial charter’. Resource compensation is considered to be part of several other aftermath decisions, so it is rarely used on its own by a clever victor unless they are trying to make a point.

WITHDRAWAL Some companies fight their corporate wars just to extend or protect their territorial boundaries; they are satisfied making sure that the defeated competition leaves their area. Enforcing a complete corporate withdrawal can be difficult and costly but the security of knowing that a former enemy and competitor cannot do business in any areas that your company is profiting is well worth it. Companies that call for opponents to withdraw in such a fashion will assuredly have standing security or military forces to remind their defeated enemies of what awaits them if they ever encroach again.

## INDUSTRIAL SABOTAGE

The single largest reason why corporations employ agents is to counteract the intrusion of other companies’ agents. The reason for that is the constant threat of industrial espionage. Agents sent to a corporation’s worksite or other facility with intentions of inflicting material damage upon them is a huge cost to the targeted company. A few successful sabotage missions can all but cripple a company’s profits for that quarter, perhaps longer.

The arena of industrial sabotage is brutal, cold-hearted and requires dedication to the mission goal at all times. It is easy for an agent to take on a job that was described to him as simply disengaging a few coolant lines at a manufacturing plant; but will he have the tenacity to go through with it when he sees that dozens of workers could be hurt or killed? Would he have taken the job if he knew innocent people would die? What if he was given a huge salary bonus to do so? These are all questions that arise when dealing with agents that perform industrial missions of destruction.

Employers may call upon an agent on their payroll to conduct sabotage on their competition. They might not know whether or not anyone could get hurt or perhaps they do not care. Whatever the case, the agent will be responsible for fulfilling the desired action completely, successfully and without leaving a trace of the employing company.

sabotage attempt. The exact nature of what must be done to achieve this goal varies depending on the agent and the mission parameters. One agent might use a detonator to cripple an imprinting machine where another might reprogram the machine to only produce misprints over and over again.

An agent sent on a specific type of industrial sabotage mission will have his options laid out in front of him depending on his resources, skills and mission requirements. An agent on a mission of data corruption will not likely bring C-4 to accomplish his goal, for example. The following is a list of useful skills that agents can use to accomplish specific missions of industrial sabotage.

- Computers – Computers – Useful for data theft and corruption; programmable
  software codes and viruses.
- Drive – Drive – Arranging for vehicular complications or accidents of
  corporate ground-based equipment.
- Explosives – Explosives – Useful for violent sabotage or resource destruction;
  very useful for industrial terrorism.
- Flyer – Flyer – Arranging for vehicular complications, accidents or
  hijacking of corporate air-based equipment.
- Gun Combat/Heavy Weapons/Melee – Gun Combat/Heavy Weapons/Melee – Useful for violent
  actions, industrial terrorism and employee assassination.
- Mechanic – Mechanic – Useful for arranging mechanical failures, vehicular
  complications and other engine or tool-based problems of
  corporate assets or equipment.
- Remote Operations – Remote Operations – Arranging for misuse or malfunction of
  corporate remotes; useful for programming combat drones for
  industrial terrorism.
- Science (any relevant) – Science (any relevant) – Arranging for research miscalculation
  or experiment corruption.
- Sensors – Sensors – Useful for data theft or sensor malfunction.
- Stealth – Stealth – Useful for getting in, around or out of monitored
  corporate facilities.

  profitable.
- Vacc Suit – Vacc Suit – Arranging for vacc suit malfunction or failures.

## MANIPULATING GOVERNMENTS

When a company evolves into a larger entity and eventually into a licensed megacorporation, they become more and more influential with the growth of their industry. As their share and control of the market increases, the local economy begins to become directly attached to the corporation’s success. At some point the local economy becomes the province of the company itself, leaving the local government at the mercy of the company.

Corporations that gather this much power and control over the governments that ‘allow’ them to do business within their territories realize quickly they can manipulate the economy to their own needs

- and therefore manipulate the government itself. Depending on how

strong the government is, a powerful corporation can perform specific actions within their market structure to urge it to do as they wish.

INDUSTRIAL TERRORISM AND EMPLOYEE ASSASSINATION Industrial sabotage is aimed mainly at machinery, data or resources – but not completely. Some amoral or callous corporate employers view the employees and officers of a competitor as nothing more than ‘living resources’ to be hindered or destroyed. These companies have no qualms about hurting the competition’s employees or workers through industrial terrorism or assassination.

Industrial terrorism is the wanton destruction of corporate assets through violent actions. Explosives, chemical warfare and automatic weaponry are commonly used to enact industrial terrorism.

Employee assassinations are precision strikes at key members of the competition’s staff. Killing these important officers, executives and foremen stalls projects, spreads fear and severely hurts department profitability.

The use of Industrial Terrorism is considered a general anathema to business dealings and any agent caught or successfully linked to Industrial Terrorism immediately loses 1 Social Standing.

In a narrative sense, there are countless different forms of sabotage that can be used to harm a corporate target. The destruction or malfunction of data, tools and resources is the ultimate goal of any

Rating a Corporation’s Political Power Every corporate entity has an economic footprint they cover in the local political scene, from the extremely minor to the ultra-powerful. Not every megacorp will have the clout to push around their local government and some small industries might have a stranglehold on their leaders’ main export. Whatever the situation, a corporation bears a standard Influence Rating that is used to determine just how influential they are in the local political scene.

Influence Rating is calculated using the background information of the local area, the type of government, the size of the corporate entity and finally the average profit margin of the representative branches of the corporation. These statistics all add up to form the corporation’s Influence Rating and should either be chosen by the Referee (to better suit his game) or rolled randomly on the tables below.

A corporation’s Influence Rating starts effectively at 1.

LOCAL AREA DEPENDENCY The Dependency table shows how much the local government’s constituency needs or desires the corporation’s services, employment or goods.

Wealth is an important factor when dealing with a governmental office. The officers in a given government will make special exceptions or inclusions for a ‘generous corporate investor’ in regards to things that the average interest or social group must all but beg for. This is the power of the almighty credit; in the hands of a crafty corporation it can make or break small governments.

Using the tables above to build this example, we are looking at determining the Influence Rating of a localised branch of a J-Drive manufacturer. Knowing exactly what we are building for our game setting, we will choose all of the acceptable modifiers, although we could have just as easily rolled them randomly.

_Starting at the standard Influence Rating 1, our company is considered to have an Above Average dependency from the local populace due to its high employment rates (+1). Working steadily with the acceptance of the local self-perpetuating oligarchy, the company is somewhat friendly with the ruling party (+1). The company, Allspace Drives, is a multi- national corporation classed as ‘Large’, making it more powerful in the eyes of economists (+2) but it has run into hard times lately and has only seen Minor Profits for the last year (+0). The local branch of Allspace Drives has a total Influence Rating of 5 (1+1+1+2+0= 5)_.

Using Influence Rating to Sway

Governmental Policy Once the Referee or player in charge of the corporation has determined what the Influence Rating should be, they can begin to use it to attempt the manipulation of local governmental agencies. Corporations can wield their economic and political might to make subtle or drastic changes to governmental policy, laws and several other areas of political manipulation.

LOCAL CORPORATE PROFIT MARGIN The following table shows how much liquid profits the local extension of the greater corporate entity makes each quarter, demonstrative of the wealth and influence the entity has over the local economy.

2d6 Result2d6 Result Local Profit Margin DescriptionLocal Profit Margin Description Influence Rating ModifierInfluence Rating Modifier 2 Heavy Losses – Heavy Losses – Corporation loses between 25 and 50% of invested capital each quarter. –4 3 Acceptable Losses – Acceptable Losses – Corporation loses between 5 and 10% of invested capital each quarter.

10 Moderate Profits – Moderate Profits – Corporation gains between 15 and 20% of invested capital each quarter.

+2

11 High Profits – High Profits – Corporation gains between 25 and 40% of invested capital each quarter. +4 12 Market-stacking Profits – Market-stacking Profits – Corporation gains 45% or more of invested capital each quarter. +6

In game mechanics the corporation’s Influence Rating represents a pool of d6s that the company receives each financial quarter to use in any way they choose to. When a corporate entity wants to manipulate the local government in some way, they choose a number of dice from their Influence rating pool and roll them all, adding the results together. For the purposes of ‘game time’, every die rolled represents a single week of lobbying, carousing and other forms of influencing local governmental officials.

Once this narrative time has passed and the dice have been rolled, if the total equals or exceeds the target number for the desired action, the company succeeds in their task. If the total is lower than what was needed, the manipulation fails and the company will need to try again.

The target number for Influence Rating rolls depends on the sort of manipulation being attempted and a handful of other modifiers. These are listed on the table below.

Type of Manipulation RequestType of Manipulation Request Base Target NumberBase Target Number^1 Menial 5 Minor 10 Lesser 12 Common 15 Uncommon 25 Rare 40 Exotic 50 Impossible 65

_As a continuation of the example above, Allspace Drives decides that it needs one of its executives to avoid prison time by having some smuggling charges dropped (a Common Request; target is 15). Spending four full weeks campaigning, wining and dining the local magistrate, the Referee grabs 4d6 from Allspace Drives’ Influence Rating pool of 5 and rolls them. The results are 5, 5, 3 and 4; 17! In one short month of manipulation, the magistrate sees ‘new evidence’ come to light and drops the charges._

## INFILTRATION

Agents that work within the buildings and facilities of opposing corporations always run the risk of getting caught and either arrested as a trespasser, exposed as an enemy agent or worse. It takes real skill to successfully infiltrate a potentially hostile compound. The agent must get in; do whatever it is they are tasked to do, then get back out – hopefully without raising anyone’s suspicions.

There are as many ways to successfully infiltrate a corporate facility as a crafty agent can dream up but there are only a handful of time- tested methods that most agents rely upon. These methods are reflected in the basic skills the more intrusion-based Agent career paths offer, but any character can use accordingly. With the right plan and the right skills and equipment at their disposal, any agent can be a good infiltrator.

The following subsections are paradoxical methodologies that characters will sometimes use during a corporate infiltration.

GO PREPARED OROR EQUIP LIGHTLY? This is the great dilemma for agents. A common infiltration will not only require certain skills but often special tools and equipment as well. An agent needs to decide how well-equipped they want to be in order to complete their mission successfully. Bring too much and risk being weighed down while having to be mindful of your gear at all times; bring too little and jeopardise the mission by not being prepared to overcome the obstacles ahead of you. With the right amount of intelligence about the facility being infiltrated the agent can answer this quandary more easily.

BE HIDDEN OROR WORK IN THE OPEN? An agent has an important initial choice to make long before he ever steps a foot within the target facility. He must decide whether or not he is going to take the extra time and care to use stealth at all times or ignore obfuscation and focus solely on the job at hand. Taking the longer amount of time to stay out of view from sensors, cameras and watchful employees will hopefully keep the infiltrator from being caught but it will also shorten the possible window of safe activity for the whole mission. Both options have their benefits and drawbacks but it is ultimately up to the agent to decide how to proceed with his infiltration.

OBSCURE FEATURES OROR WEAR A DISGUISE? Even the stealthiest of agents looking to avoid all contact and image-capturing sensors on their missions must be prepared to be seen, photographed or videotaped. Some agents wear concealing hoods or masks that make them just another faceless humanoid that cannot be placed. Agents with the skills to do so may instead choose to wear some kind of personal disguise that will baffle those who manage to see them. Looking like any other local employee or perhaps even a specific celebrity can create enough confusion to cover their escape or belay their capture.

TTTHEHEHE D D DARKARKARK S S SIDEIDEIDE OFOFOF C C CORPORATIONSORPORATIONSORPORATIONS

DO NO HARM OROR TERRORISE THE STAFF? Most infiltration missions onto corporate grounds are only as violent as the agent involved, with a vast majority of them preferring to avoid conflict when possible. They may go on their missions armed for self-defence but many agents prefer to stay out of violent situations altogether. There are those that believe quite the opposite however and will wave their guns or blades at their victims just to shake them up and to keep them from trying anything against the agent’s wishes. No agent can be ready for every situation laid before them but they can make the choice whether or not to use fear and violence on their missions.

Ghost in the Machine –

Electronic Infiltrations There is a new type of infiltration that occurs once a society reaches the computer age (TL7-8), known as electronic infiltration. This is more than just pirating software or leaving behind viruses in the wake of a talented hack, these sorts of intrusions are long-term relationships that are formed by the computer-savvy agent with other computerised personas that work for the corporate entity the agent is ‘infiltrating’.

By forging electronic friendships, alliances and even pseudo-loves with people that exist on the inside of the target network, the agent can worm his way into sensitive files and information using e-mails, instant messaging and real-time chat programs. It is like breaking into a company’s offices one cubicle at a time without ever even having to set foot in the building. By gaining the trust of employees, perhaps even by faking being a co-worker, the agent learns about the company, its facilities and potentially its secrets.

This sort of infiltration is not a quick hack or an overnight pilfering of data. It is something that an agent will create slowly and methodically until he is sure that he has cyber-tendrils woven throughout the target company. Only then will he spring his trap and reap the benefits of all his close friends and allies.

This form of infiltration is a specific Computers skill check:

Create a network of computer-based allies to electronically infiltrate a corporate entity: 10-60 Weeks, Intelligence, Average (+0)/Difficult
(–2) if targeting a corporate entity that employs White Hat hackers

Success on this skill will add the Effect of their successful check as a Dice Modifier to the total Effect needed to determine the success of failure of an Anti-Corporate Mission.

Security Systems Agents that base their missions on infiltration and intrusion have to overcome many obstacles in their line of work, namely security systems. From the ‘mark one eyeball’ on a beat walking security guard to the IR sensitive motion tracker pylons of Imperial prison yards, there are many different ways for an agent to get caught being somewhere he is not supposed to be.

This section shows several different sample security system elements that corporations combine and typically use at their facilities and office grounds. The systems are divided by entry, each entry bearing a specific minimum technology level, a narrative description of the system element, the skills that can be used to circumvent them and the Dice Modifiers placed upon those skills to do so. These, of course, are just examples and Referees are encouraged to devise their own and combine them to create new and interesting security system packages.

How to Generate an Anti-Corporate Mission The Referee should walk the agent through the following steps in order:

Generate Mission Target Determine Length of Mission Determine Difficulty of Mission Determine Agent Success/Failure Determine Mission Payout if Successful; otherwise Determine Failure Mishap

GENERATE MISSION TARGET The following table shows the categories of targets that Anti- Corporation missions will be sending the agent toward. These groupings are designed to be general in order for the Referee to ensure they can fit in their own games. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine which kind of target the agent will be going after. An Agent with a Trust level of 3 or higher with their employing agency can add or subtract 1 from their die roll if they choose to.

1d6 Result1d6 Result Anti-Corporate Mission TargetAnti-Corporate Mission Target 1 Facility 2 Public Research 3 Private Research 4 Product, Common 5 Prototype 6 Employee 7 Executive

Facility: Facility: This mission targets a specific corporate work facility; an office building, an industrial complex or a resource storage site. The agent must interact with that location in a specific way for their employer.

Public Research: Public Research: This mission targets a publicly accessible product research facility. The agent must copy, erase or steal the research data. This target grants a –1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Private Research: Private Research: This mission targets a research information that is not commonly known to the public. The agent must copy, erase or steal the research information for his employer. This target grants a +1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Product, Common: Product, Common: The mission target is a specific product type stored in a corporate storage facility. The agent must research, steal or destroy the product for his employer. This target grants a –1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Prototype: Prototype: This mission targets a new prototype being created by the competing corporation. The agent must research, steal or destroy the prototype for his employer. This target grants a +1 to the rolls upon the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

Employee: Employee: The mission targets a specific employee of the corporate entity. The agent will have to converse with, spy upon, kidnap or even kill the employee in question for his employer.

Executive: Executive: This mission targets someone of worth within the corporation. The agent will have to converse with, spy upon, kidnap or even kill the executive employee. This target grants a +1 to rolls on the Mission Difficulty and Mission Payout tables.

(^1) The amount is multiplied by five if the mission is interplanetary in nature (Referee’s discretion). DETERMINE DIFFICULTY OF MISSION The following table shows how difficult the Anti-Corporate mission will be. This is decided by the total amount of Effect the agent character will have to generate from successful skill checks during the Mission. These skill checks are based on the types of Security Systems and anti-personnel skill checks made during the course of the mission. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine how difficult the agent’s mission will be in terms of Effect necessary. The difficulty may or may not have a modifier to the Mission Payout if successful. 1d6 Result1d6 Result Anti-Corporate Mission Anti-Corporate Mission DifficultyDifficulty Mission Payout Mission Payout ModifierModifier 0 Simple (5 Effect) –3 DM 1 Very Easy (7 Effect) –2 DM 2 Easy (9 Effect) –1 DM 3 Routine (10 Effect) — 4 Medium (14 Effect) +1 DM 5 Challenging (16 Effect) +2 DM 6 Difficult (18 Effect) +3 DM 7 Arduous (20 Effect) +4 DM DETERMINE AGENT SUCCESS/FAILURE Once the agent has determined how difficult the Anti-Corporate Mission will be for him to accomplish, he must then attempt to bypass the personnel and security systems at the corporate site, arranged for by the Referee. These checks are made with the standard 8+ difficulty required of them but can be modified with any applicable characteristic. To randomly determine how many checks may be necessary, roll on the following table. 2d6 Result2d6 Result Number of Applicable Agent Skill ChecksNumber of Applicable Agent Skill Checks 23 34 4-5 5 6-8 6 9-10 7 11 8 12 10 DETERMINE LENGTH OF MISSION The following table shows how long the Anti-Corporate mission will take for the agent to fulfil. The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine how long the agent will be working on their new mission.

Once these skill checks are done and the total Effect (weighing losses against successes) is calculated, the agent checks his total against the amount required by the Mission Difficulty.

If the total is equal to or more than the amount required, the mission is a success and the agent may now Determine Mission Payout.

If the total is less than what is required for success however, the agent has failed and must instead roll upon the Failure Mishap table, subtracting 1 for each point of Effect they scored lower than the required amount for success.

DETERMINE MISSION PAYOUT
The following table shows how well the agent will be compensated for his successful Anti-Corporate Mission. The Referee should roll 2d6 or choose on the following table to determine how well the agent is compensated for a job well done, remembering any modifiers from earlier pre-mission skill checks, Referee adjustments and such.

DETERMINE FAILURE MISHAP
The following table shows what has happened to an agent when he fails an Anti-Corporate mission. The Referee should roll 2d6 or choose on the following table to determine what happened to the agent in question, remembering to include the modifier for a lower mission Effect total.

2d6 Result2d6 Result Anti-Corporate Failure MishapAnti-Corporate Failure Mishap

# BOUNTIES

Space is unimaginably large. It is a titanic place that supports untold amounts of life on a seemingly limitless number of planets, moons and space stations. Even taking this staggering concept into account, habitable territory makes up a tiny fraction of space itself. That leaves the majority of outer space empty, uninhabited and perfect for avoiding authorities. A fugitive on the run can put a lot of space between the law and himself – which is why there is the bounty system.

Bounties are, simply stated, a price placed upon the finding, capture or elimination of a specific individual. These prices are set by the parties looking to have a target hunted down and range from modest to enormous depending on the target and how badly the paying party needs them sought out. A skilled bounty hunter can make a very good living tracking and finding these targets for his employers.

This chapter details the use of bounties and bounty hunting in _Traveller_. Suited for those agents that spent career terms in the Bounty Hunter paths, this chapter helps flesh out the action of tracking down fugitives, wanted criminals and wayward starships. With the information found here, any _Traveller_ character can try their hand at making money through bringing in bounties.

## BOUNTY HUNTING

Professionals that focus on collecting bounties are called bounty hunters. They are a special type of agent that does not necessarily sell his services to one specific employer but rather sells them on a case by case basis.

When someone says ‘bounty hunter’, they immediately think of weapon-strewn mercenary types clad in armor, jetting around the galaxy in search of the big score. Most bounty hunters do not fit this description; most are simply spacefaring folk that get paid for a special service. A career in bounty hunting may sound glamorous, soaring across the stars in search of an escaped killer worth hundreds of thousands of credits to the Imperium, but the reality of things tends to be quite different. For every big money, high profile bounty that is posted there are a thousand petty payouts based on finding common bail jumpers, missing persons or small-time criminals. A professional bounty hunter is not likely to be famous for his work.

Like most agents, bounty hunters do not want to be recognizable or famous for their career choice. If their potential targets know who they are because of seeing them on a media wire they could flee at first sign of the hunter. This would make getting close enough to apprehend them extremely difficult. The proper use of stealth, disguises and misdirection is paramount to a successful hunt.

Bounty hunters that want to be successful in their chosen field need to remember the five ‘golden rules’ of bounty hunting:

### SHARPEN YOUR SKILLS

Criminals and fugitives are constantly learning new and interesting ways to avoid capture while on the run, forcing bounty hunters to work out new ways to foil their plans and schemes. For every new trick or method to thwart the hunt, the hunter must have two new ideas on how to continue unhindered. Bounty hunters should help ready themselves by constantly testing and increasing their library of skills.

Honing their abilities in skills such as Advocate, Astrogation, Computers, Gun Combat, Investigate, Stealth and Streetwise is a good way for a bounty hunter to spend his free time. They will be some of his most useful assets during many hunts.

### RESEARCH THE EMPLOYER AS MUCH AS THE TARGET

Bounties are only as good as the payout they promise but a contract taken out with a bad employer might not be worth the additional zeroes on the wage amount. Some bounty contracts are not as easy as they read, the employing party having padded the facts to make it seem more attractive to potential hunters. Knowing which bounties are not worth the possible risk, physical or financial, is key to a hunter’s success.

A bounty hunter wants to be sure that he is getting into a contract that will be worth the pay offered. This requires some background checking on both the target and the employing agencies (or individual) if the hunter wants to better comprehend what he is getting involved with. Background checks like these require either a related Contact or a few difficult (–2 DM) Admin, Carouse or Streetwise skill checks.

### BE MINDFUL OF LOCAL LAWS

Bounty hunters find most of their work through local law enforcement agencies, picking up their investigations and fugitive cases directly from the local police. Any hunter that is going to spend a significant time around the judiciary agents of a given location will need to know the ins and outs of their legal codes. The last thing a bounty hunter needs is to pay a hefty amount of fines after they get paid because they did not know the laws of the area.

Sometimes a contract forces a hunter to skirt, bend or break the law to get the job done. They may not be bound to do so by some compelling force but they will if it means getting the bounty and being paid. A hunter that understands the law system of his surroundings can adjust what he can do to alleviate his own guilt or find a loophole to avoid arrest. Knowing the area’s laws well enough to avoid inadvertently breaking them while working a bounty requires a routine (+2 DM) Advocate skill check.

### THE TARGET IS NOT FRIEND OR ENEMY

A hunter that travels a long distance with his quarry will have weeks or even months to spend in close proximity with them. This can lead, especially in the case of charismatic bounties, to social relationships forming between hunter and captive. Some might try to make friends with the hunter, others will try to get the hunter so upset he will make an error and allow them to escape.

It is best for any bounty hunter to segregate his personal feelings from any business relations and to keep emotional responses out of any interactions. This may require the bounty hunter to occasionally succeed in special Persuade skill checks made to remain standoffish and impersonal.

### ALWAYS PREPARE FOR THE WORST SITUATION

Soldiers have a saying, ‘No engagement plan survives contact with the enemy.’ Bounty hunters have a similar adage toward their missions. Every hunter knows that he must have a plan for completing his contracts but also must be aware that external situations will never allow that plan to go unchanged. It is the nature of their job.

Bounty hunters will do well in their career if they enter every contract as if it will go terribly wrong at every given point. It is better to have something and not need it than it is to need something and not have it.

## GETTING STARTED AS A BOUNTY HUNTER

There is a difference between hunting a bounty and becoming a professional bounty hunter. Any capable person can answer the request for a bounty to be tracked and found but only the professionals make a living at it. Hunting the occasional bounty is a good way to earn extra credits; being a full-time bounty hunter takes more dedication.

Someone looking to join the ranks of the bounty hunters needs to accomplish certain goals before they can be taken seriously in the field. An added amount of trust and loyalty to the job is enough to open more doors and employment options, showing the difference between a part-time hunter and a dedicated professional.

The following checklist details what a character can do to avoid negative modifiers on mission payouts. If a character does not meet at least two of the following details they suffer a –2 DM penalty to the Mission Payout roll for any completed Bounty Missions (see later this chapter).

- At least one term in the Bounty Hunter career paths of the  Agent Career.
- Three or more terms in any career paths of the Agent Career.
- A Trust Rating of 2 or higher.
- A Network with a rating of 2 or higher.
- A Cover Identity with an Average rating or higher.
- Streetwise 2 or higher.

A character that meets at least two of these details can advertise themselves as a professional bounty hunter, making the most out of the Bounty Missions they undertake.

Types of Bounties There are three main types of bounties that hunters can choose to fulfil, with each type having its own pros and cons. Bounty hunters can lean toward one type or another if they wish but knowing how to accomplish all three means fewer missed opportunities and a steadier source of income.

Ship tracing is the least hazardous of the bounty hunting assignments but it can be the most skill intensive. The bounty hunter has to locate a specific starship using astrogation charts, jump-plotting software, surveillance avenues and word of mouth. Used to locate hijacked vessels, missing cargo shipments or specific passenger craft, a ship tracing bounty rarely requires the hunter to physically acquire the vessel in question, just locate where it is for others to claim.

BBBOUNTIESOUNTIESOUNTIES

Criminal bounties, the mainstay assignments for theiftakers, are by far the majority of contracts offered in _Traveller_. They are also the most directly dangerous. Depending on the type of criminal the target is and the crime they are wanted for, a bounty hunter might have a difficult fight on his hands when it comes time to capture the target. An otherwise peaceful citizen can be willing to do nearly anything to avoid going to prison, including instigate a deadly battle with their would-be captors. Bail jumpers, runaways and other missing persons technically fall into this category as well; treated in the same fashion as criminals needing to be brought in.

The third type of bounty is rare and not commonly advertised openly

- assassinations. The sort of employer that is willing to put a defined

price on a sentient life does not tolerate failure and only hires the best. Assassination contracts require the hunter to set aside any moral feelings and only think about how he will end his target’s life within the parameters specified by the employer. There is no room for ambiguity or hesitation.

Bounty hunters that specialize in one type of contract over the others have the benefit of getting exceptionally good at fulfilling that one type but will eventually become known only for those missions. A well-known manhunter will stop getting offers to find a lost shuttle, whereas a dedicated tracer will rarely find contracts to track down runaways. Every bounty hunter must make his own decisions but the most successful rarely turn down a job.

Finding and Accepting Bounty Contracts Bounty hunters have two ways to find work – accept an open contract or get approached for a private one. Open contracts are written by employers that do not care who accepts their terms, so long as the contract is fulfilled. Private bounties are far more rare, always pay exceedingly well and require the employer to seek out a specific bounty hunter to make the offer.

OPEN BOUNTIES There may not be any interstellar contracting service to lead bounty hunters to work but each community that has use for them will have a collecting place for contracts. They cannot simply post a list of names and prices for fear that the target will discover their intentions
(if they do not already know) and flee further out of range.

In order to stay somewhat secretive but still efficient about open bounty contracts, a community will arrange for a central agency to hold most of the contract information. This agency will allow aspiring hunters access to files of open bounties but only if they know where and what to ask to do so. This does not require some secret handshake or password, merely the forethought to ask specifically about bounties, contracts and work that can be done. Finding this contracting agency requires either the use of a Contact, Network (any non-Academic) or a Streetwise skill check (–2 DM). Once the bounty hunter knows where to go to find work, it is as easy as signing up for one of the open contracts.

PRIVATE BOUNTIES Only established and (in)famous bounty hunters ever get realistically approached to take on a private bounty contract. The kinds of targets that require private contracts are going to be reserved for those hunters that have reputations that precede them. A hunter that is well known for his past successes can be trusted with these sorts of bounties and the higher wages that come with them.

To be considered for a private contract bounty a character must meet three requirements. They must have reached at least a Rank of 3 in the Bounty Hunter Agent career paths, completed at least five Bounty Missions successfully and have at least one Network at a rating of 1 or higher. If a bounty hunter meets all of these requirements he may always choose to perform a Bounty Mission as a ‘Private Contract’, using the alternate column on the Mission Payout table when successful.

Working the Contract The hunter must get into contact with the employer to accept the terms of a contract if they plan on getting paid for its completion. Once the employer knows the bounty is being worked they can stop seeking other hunters but they are not required to do so. Many employers leave their contracts open to multiple hunters to increase the chances it will be fulfilled. Knowing that a contract might have more bounty hunters working on it should help push them all a little harder; getting the target first is the only way to get paid.

Assigned to a bounty, a hunter should dedicate his time to fulfilling his end of the bargain with acceptable haste. A bounty hunter may have dozens of different ways to fulfil his contracts, varied by the type and difficulty of the bounty. It will be up to the hunter to decide the best approach and execution (sometimes literally) of acquiring his target and fulfilling the terms of the contract.

The following sections of the chapter explain how the different components of bounty contracts function from both a narrative and game mechanics point of view.

### SHIP TRACING

Contracts from employers of a high enough technology level (TL 8+) may include the need to track a target’s route off planet, across a star system or even several jumps away. Unlike following an escaped prisoner’s tracks in the mud or the electronic signature of a data thief, tracking a target across the stars is a great deal more skill intensive.

Ship tracing is the practice of locating a specific vessel or route of a passenger over one or many starship voyages. It requires a good understanding of the space transit system, commercial and private travel methods and knowledge as to where the target was last seen or tracked to. It is not an easy task to track someone travelling anonymously across several star systems but if the money is worth the work a bounty hunter must try to do just that.

The task of tracing a ship’s whereabouts is a matter of knowing the past location of the ship in question, researching the directions it could have travelled to, narrowing down where it might have gone and then investigating those possibilities. The hunter then has to eliminate bad leads until he finds the ship’s location – or past location. More often than not a ship tracer has to use this process several times, following verified paths to new optional routes, which he will then investigate and eliminate. Eventually this process of elimination will leave one avenue of the ship’s journey and hopefully the ship itself.

Starting the Hunt When searching for a specific ship the hunter has the best starting information he can – the ship’s name or designation code. As long as he was not given bad information he can begin looking for that specific ship, where it has been and what might have happened to it. This detail is often part of the employing contract and therefore requires no special research. In some cases, specifically when the hunter is looking for what ship a person travelled on instead of the ship itself, this can be much more difficult.

If the bounty hunter needs to learn the designation and the last location of the ship, any of the following methods in game terms will grant the information:

USE A KNOWLEDGEABLE CONTACT, ALLY OR NETWORK The easiest way to find out the name of a specific vessel to track down is by knowing someone that may have the information. It may cost favours or a bribe but using a Contact, Ally or Network that has roots in the spacefaring industry or is otherwise related to the target being tracked is a sure way to get the information reliably.

TALK TO THE SPACERS AND PILOTS IN THE AREA Not as easy or reliable as using a known informant, a bounty hunter can canvas an area on his own. He can speak to the dockworkers, pilots, outgoing and incoming passengers, spaceport security and other useful fonts of information in order to glean some details on the target in question. A stall clerk might have sold a specific passenger a meal and he remembers the face or perhaps docking staff have a story about the ship the hunter is looking for.

To use this method, the bounty hunter must acquire 18 total Effect using the following skill tasks.

ADMIN _Talk to spaceport management about target:_ 1-6 Hours, Social Standing, Difficult (–2).

CAROUSE _Start useful conversations about target in spaceport common areas:_ 1-6 Hours, Social Standing, Average (+0).

DECEPTION _Lie to spaceport staff to get details about target:_ 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

INVESTIGATE Look for physical clues (ticket stubs, pictures, etc) of target: 10-60 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

PERSUADE Convince spaceport personnel to talk about target: 1-6 Hours, Social Standing, Average (+0).

STREETWISE Talk to local homeless/criminals about target: 1-6 Hours, Intelligence, Average (+0).

SEARCH COMPUTERISED RECORDS Easier to perform for a bounty hunter that has either the permission to do so or the skills to hack the network, searching the computer records of a spaceport can be extremely useful. Poring over lists of passengers, cargo, designation codes and even purchasing receipts is arduous and monotonous but can be quite fruitful. Though time consuming to perform, this sort of investigation is slightly easier to garner useful information than by word of mouth.

To use this method, the bounty hunter must acquire 12 total Effect using the following skill tasks:

ADMIN Get proper passwords to spaceport network: 1-6 Hours, Social Standing, Very Difficult (–4).

COMPUTERS Access necessary listing information data streams on spaceport network: 1-6 Days, Intelligence, Average (+0) if allowed password access; otherwise Difficult (–2).

REMOTE OPERATIONS Tap into and search security and surveillance cameras to find records of target: 1-6 Days, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

SENSORS Tap into spaceport sensing suites to find target designation codes: 10-60 Hours, Intelligence, Difficult (–2).

Once the bounty hunter has the location (or recent location) of the starship he needs to trace in order to acquire his contracted quarry, he must begin the process of narrowing down where it went to next.

Renton, a bounty hunter in search of an AWOL pilot from the Imperial navy on board his missing scout ship, uses his impressive technical skills to hack into the flight base data stream and find everything he needs to know. It takes him several days of software sifting and code hacking but he eventually amasses the 12 Effect in skill successes to know that the pilot’s ship last landed officially at the Beta Serapoln starbase, just a few jumps from where he went missing.

BBBOUNTIESOUNTIESOUNTIES

Chasing Down the Right Path Knowing where a target began his trip into the stars is useful but it will not bring the bounty hunter any closer to his payday on its own. It is where the real investigation begins however; leading the hunter to any number of possible routes the target may have taken from that point. The hunter must now begin to narrow down his search by looking into each and every potential course the target may have taken.

Once the hunter knows where to begin his search for the target ship, he then knows the numerous different jump routes, planetary orbits, station excursions and the like that the ship could have potentially used.

Unlike searching for a starting point, the right path a target ship has taken could always be changing. The bounty hunter has to win a race against time as he eliminates faulty information and unlikely avenues of travel. If he reaches the right conclusion and gets to where the ship had travelled a day too late he will then have to start researching routes all over again but from a different starting location!

In game terms, every ‘leg’ of the ship trace has the potential for the hunter to find his target – if he is fast enough with his research and investigating. This is calculated by the Referee rolling a random time limit that the bounty hunter has to find the correct route, keeping that amount of time secret from the players until they acquire enough successful Effect to know which route to take to follow the target.

Before rolling on the timing table below, the Referee must decide what category the target ship falls into:

- Easily Traced – Easily Traced – Passenger liners, commercial traders, regular-
  route vessels.
- Traceable – Traceable – Private liners, Imperial transit, scout ships within
  Charted Space.
- Difficultly Traced – Difficultly Traced – criminally owned liners, military ships,
  alien vessels.
- Evasive – Evasive – Stolen vessels, raider ships, unregistered
  transports.
- Actively Hidden – Actively Hidden – Enemy (from the local point of view)
  warships, any ship that is aware of the bounty making it a
  target.

Once the ship’s general category is decided, the Referee then rolls 2d6 and consults the table below to determine how long the bounty hunter(s) have before the target moves on to a new destination.

The Referee, having determined how long before the target moves on, must allow the bounty hunter(s) to use their skills, contacts and other ideas to work out where the target went.

The characters can figure out which route is the correct one by collecting Effect from successful skill checks allowed by the Referee. The exact types of skill checks and tasks that the Referee allows are down to the situation and environment. An Admin skill check may not work in a backwater routing station but it would be fine in a commercial transit hub. Streetwise would be all but useless on a military carrier but perfect in a run-down planetary warehouse port.

The Referee has final say as to the difficulty levels of the skill checks the hunter(s) are taking based on how well he believes it would garner any useful information but we encourage most checks to be of an Average or Difficult (–2 DM) challenge level. These checks should take 10 to 60 hours each.

Some bounty hunters will have useful Contacts, Allies or Networks they might want to tap for information as well; requiring the Referee’s approval. For every Contact a character uses for information, 2d6 Effect is gained toward finding the target. Networks also give a gain of 2d6 Effect but the character may re-roll one of the dice if he wishes. Allies grant 1d6+6 Effect when used in this fashion.

The amount of Effect that the bounty hunter(s) must acquire in the secret allotted time limit is based on the previously chosen ship category.

- Easily Traced – Easily Traced – 10 Effect
- Traceable – Traceable – 14 Effect
- Difficultly Traced – Difficultly Traced – 18 Effect
- Evasive – Evasive – 22 Effect
- Actively Hidden – Actively Hidden – 26 Effect

If the character(s) manage to accumulate the listed Effect before the secret time allotment is up, they have tracked down the right route to the target and can get to it in time to interact with it (photograph, capture, and so on) based on the needs of the contract.

If the time runs out before the bounty hunter(s) can gather enough Effect, the target ship has moved on to a new destination. The Referee should _not_ inform the characters that they did not make it in time; instead he should let them arrive to the calculated route to find out that they missed the target by a few days or even hours. If this happens, the Referee returns to the Tracing Timetable and the process of route elimination begins anew.

Eventually the characters should get a favourable timetable roll and manage to find the target in time. If not, perhaps they should be in the market for a new line of work. Ship tracing is obviously _not_ the right career choice for this bounty hunter!

_Continuing our example, Renton has arrived at Beta Serapoln in search of the missing scout ship and its pilot. He immediately begins combing the spacer bars and computer records, even breaking into the local security network to look for license transactions with his ID on them. He makes eight total skill checks (a total of 300 hours; just over 12 days) before reaching the 18 Effect (Difficultly Traced) the Referee claims he needs. He knows where the scout ship is; the Bongol Waystation! When he arrives there however, the Referee laughs and reveals that he rolled 14 days on the timetable and Renton only missed the ship by less than 48 hours! Renton’s player growls his discontent and begins the searching process anew as the Referee secretly rolls another result on the timetable..._

### CRIMINALS

The large majority of bounties placed in _Traveller_ are those classed as ‘criminal bounties’, even though not all of the targets are actually criminals. What the category of criminal bounty actually means is
‘an individual who must be located, captured and returned to the employing agency or individual’. Runaway slaves, bail jumpers, debtors and hardened murderers all fall into this greater category.

Criminal targets are harder to track down on the larger scale because of how easy it is for a single person to blend in with his surroundings and ‘fall off the grid’ if they wish to. Once cornered however, it is much easier to find a face or a description in a city or space station than finding a spaceship in the great void of Charted Space.

Bounty hunters that take on criminal contracts that have travelled offworld will use the Ship Tracing (see earlier in this chapter) rules to find the location of their specific target but then add the additional step of cornering the criminal target somewhere on the planet/space station in order to confront and hopefully capture them.

Cornering the Criminal Target When the bounty hunter knows exactly where his target is, he then has to make sure he approaches the upcoming interaction properly. Moving openly and headlong toward a criminal target is a good way to give away the hunter’s intentions and possibly scare the target into flight. Using stealth, misdirection and good tactical knowledge will result in the target having nowhere to go – and only the bounty hunter to deal with.

In game terms, the bounty hunter must work his way into the perfect interaction with the target before the target moves into a new position. Similar to how ship tracing works, this is calculated by the Referee rolling a secret random time limit in which the hunter(s) must acquire enough successful Effect to set up the interaction with the target.

Before rolling on the timing table below, the Referee must decide what category of criminality the target falls into:

- Non-Criminal – Non-Criminal – Children, runaways, missing civilians.
- Non-Violent – Non-Violent – Embezzlers, petty thieves, the physically unfit or
  infirm.
- Potentially Violent – Potentially Violent – Bail jumpers, trained soldiers, street
  gangers and escaped convicts.
- Violent – Violent – Murderers, formerly violent offenders, Life sentenced
  convicts.
- Dangerously Volatile – Dangerously Volatile – Sociopaths, lunatics, mass murderers.

Once the target’s criminality category is determined, the Referee then rolls 2d6 and consults the table below to determine how long the bounty hunter(s) have before the target moves to a new location.

The Referee, having determined how long before the target moves local hideouts, now gives the bounty hunter(s) a chance to use their skills, Contacts and other ideas to close in on the target and deal with them.

The bounty hunters must then use their skill base to work out the best plan to find and trap the target, earning an amount of Effect from their successes. The characters can use the following skills to corner the target and gain the ability to interact with it on their terms: Carouse, Computers, Investigate, Navigation, Persuade, Sensors, Stealth, Streetwise and Tactics. These skill checks begin at an Average difficulty level and should take 1 to 6 hours each. A character with a Cover Identity can add the bonus of his Cover

Identity’s rating (Weak, Strong, etc) to the Effect of _each_ successful skill check.

Some hunter characters will have useful local Contacts or Allies they might want to tap for good territorial information. For every Contact a character uses for information, 1d6 Effect is gained toward learning the target’s current hideout; Allies grant 1d6+3 Effect instead.

The amount of Effect that the bounty hunter(s) must gain in the secret time limit is based on the previously chosen criminality category.

- Non-Criminal – Non-Criminal – 8 Effect
- Non-Violent – Non-Violent – 12 Effect
- Potentially Violent – Potentially Violent – 16 Effect
- Violent – Violent – 20 Effect
- Dangerously Volatile – Dangerously Volatile – 24 Effect

If the hunter(s) accumulate the listed Effect before the secret time allotment is up, they have successfully cornered the target in a suitable place to initiate an interaction with them. Whether this is a negotiation, conversation, kidnapping or all-out gunfight is down to the bounty hunter, the target and the contract.

If the time runs out before the character(s) gain enough Effect, the target has moved on to a new hideout and might even be made aware the bounty hunter is after them. The Referee should _not_ inform the characters that they did not corner their target successfully; rather he should let them get to the target’s expected location and compare the amount of Effect the hunter was short by on the following table – explaining what the characters find at the target’s previous hideout.

Effect Amount Effect Amount ShortageShortage The Target...The Target... Game EffectsGame Effects 1-3 ...just barely got out in time and did not have time to grab all of their possessions.

The bounty hunter gains 2d6 Effect toward cornering the target on the next set of skill checks. 4-6 ...left behind an important clue.

The target and his allies will attack the bounty hunters when they arrive
(if appropriate).

Eventually the characters will manage to corner the target before he moves on to a new hideout. When that happens the target is then put into a position for the bounty hunter to interact with on his own terms.

_Continuing our previous example, Renton made it to Bongol Waystation and immediately begins planning on how to get the pilot in a place where he can be taken into custody. Renton begins by seeking out other military types and questioning them. His skill checks give excellent results, amassing the 16 Effect quickly in only twenty hours time. The Referee explains that Renton has cornered the pilot in an old safe house and now all he has to do is decide how to bring him in._

Criminal Target Archetypes When a bounty hunter eventually corners his target he will then have to deal with him in whatever way is best for the hunter, the contract and the employer. A target that must be brought in alive cannot be risked by starting a gunfight; a peaceful runaway should not be manhandled, especially if the employer has asked for these things _not_ to happen.

However the bounty hunter wishes to start his target interaction
(conversation, combat, and so on), the following statistic entries will be helpful for the Referee to run these scenes. These are more specific than those found on pages 84-85 in the Traveller Core Rulebook but those templates can be used as criminal targets just as easily.

Runaway Adolescent: Runaway Adolescent: This is a young man or woman that has been living on the run, trying to evade capture for his or her own personal reasons.

Common Missing Person: Common Missing Person: A civilian that has been trying to stay away from his captors and knows how to protect himself.

### ASSASSINATION

The main rule of assassinations is that the target must be dispatched in a very specific way by the chosen bounty hunter, as denoted by the employer in the contract. Some targets must look like they died of natural causes; others might want bloody shows of exploding craniums on public television. It is the employer’s money, so any good assassin will carry out their wishes for the right wages.

Assassination contracts are predominantly private bounties offered to reputable hunters that have earned the title of ‘assassin’ by taking on these murderous jobs in the past. Beginning with easy kills for small payoffs from street gangs and criminal syndicates, a bounty hunter can get his name in the kinds of circles employers go to for a hired killer. Professional assassins are frighteningly good at their job and never work for cheap.

Taking Assassination Contracts Not all bounty hunters have what it takes to be a professional killer. Anyone can earn a few hundred credits for putting a bullet in someone but a true assassin does so while protecting his own assets and the wishes of his employer. It can take years of low-wage deals and hired hits before employers come looking for the bounty hunter with an offer for an assassination bounty.

In order for a bounty hunter character to qualify for private assassination contracts, he must first meet the following requirements:

- Must have purposefully killed at least 5 bounties in the past
  (whether contracted to do so or not) or succeeded in 5 Paid
  Hits (see Bounty Missions for details).

If a bounty hunter character meets these requirements they can choose to take on Assassination Missions (see Bounty Missions later in this chapter) or be approached in game by employers looking to have someone professionally killed.

The Art of Assassination A simple explosion or bullet to the head can kill a target but sometimes the employer wants the target assassinated in specific or detailed ways. This makes things more difficult for the bounty hunter but also allows him to ask for a higher wage.

Whenever a bounty hunter takes on an assassination contract, the Referee should determine whether or not the employers want the killing to have special requirements. About 50% of professional hits have these instructions in order to send messages, avoid prosecution or get a particular brand of revenge upon the target.

If the Referee decides or randomly determines that the contract has special assassination requirements, he should choose or roll on the table below to decide what those requirements are for this contract. Descriptions and game mechanic adjustments of each type of requirement can be found below the table.

2d6 Result2d6 Result Assassination RequirementAssassination Requirement 2 Natural Causes 3-4 Poison 5-6 Blade 7 Public Display 8-9 Accidental Death 10-11 No Remains 12 Explosion/Arson

Natural Causes – Natural Causes – The employer wants the target to seem like he died of completely natural causes; disease, organ failure, cardiac failure, and so on. This will be extremely difficult for the average bounty hunter to accomplish, requiring several very difficult checks of the Medic or Science (biology) skills. If successful however, the assassin may add +3 to the Mission Payout roll.

Poison – Poison – The target must be killed by some kind of poison, normally named by the employer. Delivered orally, injected or maybe in gas form, the target has to die based on this poison. This will likely require Science (chemistry) or Streetwise skill tests to make or acquire the poison. If successful, the assassin may add +2 to the Mission Payout roll.

Blade – Blade – The employer wants the target to die as a result of one or more stabbing, slashing or rending wounds. This will require the

BBBOUNTIESOUNTIESOUNTIES

assassin to get close to the target and deliver the blows in melee range. There is a +1 bonus to the Mission Payout roll for achieving this.

Public Display – Public Display – The target must be killed in a violent and public manner, in front of as many witnesses as possible. There is no bonus to the Mission Payout but the assassin can re-roll any ‘1’ result instead.

Accidental Death – Accidental Death – The employer wants the target’s death to look like an accident. Car accidents, equipment failures and similar situations can be arranged for with the Engineer or Mechanic skills, perhaps using Deception or Stealth to ensure the death takes place at the right moment. This will add +2 to the Mission Payout roll.

No Remains – No Remains – The employer does not care at all how the target dies, just that no bodily remains ever resurface. The assassin may use special equipment or ingenuity to make this happen, earning a +2 bonus to the Mission Payout if they succeed.

Explosion/Arson – Explosion/Arson – The target is to be blown to bits or burnt to a cinder, preferably in his own home or workplace. This can inflict serious collateral damage and potentially injure non-contracted lives, requiring difficult Explosives skill rolls to ensure the target dies without flattening the neighborhood in the process. A successful assassin will add +2 to his Mission Payout roll and re-roll any natural ‘1’ results.

### BOUNTY MISSIONS

We encourage Referees to use actual gaming sessions to narrate their Player Character’s bounty hunting escapades using the methods detailed in the rest of this chapter, but some mixed-career _Traveller_ groups might not find the time to do so. In order to give bounty hunter characters the same fast-track mission options as we have for Espionage and Corporate-based Agents, this section reveals another version of the quick format for missions based on bounty hunters.

How to Generate a Bounty Mission The Referee should walk the agent going on the mission through the following steps in order:

- Decide Mission Type
- Determine Difficulty of Mission
- Determine Agent Success/Failure
- Determine Mission Payout if Successful; otherwise Determine
  Failure Mishap

Decide Mission Type Unlike most other types of Agent missions, bounty hunting is rarely a random assignment. In this system the bounty hunter character is allowed to choose from the following list of Bounty Mission types, instead of rolling randomly. Note that only a character that qualifies for Assassination Missions may choose them.

Each of the Mission Types is defined in short by a group of three listed skills. The bounty hunter will need to take each of these skill checks (in any order) in addition to a special skill check using his Intelligence DM and the level of one of his Cover Identities as modifiers. The total Effect of these checks will be used later to determine the success or failure of the mission.

There is a dice modifier listed in parenthesis for these mission types
(except Assassination); this is the inherent Mission Payout modifier to that type of Bounty Mission. Assassination Missions base their modifier on any special target-based circumstances (see The Art of Assassination above).

Ship Trace, Locate: Ship Trace, Locate: This is a mission based on finding the current location of a specific vessel. The bounty hunter will be using Astrogation, Computers and Investigate. (–1 DM)

Ship Trace, Capture: Ship Trace, Capture: This is a mission that requires the character to find and capture a starship currently abroad. The bounty hunter will be using Astrogation, Engineering and Gun Combat. (+1 DM)

Criminal, Locate: Criminal, Locate: This bounty will pay for the hunter to find the exact location of a specific criminal. The character will be using Investigate, Persuade and Streetwise. (–1 DM)

Criminal, Capture: Criminal, Capture: This mission sends the character after a specific criminal target to be found, captured and turned in to the employing agency or individual. The bounty hunter will be using Investigate, Melee and Stealth. (+1 DM)

Criminal, Dead-or-Alive: Criminal, Dead-or-Alive: This bounty places the character on the trail of a criminal target that has been labelled as a potential threat; enough to allow for his death. As long as the bounty hunter returns with the body, alive or not, he will get paid. The bounty hunter will be using Deception, Gun Combat and Stealth. (+0 DM)

Criminal, Paid Hit: Criminal, Paid Hit: This bounty mission is a simple affair of finding and killing the target for his crimes against the employer. The agent will be using Gun Combat, Melee and Stealth. (+0 DM)

Assassination: Assassination: Reserved only for tested and well-known assassins, this mission is a professional hit placed upon a sentient target, criminal or not. The bounty hunter will need to use Gun Combat, Stealth and Tactics.

Determine Difficulty of Mission The following table shows how difficult each type of mission will be for the bounty hunter to accomplish. This is measured in a total amount of Effect the agent character will have to generate from his successful skill and Cover Identity checks (based on the Mission Type, above) during the Mission.

The Referee should roll 1d6 or choose on the following table to determine how difficult the agent’s mission will be in terms of

Effect necessary. Bounty hunters with a Trust rating of 2 or less will add +1 to the die roll, whereas a Trust of 4 or higher may subtract –1 if they choose to do so. The difficulty may or may not have a modifier to the Mission Payout if successful, as detailed on a secondary table below.

Bounty Mission DifficultyBounty Mission Difficulty Mission Payout ModifierMission Payout Modifier Training Level –3 DM Very Easy –2 DM Easy –1 DM Routine — Medium — Challenging +1 DM Difficult +2 DM Arduous +3 DM

Determine Agent Success/Failure Once the bounty hunter has determined how difficult the Bounty Mission will be to complete, he must then attempt all three of the skill checks listed in the Mission Type category along with the special Cover Identity check. These checks are made at the standard 8+ difficulty, with the skill checks modified with any reasonable characteristic. The Cover Identity check is made with Intelligence as a modifier.

For example, a clever bounty hunter working a Dead-or-Alive Criminal bounty may attempt to modify his Deception and Stealth rolls using his high Education modifier. He does this reasonably by saying that he has practiced and memorised the passwords to several criminal taverns (Deception) and wants to use his knowledge of the noisy local mass transit system to cover his footsteps (Stealth). His Cover Identity is rated as Strong (+1) and his Intelligence has a +1 modifier as well, giving him a total +2 DM on the obligatory Cover Identity check to help him blend in with the locals long enough to get his prey in his sights.

Once all of these checks are rolled and the total Effect is calculated, the bounty hunter checks his total against the amount required by the Mission Difficulty.

If the total is equal to or more than the amount required, the mission is a success and the bounty hunter may now Determine Mission Payout.

If the total is less than what is required for success however, the bounty hunter has failed and must instead roll upon the Failure Mishap table (or Assassination Mishap table); subtracting –1 for each point of Effect they scored lower than the required amount for success.

8 The target writes a letter to the media about you and your bounty hunting business; lower all of your Cover Identity levels by one stage (minimum of Weak rating).
9 A competing bounty hunter barely beats you to the target and you react unprofessionally; gain a new Rival or turn an existing Rival into an Enemy.
10 You endanger one of your allied informants in order to get to the target; turn a Contact or Informant into an Enemy. Gain a Rival if you do not have any Contacts or Informants.
11+ The bounty contract was cancelled by the employer, who forgot to inform you before you went as far as you did. You do not get paid but you gain +1 Trust.

Assassination missions that go wrong have graver consequences, requiring them to have their own abbreviated Mishap table for those unlucky professional killers to roll upon when they fail in their contracts.

# AGENT TECHNOLOGY

This chapter details equipment and vehicles specific to the agent career.

## TECHNOLOGICAL PROTOTYPES

Agents in _Traveller_ that work with certain agencies will come in contact with new and potentially powerful devices. They might have stolen an untested product from a corporate research lab, been given a device to do field research upon or tasked with smuggling unique software to an employer’s mainframe. Agents are constantly exposed to these technological prototypes in their line of work.

A prototype is a new or improved piece of technology that an agent comes into contact with for a variety of reasons based on their employer’s wishes. Exactly what the prototype does or what the employer wants done with it depends on the situation.

This section details a quick system for Referees to design prototype pieces of technology. This creates devices that can be used in Agent missions or other _Traveller_ scenarios.

Referees can create a prototypical piece of technology through a series of random dice rolls applied on the following tables.

Step One – Determine the Technology Type The Referee must roll or choose on the following table what type of equipment the prototype device is. This will determine the general form the prototype will take; the exact nature of the device should be decided by the Referee.

d66d66 Technological TypeTechnological Type 11-13 Weapons 14-16 Armor 21-23 Tools 24-26 Electronics 31-33 Medical 34-36 Drugs 41-43 Communications 44-46 Computers 51-53 Software 54-56 Robotics 61-63 Augments 64-66 Psionics

Weapons: Weapons: All melee, personal and support firearms, including energy weaponry. Armor: Armor: All shields, armor and other protective devices. Tools: Tools: All field kits, career-based equipment and skill-related gear. Electronics: Electronics: Basic electronics packages, tools and hardware.

Medical: Medical: All first aid, surgical and medical-grade pharmaceutical equipment. Drugs: Drugs: All non-medical chemicals, narcotics and combat stimulants. Communications: Communications: All sensors and electronic communication devices. Computers: Computers: All computer hardware. Software: Software: All computer software, data packages and programs. Robotics: Robotics: All drones androids and self-contained robotic equipment. Augments: Augments: All bionics, cybernetics and bodily-augmenting devices. Psionics: Psionics: All equipment based on the use or effect of psionic abilities.

Step Two – Determine the Prototype’s Distinction The Referee must roll or choose on the following table as to what makes the prototype equipment new or unique. This will determine how the prototype is different from other pieces of technology in the same type category.

RollRoll Prototype DistinctionPrototype Distinction 1 Characteristic Reduction 2 Characteristic Increase 3 Skill Penalty 4 Skill Bonus 5 Extensive Damage Potential 6 Special Ability

Characteristic Reduction/Increase: Characteristic Reduction/Increase: The prototype somehow reduces or increases a base Characteristic of either the user or a given target.

Skill Penalty/Bonus: Skill Penalty/Bonus: The prototype either imposes a Skill penalty to a specific target or grants a bonus to one or more of the user’s Skills.

Extensive Damage Potential: Extensive Damage Potential: Something about the prototype gives it the ability to inflict heavy damage upon targets when used.

Special Ability: Special Ability: The prototype has the ability to grant otherwise unheard of powers, effects or skills to the user of the device.

Step Three – Determine the Prototype’s Power Level The Referee must roll or choose on the following table to determine how powerful the prototype’s will be. This will affect the financial worth of the item, noted on the table below as a modifier to the Prototype Value roll (see below).

RollRoll Prototype Power LevelPrototype Power Level Prototype Value DMPrototype Value DM 1 Menial –2 (minimum 0) 2 Mundane –1 (minimum 0) 3 Moderate +0 4 Strong +0 5 Impressive +1 6 Unbelievable +2

The power level of the prototype will be instrumental in figuring out exactly what the device does for its user.

Step Four – Decide the Prototype’s Effects Now knowing what power level the prototype device is supposed to have, the Referee can decide what the device does for the user. This is a somewhat generic description, allowing the Referee to come up with the specifics to best fit his own game setting.

The Effects table shows examples for each of the Prototype Distinctions at the Power Levels possible for any device. These are not the only effects that a prototype could have; we encourage Referees to come up with their own to work within their own games.

#### STEP FIVE – DETERMINE THE PROTOTYPE’S VALUE

The Referee must roll or choose on the following table to determine how much prototype is actually worth on the open market. This is what the device would sell for if the Agent found a neutral party to purchase it.

1d6 Result1d6 Result Prototype ValuePrototype Value 0 Between 1,000-5,000 Credits 1 Between 5,001-10,000 Credits 2 Between 10,001-20,000 Credits 3 Between 20,001-50,000 Credits 4 Between 50,001-100,000 Credits 5 Between 100,001-500,000 Credits 6 Between 500,001-999,999 Credits 7 Between 1 million to 10 million Credits 8 Priceless – upwards of 1 billion Credits

##### STEALTH EQUIPMENT

Agents oftentimes must try to perform their activities without others seeing, hearing, sensing or knowing that they have done so. They rely on their training and skills but every good agent will know that better equipment can make all the difference.

This section is devoted to a number of new pieces of technology aimed directly at being stealthy or dealing with those occasions when an agent cannot avoid detection.

Weaponry and Related Equipment Firearm Sound-Baffle (TL12): Firearm Sound-Baffle (TL12): An electronic device fitted to the barrel of a firearm, the sound-baffle emits the exact opposite wavelength of sound that the report of the weapon being fired causes. This reduces the sound the weapon makes to a dull ‘click’. A sound- baffled weapon imposes a –6 DM on attempts to detect to locate it using sound. Cr. 500. Sound-baffles for one weapon are not interchangeable with different types; one must be pur chased for each specific model of weapon.

Laser Pistol, Invisibeam (TL12): Laser Pistol, Invisibeam (TL12): Using special lenses and computerised goggles to aim with the output, the Invisibeam technology creates a completely visually undetectable streak of coherent light. This grants the firer a +4 DM bonus to Stealth checks for the purposes of hiding where an attack comes from. The weapon is still dependent on a bulky belt power pack, which costs Cr. 1,000 and weighs 2kg and is good for 75 shots.

Laser Rifle, Invisibeam (TL12): Laser Rifle, Invisibeam (TL12): This is a rifle version of the standard Invisibeam Laser Pistol. The power pack (Cr. 2500, 2kg) is slightly lighter than that of the standard laser rifle.

Needeletto (TL7):Needeletto (TL7): A reinforced but thin metal ‘needle’ used for precision killing strikes. Needelettos have no edge but have a very sharp point with an angled tip for severing nerves and arteries. Non-rigid armor (such as jack, cloth, mesh and the like) is not very effective against a needeletto; their value is halved (rounding down). The Effect of this weapon is always considered to be one point higher for the purposes of damage.

Vocal Trigger (TL10): Vocal Trigger (TL10): Attached to any firearm of TL8 or higher, the vocal trigger is an electronic counter-safety that allows agents to ‘tell’ their weapon to fire even if the trigger cannot be depressed or the weapon’s safety is engaged. It is coded to a specific three-word phrase and tone of voice, making it very difficult (–4 DM) to mimic. It also only works in a speaking tone up to twelve metres away; not a shouted command or a whisper. Cr. 750. Vocal triggers for one weapon are not interchangeable with different types; one must be pur chased for each specific model of weapon.

Armor and Armor Components Stealth Bodyglove, Armored (TL10):Stealth Bodyglove, Armored (TL10): A protective bodyglove worn to cushion against impacts and potentially deflect low calibre rounds, this armor is designed to help blend into shadows and undergrowth equally well, adding a +2 bonus to all Stealth skill checks in darkness and foliage.

X-Ray Chameleon (TL11): X-Ray Chameleon (TL11): This technology can be applied to any vacc suit, combat environment suit, combat armor, powered armor or battle dress. Thin layers of inert radioactive materials shield the wearer from appearing on X-ray scanners, scopes or goggles. This baffles X-ray based detection and tracking systems, imposing a –4 DM on attempts to discover or track the wearer with that technology. Cr. 3,000.

Field Equipment Compact Communication Suite (TL10): Compact Communication Suite (TL10): A special communications transmitter/receiver set that is worn inside the mouth and ear. Fastened around a rear tooth, the transmitter is triggered by the user clenching his teeth and then whispering barely audibly. This allows the user to keep a communication range of 3 kilometres without worrying about giving away his position, adding a +2 DM to Stealth skill checks for these purposes. Cr. 750.

Holographic Decoy (TL9): Holographic Decoy (TL9): This small and easily hidden projector creates intermittent flickers of holographic movement throughout a nine-metre area that can be seen for over a hundred metres, attracting attention to that area and away from the user. An active holographic decoy will add a +4 DM to Stealth skill checks within fifty metres but not within nine of the projector. Cr. 800.

Intrusion Kit (TL5+): Intrusion Kit (TL5+): This is a collection of useful tools and implements used to break into locked perimeters. Lock picks, hinge grease, glass cutters and the like make breaking and entering much easier, granting a +1 DM bonus to all skill checks pertaining to intrusion into a building, plus an additional +1 DM for every two technology levels higher the kit is compared to the building it is being used upon. Cr. 50 multiplied by the technology level of the kit.

Rope, Dissolving (TL9): Rope, Dissolving (TL9): This rope is chemically adjusted to melt away into an alcohol-based fluid after one hour of being spooled out of its container. 10m of this corded material can hold up to 175 kilograms before breaking. Cr. 150.

Sensor Goggles (TL7): Sensor Goggles (TL7): Special polarised lenses with alternating filament currents running through them, these goggles are used

for seeing the otherwise invisible beams of motion sensors and IR trackers. Wearing the sensor goggles add a +2 DM to any skill checks made to avoid security systems that use these components. Cr. 1,000.

Medical Equipment Body Stall Injector (TL8): Body Stall Injector (TL8): This one-use, disposable syringe contains a potent toxin that renders the recipient’s bodily functions and bio- electric activity to almost nothing for several hours. Taking effect in 1d6 minutes after being injected, just one dose will put the recipient in a deathlike state for 3d6 hours. During this state it requires a Difficult (–2 DM) Medic check or a similar procedure to sense life in the body. One dose costs Cr. 500.

Chemi-Mute (TL6): Chemi-Mute (TL6): Stored in a chewable gelatine capsule, this disgusting chemical robs the imbiber of any use of his vocal chords for 3d6 days. This is useful for an operative that has been caught by the enemy and needs to ensure that he cannot be forced to leak information via truth serums and torture. A set of five capsules is Cr. 250.

Personal Augments Camodermis (TL10): Camodermis (TL10): This is a layer of image-altering fibres inserted into the epidermis to break up the distinctive outline of the individual. Camodermis imposes a –2 DM to see or hit the individual at ranges of Long or greater, as long as they are in some kind of cover. Camodermis can be defeated by any infrared or other detection systems that operate beyond the normal visual spectrum. Cr. 40,000.

Subdermal Sensor Shielding (TL11):Subdermal Sensor Shielding (TL11): Adds a mesh of reactive fibres to the skin similar to those used in IR chameleonic armors, giving the character a natural version of the same kind of stealth-increasing attributes. This imposes a –2 DM on attempts to detect or track the wearer with infra-red sensors. Subdermal sensor shielding stacks with armor but not other types of subdermal armor. Cr. 25,000.

Technoscramble Emitter (TL11): Technoscramble Emitter (TL11): A wired transmitter that runs down the spinal cord, the technoscramble emitter amplifies nerve impulse energy into a wavelength discordant to those used by radio receivers. Any radio-based device of a technology level 10 within 30 metres or less is jammed by the emitter, imposing –6 DM on all skill checks using the device. The emitter is not an optional device, as it cannot be turned off once implanted. Cr. 75,000.

##### SPECIALIST AGENT EQUIPMENT

There is much more to the Agent career paths than sneaking around and trying not to get caught; this section is devoted to numerous pieces of equipment that can help characters perform a variety of tasks. This equipment is divided by Agent career paths but it could be obtained and used by any Traveller character.

Law Enforcement Bullhorn Helm (TL8): Bullhorn Helm (TL8): An armored helmet with an electronic face grille used to amplify the wearer’s voice in the same way that a bullhorn does, allowing a police officer to project his voice with added authority. The wearer of this helmet can be heard clearly for 200 metres, gaining a +1 DM on all Persuade and Leadership rolls to targets within half that distance. 5 kg, Cr. 200.

Charged Shield (TL11): Charged Shield (TL11): A new version of the standard riot shield. A charged shield is an advanced riot shield with a grid of conduits built onto its surface. These are powered by a small backpack which has 20 ‘power points’ available before needing to be recharged at any central recharging station. If anything crosses more than one of the sensitive wires, it erupts in a powerful burst of electricity. This costs 1 power point per burst and inflicts 1d6+2 Stun damage upon any target struck with the shield or anyone that strikes the shield with a metallic melee weapon (see page 101 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ for rules on stun weapons). Attacks that hit will fall on the shield on 8+; its armor value is 8.

Cyberstunner (TL12): Cyberstunner (TL12): One of the most frightening suspects a peace officer has to deal with is one that has been heavily augmented with cybernetics. The cyberstunner is a modified stun carbine that is keyed to affect the advanced neurotransmitters that are used to connect a living being with its cybernetics. When a hit is scored upon a target, roll 1d6 (2d6 if the target has subdermal augments) – if this is greater than the target’s armor rating, the stun effect is rolled. The stun damage is doubled against a cybernetically augmented target.

Law Enforcement Package (TL8): Law Enforcement Package (TL8): This is the standard Law Enforcement Agent equipment package that comes with several different and useful items. It includes: a Flak Jacket (TL7), standard collar-mounted Commdot, Stunstick, Autopistol with two magazines (standard ammunition) or Stunner (TL8) and two Smoke Grenades. Total cost is Cr. 500.

Nausea Baton (TL8): Nausea Baton (TL8): The so-called ‘sick stick’ looks like a light security baton but with a luminescent tip that produces a specific wavelength of vibration that froths and curdles stomach acid upon contact. In addition to the normal damage, 1d6+1 stun damage is delivered to any unarmored target from stomach cramps and vomiting. The baton’s generator takes 1d6+1 rounds to recharge after this but the baton can still be used as a club in this period.

Scan Baton (TL9): Scan Baton (TL9): Used primarily by customs agents to verify the contents of cargo containers, the scan baton is a handheld electronic chemical sweeper that can be programmed to look for an assortment of chemicals, drugs or explosives. Using the baton adds a +4 DM bonus to the Investigate skill check to search for contraband. 1kg. Cr. 150.

Investigator Autocam (TL7): Autocam (TL7): This high resolution, perfect zoom camera is a private detective’s best choice for setting up an investigative stakeout. With a successful Routine Sensors skill test the camera can be programmed to take pictures in specific intervals, allowing the character to make Investigate skill checks regularly despite being elsewhere. Cr. 150.

Code Turner Software (TL9): Code Turner Software (TL9): A complex program that turns defensive software programs against themselves to create a viewable ‘window’ through the code; making computerised information gathering far easier. The drawback to this form of program is that it only works as a viewer – no data may be transmitted or downloaded while the code turner is on. This adds a +2 DM bonus to the Computers skill when dealing with an actively defended network or data stream. Cr. 5,000.

DNA Sampler/Storage Kit (TL8): DNA Sampler/Storage Kit (TL8): This is a small handgun-like device that takes a cubic millimetre of living tissue from anything the muzzle is pushed against when the trigger is depressed. It is used by investigators to take and keep DNA samples bottled and logged for all justice casework. The kit automatically seals every sample in a small test tube and labels them based on what is keyed into the handle. Cr. 500.

Holographic Disguise Generator (TL12): Holographic Disguise Generator (TL12): An undercover agent’s best friend, the HDG is a very complex device made up of projector wrist cuffs, anklets, a waistband and a collar. These devices are wirelessly keyed in to a central data node that resembles a handheld communicator. The node is programmed with a three-dimensional image of a person (requiring a Computers skill check), which it emits through the projectors as a full-body image. This grants the wearer a +6 DM to Deception skill checks for the purposes of visual disguises. The holograph is not tangible and any physical contact will cause the image to flicker – getting rid of the bonus for any who see. Cr. 10,000.

Neural Flash (TL16): Neural Flash (TL16): Used only when an undercover agent is caught in a situation that could be actionable for he or his employer, the neural flash is a small one-use device similar to a data pen or stylus. When activated, the neural flash emits an intense psionic pulse that erases the last 2d6 hours from the minds of anyone within nine metres who sees the device when it is activated. Those affected can pass a Very Difficult (–4 DM) Athletics (endurance) skill check to shrug off most of the effects, reducing the length of time to 2d6 minutes. Unauthorized use of a neural flash is an offence punishable by a steep prison sentence. Cr. 25,000.

Spy Acidic Lockpick (TL5+): Acidic Lockpick (TL5+): Used only in cases where access is more important than secrecy, the acidic lockpick is a thin glass tube attached to a refillable latex bulb of acid. The tube is inserted into any mechanical tumbler-based lock (TL7 or less) and the bulb rapidly squeezed to spray the acid into the workings of the lock. This softens the tumblers and springs before fusing them together into one mass of metallic sludge, allowing the spy to force the lock open with ease. The tumblers will be softened in 1d6x30 seconds, allowing an Athletics (strength) check with a +6 DM modifier to open the lock. The lock parts will re-solidify in 1d6+3 minutes after application however, making the mechanism permanently stuck in its state at the time (locked/unlocked, closed/open). Cr. 50.

Facelift Mask (TL8): Facelift Mask (TL8): A masterly crafted prosthetic mask created by a computerised image system, the facelift mask is a one-use application that perfectly adheres to the face of the wearer, effectively creating

a second skin that bears a different visage. The mask is made from organic compounds and materials, making it almost undetectable by sight, touch or even taste. The facelift mask grants a +6 DM bonus to all Deception skill checks to hide the wearer’s features or mimic the features of the one whose image was used to create the mask. The organic compounds are time sensitive however and a facelift mask will begin to deteriorate rapidly after 2d6x5 hours after being removed from its airtight storage package. Removing the mask from one’s face at any time will invariably tear some of its sensitive fibres, ruining it prematurely. Cr. 5,000.

Magnetic Intrusion Gear (TL9): Magnetic Intrusion Gear (TL9): This is a set of gloves and foot pads that contain extremely powerful electromagnets in the shape of rollers and gripping points on their palms and soles. When activated, the magnetic fields hold up to 175kg of weight against any ferrous metallic surface. The roller points allow the wearer to move, although slowly, while adhered (1.5 metres per significant action). The magnetic intrusion gear adds a +2 DM to climbing-based Athletics skill checks on a metallic surface, as well as granting the ability described above. Cr. 750.

Pocket Scrambler (TL10): Pocket Scrambler (TL10): A powerful transmission scrambler fitted into a small ovoid roughly the size and shape of a bar of soap. The pocket scrambler emits a constant cacophony of feedback and noise into most radio frequencies within 50 metres. It only functions for up to one half-hour per battery charge but any unsecured radio networks (such as the communications between security guards) will be extremely difficult to use (–4 DM to skill checks) during that time. Cr. 500.

Whisperkill Pistol (TL11): Whisperkill Pistol (TL11): An amazingly powerful sidearm that is surprisingly small, light and extremely quiet. The Whisperkill is a small, twin-barrelled slug pistol with one shot per silenced barrel. Like all suppressed or silenced weapons, the Whisperkill imposes a
–4 DM on attempts to locate it using sound. The weapon can either be fired as two single shots or a single powerful attack using both barrels. This second firing mode uses the damage and recoil values listed in the parenthesis.

Analyst Auto-Destruct Security Case (TL7): Auto-Destruct Security Case (TL7): This is a specialized metal case used to transport documents and other important items without fear they may land in enemy hands. The case has miniature explosive devices wired throughout its interior, which are rigged to the locking and hinge mechanisms. If anyone tries to pry, cut or otherwise open the case without putting in the six-digit code first, the explosives detonate into the case, rendering anything inside to ash and flakes of shrapnel. The explosion is harmless to anything outside the case when it is closed; but act as a fragmentation grenade if they

detonate while the case is open. The locks are considered Very Difficult to bypass and the explosive devices Formidable (–6 DM). If ever used as cover, the security case is worth 3 points of armor. 2kg; Cr. 500.

Displacement Barrier (TL13): Displacement Barrier (TL13): It is hardest for security and bodyguards to protect their employer from the single surprising shot made by a distant sniper. The displacement barrier is a semi-mobile sheet of advanced translucent polymers that are woven with several layers of useful technology. The primary use for the barriers is that visual images seen through them are shifted by nearly a half-metre, making it impossible for shooting attacks to successfully Aim at the target
(aiming in any form is automatically nullified). A self-polarising element in the barrier activates as soon as any projectile moving at least as fast as a thrown object strikes the polymer pane, blackening it immediately to a one-way opaqueness to grant complete cover to anyone behind it. A displacement barrier can be set up on its stand in 1d6 minutes, covering a 90 degree angle. These devices are designed to be used in multiples, offering better all-round protection and can be networked easily for all polymer panes to blacken when one is triggered. 25kg; Cr. 2,000.

Dual-Holo Projection Suite (TL12): Dual-Holo Projection Suite (TL12): This pair of advanced wrist cuffs are worn by a diplomat and his bodyguard and are linked to a central imaging projector located somewhere between them. While worn and active, the projection suite casts a visually perfect hologram of each cuff’s wearer upon the body of the _other_ cuff’s wearer. This means that anyone trying to target what they believe to be the diplomat will actually be targeting the bodyguard. This item reduces Investigate skill checks by –4 DM to see through the images. Cr. 1,000 per suite.

Protec Suit, Advanced (TL11):Protec Suit, Advanced (TL11): An enhanced version of the standard slim-fitting business suit, this protective armor is commonly used by political agents or socialite bodyguards. Can be worn under other types of armor.

Testimonial Drone (TL12): Testimonial Drone (TL12): This floating drone is a combination legal advisory library, holo-recorder, audio storage system and visual image projector. It is very useful for any political officer, as it comes as standard with the Admin/2, Advocate/2 and Language/2 programs. There are a number of other minor things that the testimonial drone can do that make it useful:

- Simultaneously record up to twenty-four hours of audio and
  visual information.
- Project a three-dimensional playback of its recordings at 1/15th
  its normal size.
- Translate incoming text or audio information into its

programmed languages with a 0.05 second delay.

- Convert spoken language into text file format as quickly as it
  is received.

The drone is plain, matte black in colour and levitates at head level of its owner at all times, normally within six metres. Cr. 15,000.

Corporate Chameleon Uniform (TL9): Chameleon Uniform (TL9): A simple set of clothing that has been patterned after any type of suit, uniform or other pattern. A chameleon uniform is an easy way for a corporate spy to vanish into the crowd when his mission is done. The uniform has a hidden button in one of the cuffs that sends a light current through the cloth, drastically altering its colour and pattern in seconds. This can be used to turn a normal set of clothing into a corporate uniform or vice-versa with a minor action and 1d6 seconds. Cr. 750.

Data-Corer (TL8): Data-Corer (TL8): A malicious item used by corporate agents sent on data-destruction missions, the data-corer is a handheld electronic device that resembles a pistol with no barrel. When the trigger is pulled the device emits a short-ranged (1.5 metres) cone of intense electromagnetic and microwave pulses. This does very little to its environment but will invariably wipe out or corrupt all computer data on storage systems within that cone. The erasure is powerful and extremely difficult to repair, requiring a total of 30 Effect on a Formidable level Computers skill checks. A side benefit of the data- corer’s effect is the ability to inflict 1d6 damage on any cybernetically augmented target caught in the area of effect as well, ignoring armor. Firing the data-corer is a significant action and it can be used for ten pulses before needing to be recharged. Cr. 1,000.

Networking Adhesion Modem (Hacktape) (TL10): Networking Adhesion Modem (Hacktape) (TL10): A flat, 5cm piece of molecularly adhesive plastic containing a web of sensitive broadcasting filaments. Any computer the hacktape is stuck directly to (no more than six centimetres barrier between the tape and circuitry) is considered to be in direct networked connection with another pre-programmed computing device. The hacktape has a linking range of only 30 metres. This expensive and advanced computer accessory was originally designed to allow technicians to monitor vehicular computers without having to take the vehicle offline to do so. The technology has fallen into the hands of data- hackers and now is used to make stealthy connections to corporate networks without having to maintain a hard-link. Cr. 5,000.

Surveillance-Hub Helmet Rig (TL8): Surveillance-Hub Helmet Rig (TL8): Keeping good security at expansive corporate grounds with several square kilometres to cover can be difficult. Setting up dozens of surveillance cameras can help increase video coverage but still requires personnel to monitor them.

This enclosed helmet rig allows for up to fifty different surveillance cameras to be wired into the viewing HUD of the helmet, and the wearer may flip through the channels, zooming in and saving certain images with the press of a button on the requisite glove-set. While wearing this rig decreases the user’s local perception-based skill tests by –2 DM, it increases all video-based checks by +2 DM. 5 kg; Cr. 500.

Bounty Hunter Foam Grenade (TL8): Foam Grenade (TL8): This is a non-lethal concussive delivery system of rapidly-expanding oxygenated foam. The foam is thick and dense, making movement difficult while not impeding breathing. When used, the grenade fills a 3m-cubed area with the dense foam, which becomes stringy and thick in the round following. This substance is similar to what is fired from a web rifle (see below) but is not as viscous or physically limiting. Anything caught in the grenade’s area must pass an Athletics (strength) skill check to wipe away the foam before it thickens. Those that fail move at half speed and suffer a –2 DM penalty to all Dexterity-based skill checks for 2d6 minutes, until the foam evaporates. Foam grenades may be fired from all common grenade and RAM launchers.

Jump Filters (TL11): Jump Filters (TL11): A very expensive hardware and software kit attached to any starship or satellite sensor suite, jump filters allow the sensor package to look for very specific element traces in space. Seeking the remnants of used fuel and a broken jump envelope, the jump filters add a +4 DM bonus to the sensor operator’s skill check to discover where a ship jumped from and potentially the route it

may have taken. This is very useful for ship tracers and using jump filters to track a vessel automatically adds 2d6 Effect to the total needed to find a vessel if the rules for Ship Tracing are being used. Cr. 250,000.

Mind-Brig (TL15): Mind-Brig (TL15): An expensive and powerful detainment device used by high-end bounty hunters only, the mind-brig is a centimetre- wide circlet of a golden alloy speckled with neuron-sensitive crystal nodes. While the circlet is placed around the head (or other brain- containing area) of a living being, it nullifies the ability to make conscious thought. This effectively ‘turns off’ the wearer, allowing a hunter to move his bounty freely without fear of it escaping, fighting or even talking. Beings with a Psi characteristic may attempt to pass a 10+ Psi test (adding in their strongest Psion skill rating) to fight the mind-brig; success overloads the sensitive crystals and breaks the mind-brig. Cr. 100,000.

Stun-Cuffs (TL8): Stun-Cuffs (TL8): Effective methods for hunters to keep their bounties under control, stun-cuffs are sometimes viewed as sadistic or cruel. A target placed in stun-cuffs is detained in the same way as normal handcuffs or shackles but is administered a powerful stunning shock if he attempts to pull the cuffs taught for any reason. This automatically inflicts 1d6+1 Stun damage to the wearer. Stun-cuffs can inflict 100 of these charges before the battery needs replacing and are considered Very Difficult to remove without the proper key code. Cr. 200.

Web Rifle (TL10): Web Rifle (TL10): A large and intimidating weapon that hurls an expanding sphere of extremely viscous material, the web rifle is used to bring down hostile targets without worrying about lethal force. Anything successfully shot by a web rifle must pass an Athletics
(strength) skill check each round in order to perform any actions. The ‘web’ fluid lasts for 2d6 minutes before it becomes brittle and easily removed. Webbed targets move at half speed and suffer a –2 DM penalty to all Dexterity-based skill checks.

Jester-Class Covert Operations Fighter Designed originally by a genius in the space-aerodynamics industry, the _Jester_ -class fighter is a fast, stealthy and sleek ship that can be used to zip in and out of dangerous situations while on spying missions. This fighter is thin, flat and very fast for the amount of firepower it contains. Its twin lasers make short work of surveillance satellites and sensor drones; a spacefaring spy’s hated enemy. Its principal drawback is that it is so expensive that it very rarely (if at all) seen outside of covert operations.

Prisoner Ferry Prison planets or Imperial detention centres will occasionally need to take prisoners from one facility to another. They can do so with ease and safety through the use of prisoner ferry vessels. This ship is a favourite of prolific bounty hunters, who can fill their brig with multiple bounties at once to deliver them across long distances. The crew consists of a captain, pilot, navigator, 2 engineers, 3 gunners and 4 security guards. Prisoners are usually carried in low berths, although for short trips (or less scrupulous operators) additional cabin space is available for more prisoners. For prisoners requiring special treatment, there are two staterooms available.
