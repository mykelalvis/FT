## Palique
For most of the year, Palique is no more hazardous to visit than any other world, however during its passage through the planetoid belt the approach can be more tricky. There is relatively little danger to ships from asteroids – Palique itself is endangered mainly due to gravitational attraction and even so tends to encounter only small rocks on most passages.

A safe passage to or from Palique requires jump entry or emergence outside the planetoid field, typically about four times the usual 100 diameter aiming point. A course avoiding major hazards can be plotted on an Easy (4+) Astrogation check, although this does not guarantee a ship will not encounter smaller chunks of rock. Each pass through the belt causes Palique to perturb nearby asteroids, making it impossible to chart them all.

A ship that follows a well plotted course in a cautious manner – taking about 36 hours for the transit in and out from close orbit – can do so in almost complete safety. Minor course corrections may be necessitated but a good sensor watch will suffice to spot hazards early enough that any competent pilot can automatically avoid the danger. However, this is very slow.

The transit time can be reduced to 30 hours without running major risks, although higher speeds reduce the time available for evasive action. Note that maneuver drive power does not affect this transit time – it is defined by conditions, not the ability to accelerate. A Routine (6+) Pilot check is needed to make a safe transit.
For every 10% increment shaved off this time, either by jumping in or out a little closer or being more liberal with the throttle, the check is subject to a cumulative DM-2.

If the Effect of this check is negative, the ship hits something, suffering 1D damage per point of negative Effect. Minor damage indicates clipping a chunk of rock; a large amount will mean the ship has slammed into a large asteroid with serious consequences.

[[Mora]] itself is an economic and industrial powerhouse and has large megacorporate holdings on-planet. Among the lesser corporations also headquartered there is [[Al Morai]], a moderately sized shipping line that provides a reliable service through to the [[Darrian Confederation]] via [[Vilis]].

There are six worlds in the subsector ([[Heroni]], [[Catuz]], [[Jokotre]], [[Palique]], [[Fenl's Gren]], and [[Duale]]) that are [[Amber Zone]]d and there are no Red Zones. However, access to what is left of the Imperial Research Station on Duale is not possible. Details of what the station was working on are unavailable but in 1102 a massive explosion caused heavy damage to the station and caused its temporary abandonment. Naval assets and [[Imperial Marines]] remain on station (at a curiously respectful distance) to prevent intruders from entering the site.

[[Palique]]'s [[Amber Zone]] is due to frequent meteor bombardment. The world is a captured body following a highly eccentric orbit, which takes it through one of the system's two planetoid belts twice a year. Although conveniently placed as an industrial center for minerals mined from the rich belts, Palique can be a hazardous destination for starships. All of the world's cities are deep underground for protection and the world is justly famous for the quality of vacc suits and vacuum-environment survival gear manufactured there.

[[Pimane]] is an interesting astrophysical oddity. Its surface has a number of extremely deep rift valleys that contain an atmosphere dense enough to support life, although the surface is a near-vacuum.
