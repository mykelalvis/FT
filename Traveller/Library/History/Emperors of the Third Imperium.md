## EMPERORS OF THE THIRD IMPERIUM

The Old (or First) Imperium spanned a large portion of this spiral arm of the galaxy before [[Terra|Terran]]s ever reached the stars – it persisted for nearly 200 years in the face of [[Terra|Terran]] expansion. Ultimately falling before the expansion of [[Terra|Terran]] humanity, it reincarnated as The Rule of Man. While [[Terra|Terran]]s were superb in their expansion to other systems and other worlds, their control of the stellar reaches already explored proved too little too late, and this Ramshackle Empire continued the pervasive decay present in the Old Imperium into an age of war and chaos called the Long Night.

This period of interstellar anarchy ended some 1,500 years later with the establishment of the Third Imperium. In a 30 year campaign, which moulded public opinion at the same time that battle starships were convincing local governments, Cleon Zhunastu committed a family industrial base and a firm foundation of political support to the creation of an empire that would rival the glories of past ages. He succeeded in forming a government that controlled, with a velvet-gloved fist, nearly a 100 subsectors.

In the 1,100 years since the assumption of Cleon I, the Emperor's List has been a convenient reference to the events in the growth and development of the Imperium.

Cleon I: First of the Zhunastu dynasty and first Emperor of the Imperium. Born 57 PI ( Pre Imperium ), proclaimed hereditary emperor for life in the first year of the Imperium. Died of natural causes in 53.

Cleon II: Only issue of Cleon I. Also known as Cleon the Weak. Born 21, pro-claimed emperor 53, abdicated 54. In point of fact, recent study indicates that the term “weak” may be an unfair description of Cleon II. Apparently unsuited to devious palace politics, but still recognizing the need to consolidate the power of the fledgling Imperium, Cleon abdicated in favor of his brilliant chancellor, Artemsus Lentuli. Vitally concerned with the welfare of his former realm, Cleon spent the rest of his long, active, colourful, and from all accounts, happy life on the frontier as a self-appointed, and extremely effective, one-man fire brigade.

Artemsus: First of the Lentuli dynasty. Born 17 Pl, proclaimed emperor in 54, died of natural causes in 166 at the then incredible age of 183, demonstrating the characteristic natural longevity of the Lentuli line.

**_Martin I:_** Eldest son (an elder daugh ter preceded him, although did not pursue a career in government) of Artemsus. Born 12, proclaimed emperor 166, died of natural causes 195. The Solomani Hypothesis (that the humans of the galaxy are all descended from one genetic stock, spread by some ancient race for reasons unknown; and that the source of that stock was Terra of Sol) was proposed in 114 and received immediate, although somewhat uninterested, acceptance.

**_Martin II:_** Oldest issue of Martin I. Born 53, proclaimed emperor 195, died 244 of natural causes without issue.

**_Cleon III:_** In the dynastic crisis caused by the death of Martin II without direct issue, Cleon Zhunastu, great-great-great grandson of Cleon II by direct first issue, appeared as the most legitimate claimant to the throne. Born 201, proclaimed emperor 244, assassinated 245. Also known as the Mad, it appears that while Cleon's claim to the throne was flawless, he was not.

His behaviour in office soon convinced surviving members of the government that he was a homicidal maniac and a decision to dispose of him was made and implemented in short order.

**_Porfiria:_** Fourth in the re-established Lentuli dynasty, Porfiria was the oldest issue of the grand-nephew of Martin II. Born 201, proclaimed empress 245, died of natural causes in 326.

**_Anguistus:_** Oldest issue of Porfiria. Born 246, proclaimed emperor 326, died of natural causes 365.

**_Martin III:_** Second issue of Anguistus (a preceding infant died in childhood). Born 289, proclaimed emperor in 365, died in an air/raft accident in 456 at the age of 167, having outlived his only issue. In memory of this deceased son, the title Martin IV was never used by an emperor.

**_Martin V:_** Grandson of Martin III, oldest issue of Martin IV. Born 357, proclaimed emperor 456, died of natural causes 457.

**_Nicholle:_** Oldest issue of Martin V. Born 401, proclaimed empress 457, assassinated 475.

**_Cleon IV:_** Generally believed to be responsible for the assassination of the Empress Nicholle and the murder of her immediate family, Cleon IV was a distant relation in the Zhunastu line and based his claims to legitimacy on that. Generally regarded as an interloper now, Cleon IV is considered to be the first of the non-dynastic emperors. Born 423, proclaimed emperor 475, assassinated 555.

Jerome: Ascended the throne by right of moot election. Born 525, proclaimed emperor 555, assassinated 582.

Jaqueline I : Ascended the throne by right of moot election. Born 561, proclaimed empress 582, assassinated 606.

During the reign of Jaqueline, extensive expansion of the Rimward Fringe of the Imperium took place, due primarily to her economic policies, which depended on cost-effectiveness. Sol-Terra was reintegrated into the Imperium in 588.

Olav : First of the Emperors of the Flag. Olav hault-Plankwell, as Grand Admiral of the Marches, defeated the massive incursions of the Out- World Coalition in the First Frontier War (589-604). Upon return to the Core, Olav personally murdered the Empress Jaqueline I and proclaimed himself emperor by right of fleet control. Born 532, self-proclaimed emperor 606, killed in battle 609.

Ramon I : As Olav's chief-of-staff, Ramon was able to convince large portions of the fleet to attempt an overthrow of Olav. In the Battle of Tricanus5 (609) Ramon's forces were apparently defeated but Olav's flagship was destroyed with all hands in a final closing action. Born 560, proclaimed emperor by right of moot election 609, assassinated 609.

**_Constantus_** : Born 562, and self-proclaimed emperor by right of assassination in 609. Killed in battle 610.

_**Nicolai**_ : Defeated the forces of Constantus in the Battle of Rakakaka (610). Born 559, proclaimed emperor 610, assassinated 612.

The Imperial Sunburst is the symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon I, the first emperor, when the empire was proclaimed.

**_George_** : Born 558, self-proclaimed emperor by right of assassination 612, assassinated 613.

> Numerous emperors of uncertain status and unlikely heritage ruled fragments of the Imperial Core from 613 through 615. None held a sufficient balance of power to be judged truly emperor and the Home Worlds had formed a temporarily autonomous state. Nevertheless, no break in the Imperium is judged to have taken place as the Imperial bureaucracy continued to function without interruption.

**_Cleon V_** : Born 565, proclaimed emperor 615 after the re-subjugation of the Home Worlds. Killed in battle, 618.

**_Joseph_** : Born 581, proclaimed emperor after defeating Cleon V in the Battle of Markhatch (618), killed in battle the same year.

**_Donald_** : Born 579, emperor after the defeat of Joseph at the Battle of Arakoine (618). Assassinated 618.

**_Catharine_** : Born 582, proclaimed empress 619, assassinated 619.

**_Ramon II_** : Born 566, proclaimed emperor 619, killed in battle 619.

**_Jaqueline II_** : Born 569, proclaimed empress after defeating Ramon II in the Battle of the Nivzhine Belt (619), killed in battle 619.

**_Usuti_** : Born 558, proclaimed emperor after defeating Jaqueline II in the Second Battle of Arakoine (619). Killed in battle 620.

**_Marava_** : Born 551, proclaimed empress after defeating Usuti in the Third Battle of Arakoine (619), killed in battle 620.

**_Ivan_** : Born 580, proclaimed emperor after the defeat of Marava in the Battle of Sulgami (620), killed in battle 620.

Martin VI: Born 597, proclaimed emperor after the defeat of Ivan in the First Battle of Zhimaway (621), assassinated 621.

**_Gustus_** : Born 581, proclaimed emperor 621, killed in battle 622.

**_Arbellatra_** : First of the Alkhalikoi dynasty (and occasionally considered to be the 18th of the Emperors of the Flag). Born 587, served as Grand- Admiral of the Marches and led the defeat of the Out-World Coalition in the Second Frontier War (615-620). Returned to the Imperial Core with strong fleet elements and defeated the remnants of the Central Fleet under Gustus in the Second Battle of Zhimaway (622). Proclaimed regent in 622 pending the location of a suitable surviving heir to the throne. Proclaimed empress in 629. Died of natural causes in 666.

Zhakirov : Oldest issue of Arbellatra. Born 624, proclaimed emperor in 666. Zharirov's marriage to Antiama in 679 marked and cemented an alliance between the Alkhalikoi dynasty and the business interests of the Imperial Core; it broke the power of Solomani interests at court and ultimately led to the Solomani Rim War (990-1002).

Margaret I : Oldest issue of Zhakirov. Born 684, proclaimed empress in 688, died in a tunnel collapse without issue in 736.

Paulo : Second issue of Zhakirov Born 684, proclaimed emperor 736, died of natural causes in 767.

Tomutov I : Oldest issue of Paulo I. Born 712, proclaimed emperor 767, abdicated 768, died of natural causes 801.

Paula II : Eldest issue of Tomutov I. Perhaps best known for her steady hand at the helm of state during the Psionic Suppressions of 800-826. Born 752, proclaimed empress 768, died of natural causes 836.

Tomutova II : Third issue of Paula II (preceding heirs died before ascending the throne). Born 782, proclaimed empress 836, died of natural causes 908.

Margaret II : Oldest issue of Tomutova II. Born 824, proclaimed empress 908, died of natural causes 945.

Styryx : Oldest issue of Tomolin (oldest issue of Margaret II, b. 901, d. 944). Born 920, proclaimed emperor 945, abdicated 989 in the repercussions of the mismanaged Third Frontier War (979-986).

Gavin : Oldest surviving issue of Styryx. Born 946, proclaimed emperor 989, died of natural causes 1031.

Paulo III : Oldest issue of Gavin. Born 981, proclaimed emperor 1031, died of natural causes 1071.

Strephon : Oldest surviving issue of Paulo III. Born 1049, proclaimed emperor 1071. During his reign the Fourth Frontier War (1082-1084) erupted; clever public relations turned it to Strephon's advantage, although he physically had little to do with it. The long delay in communication with the front meant that his orders held little sway and the armistice arrived almost as soon as the news of war. The conflict, however, has been called the False War and it resolved little of the continuing tension between the Zhodani and the Imperium.
