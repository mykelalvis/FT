[[Utoland]] [[Utoland]] 0409 C473464–7 0409 C473464–7 NINI The world of [[Utoland]] became independent world from the Imperium shortly after the Third Frontier War but has recently been taken over by the [[Federation of Arden]]. Although the Imperium has classed the world as non-industrial, the Federation has increased production by a staggering rate by bringing in their own people and technology to increase efficiency. Full details can be found on page 40 (Conspiracies).

There are five planetary bodies in this system but only the outer planet, Utoland, has been colonized.

Utoland 0409 C473464–7 NI Utoland was first colonized at the end of the [[Second Frontier War]]. Having ceded several worlds to the [[Zhodani]], the [[Imperium]] established a refugee colony on Utoland in 620. However, being so far from the Jewell Cluster and having little in the way of resources, the population of Utoland never grew beyond 40,000.

Shortly after the [[Third Frontier War]], Utoland became an independent world but has recently been taken over by the [[Federation of Arden]]. Utoland is now in a state of unrest and although the Federation allows ships to use the starport facilities, access beyond that is limited.

The [[Federation of Arden]] maintain that they are here at the request of the previous administration and work for the benefit of Utoland but the majority of the population opposed the decision to be ruled by a corporation. It is these conflicting attitudes that are the cause of the unrest and the need to restrict access to the city.

Most of the population live in the capital city of [[#Utane]] situated near the [[#mining facility]] south of the city. A number of satellite towns can also be found in the surrounding area. To the north and the west are two vast mountain ranges that are home to a wide variety of wildlife.

The [[Imperium]] has classed Utoland as non-industrial but the technology and resources supplied by the [[Federation of Arden]] are greatly improving productivity.

# ATTITUDES

Due to the current social and political climate on Utoland, attitudes vary greatly. Whilst many people oppose the [[Federation of Arden]]’s takeover of Utoland, others have welcomed it. The economy is certainly improving but many feel this has come at the cost of personal freedoms.

# LAWS

Landing is only permitted at the [[#starport]]. All assault and heavier weapons are illegal as is trading in high technology items. Trade permits are required for anyone wishing to enter the city.

Due to the unrest and several outbreaks of violence, ***legal weapons*** also require a permit. These permits are given out sparingly and only with good reason. Anyone found breaking this law is arrested, fined and has their weapons confiscated. Anyone caught using a weapon faces imprisonment. There is a continuing weapons amnesty where anyone can anonymously deposit their weapons without suffering any consequences. Travellers are permitted to leave personal weapons on their ships but large quantities of weapons will be assumed to be cargo for sale and subject to the aforementioned punishments.

## Trade Permit

Before being allowed access to the city, one needs to get a trade permit. They can find out how to do this by speaking to one of the clerks in the administration office. The clerk will explain that although the Federation of Arden does not wish to prevent trade in Utane, permits are necessary for security reasons. Not only does it help prevent unwanted or illegal traders from doing business here but all trade can be monitored and regulated.

Upon application for a trade permit, the ship will be inspected to make sure that they are not carrying any contraband. Whilst the ship is being searched, all crew members are interviewed and a local background check is carried out. Interviews are short and include the following questions:

- What is your reason for coming to Utoland?
- What type of goods or services do you usually trade?
- Have you got a criminal record?

If any of the replies do not match or the interviewer suspects the person is lying then the permit will be denied. If the interviewer is happy with the answers and they all seem to check out, the party will each be given a trade permit.

Once approved, the relevant details are then submitted for a more thorough background check, which will take at least four weeks. If any problems come to light, then the next time the party visits Utoland they will be arrested, charged and their trade permits revoked.

If one fails to get valid permits, they will either have to move on to the next world or attempt to gain access to the city without a permit. However, since the only way in is through the security checkpoint, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to get inside.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Utane

The capital city is home to the majority of the planet’s population. The city is split into two levels. The upper level is located within a large dome on the planets surface and is primarily a commercial area. The lower level is underground where most of the houses have been built.

## Starport

The starport is accessible to any traveller for refuelling but access to the city requires a [[#trade permit]]. The only way into the city is through one of the security checkpoints. Anyone without a permit will not be allowed through and directed to the administration office.

## Mining Facility

The facility consists of a number of mines located 100 km south of [[#Utane]]. Upgrades and maintenance work is still being carried out but the majority of the mines are now in full production. Access to these facilities is restricted to authorized personnel only.

## The Blue Room

This bar is located on the lower city level and is frequented by individuals who make it quite clear that they are not happy with the federation’s rule. The federation are aware of the activities here but have not gotten involved, partly to avoid unnecessary conflict but it also allows them to monitor and identify potential trouble makers.
