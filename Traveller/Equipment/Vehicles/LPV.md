## LIGHT PATROL VEHICLE

Light Patrol Vehicles, or LPVs, are used by many security services and mercenary units. They have some applications in counter-insurgency work but are primarily encountered patrolling the boundaries and approaches to installations such as starports. Although more glamourous high-tech vehicles are available to those with funds, an unsophisticated wheeled vehicle capable of resisting small arms fire and mounting a decent support weapon is more than enough for most security applications.

The standard LPV is a four-wheeled design capable of crossing rough terrain but possessing a limited radius of operation. The crew of three consists of a driver, gunner and commander. The latter two are seated in the turret, which normally mounts a projectile weapon such as a light autocannon.

Autocannon are by far the most common weapons but machineguns and other high-rate-of-fire weapons are also common. LPVs may also carry grenade launchers or less-lethal weaponry such as tear gas jets or water cannon.

Like many military and paramilitary vehicles, the LPV is better protected in the frontal arc. The glacis and turret front are capable of withstanding heavy machinegun fire, whilst the rest of the vehicle is armored against small arms fire.

The large turret is quite roomy when a standard weapon, such as an autocannon, is fitted. Normally this weapon is accompanied by a co- axial machinegun that shares its rather basic fire control system. Two Spaces of weapons can be fitted if the autocannon and machinegun are removed. A second machinegun is mounted on the turret top for use by the commander, providing all-round infantry defence.

LIGHT APC


The light APC is built on the same chassis as the Light Patrol Vehicle and has many components in common. Some users combine both designs to create a mobile infantry force with organic fire support elements, although often the APC is used for all roles. The large turret of the LPV is replaced by a large internal compartment with a high ceiling, making the APC suitable for command vehicle, armored ambulance and weapons carrier roles, as well as personnel transport.

Normally the vehicle is armed only with a pintle-mounted machinegun and even this may be omitted on some security vehicles. APCs of this sort are sometimes used by civilian 'armored truck' companies transporting valuables and police departments, neither of whom normally mount military weapons on their vehicles. The vehicle does have six firing ports to allow personnel to use their weapons from behind armor.

The crew of two (driver and commander) are seated at the front of the vehicle, separated from the troop compartment by an internal partition. Troop capacity is nominally six personnel. Up to twice as many can be jammed in but this makes dismounting or even conducting an equipment check very difficult.
