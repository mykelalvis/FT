## Ranger Cerny

[[Vilani]] Female 35 (A7B8A6)
PRESERVE RANGER TILLANIDI CERNY

![[RangerCerny_Portrait.jpg]]
Cerny is the chief ranger at the [[Tinea-Fabre]] wildlife preserve. She has been employed by [[Okhotnikov]] for about a year and does not approve of his methods. However, she does not debate with him about his approach as she enjoys the job immensely and does not want to jeopardise her role. Rumor has it the previous chief ranger was fired by [[Okhotnikov]] after a disagreement with him about his wildlife management philosophy.
