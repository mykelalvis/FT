The Imperial military consists of four services: the [[Imperial Navy|navy]], [[Imperial Marines|marines]], [[Imperial Army|army]] and [[scout service]]. Each of the services has a distinct role in the defense and maintenance of the empire.

Many would argue that the [[Imperial Navy]] is the most important of the services. It is the glue that holds the Imperium together, responsible for the defense of its borders and the enforcement of Imperial law.

The marines are an adjunct to the navy, serving as its ship’s troops. Starship battles alone do not always win wars. When the Imperium attacks terrestrial targets, the marines are its primary assault force the shock troops who descend from space to establish a landing zone for other military forces.

The army is the lifeblood of the Imperial military. Each world recruits its own army from the native population. When called upon, these planetary armies unite into a cohesive military force, and may be deployed to conquered planets where they restore order and keep the peace.

Without the scouts, the [[Imperium]] could not exist in its current form. The bold explorers of the [[Scout Service]] recontacted hundreds of isolated worlds and pocket empires during and after the Long Night, and paved the way for their integration into the Imperium. Today they continue to survey the Imperium’s many member worlds, explore outside the Imperium to further its knowledge and maintain the communications links vital to maintaining the Imperium itself.
