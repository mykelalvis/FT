Many worlds of Cemplas were members of the Interstellar Confederacy, which challenged the Sylean Federation for dominance of the Core before the rise of the Third Imperium. Cemplas is a region of sharp contrasts. Unlike the former Confederacy worlds in Bunkeria, those of Cemplas underwent a difficult transition into the Imperium, which in many ways was never fully consummated. Bunkeria rarely saw direct conflict with Sylean forces but major wars were fought on the worlds of Cemplas, some of which still bear the scars today. Because of this, there was a great deal more resentment towards the Syleans and their new Imperium. Many of these worlds grudgingly relented to Imperial authority and developed cultures that take umbrage to any perceived interference in their affairs. Time heals all wounds but even after 1,000 years, there are feelings of mistrust between the close-knit worlds of Cemplas and its Imperial overlords. While a large-scale insurgency would be virtually impossible to carry out, Imperial intelligence agencies keep a close eye on Cemplas for any trouble that might be brewing. There is little danger of outright rebellion but Cemplas is on a shorter leash than Bunkeria and probably always will be.

The spirit of rebellion lives on in Cemplas. It is a place of both great wealth and immense challenges. Cemplas is home to some of the most technologically advanced worlds in all of the Core but also harbours some of its most oppressive dictatorships. Cemplas has four industrial worlds, three of which – Bendo, Keplo and Shibashliim – are ideally located along the Sylean Main. Near the heart of the Core and in close proximity to Capital, these worlds are of great importance to Cemplas and the region at large. Bendo and Keplo manufacture low- to mid-tech consumer goods and the factories of Shibashliim – which cover the majority of the planet's surface and sprawling swaths of its sea bed – produce high-end computer systems and electronics. The governors of Shibashliim have large stakes in the megacorporation Naasirka, which holds a monopoly of the planet's industrial capital. The fourth industrial world, Lishiruud, is located in the rimward portion of the subsector and sits upon a small jump-1 main where competing merchant companies run liners and megafreighters and operate a network of subsidized merchant routes in the surrounding markets.

Innovation in Cemplas is fuelled by the Imperial Navy, which has ultra-high-tech research and development centres on Celetron and Ye-lu. Both are on the verge of major breakthroughs in automation and artificial intelligence. Celetron is developing autonomous starships and Ye-lu has all of its essential functions controlled by an AI computer network. Both worlds are high-value strategic assets and heavily defended by the 160th Fleet. While they are fully engaged in the development of military hardware and software, each has agencies that share consumer-oriented tech with civilian firms. Meanwhile, private companies on Shibashliim are competing in the cutting-edge field of matter transport. While some are close to being able to transmit small amounts of matter across continental distances, a few niche companies are attempting to use the technology to teleport radio waves across an entire star system. If successful, they will have invented the Imperium's first working FTL communications device.
