## Natoko

Natoko (0809-8582211-B) is a moderate sized world  along the [[Aramis Trace]]. Approximately 8,000 km in diameter, it has a dense atmosphere and shallow seas covering 20% of its surface.

Natoko is relatively uninhabited; its population is less than a thousand, virtually all employees or dependents of [[Tukera|Tukera Lines]], which operates a starship overhaul service on the  world. [[LawLevel 1|Local law level]] prohibits the grosser forms of violence but generally leaves behavior as a matter between individuals. Natoko's technological capabilities are [[TechLevel 8|low]] low, but the starport is capable of performing its routine tasks.
