# The Underwater Caverns of Amboure

Amboure is a very wet world, but not a ‘water world’ as such. It has a modest amount of land above sea level, and this is where the inhabitants live. There is evidence that sea level was once much lower, perhaps due to extensive glaciation, and during this time several enormous cavern systems were open to the air. As sea levels rose these systems were inundated, leaving air pockets in some sections. With no practical reason for exploration, these caverns were left undisturbed for many years.

The caverns have developed their own closed ecosystems over the millennia which are now attracting scientific interest. In addition, there are those who find the challenge of exploring the caverns irresistible, and these two agendas have coincided with the result that several expeditions have entered the various cavern systems. Only a small section has yet been fully explored however.

The difficulties inherent in exploring an underwater cave system are quite considerable. The entry points to most caverns are underwater, or else high in the roof above a water-filled cavern. Even a dive of about 100m is hazardous with conventional personal equipment, and some transits require several hours including squeezing through narrow areas and negotiating deep sumps. These downward bends can take the diver to dangerous depths and in some cases cannot be passed without specialist equipment.

Some of the largest cave systems have entry points over 500m down, and at present can only be explored by using submarines. Once a shallower area is reached, divers can make a local exploration. In some cases, small base camps have been set up in the largest caverns. Some float on the water surface or are perched on a dry section, others are built underwater. From these camps the explorers make ever-deeper forays into the dark waters of the cave system.

Scientists have discovered numerous new species in the cave systems, including some very exotic life. There are also rumoured to be gem beds accessible only from underwater and natural wonders in the form of caves with glittering crystals in their walls. When divers bring their lights into these places, the scene is spectacular but can be hazardous to those who are not prepared. Being startled in a diving suit is a hazardous experience.

At present only the upper regions of most cavern systems have been explored. The difficulty of entering a cave system underwater then penetrating a deep vertical distance makes such an undertaking very expensive. It may be necessary to use different types of equipment for the parts of the transit, which in turn requires the ability to switch between one and another at a suitable point.

Deeper exploration has been carried out by remotely controlled and autonomous vehicles, though the rate of loss makes this, too expensive. Losses are typically due to difficult conditions and operator error in a tight space, though it is known that at least a few drones have been destroyed by deep-water predators which presumably resented the intrusion into their environment.

Recently, a way has been found for small submarines to enter a large cavern with an air pocket and some above- water areas suitable for a base. This is significant since the cavern is located close to a wide deep-water shaft going down for an unknown distance. Side passages lead off from this central shaft, and are reported as being very extensive. Work has begun on a base to support larger scale exploration of these shafts and passages.

Several exploration and scientific groups have joined forces to penetrate the mysteries of the underwater caverns, though relations between the various groups are not always amicable. The politics going on at base camp can get vigorous, potentially derailing expeditions, and tempers have reportedly frayed on several occasions. Perhaps this is the reason why a small security contingent has been brought in to police the base and protect its equipment. There are, naturally, those who insist that the new security arrangements are defensive in nature, and that there is something hostile in the underwater tunnels.
