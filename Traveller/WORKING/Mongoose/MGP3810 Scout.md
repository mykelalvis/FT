## Scouts

along with commentaries on their areas of use and advantages/
disadvantages.

The work of the Contact and Survey branches of the Scout service
receives in-depth treatment in its own chapter. The extensive
First Contact Protocol outlines how new civilizations should be
approached and treated, whilst the Survey section details the
essential stages of a survey mission, and offers an enhanced
cartography system for detailing a stellar system

The book rounds out with a chapter for referees playing in the Third
Imperium. The organization of the IISS is detailed, with a particular
focus on the work of the Imperial Grand Survey – those responsible
for mapping and plotting the Imperium's expansion.

# IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

In the same way that Mercenary and High Guard have examined the
roles of the fighting and naval services respectively, Scouts takes a
detailed look at the Scout service. In the pages of this book you will
find rules for expanded Scout character generation, new career options,
vastly enhanced Event and Mishap tables, additional, new, mustering
benefits and a full overview of the work the Scout service undertakes.

Further chapters expand on the missions available to both Scouts
and retired Scouts – a boon to referees who may need to quickly
generate a scenario seed for rapid play. In addition, Scout Base
Cygnus X-3, along with its eclectic crew, is detailed as a starting
point for Scout-centric adventures to take place.

The Equipment and Ships chapter offers a plethora of new
devices available to Scouts, and a selection of additional ships,

This chapter provides the rules for creating scout characters.
It takes a special strength of will to undertake the hazardous
exploration of the unknown, and whilst this is, to a large extent, the
purpose of many _Traveller_ games, characters may find themselves
in this position by accident or coincidence; scouts, however, do
this for a living. It is a vocation; a calling; a way of life. Scouts
deliberately, and constantly, push themselves beyond the reaches
of the known in order to satisfy the curiosity of society and their
own, restless souls.

And it is risky work. A newly discovered system holds many
dangers: asteroid and radiation belts; uncharted stellar anomalies;
undiscovered, perhaps hostile, inhabitants – either aliens, native to
the system and others, or isolated colonists, lost to the empire, that
have little wish to be reconnected with the old regime. Scouts are the
ones who get there first. Their initial observations and attitudes may
make or break future relations. Scouts are pioneers, researchers,
surveyors, ambassadors and diplomats, troubleshooters and
peacemakers. In many ways, they _are_ the essential _Travellers_.

Scouts may therefore arise naturally during the course of play,
and the rules found in this book can be used to adjudicate the
outcome of their activities, but equally there needs to be a way
for scout characters to be developed as a career path before play
begins. _Traveller_ characters may have been scouts before moving
onto a different walk of life, but the skills developed as part of their
previous career have equipped them for the unknown. This chapter
is therefore dedicated to creating the scout character – whether a
character who later goes on to another career or who remains in
pursuit of the wider excitement of the unknown.

## BASIC SCOUT CHARACTER CREATION

This chapter follows the normal stages of character creation as
detailed in the _Traveller_ core rulebook, pointing out where and how
players and Referees can branch away from the standard career
paths in order to use what is available in _Traveller: Scouts_.

Characteristics
The basic six characteristics of a scout character are the same as
for any other character. Scouts tend to have higher than average
Endurance characteristic owing to the rigours of long hours, often
alone, in space flight or surveying hostile and potentially hostile
environments. Scouts are tenacious and are physically and mentally
prepared for both the isolation of space, including the boredom of
long periods of travel, and the hazards of new environments. High
Intelligence and Education characteristics are also beneficial for
achieving promotion within the scout career – those with a curious,

open mind can make those career-enhancing discoveries; and,
understanding the nature of both space and stellar systems greatly
assists the prospects of success.

Homeworld
Whilst scouts can ostensibly come from any Homeworld, those
worlds that engender curiosity, resistance to hardships and a frontier
spirit tend to produce those with the natural tenacity to excel as
scouts. If your character comes from any of the below worlds, he
gains a +1DM to enlistment in the Scout service:

Asteroid Vacc Low Pop
High Technology Ice Capped Gov Type 0 or 5
Industrial Desert

Infrastructure
Although they often operate alone or in small teams, scouts are
backed by a solid infrastructure: a governing directorate that
establishes scouting needs and missions; a communications wing
that co-ordinates the often far-flung scout outposts; a technology
wing that procures and assigns the essential equipment every scout
needs; an operations wing that co-ordinates scouts and missions in a
localised area (which may span several neighboring systems, or be
limited to just a single system); and an administrative bureaucracy
that handles the necessary permissions and paperwork all scouts
need to navigate at some point, especially if travelling through areas
that have special interest to other parties (such as the military or
scientific establishments engaged in specialist areas of study).

This infrastructure is common to all scout operations irrespective
of the background used in your Traveller campaign. Any formal
scouting service requires sanction, and this is what differentiates
it from freebooters and chancers who prefer to operate beyond the
rules and laws of civilised administrations. However, any scout
service has to operate with a certain autonomy, and scout services
tend to have more flexibility than other arms of the government, such
as the army or navy, whilst still occupying the same importance of
position. This does lead to certain complications though. The scout
service is often viewed as a maverick branch, employing loners and
rule-bucking renegades who can cause more harm than good in
certain situations. Certainly the scout career tends to attract those
with a taste for high adventure but prefer to disregard the kind of
discipline essential to the military services. But, at the same time,
the scout service fulfils an important need in that it takes the hard
risks first – and so most other services grudgingly accept that scouts
are allowed to bend, or sometimes ignore, certain rules, even if this
is not a universally popular view.

### THE SCOUT CAREER PATHS

The following career paths are designed for those with a career in
the scout service. This is a dangerous career, especially when it
comes to exploration and survey, and it requires a certain hardiness
of mind, body and soul to cope with the rigours of the job.

There are five distinct scout career paths: Contact, Courier,
Exploration, Special Operations and Survey. Each career branch has
several specialist areas within its function that determine the skills
derived in a particular term of service.

Contact
The Contact branch specializes in making contact with new races
and civilizations, or re-establishing contact with old ones. It involves
a variety of skills and techniques, including the general assessment
of conditions, detailed study and survey of the subject, 'First Contact
Protocols' where a new race is encountered, and first-line diplomatic/
ambassadorial functions before the diplomatic corps takes over. The
Contact branch therefore requires people who have an eye for detail,
the ability to accurately extrapolate factors such as technology level,
military strength, propensity for hostility, political climate, specific
biological considerations, and so forth. Contact scouts might spend
years studying a system before any actual contact is made; and, if
a new race or life-form is discovered, Contact frequently works with
other agencies to ensure that the 'First Contact' is as successful
as possible. Where it is necessary to re-establish contact with an
isolated colony or civilization, the branch studies the history of the
subject extensively so it can be fully prepared for the likely reaction
and reception to renewed communications.

Courier
Unfairly viewed as the 'messenger boys', the Courier branch is
responsible for transporting messages across vast distances quickly,
efficiently, safely and securely. In settings where faster-than-light
communications are not possible, the Courier branch comes into its
own, as it forms the vital link between the central hub of civilizations
and far-flung systems, colonies and outposts. In settings where FTL
communications are both possible and the norm, the Courier branch
establishes relay points, provides encryption/decryption services,
and takes responsibility for certain high priority communications
that cannot be entrusted to another agency for specific reasons. The
Courier branch also provides 'bodyguard' services for transporting
dignitaries or VIPs, especially into newly discovered or established
territories. Whatever the function, the Courier branch is anything
but a glorified message service: it is frequently in charge of highly
sensitive communications that require the full gamut of skills
available in other branches, particularly Contact. Courier scouts are
those who can prove their dependability, reliability and the ability to
be both tactful and discreet.

Exploration
The Exploration branch is responsible for the high level exploration
of new systems prior to a survey team being despatched for a more
detailed survey of the area. Exploration deliberately heads into
uncharted or barely charted regions of space, searching for a variety of
things: stellar anomalies, habitable worlds, worlds and systems with
particular characteristics, and so forth. Its remit is as broad as space
itself, and Exploration crews often spend long periods amongst the
stars, working on faint traces, hopeful glimmers and potential sites
of interest as it does working with hard facts and evidence. Much
of its work is involved with accurate charting and route definition:
humdrum work that is, nevertheless, essential to many agencies.
Where charting is concerned, the Exploration team must correctly
note and quantify all factors that have a bearing: asteroid fields,
dangerous anomalies – anything that might pose a hazard or risk to
any space traffic that will make use of a route in the future.

Special Operations
Special Operations covers a wide range of activities, many of them
highly secret or covert in nature. Special Operations might be required to
undertake undercover work on behalf of an agency such as the army or
navy, or supply advanced information relating to an enemy – existing or
potential. Similarly, it might be required to make discreet contact with a
new discovery, find out as much as possible, and then relay its findings
in advance of a formal exploration, survey or contact team going in. The
branch is also responsible for subtly manipulating civilizations according
to a specific agenda. This might mean averting a war or starting one;
imposing a new ruler or deposing the old. The agenda is dictated by a
higher power, but Special Operations is chosen to conduct it because
it has the skills and capabilities to effect transformation under the
radar, and can be officially denied by a government or imperial power if
needs require it. A scout service might even deny it has anything like a
Special Operations branch, whilst, in reality, it readily engages in 'black'
missions under the guise of its standard branches, but using specially
trained and briefed operatives.

Survey
The Survey branch is responsible for the detailed assessment and
survey of systems, stars and worlds once the high level assessment
has been completed by the Exploration branch. Scout surveyors are
specialists across a wide range of sciences and research techniques:
these are professionals and experts in their field. Survey teams tend
to incorporate a wide body of skills but may, just as equally, consist
of a small group of specialists in a narrow range of disciplines,
depending on the task in hand. Members of the Survey branch are
used to spending long periods in situ: patience and diligence are
watch words. Working with all the other Scout service branches, they
compile detailed and accurate reports on their subject matter that
form the core of the intelligence for a number of external agencies.

### ADDITIONS TO MUSTERING OUT

###### PROCEDURES

Scouts adds a new mustering out benefit specific to the Scout service:
Secrets. Secrets are important and highly valuable information that
the character has uncovered in the course of his work. When a secret
is gained, the player must decide what to do with it: the choices are
to gloss over it in official reports and have it when one begins play;
clandestinely sell it without telling the Scouts, or reporting it fully
to the service.

- If you choose to keep the secret, you retain it when your character
    begins play. It provides an adventure hook that should lead to
    fame, fortune and great risk.
- You may choose to officially conceal the information and sell it
    to interested parties gaining 1D6 x Cr10,000 when you choose,
    but if you do, you must make Int+Deception 9+ to prevent the
    Scout service from finding out. If you are discovered, you must
    forfeit 2 Benefit rolls and leave the service immediately.
       - If you make the appropriate channels aware of the find, you gain
          an additional benefit roll and +1 to your next Advancement roll.

Secrets received during mustering out may be handled as above,
with the exception that no bonuses to advancement are relevant. A
character's retained secrets can never be greater than half his or her
terms or rank (whichever is greater), minimum of one.

### CHOOSING A SCOUT CAREER

For each term in the Scout service, choose a career branch and
specialization. Entry to that branch is determined by succeeding
in the Qualification roll. Those characters who have spent time
in other fields before joining the Scouts may find their previous
experience fast tracking them into their chosen career path. If
your character has served at least a term in the service listed in
the Previous Service column, gain a +1DM to the Qualification
roll for enlistment

### AFTER RETIREMENT

Every Scout, when he joins the service, understands that he may
be undertaking a lifetime commitment. The Scout service has such
a broad remit, requiring such a broad range of skills, abilities and
life experiences, that retired Scouts are often summoned back to
the service on short notice, either for one-off missions, short-term
contracts, or even long-term endeavors.

For Traveller characters this is an ideal way to introduce a new
adventure or scenario: the Scout service acts as the patron, and any
ex-Scout is liable, at any time, to be summoned back for 'one last
job', or to assist in a special exercise that requires his particular
skills and experience. If the ex-Scout has colleagues that also have
particular skills (such as his adventuring buddies, for instance),
then on a roll of Int 9+ (with DMs for Broker and/or Persuasion)
then he can make a successful case for his team being brought into
the task as well.

If the Scout service summons a character back, refusal is difficult.
The enlistment contract carries financial penalties for refusing a
summons which can be legally enforced. The base fine is Cr20,000,
but may be more depending on just how much the service wants the
character to come back. If the fine is not paid, then the minimum
prison sentence is 2 years.

However, coming out of retirement to serve the Scouts again can
pay very well. The minimum payment for a job is Cr24,000, and this
is standard for any task that lasts between a few days and 6 months.
The pay scale is below:

Term of EmploymentTerm of Employment SalarySalary
< 6 months Cr24,000
6 – 12 months Cr36,000
12 – 24 months Cr54,000
24 – 48 months Cr81,000
48 – 60 months Cr122,000
60 months + Cr183,000

The salary is paid monthly into a dedicated Scout banking account;
so, for example, a character employed on a 60 month contract would
be paid Cr2,033 per month until the end of his 5 year contract term.

Characters who are summoned back to the service for 12 months or
greater are entitled to roll once on the Other Benefits column of the
Mustering Out table appropriate to the branch that they are working
for. Depending on how well they have acquitted themselves during
their period of re-employment, they may gain a DM of +1 or +2 to
the roll.

### SCOUT CHARACTER CREATION

### EXAMPLE

The following example provides an illustration of the process of
creating a human Scout character. Actual die throws are shown in
brackets, as are comments on the application of game rules. Die
modifications are labelled DM, as is standard in Traveller products.

MAHRAN SCHAEFFER
Born in the asteroid belt of his home system, Mahran dreams of
exploring space beyond the confines of his habitat. The tales of the
grizzled spacers and belters who frequent his father's bar fill him
with a wander-lust only the Scout service can fulfil. At the age of
16 Mahran takes himself to the Scout base located at the far end of
the asteroid and signs-up for the Scout service. The dour-looking
administrative officer who guides him through the application
process points out the commitment he is making ('You know the
Scouts means for life , son? I hope so.').

Mahran Schaffer at 16
Str 8 (+0), Dex 4 (–1), End 6
(+0), Int 7 (+0), Edu 10 (+1),
Soc 8 (+0)
Asteroid, High Population,
High Technology: Zero G 0,
Computers 0, Streetwise 0.

ENLISTMENT AND FIRST
TERM
Coming from an asteroid,
and a high-tech one at that,
Mahran gains a +2 to his
enlistment. He attempts to
qualify for the Courier branch
(End 5+). His enlistment roll
(9) gains +2, so he breezes
through the qualification
procedure and, for his first
assignment chooses xBoat,
joining a messenger crew
that is already based at his
asteroid habitat.

As this is Mahran's first career, he gains the following Basic Training
skills at level 0:

Pilot (spacecraft), Comms, Astrogation, Sensors and Navigation, and
Streetwise. As he already has Streetwise 0 due to his upbringing in
the teeming asteroid habitat he does not gain any further expertise
in this skill.

##### CREATING A SCOUT TRAVELLER CCREATINGREATING AA S SCOUTCOUT T TRAVELLERRAVELLER

After completing his basic training, his experience begins for real.
In his four-year xBoat assignment, he decides to concentrate on the
specialist skills that go with his job aboard the ship he is serving
on. He therefore rolls 1D6 (3) and gains Space Science; Mahran
chooses Space Science (Planetology) 1. The journeys he makes
take him throughout the solar system and he is keen to study the
characteristics of the mudballs that are so far removed from the
world he has known.

But of course life in any service is not without problems. Mahran
must roll for his Survival, which, for the xBoat assignment, is End
6+ (8). He encounters no mishaps in his first four years of service.
Yet the term of service is still eventful. On the Events table (53)
Mahran goes through a Life Event (9 – Travel to another world,
+2 to next advancement roll). Mahran is re-assigned to the prime
world of his solar system and, with his newly gained knowledge
of planetology, makes something of a name for himself despite
his youth. His Advancement roll is End 7+ (7+2 = 9). Mahran is
promoted to Messenger Second Class at the end of his first term.
He also gains an additional roll on any of the skills tables. Mahran
chooses to focus on Personal Development (6) and gains Comms:
clearly Mahran has an aptitude for communication systems. Mahran
is now 20, and has the following skills: Astrogation 0, Comms 1,
Computers 0, Navigation 0, Pilot (spacecraft) 0, Sensors 0, Space
Science (Planetlology) 1, Streetwise 0, Zero G 0.

SECOND TERM
Mahran decides to remain with the Scouts but decides to opt for
a new branch in his second term. His Comms experience makes
the Covert Surveillance assignment of Special Operations a natural
choice. His qualification throw is Int 6+ (11) – a success. Mahran's
capabilities have not gone unnoticed by the higher-ups of the Scout
service, and his Streetwise nature clearly makes him a natural for
this field of work.

For his first skill in Special Operations - Covert Surveillance, Mahran
selects the Specialist Covert Surveillance table (1); his Comms
increases to Comms 2. His survival roll is Int 8+ for this assignment.
The dice are thrown (10), and Mahran avoids a Mishap.

For his event in this term, Mahran rolls D66 again (56): Political
Conspiracy. A senior official, well-connected with the political group
Mahran has had under surveillance for the past three years has
Mahran approached secretly by members of the Black Star Brigade
to recruit Mahran into their ranks. Mahran resists the approach,
valuing his role in the Scouts far more highly than this tawdry
attempt to make him a traitor. As a result, he now has an enemy of
the entire Black Star Brigade. However, his advancement roll – Edu
6+ (7) is a success, and Mahran gains a rank, and an extra skill. He
chooses the Advanced Education table and gains Survival 1 – his run-
in with the Black Star Brigade has clearly taught him a few lessons
in watching his back. His skills are now: Astrogation 0, Comms 2,
Computers 0, Navigation 0, Pilot (spacecraft) 0, Sensors 0, Space
Science (Planetlology) 1, Streetwise 0, Survival 1, Zero G 0.

Mahran is now 28 years old and desperate to put some distance
between himself and the Black Star Brigade. He decides to enlist in
the Exploration branch, which should get him off-planet!

THIRD TERM
To qualify for Exploration – and Pathfinder appeals – Mahran must
roll End 6+ (8). Mahran joins the Pathfinder team and is assigned
to a Type S Scout that is responsible for mapping new space lanes
between systems. As he does not already have it, he gains Vacc Suit
0 upon joining this branch.

Mahran's first skill roll is made on the Pathfinder Specialist table (5);
he gains Astrogation 1. Already having some expertise in Astrogation
gains him the position of navigator aboard the ship, which the crew
has named Mercury Rising. His survival roll is End 6+ (10), so there
are no mishaps this term.

The Event result is (45). The Mercury Rising is diverted from its
mapping assignment to rescue a stricken freighter that has been
attacked by pirates (which are, unbeknown to Mahran, backed by
the Black Star Brigade). This event requires Mahran to roll 1D6 for
the outcome: (5). Mahran is injured during the rescue attempt, and
must roll on the Injury Table (page 37 of the Traveller rules). The
result is (4) – Mahran is badly scarred when debris rips through his
Vacc Suit and gouges away part of his upper thigh. Mahran reduces
his Endurance by 2 points, taking him down to End 4 (–1). He will
also now walk with a permanent limp as his leg is in constant pain,
despite the best medical attention he can be given.

As far as advancement goes, Mahran needs Edu 7+, and his decent
education of 10 grants him a +1 bonus. He succeeds (6+1) and as
his term of service draws to an end, Mahran is now an Exploration
Officer gaining Space Science (planetology) 1. For his additional skill
he chooses to roll on the Advanced Education table for Exploration
(1) – he has developed Pilot (spacecraft). At the end of his third term,
Mahran's characteristics and skills are as follows:

Str 8 (+0), Dex 4 (–1), End 4 (–1), Int 7 (+0), Edu 10 (+1), Soc 8 (+0)
Astrogation 1, Comms 2, Computers 0, Navigation 0, Pilot
(spacecraft) 1, Sensors 0, Space Science (planetology) 2, Streetwise
0, Survival 1, Vacc Suit 0, Zero G 0.

FOURTH TERM
Mahran decides to stay in Exploration and transfer across to the
Analysis assignment. His knowledge of the planets and planetary
systems is developing and he has a keen interest in this branch of
study. Working for Analysis he has the opportunity to develop it
further, and so he rolls on the Analysis Assignment table (1), gaining
a Life Science. Mahran chooses Life Sciences (Cybernetics); his
hope is to somehow overcome his leg disability with an implant
or augmentation some day, but he also studies the way such
augmentations have been used in the worlds the Exploration branch
have under scrutiny.

##### CCREATINGREATING AA S SCOUTCOUT T TRAVELLERRAVELLER

For his Survival throw of End 6+. His roll (8) is reduced to (7) owing
to his debilitated Endurance characteristic, and so Mahran avoids
rolling on the Mishap table.

A roll of (33) for Events in this term. Mahran makes a breakthrough
in planetary survey techniques that will save the Scouts time and
money if adopted and implemented throughout the service. He
gains Sensors +1 as a result of this work and he is thrilled when the
Exploration branch works the exploratory techniques into its official
training and survey orientation syllabus. However, Mahran receives
no credit for this work and no recognition of his contribution. This
is hugely upsetting, and the Int 8+ roll he is required to make is (6).
Disillusioned and dejected, Mahran serves his remaining term but
will leave at the end of it: he feels he has no choice.

There is, of course, a last stab at promotion, and Mahran rolls (12).
He is promoted to Exploration Team Leader (gaining Leadership

1) and, because the roll was a natural 12, Mahran must remain in
the Scouts for another term – even though his desire is to leave.
In consultation with the Referee, it is decided that, having heard of
Mahran's disillusionment, strings have been pulled to keep him in
the service but transfer him elsewhere. Because of his promotion,
Mahran may roll once more on any of the Exploration skills tables:
he chooses Service Skills (6) and gains another level of Comms.

So, by the end of his fourth term, Mahran's skills are: Astrogation
1, Comms 3, Computers 0, Leadership 1, Life Sciences (Cybernetics)
1, Navigation 0, Pilot (spacecraft) 1, Sensors 0, Space Science
(planetology) 2, Streetwise 0, Survival 1, Vacc Suit 0, Zero G 0.

FIFTH TERM
Mahran has decided this will be his last term with the Scouts, and
even then, he is here under duress. He decides to return to Special
Operations and is assigned to the Undercover division, investigating
Black Star Brigade activities on a colony world. His training from the
Service Skills table (3) gives him Gun Combat and he selects Slug
Pistol as the specialization.

The Survival roll is End 7+. His injured leg is a definite disability
here, but the roll (12) means that he suffers no mishap. His Event
roll is 42: Mahran is finally sent deep undercover to investigate
the activities of a criminal syndicate bank rolled by the Black Star
Brigade. Mahran must roll Deception 8+ (5), and so he must now roll
on the Mishap table from either the Rogue or Citizen careers from

the Traveller main rules; the Referee suggests Rogue, and Mahran's
roll (3) sees him being betrayed by someone he considered a friend.
The Black Star Brigade now know who Mahran is, and, as he has the
entire Black Star Brigade as an enemy, Mahran has no option but
to abort his mission and get as far away as he can from this most
dangerous and persistent foe. Mahran gains a new Enemy, and he
decides this will be Fetcher Lyndt, a local crime boss. Once he has
managed to get away from the Black Star Brigade, and considered
his options, Mahran decides that he will conclude his unfinished
business with both Lyndt once and for all...

For his final promotion roll Mahran scores (11) and leaves the Scouts
with the rank of Operations Leader, and a further level of Leadership
skill. He also rolls on the Personal Development table and gains +1
Int.. His characteristics and skills on mustering out are:

Mahran Schaeffer, ex-Scout (5 terms), 36 years
Str 8 (+0), Dex 4 (–1), End 4 (–1), Int 8 (+0), Edu 10 (+1), Soc 8 (+0)
Astrogation 1, Comms 3, Computers 0, Gun Combat (slug pistol)
1, Leadership 2, Life Sciences (Cybernetics) 1, Navigation 0, Pilot
(spacecraft) 1, Sensors 0, Space Science (planetology) 2, Streetwise
0, Survival 1, Vacc Suit 0, Zero G 0.

He is entitled to 5 Benefits rolls for his terms of service, plus 3
for his rank – 8 rolls in total, and a +1DM to rolls made. Mahran
rolls on the Special Operations branch Mustering Out table, using
his maximum 3 rolls for cash benefits (3+1, 3+1 and 5+1) to gain
Cr80,000. His Other Benefits rolls are: 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. Mahran takes
Gun Combat 1 to raise his Gun Combat (slug pistol) to 2, and also
takes a Snub Pistol. His rolls of 4, 5 and 6, he applies his +1DM to
give 5, 6 and 7. Mahran emerges from the Scouts with 3 Ship Shares
and a Type S Scout – the Mercury Rising , no less - on loan, although
his Ship Shares will be used to buy Mercury Rising from the Scout
service at some point.

Mahran also has enemies in the shape of Fetcher Lyndt and the
Black Star Brigade. He still walks with a limp after his space accident
in the rescue mission, and the theft of his survey techniques have
left him bitter and vengeful. That idealistic young man who craved
travel, away from his asteroid habitat, is no more; in his place is
a grizzled, clever, street-wise, communications expert who knows
how to lead specialist teams. He has money in the bank, and a ship
of his own.

Mahran Schaeffer has scores to settle...

##### CREATING A SCOUT TRAVELLER

An advantage of serving with the Scouts is that the Scout service
often needs to call on the skills and expertise of its retired personnel.
Scouts have the opportunity to train and develop in very broad areas,
affording them a portfolio of diverse skills. Furthermore, as Scout
activities take personnel on very long voyages to very distant places,
the existing, active ranks can be easily depleted. The answer is to
call upon retired personnel to return for one-off missions. To ensure
compliance, the enlistment process when first joining the Scouts
makes it clear that retired personnel can be recalled to active duty
at any time, and that ignoring that summons comes with certain
penalties (see page 26).

Additionally, in wartime, many scout services are militarized and
activated as auxiliary forces attached to regular military formations
and groups. Most typically this involves utilizing the extensive
surveillance activities in tactical and strategic situations; however,
their in depth knowledge of cultures and planets may also be tapped
to assist military operations or recruit, organize or soften up and
disrupt locals before or instead of direct military action. Most of the
missions described below can be recast as military missions by the
referee as needed. In general, scouts are recalled for the duration of
the conflict, and posted within military formations (generally they
are provided with a courtesy rank as appropriate). Pay and benefits
are unchanged from standard peacetime reactivation.

This chapter describes Scout Missions for retired Scout characters.
It effectively places the Scout service in the role of patron, and acts
as a catalyst for Traveller adventures. The system presented here is
akin to the Ticket system from Mercenary – the overall process is
largely the same – but with subtle differences to reflect the broad
remit of the Scout service.

## TOTAL RECALL

Scouts are recalled to service in many different ways. Here are the
three most common.

- Scout Information Network: SIN. This electronic bulletin board
    is monitored by Special Operations and every Scout, active or
    retired, is automatically given a SIN account, allowing messages
    to be posted. SIN generally operates as a direct information net
    within a system, and data communications between systems
    are given priority on xboat or courier communications routes. If
    SIN is used to recall a Scout, he will usually be directed to the
    nearest Scout base where mission details will be given, and the
    contract negotiated with the administration team.
- Special Operations Contact: Scout Spec Ops operatives have,
    as a routine part of their work, the task of tracking and recalling
    retired Scouts. Typically a Scout will be approached either by
    a known Spec Ops contact, or will be contacted to arrange a
    meeting (which may be at a scout base or a public location,
    such as a hotel or bar). The Spec Ops agent will usually have
    full mission details and have been given authority to negotiate
    specifics of the mission and the remuneration package.
- Scout Base Protocol: If a retired Scout is passing through
    a space port that is in the vicinity of a Scout Base, standard
    security procedures at the space port will arrange for the ex-
    Scout to be directed through fast-track channels which result in
    the Scout being taken directly to the Scout Base. Here, Admin
    teams outline the mission and negotiate its terms.

The degree of secrecy involved in recalling a Scout depends on the
sensitivity of the mission. Survey, Exploration and Courier missions
are often highly routine with little or no secrecy needed. However
Contact and Special Operations missions may be highly sensitive,
with espionage-service levels of secrecy and discretion being
employed to protect the mission's (and its personnel's) safety.

Any Scout who refuses a mission without good cause risks a fine of
Cr20,000 or 2 years imprisonment. Obviously there is a chance that
he can talk his way out of an assignment without incurring either
penalty. Refusing an assignment without obvious or good cause
and dodging the repercussions is a Diplomacy or Persuasion task if
the rejection is based on good cause; but is Very Difficult (-4) if not.
In wartime, an additional -2 is applied to both situations.. Note the
Effect of the attempt:

# SSCOUTCOUT M MISSIONSISSIONS

Keeping Tabs
The identity papers and cards all ex-servicemen carry identify
retired Scouts as such. Every spaceport an ex-Scout passes
through notes his presence; hotel rooms record how long he
is staying for and in which room; in other words, the Scout
service (and typically the Covert Surveillance teams of Special
Operations Branch) knows where its retired personnel are, have
been, or are likely to be. It can track you down, even over long
distances, and if you have the skills and expertise it requires
for a particular assignment, it will go to great lengths to find
you. A small though crucial part of the xboat system is devoted
to keeping local scout stations updated as to the presence and
status of retired scouts, and similarly, to keep central scout
offices apprised of the location of same.

Most retired Scouts understand this and do not try to hide from
the Scout service, or avoid being recalled. The Scout service pays
well and offers a steady stream of work on terms that can be
negotiated. If a retired Scout has associates that will be an asset to
the mission, then the Scout service will generally consider hiring
them too – if it can be proved that they will add value. Similarly,
the scout service has no motivation to force compliance from a
retired scout who is genuinely unable or incapable of carrying out
a needed assignment.

### MISSION STRUCTURE

Scout missions follow a similar structure to Mercenary tickets:
characters have the opportunity to negotiate and influence on
some of the finer details. The employer is always the Scout service,
with the branch that performs the recall acting in sole regard for
the mission, but according to standard Scout service contracts and
protocols.

Employee Details
The focus of the mission contract is the ex-Scout. He is named
as the Primary Contact and is used as the leader of record for the
mission even if, in reality, another member of the team will act as
leader. The ex-Scout therefore carries the full responsibility for the
mission's success.

It is at this stage that the ex-Scout names those who will be drafted into
the mission, although the ex-Scout must vouch for each mission member
he intends to draft into the frame, summarising their credentials and
experience. The Scout service always has veto over mission members
and, if members of a group are not thought to be acceptable, then the
contract can be terminated at this stage. Alternatively, if the mission
requires other, retired Scouts, they will be named and drafted in at
the Employee details stage, so that specialized ex-Scout teams can be
assembled and controlled in a contracted framework.

The Primary Contact may use Advocate, Broker or Admin to convince
the employer of the suitability of those he intends to draft into the
mission. A roll of 8+ per additional mission member is needed to
successfully convince the Scout service of their credentials. Non
Scouts are paid a standard two thirds of the ex-Scout's mission fee:
this is generally non-negotiable unless the additional members have
particularly valuable skills for the mission, in which case the fee may
rise to 90% of the Primary Contact's fee, but never exceed it.

Note that in wartime, non-scouts need not participate, but once they
agree to do so, they are treated as civilian volunteer auxiliaries to the
scout service, and qualify for 90% pay in all cases. This status is for
the duration of the emergency or activating event, and requires a very
difficult (-4) roll against Admin to leave service before deactivation:
note the result and apply to the above mission rejection table.

Service Required
Arguably the most important section on any mission, this is where
the actual business of the contract is listed. Unlike other areas
of the mission, where ambiguity might be useful, the services
section needs to be as detailed as possible for the benefit of both
parties. If the services are drafted too vaguely, the mission could be
misinterpreted and the job done improperly. The employer wants
the mission to be precise in order to get the job done right; the
employee wants the service to be explained as plainly and specific
as it can be. The result is hopefully a clear image of exactly what
they have to do to get paid. This is relevant to both peacetime and
wartime activation.

Pre-Mission Support
There are some missions that require special equipment or services
to occur before the employee can begin to fulfil the services. Some
employers will understand this fact and arrange for this special
support as part of the mission assignment process. If a mission's
services are going to be difficult without certain gear the employer is
frequently expected to at least offer the funds to equip themselves,
if not the equipment itself.

If a local Scout base can supply the agreed equipment, then it can be
drawn from stores. Otherwise the Scout base assumes responsibility
for ordering it and the team will need to wait until all equipment is
available before the mission can commence.

Post-Mission Support
Things unfortunately happen while in the course of a mission's
fulfilment that cannot always be expected, and sometimes the
employer makes ready for that. Items attached to a mission like
assisted health care, rearmament fees, or something as simple
as evacuation transportation can be placed under post-mission
support. This section of a Scout mission is dedicated to what the
employer is willing to do for the employee after a mission's service
has been met, beyond simple financial payment.

##### SCOUT MISSIONS SSCOUTCOUT M MISSIONSISSIONS

The Scout service has a standard Post-Mission Support template
which includes the following elements:

- Medical expenses for 6 months after the conclusion of the
    mission.
- Repatriation process should the mission need to be extracted
    from a difficult situation. This is handled by Special Operations.
- Legal fees for 6 months after the conclusion of the mission.
- Family financial support for one year for the Primary Contact
    if the Primary Contact is unable to work owing to the
    circumstances of the mission.

The Primary Contact can use Advocate or Broker to improve upon these
terms depending on the success of the roll. Additional team members
are not allowed to participate in this section of the contract.

Compensation Package
Unless the Primary Contact has negotiated a higher compensation
package, the salary paid is as follows:

### CREATING MISSIONS

This section cover the process of creating a Scout service mission
step by step, in much the same way as Mercenary covers the creation
of mercenary tickets.

STEP ONE – EMPLOYER DETAILS
This is always the Scout service, but separate branches decide
upon and administrate their own missions. A branch will usually
recall someone who has served in its ranks before, but this is not
an absolute pre-requisite. A retired Scout may find himself being
recalled by a branch that he had no previous contact with whilst a
serving Scout. If a random branch is required, roll 2D and consult
the following table:

EMPLOYER DETAILS
2d62d6 BranchBranch
2-3 Contact
4-6 Courier
7-9 Exploration
10 Special Operations
11-12 Survey

STEP TWO – EMPLOYEE DETAILS
This is in the hands of the branch doing the recall and recruiting. The
branch may require specific skills, knowledge or experience, or simply
need a reliable person to organise and administrate the mission on
their behalf. Where specifics are needed, it is an opportunity for the
Primary Contact to negotiate a higher compensation package or
improved post-mission support terms.

STEP THREE – SERVICE REQUIRED
Scout missions are always highly specific and work to SMART
principles:

S – Specified goals and objectives
M – Measurable in terms of outcomes and deliverables
A – Achievable, in terms of risk and outcome
R – Reasonable, in terms of what is expected of the recalled Scout
T – Time-constrained. Time limits and deadlines are always attached
to any Scout mission

When creating Scout missions, Referees should keep the SMART
principles in mind; the Scout service has finite reserves and, whilst
it has a broad remit, is constrained in the areas it can operate. If it
oversteps this remit, then others, such as the Army or Navy, may
be engaged to perform the same activity with a much lower cost
and risk.

Each branch of the Scout service has specific mission types it can
recruit for, and the tables in this section define these mission types
by branch.

The Mission Type column names the kind of mission a branch will
require. The Compensation Multiplier is the factor that can be applied
to the payable salary if the Primary Contact can make a Broker 8+
throw. The Compensation Multiplier is applied only to the ex-Scout's
compensation; if he wants to increase the salary for non-Scouts, he
must make separate Broker 9+ rolls for each team member.

CONTACT MISSIONS
Contact missions fall into two general categories: first contact and
re-contact. Both are discussed in detail below. What is important
to note is that the main definition of a contact mission is not
necessarily revealing the presence of the larger universe to the
natives (although this can be the goal); rather, it is physical contact

##### SCOUT MISSIONS SCOUT MISSIONS

with the culture by scout agents, and is generally defined by “Boots
on the ground” surveillance rather than covert orbital survey. Thus,
many first contact missions have an extended period of extremely
covert investigation of the culture; often involving secretly inserting
survey personnel into the culture where possible. In particular,
direct human surveillance is often preferable to drone or robotic
survey when assessing low tech cultures

First Contact
The mission involves making first contact with a new alien race. It
will require the team working with existing Contact branch operatives
and generally in a support function unless the Primary Contact has
particular expertise that determines he should take a lead role in the
overall mission. It is important to note that this contact may or may
not be covert, ranging from a very limited direct study followed by
gradual expansion of contact to the classic “saucers appearing over
government buildings on worldwide feed” model. Again, contact is
defined by actual presence on the planet in question.

Re-Contact
The mission involves establishing contact with a neglected, isolated
or forgotten outpost, colony or planet. Re-contact missions can be
highly sensitive; contact might have been severed acrimoniously,
and re-contact may require delicate negotiations and attention to
local sensitivities and sensibilities. Re-contact teams have been held
as ransom collateral in return for other benefits – financial, political
or technological. As with first contact, this may be covert or overt.

Holding Diplomacy
First Contact and Re-contact assignments often require a Holding
Diplomacy element. Holding diplomacy involves establishing
rudimentary, but effective, diplomatic structures (framework
agreements for trade; expressions of interest in scientific matters,
and establishing embassies and the like) whilst a full diplomatic
corps is assembled and sent to take over the full ambassadorial
responsibility. The Scout service provides such 'holding' functions,
relinquishing them once a full diplomatic team comes into force. The
Contact branch briefs the diplomatic corps, transfers its knowledge
and acts in a transitional capacity before withdrawing altogether.
This is again sensitive and delicate work requiring individual skilled
in establishing relationships and setting the groundwork for future
co-operation.

Translation
The Scout service has an extensive Translations wing which,
depending on Tech Level, is backed-up by powerful translation
software and equipment. These missions involve the Scout service
acting purely in a translation capacity, using linguistics teams to
accurately convey meaning and nuance in the transcription of
new or little understood languages. While translation software is
generally available and accurate, the scout services generally prefers
to use human agencies in combination with automated or artificial
communication protocols.

Liaison
As relations with new races or re-contacted outposts are developed,
the Scout service retains a liaison role to support whatever systems
are put into place for future communications. As the Scout service is
skilled in dealing with new discoveries and managing the important
early stages that follow them, advisers from Contact are assigned
to governmental, diplomatic and military bodies to provide counsel
and guidance. Often, a liaison officer will be required to administer
and or make decisions for local organizations and polities far beyond
his usual level of authority.

xBoat – general messenger
In civilizations with no FTL communications, the Scout service
offers a constant message transit service across the space lanes,
ferrying general communications, mail, orders and so forth to
distant planets. It then collects the same and takes the messages
to the next destination. The Scout base for a system acts as the

##### SCOUT MISSIONS SSCOUTCOUT M MISSIONSISSIONS

sorting office for mail, providing encryption, security scanning and
so on, before designating which cargo of messages is assigned
to which vessel. Scout xBoats generally stick to fixed routes in
order to optimize the time for message despatch and delivery, but
sometimes will undertake bespoke messaging missions that are off
the beaten track or require special attention. In these cases, retired
Scouts are often recalled and used to minimise disruption to the
standing xBoat service.

If a recalled Scout has a capable ship, then he is expected to use it:
any Scout who leaves the service with an entire ship has it under
loan, and must return its use if called upon. The Scout service
pays all fuel, maintenance and spaceport costs, but the owner is
expected to provide the crew. If the Scout does not have a ship of
the appropriate type or speed required, he is loaned one for the
duration of the mission.

xBoat – secure messenger
Whilst most military arms have their own messenger services, the
Scout service is frequently called upon to relay important military
information between systems, especially where military vessels
may be vulnerable to interception. The Scout service uses its own
encryption logarithms quite separate from military encryption
(although to a military level), and its fleet of unmarked fast courier
vessels mean that the Scouts often provide a more attractive secure
messaging service than a military's own. Occasionally the Scouts
find themselves ferrying communiqués that the military wants
to disavow and are therefore better conveyed under independent
auspices.

Non-military parties, such as corporations, governments and wealthy
individuals also hire the Scout service to take secure messages on
their behalf.

Secure messenger missions usually involve ferrying military or
highly sensitive information on non-standard routes, to a specific
destination (sometimes even a named individual) and to specific
timescales. Retired Scouts are recalled for such missions because
disavowing their involvement is easier, and because it places no
strain on the existing service infrastructure. However recalled
Scouts who are taken on for such missions usually have to sign
many disclaimers and agree to limitations in repatriation packages,
depending on the nature of the material being conveyed.

Relay
Where messages need to be taken over very long distances, xBoats
rendezvous with a Relay station, which is a remote Scout base where
messages are left or downloaded and then picked-up by another
ship which continues the message run. Relay stations are also used
to disperse disparate messages that can travel a certain portion of
a route aboard a single xBoat but must then be distributed along
separate routes by other ships.

Ciphers: Peacetime
Generally, xboat traffic must be encrypted upon receipt regardless
of the source; later cryptographic and compression transformations
are applied as needed, and requested by the scout service. This
obviously can be waived for military and diplomatic transmissions,
especially in wartime.

The Scout's Cipher division of the Courier branch specializes in
encoding and decoding messages to specific security requirements.
Its cipher algorithms are internally designed and highly respected.
Even basic messages are usually encrypted at a reasonable level
to ensure privacy. In peacetime, Cipher missions generally involve
the Scout encrypting and decrypting ciphers at a Scout base or
Relay station. The work is there to deal with a backlog or provide
additional support.

Ciphers: Wartime
Cipher missions during wartime are far riskier. This is the encoding
of messages to a particular, military grade cipher, transporting
the message into hostile territory and then deciphering it for the
recipient. This assignment seldom involves the retired scout in the
encryption process, but rather involves him in the physical delivery
of the message. The ciphers used are known only be the deliverer

- so the ex-Scout brought in to handle this level of mission is
expected to be skilled in survival techniques as he is likely to be
entering highly hazardous conditions.

Special Communications
Special communications missions are those designated with a
high-security, high-priority status, usually requiring delivery of the
information in a special format (such as a memory implant or other,
highly specialized medium) to a named individual. These missions
generally have high levels of risk, even during peacetime, and may
require the carrier to agree to a raft of waivers in return for a much
higher than usual completion fee. If the carrier is working with a
team, then the mission may have a more routine cover with other
members of the team being completely unaware of the true nature
of the task.

##### SSCOUTCOUT M MISSIONSISSIONS SCOUT MISSIONS

detailed survey team (which may or may not include the original
exploration team) is sent-in to take an in-depth look.

Planet Exploration
Planet Survey missions involve the reconnaissance of a new or
barely known world. On a 2d6 roll of 7+ , the mission is the fairly
common version which requires undertaking the survey from orbit.
If the result is from 4-6, the survey will require actual landing to
assess physical parameters or anomalies.
on a 2-3 result, there is a specific anomaly which must be
investigated, other than from orbit (surface based, subterranean,
undersea and so on) the survey from high orbit with a few dips
into the atmosphere, but otherwise to refrain from landing unless
specific orders are given to do so. Orbital missions may be framed in
terms of general objectives: to understand the general atmospheric
conditions, geology, geography, tectonic activity, and so forth, or
may have a more specific nature – to search for particular natural
resources, for example, or assess the suitability for habitation. In
general, missions involving a landing will have specific goals, and
will not also require the more general (but extensive) investigation
on a planetwide basis. In many cases, reports from a previous orbital
Survey will be available (5+)

System Exploration
A system survey is a high-level sweep around and through an
entire solar system, noting the position and orbits of planets, gas
giants, asteroid belts and other stellar features, but stopping short
of individual planetary surveys. The survey team will be under
instruction to note the trajectories of comets, the characteristics
of planets and their satellites and, naturally, the star itself. These
are lengthy missions by their very nature and seek to establish the
overall picture of a solar system that will be supplemented by more
detailed surveys later.

Anomaly Exploration
Anomaly surveys are missions designed to investigate particular
stellar anomalies, such as scientifically important stars exhibiting
rare characteristics, or the investigation of rare astronomical events.
Again, these tend to be long-term missions and may even form part
of a System Survey mission.

Artefact Exploration
As this mission suggests, it involves the study of discovered artefacts:
either located on a planet or space-born. Like all exploration missions,
artefact study missions are deliberately high-level 'what is it, how
old is it, what might it do?' reconnaissance trips designed to assess
and quantify risk before the detailed scientific study groups from
Survey or third party agencies become involved. They are, however,
secretive missions. Any newly discovered piece of technology is an
exciting find and, as the item might yield considerable wealth, the
Scout service is at pains to keep its work a secret from exploitative
eyes until the time it has to hand over the study to others.

Cultural Exploration
The high-level study of a new culture. A frequent goal is to assess
the cultural suitability or tolerance for overt contact. Before the
Contact branch becomes involved, using First Contact protocols,
the Scouts commence a study of the civilization to define its relative
technology level, military capability, and so forth. The mission is
forbidden to make contact, and so it is a covert operation as far
as it possibly can be. Much of the work is done from orbit and as
discretely as possible. If a civilization under study has spacefaring
capabilities, then Contact might be called in sooner rather than
later, but otherwise the study notes and assesses what it can
before passing the data onto Contact and offering a full briefing
to the Contact teams that will establish formal communications
with the species.

Covert Exploration
This covers any mission where stealthy exploration is needed. This
might form an advanced reconnaissance for any of the other Scout
branches or one of the military services. A stealth-equipped ship is
essential (see page 56), and the surveillance equipment is cutting
edge. It should be noted that this differs somewhat from classic
wartime or hostile relations espionage. Generally a covert survey
involves a much smaller target, one which may or may not be aware
of the larger universe or the Scout services polity. Wartime and high
level hostile espionage is generally subsumed under Special Ops
missions described below. If a covert Exploration team is detected,
it can expect to be disavowed unless its presence can be explained
without damaging political or military repercussions.

Special Operations missions are often conducted within newly
discovered or re-contacted societies where surveillance and
espionage operations are deemed an essential part of forging a
stable relationship – as counterproductive and contrary as that
might seem. They also reflect the assignments that scouts receive
when war heats up, or when diplomatic relationships are decaying
or actively hostile. These missions should not be confused with
the kind of espionage and spying missions members of the Agent
career undertake; they are concerned with societies that are newly
contacted and therefore within the Scout's sphere of influence, or
with the scouts activation as a military service in wartime or in times
of emergency.

##### SCOUT MISSIONS SCOUT MISSIONS

Undercover – Military and Political
These missions generally involve a Scout operative gaining
acceptance within a specific group of people to advance political
or military knowledge. Posing as civilian members of a separate
agency, the operative's chief regard is to gain the trust of the group
and then to discreetly extract, and feedback, as much information
as possible. Missions of this nature may take months to establish
as trust is gained, but be over within days or weeks once the
information required has been gathered. Note that this also covers
contact missions involving physically infiltrating a newly discovered
civilization Missions of this nature are rare; and naturally exceedingly
difficult, and so missions of this type are only undertaken by recalled
personnel in the most pressing of circumstances.

Covert Surveillance – Military and Political
Covert surveillance missions are remote spying and eavesdropping
missions, turning the Scout's survey, linguistics and cipher
technology to espionage ends. Operatives track and monitor the
movements and communications of a designated target, either
planetside or, more commonly, from a suitably equipped orbiting
vessel. The mission might entail general communications monitoring
to establish the nuances of a political or military situation, but
usually a specific goal is attached to the monitoring activity. The
classic example of such a mission is the cold war “fishing trawlers”
of the KGB or the CIA. Other situations may involve the scouts in
direct surveillance and recon work for a hot war.

Espionage – Military and Political
Where covert surveillance or undercover work are insufficient,
espionage tactics are employed. These are specific missions with
varied contents, ranging from trailing a target, through to gaining
access to secret documents and copying them, and up to blackmail
and honeytrap operations. Again, such missions are rare and not to

be confused with the work of the Agents career, but do occur from
time to time. Special Operatives might be called upon to change
the progress of a war, a political situation or even the development
of a society, depending on the local circumstances and the overall
agenda of their home civilization. Operatives may spend weeks,
months or years in the field, working both undercover and in covert
operations to bring about their mission's success.

On the face of it Survey missions might seem very similar to
Exploration missions. However, Survey missions tend to be very
specialized, medium to long-term engagements. Survey teams focus
on one particular subject and delve into its nature exhaustively.
Most survey missions are highly scientific in nature and require
specialists in their particular fields: the outcomes of missions can
make reputations, alter scientific thinking and reveal remarkable
insights into a planet, a star, its system or its galaxy.

Planet Survey
Planet Survey missions involve the detailed surveying of a new or
barely known world. The mission team is required to undertake
lengthy surveys from both high orbit with and the surface, working
with the initial reports provided by the Exploration teams. The
outputs of the survey mission will inform future views and missions,
including colonization programs and terraforming: accuracy is
therefore essential.

System Survey
A system survey focuses on a particular facet of a solar system and
works to understand it completely. This might be the trajectory
of a comet, the orbit of a gas giant around its sun, measuring the
legrange points of a gas giant, mapping a moon, or studying the
chemical reactions happening within a newly formed or dying star.
Whatever the subject, the work is exhaustive, with missions crews
spending long periods in space, often at the far reaches of known
space territories.

Anomaly Survey
Stellar and interstellar peculiarities are the focus of anomaly surveys.
Picking up from a high level expedition, the survey team focuses
one hundred percent on the nature of the anomaly, attempting
to understand, define and then predict its nature and behaviour.
Depending on the anomaly, a comet with particular characteristics,
a dying star, a neutron star, dark matter and so forth, this could be
dangerous work.

##### SSCOUTCOUT M MISSIONSISSIONS SCOUT MISSIONS

Any starport of class D or above has the chance of hosting a Scout
base according to the following table:

Starport ClassStarport Class 2D throw for Scout Base Presence2D throw for Scout Base Presence
A 10+
B8+
C8+
D7+

As the class of the starport rises, there is a lesser need for the
facilities Scout bases traditionally offer to both Scouts and other
spacelane shipping. Therefore Class A starports are less likely to
agree to a Scout base being sighted on the premises or close-by
because it can offer fuel refining and a host of other services at a far
more competitive cost.

When a Scout base is present, its facilities are determined by its
own Scout Base Class. Facilities offered are generally inversely
proportional to the class of the starport. Roll 2D and apply the
relevant DMs to determine the Scout Base Class.

- Berthing and launch of Scout vessels
- Refuelling and fuel purification
- Message deposit, collection and dispersal
- Mission briefing and debriefing
- Scout and ex-Scout accommodation, social and recreation
    facilities

Artefact Survey
Artefact surveys are usually conducted in-situ but may, on occasion,
involve bringing an artefact back to a Scout base or specially hired
laboratory. Either way, this is the exhaustive study of any kind of
artefact, be it a building, architectural curio, satellite, probe, city,
tomb or weapon. The missions are, again, scientifically specialized
and very often long-term as the aim is to fully understand the object
under scrutiny.

Cultural Survey
Civilization surveys require the survey teams to embed themselves
within the society under scrutiny. Experts in social behaviour,
political behaviour, linguistics, biology, psychology and all manner
of life sciences spend anything up to a year or more, ingrained within
a newly discovered society, learning its structures, beliefs, practices
and cultural framework. This type of mission typically follows an
exploration mission, and precedes a contact mission. This is one
of the few non-contact branch missions that may involve actual
interaction with the culture in question, although all such contact
will be covert.

Covert Survey
Covert survey missions operate in hostile or potentially hostile territory
and may be any of the above missions, but are conducted in absolute
secrecy. The Scout service ensures that appropriate equipment is
placed at the disposal of the covert survey team, but otherwise the
risks are high, especially where the chance of capture is heightened.
This may involve deep penetration or behind the lines recon missions
in wartime; or in peacetime, standard survey missions in hostile
areas, or actively isolate or xenophobic cultures.

### SCOUT BASES

Any society operating a Scout service, and capable of interstellar
flight, deploys Scout bases across its area of operations.

Bases vary in size and range of functions, but offer a range of
standard services:

- Berthing and launch of Scout vessels
- Refuelling and fuel purification
- Message deposit, collection and dispersal
- Mission briefing and debriefing
- Scout and ex-Scout accommodation, social and recreation
    facilities

Most bases are located within, or close to, a spaceport, sometimes
with shared facilities, depending of the class of the base, but usually
with independent facilities.

Berthing
Every Scout Base has excellent berthing facilities. These include
centrally controlled, semi-intelligent approach, docking and landing
instrumentation, landing bays and areas to accommodate hulls of
up to 500 tons, cargo loading and unloading equipment (lifters,
drones and robots), and repair facilities. Repair facilities are a staple
of the berthing services: Scout vessels of all sizes undertake long
and frequent journeys and so maintenance, servicing and general
repair are essential at any base.

- Class A and B bases can handle complex repairs to flight
    systems, life support, weapons, specialized equipment, drives
    and auxiliary systems.
- Class C bases can handle all the above with the exception of
    specialized equipment, although the expertise and tools needed to
    effect repairs can be brought-in given time and sufficient notice.
- Class D and E bases cannot offer repairs for specialized
    equipment or weapon systems, although, like Class C bases,
    can import such facilities given time and notice.

Serving Scouts receive all maintenance and repair services free of
charge. Retired Scouts must pay, but do so at a lower rate than for
standard starport maintenance charges. Scout bases offer retired
Scouts maintenance at 0.075% of the vessel's total cost.

Fuel Refining
Every base offers fuel refining and refuelling as a standard service.
Serving Scouts receive refined fuel, and may have any unrefined fuel
they carry refined, free of charge. Retired Scouts qualify for refined
fuel at a cost of Cr350 per ton, and having unrefined fuel treated
at a cost of Cr100 per ton. Scout bases never offer unrefined fuel;
the chance of a mis-jump or other accident associated with using
unrefined fuel is a risk the Scout service is unwilling to undertake.

Message Services
All bases except Class E offer messaging services: that is, the
collection of messages (this includes transmissions, documents/
manuscripts, packages, parcels and other larger materials) brought

by xBoat or other Scout vessel, and then either transmitted, using
long-range (either laser or maser communicators) comms devices,
or carried through to the final destination within the system using
in-system craft (such as a launch, pinnace or shuttle – see the Small
Craft section of the Traveller main rules, page 132 – 133).

Any message is automatically scanned for potential dangers,
using excellent quality X-Ray, radar, thermal imaging, radiation
detection, bio-hazard detection and anti-virus equipment. Every
message is subjected a barrage of checks before it is released, and
any encryption is verified against standing Scout service security
software to ensure veracity. If a message is believed to pose any
potential danger it is erased or destroyed, with a full log and report
being issued to both sender and recipient as to the nature of the
danger detected. Where messages are of a secret or highly sensitive
nature (the level of encryption and associated metadata and security
used indicates this), then the Messaging team uses its highest-
level Scout operatives to handle the message's distribution and
dissemination. Scout bases are renowned for their discretion and
rigorous, trustworthy security procedures and it is rare for breaches
of the extensive security protocols to take place.

Alternatively, the base offers a notification system to those awaiting
messages so that the recipient can arrange to come to the base and
collect the message personally. The Messaging Centre contains a
series of private areas where messages can be collected/displayed/
opened in complete privacy. Those arriving in person to collect
or view messages are subject to a screening and verification
process, involving, where necessary, fingerprint, iris, voice and
DNA recognition systems to identify the recipient. See Messaging
Equipment on page 49 for more details.

Messaging costs are born by the sender. However, if personal
collection is required, the Scout base levies a charge based on the
type and security of the message being handled. Private citizens,
corporations and military services have to pay for these facilities: it
is a considerable source of revenue for the Scout Service.

Military bases in a system generally have an account with the Scout
base, as might corporations and government agencies. Discounts
are offered for frequent message handling.

Mission Briefing and Debriefing
All bases operate mission briefing and debriefing services. This is
essentially a bureau service where serving and recalled Scouts can
be issued with orders, arrange contracts, and debriefed on particular
assignments. Larger bases (Class C and above) have a team of
dedicated mission briefing operatives whilst smaller bases have
only one or two trained mission briefing personnel to handle the
administration and intelligence gathering/dissemination required for
a mission. Class A and B bases offer psychiatric facilities in addition
to the standard de/briefing functions, and these are employed on a
regular basis as part of routine check-ups for serving Scouts who
have been engaged on long or arduous missions.

Accommodation
The standard and style of accommodation tends to reflect the
class of the Scout Base. Class A bases have private staterooms,
en-suite, with personal communications channels and equipment,
whilst Class D and E have shared dormitories and only the
most basic facilities for food and hygiene. Serving Scouts are
entitled to free accommodation; retired scouts are entitled to
accommodation if available, but are charged at a standard rate of
Cr10 per night for the most basic accommodation and up to Cr20
for higher class accommodation. Whilst Class D and E bases do
not necessarily offer accommodation for retired Scouts, if room
is available it will generally be made so – although serving Scouts
always take priority.

Social and Recreation Facilities
As serving bases, social and recreation facilities tend to be minimal:
one does not find casinos or high-class restaurants in any Scout
Base; but the quality and range is, again, dependent on the class
of the base. A typical Class A base will have, for example, a gym,
a reasonable restaurant and bar, and sometimes a sports hall,
small leisure area (with gambling/gaming machines) and, if the
technology supports it, facilities such as a small holodeck or Virtual
Reality facility. Class D and E bases will have a basic canteen serving
pre-prepared and reconstituted rations and limited stocks of alcohol
or other stimulants (depending on the Law Level of the system and
the attitudes towards them).

Scientific Facilities
Class A, B and C bases offer scientific facilities: that is, fully
equipped laboratories, with trained staff, to handle Space and
Planetary sciences. Class A and B bases operate full astronomical
observatories with a range of telescopes (radio, optical, mass
spectrometry, and so forth) for system and interstellar mapping.
Anyone with expertise in Space or Planetary sciences will find the
facilities they require for extensive laboratory research necessary
after field research is completed at A and B class Scout bases.
Class C bases are somewhat more limited in their capabilities,
but are still good enough to support most Space and Planetary
fields of study.

Class A bases also support cipher and linguistics laboratories. These
specialized branches examine little known or newly discovered
languages in an attempt to conduct a translation and also have the
facilities to create and analyse ciphers and codes across a multitude
of levels: from the most basic up to military-grade, multi-layered,
digitally protected, encryption techniques. It can take months or
years for a linguistics lab to complete its work, depending on what is
being studied, and the bulk of their work is concerned with ciphers
and encryption/decryption. However where language translation is
required, linguistics specialists from across the Scout service might
be brought into one place to study a language intimately in a bid to
understand its characteristics, nuances and structures to formulate
working dictionaries and translation equipment.

Medical Facilities
Every base can provide basic first aid care, but only Class A and B
bases have anything approaching true hospital care – and even then
facilities are limited by the size of the base and the availability of
dedicated medical expertise. Where a base has a hospital wing, it is
generally only large enough to handle 2d6 patients at any one time.
The hospital wing has an operating theatre and surgical equipment
(either fully automated, depending on tech level, or requiring
human surgeons), and a small Intensive Care Unit and basic trauma
facilities. However, advanced medical care for diseases, extremely
serious injuries and other life-threatening conditions are beyond
the Scout base's scope. What a Scout base hospital can do is save
and preserve life before arranging for transportation to a hospital
capable of handling the rest of the care.

Serving Scouts receive any hospital care free of charge. Retired
Scouts may use the facilities at the standard charge as outlined on
page 94 of the Traveller rules.

Ships at Scout Bases
The Scout service operates many types of vessel, but most commonly
the Type S Scout. The ships that can be found docked or available at
a Scout base depend on the base's class. The table below shows the
chance of the type of ship being present (a 2D roll), following by the dice
code to determine the number of vessels present at any given time:

All vessels appear in the Traveller rules Spacecraft section.

Whilst the ubiquitous Type S is the commonly used and seen ship, Scout bases use a variety of vessels according to the needs of the
mission. Type A Free Traders are used for certain messaging runs and moving cargo; Laboratory Ships are used for scientific missions and
are outfitted for long periods within star systems. Launches, Pinnaces, Shuttles and Cutters are all used within systems for short-haul trips,
reducing the wear and tear on the workhorse Type S.

Most ships are either engaged in active service or are undergoing routine maintenance (usually a third of ships berthed are undergoing
some form of dry-dock work). A serving or recalled Scout that has to undertake a particular mission will be assigned a Type S unless a ship of
a different type is essential to the mission's outcome. If a Scout character wants to requisition a ship of a type different to the one assigned,
he must roll Admin, Broker of Persuasion 8+ to convince the Mission Briefing Officer of the compelling need.

### SCOUT BASE CYGNUS X-3: SAMPLE

### SCOUT BASE

Cygnus X-3 is a typical Class A or B base attached to a Class B or
C starport. The starport is a standard interstellar port authority
installation; as relations with the local government are good, and
conditions on the planet adequate, there is minimum security along
the perimeter line around the port. The Scout Service maintains its
own section, including repair facilities and security.

The starport/scoutbase authorities have a limited number of
unarmed small craft available. These are five shuttles and a pair
of 50 ton modular cutters. These are unarmed and are used in a
wide range of operations which include orbit to surface shuttling
and refuelling. Additionally, two type R400 ton non-jump merchants
regularly travel between planet and the nearest gas giant. The Port
corporation also has several grav vehicles at the base for use with
their cargo and passenger transports.

The starport/scout base complex is defended by minor ground
based planetary defences. These consist of a single deep-site H
meson gun (with a type 9 computer) and a series of surface sensor
sites, some of which are concealed. These sites are guarded by
either government troops or sanctioned mercenaries. The troops
guarding the Port authority HQ and other starport sites are hired
corporate security forces which the Scout service part funds. Both
sets of troops are well-armed and prone to shoot long before they
even think of asking questions.

Cygnus X-3 maintains one survey scout, three Type S Scouts, two
Type S Scout/Couriers, and two small non-jump ships. The small
craft are a pinnace, and a modular cutter. The base also has an
(off the record) gig from a destroyed Gazelle class escort, which
has been extensively customized. The base maintains several grav
vehicles (air/rafts and a single speeder) as part of the Scout base
fleet. It is rare to find more than one or two of the Scout/Couriers at
the port. The rest are typically out on missions.

Cygnus X-3 handles minor border duties in the local area, and keeps
an eye on several small, but restive, political entities, which are
little better than banana republics. Firepower available to the base
for such missions is extremely limited, and mostly resident in the
squadron's scouts. Local Navy forces consist of a squadron of four
Gazelles which patrol the system, generally in pairs.

The base also supervises the sub port at the local moon of the gas
giant. The population of this moon is a moderate sized mining
settlement (pop 4) on a hostile world (Atmosphere B) , and has a
small, mainly underground, transportation system. The sub-base
can tend one to two free traders, or one subsidized merchant at
any given time, has a shuttle and modular cutter on call; both are
piloted by scouts on rotation from Cygnus X-3, or as a moderate
punishment. The moon is mainly self sufficient, but trades ore

for food and parts with the main world. About half the population
are temporary miners, some independent, some employees of the
mining cartel that controls mining and ore extraction operations in
the system.

Cygnus X-3 is typical of a frontier scout base in that it has no
particular specialization and can support a wide variety of mission
profiles. Scout missions have included frequent mail drops linking
the local area with the (distant) Xboat route out of the main system.
Diplomatic courier duties to the various pocket states in the system
are common. Rescues and assists are also fairly common, partly
due to the age of most of the local ships, and the base maintains
a standing orbital patrol with a modular cutter in medivac/rescue
configuration. Detailed system surveys and updates are also
frequent duties for the local systems in the subsector, and while
actual exploration opportunities are less common, anomalies
requiring investigation seem to crop up regularly. Cygnus X-3 is
also a minor training campus for the sub-sector. It is somewhat
underfunded due to demands on the more important frontiers, and
as the other services are in similar situations, an informal lend and
loan system has evolved, where support is traded for missions as
well as other supplies between the navy, colonial forces, scouts and
the merchant service.

Several types of Scout characters end up stationed at Cygnus X-

3. The first are long service scouts, close to retirement. Typically,
this kind of posting is seen as a fairly easy, lower risk way to wind
up their career. Second, are very new scouts; locations such as the
Trojans of the gas giant are excellent for technical training. Third,
are those scouts no longer able to function efficiently due to age or
injury, yet not so badly impaired as to require retirement from the
service. They typically do much of the support and admin work for
the base, freeing the flight rated scouts to serve on the ships; they
also are a valuable source of training and education for the younger
scouts. Many run seminars and training classes as part of scout
training. Finally, there are the 'problem children'. Although seldom
incompetent, (as incompetent field scouts generally self select for
survival failure fairly soon in their careers) these individuals are
those who have extreme difficulty playing well with others even
by the relaxed standards of the scout service), have had a run of
terrible luck, and/or have caused, or have been in the near vicinity,
of repeated sub-terminating screw-ups.

while she would not mind a different posting, rather enjoys her
independent status away from Cygnus. Her undoubted patience is
often called into play to deal with local tensions between the Port

Perdy's petulance.

plotting procedures. Her main disadvantage is her arrogance; she
is convinced that she is the best scientist the Scouts have ever

Medical Group
Cygnus base operates a medical group in the reasonably well
equipped medical wing. The group has specializations in both
human and xeno-biology. Whilst part of the Scout base, a long-
standing agreement with the Port authority means that medical
expertise is leant to the starport medical team, which lacks
xenobiology medical expertise.

Dr. Haw Vratch uses his medic skill at full value for Humans and other
lifeforms found in the system. Vratch unfortunately suffers from a
benign mutation which links to the victim's epithelial cells, and causes
a clear, viscous jell to be exuded from the subject's skin although it
is harmless. Vratch controls the discharge with drugs but these have
the side-effect of limiting his sense of smell. His bedside manner is
excellent, and he is a well respected doctor, often called upon by the
Port authority to treat ailments amongst those using the main starport.

Science group
The Science Group runs all Survey and Exploration missions out of
Cygnus, and is responsible for investigating and charting anomalies in

A crew of veterans who have surveyed in many branches of the Scout
service during their careers, and have travelled far and wide. The

##### SCOUT MISSIONS

This chapter details the tools of the Scout service's trade: the
equipment used across its various branches and, naturally, the
ships deployed as part of its messenger and exploratory activities.

Equipment is grouped under each branch of the Scout service, but
this does not mean it is exclusive to that branch – simply that the
branch uses the equipment more than others. Ships, on the other
hand, are ubiquitous, with each branch using a variety of ships
depending on the task in hand.

## GENERAL EQUIPMENT

All equipment is rated by its Tech Level, its cost, weight, and any
special rules concerning its operation and use. Dependent on Tech
Level, any Scout team expected to undertake a particular assignment
will be able to requisition the appropriate equipment for the stores
of a Scout Base; the only exception will be for Class D and E bases
where resources are stretched. In this case, a Class D base has the
required equipment available on a roll of 8+ and Class E on a roll
of 10+.

Synthetic Skin (TL12+)
Resembling skin, Synthetic Skin bandages have been developed by
the Scout service for aiding Contact expeditions. The material is a
complex nanotechnology analogue that includes dermal receptors
to analyse and replicate the skin type over which the bandage is
placed. This allows the material to be compatible with near-human
dermal make-up (carbon-based life-forms).

Synthetic Skin protects wounds, cuts and abrasions, healing up to
3 points of damage over the course of 3+1D6 days. The material
protects from infection and allows the natural skin underneath to
breathe. It is water-tight, the nanoreceptors in the material forming
a perfect bond (a not unpleasant tingling sensation) with the natural
dermis. When applied, it takes about half an hour for the material to
form its bond and then healing commences.

Synthetic Skin comes in packs of patches of varying sizes and
bandage wraps of 1m in length. A standard kit includes 12 patches
and 3 bandages. The material can be cut to length.

Cr500

Tannin Capsules (TL12)
These orally-taken capsules darken or lighten the skin's pigmentation,
either for cosmetic purposes or to guard against the effects of UV
radiation. Packs of tannine capsules contain 12 doses: 6 each of
lightening and darkening capsules. The process takes 1d3+1 hours
to complete.

Cr400

Smart Kitchen (TL14)
A portable food processor, the Smart Kitchen is capable of producing
a passable likeness of any food sample placed into its sensor unit.
The output is a standard portion, served hot or cold, of the sample,
but calibrated to suit the imbiber (therefore potentially unpalatable
foods can be created to suit a human or other alien metabolism).
The unit contains a standard pack of organic compounds (proteins,
carbohydrates, vitamins, and so forth) from which it draws its
raw materials. The pack contains enough material to replicate 12
standard portions of foodstuff before it needs to be refilled.

The unit, whilst portable, is bulky, and resembles a large attaché
case faced with calibration reads-outs, the sensor input and the
portion dispenser.

Larger versions holding quadruple the raw material packs are often
fitted to Scout survey and Contact vessels as part of the ship's
kitchen.

Cr15,000
(Raw material packs Cr1,000)

Shelter Cubes (TL13)
These are portable buildings that consist of light, collapsible frame
poles, insulated flooring rolls and cans of foaming wall. Once the
frame poles are erected over the flooring sheet, cans of spray-on
structural foam are used to create exterior and interior walls, with a
single can sufficient to create a cube-like structure 3m x 3m x 3m. It
typically takes 10 minutes to erect the frame and floor; 10 minutes to
apply the foam and 10 minutes for it to harden. Within half an hour
one can construct an insulated, water and wind-resistant shelter.
The foam is steel-hard and offers 5 Armor Points of protection;
it is also fire-retardant. Whilst the foam is drying it can shaped as
necessary using standard tools (knives and so forth), as needed.

Solvents included in the Shelter Cube kit allow the foam walls to be
dissolved once the shelter has served its purpose, with the residue
forming a non-toxic pool that evaporates in standard sunlight within
24 hours.

Standard Scout Pac System (Available at
TL14+)
Basic scout equipment is built around reliability, ruggedness,
easy configurability and replacement. In many cases Scout-grade
equipment will out-perform standard civilian or even military man-
portable scanning equipment simply due to the usage and mission

# EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS

profile it is designed to meet. To that end, the basic scout Pac system
has been developed, consisting of small sensor/computing modules
(handPacs) about the size of a thin modern cell phone (sometimes
thicker) with dedicated functions based on the differing and altering
needs of a scouting mission. Several handpacs can be easily carried,
and include slots for various accessories as described below.

The modules themselves can be slotted into a ManPac unit, about
the size of a small laptop or thick clipboard. When installed, the
ManPacs function with greater range, and generally increased
computing power, and the user has more options for adding
accessories, and easier hardware, for control and interface tasks.
Finally, whereas the Hand Pacs are, at best, capable of robotic
autonomy, the ManPac is designed to act as science assistant, and
runs intellect software allowing it to intelligently use its components
as defined by basic input from the user.

HandPacs are divided into several basic types sharing functional
abilities. SnifferPacs, AssayPacs, ScanPacs and ResourcePacs.

Sniffer Packs give a very fast response to a number of predetermined
questions. _Biosniffers_ require a minimal, casual sampling to work,
or are capable of passive sampling (Radiation, for example). A
Biosniffer gives a probability of life within a certain range and its
DNA compatibility. _Envirosniffer_ gives atmospheric toxins, radiation
(various types) , known viral or bacterial hazards and temperature.
_Chemsniffer_ gives a quick assay of the atmosphere or liquid based
around specific hazards.

Assay Pacs are lab equipment, and produce much more detailed
results taking longer amounts of time to correlate. They are passive,
and require a sample - either physical ,such as organic matter, liquid
or gas; or simply the presence of the assay material , such as EMS
output, radiation, heat, and so on. In all cases with physical samples,
the size required is fairly small, about 1-3 grams, and is quite accurate
within that limit –it must be noted, though, that a small sample may
often lack some less than perfectly homogenised or rare component,
so multiple sampling techniques are always recommended..

Scan Pacs Are closest to conventional sensor equipment. Active
scanners emit probe signals as appropriate and analyse the
response/return signal. In some cases, such as visual enhancers,
the sensors are entirely passive. Note that if needed, most active
scanners can be operated in a purely passive mode, although with
a considerable decrement in performance – generally either a –3 to
Sensor operation skills, or halving the effect of a success, depending
on the type of sensor and the situation.

Resource Pacs are either highly specialized data processors (crypto,
database, mapping) high capacity recording units, or boosters to
increase functionality in other hand or Man pacs.

All handPacs are designed to allow a user to access important
and varied skill sets via the computer skill. Thus, all pacs (hand or
otherwise) are fundamentally computers, and are operated by use of

Computer skill, except for pacs that emulate sensor skill, which may
also be operated by the Sensor skill.

MANPACS (TL14)
Man Pacs are book-sized computer terminals. A typical ManPac has
configurable slots for an additional four handpacs. All handpacs
operate at Expert Level +1 and Agent Level +1 as appropriate
when connected to the core. Additionally, the manpac core runs
Intellect/1 and can intelligently run any of the attached handpacs in
the background at Expert(skill) or Agent level 1, report results, and
suggest further actions as necessary.

as all virtual and/or distributed options possible for sniffer and
scanpacks.

Contact
The Contact branch draws on the full array of Sensor equipment
found on page 96 of the main Traveller rules, but also has the
following items available:

TRANSLATION UNIT (TL 14)
A translation unit is designed to take spoken language and rapidly
translate it into the desired language, broadcasting the output
audibly and in a tone and accent that is as acceptable as possible
to the recipient. The linguistics and phonetics algorithms used in
the translation unit are highly sophisticated, but even at high Tech
Levels, no unit can handle more than one language at a time.

Language dictionaries are stored on high capacity memory wafers
which are loaded into the unit. The processor is worn on the hip,
and includes a 'natural speech synthesiser' which broadcasts the
spoken output. The user wears a discreet headset or ear-buds and
receives translated inputs direct to the ear.

There is a delay of about half a second as the translation (in both
directions) is processed and broadcast and delivered. Additionally,
there is always the chance of a mistranslation occurring on a throw
of 9+ (the Referee should decide when such a chance is prevalent).
The user of the device may off-set the mistranslation chance with his
own Language skills, gaining a +1DM for each level in the language
skill that is being used for the translation. If a user has a Language
skill of 3 or higher, then the chance of a mistranslation is completely
negated.

Cr8,000

LINGUISTICS ANALYSER (TL12)
This is a plug-in module for the Translation Unit and is used when
a completely new language is encountered. The analyser records
spoken words and then runs complex linguistic and phoneme
alogorithms to determine language structure, nuance and
meaning.

It requires 8 hours of more or less continuous speech for the
analyser to assemble a very basic, almost child-like understanding
of a language. After a further 8 hours of recording and analysis, it

has a language accuracy equivalent to skill rank 0. For every 24
hours thereafter, its accuracy increases by a further 1 level, up a
maximum of 3.

The Analyser can be plugged into a translation unit at any time. At
level 0, the chance for the Translation Unit to mistranslate is 9+,
as described in the description of the Translation Unit. Every level
of accuracy reduces the throw, up to a mistranslation chance of 6+
(which may be offset still further, or negated, by a competent user
of the language).

Cr 8,000

LIFE SCANNER (TL 12)
The Life Scanner is a ship-mounted sensor array that is specifically
calibrated for detecting signs of mobile life and differentiating
between life forms. The Life Scanner can differentiate, for instance,
between a colony of insects, a herd of migrating animals, and social
groups of sentient creatures. Typically used in high orbit above a
newly discovered planet, it can, within 24 hours (for an average,
earth-sized world) identify and quantify population densities, likely
life types (sapient, sentient, non-sapient and so forth), certain
ecological niches. When using the scanner, a Sensors roll is required
to successfully interpret the results. The Life Scanner is not 100%
accurate; it typically has an accuracy of between 70% and 85%, but
this is sufficient for first-pass exploration needs.

Cr 20,000, Ship-Mounted as part of the standard sensor cluster.

LIFE SCANNER/ANALYSIS (TL 14)
A development of the Life Scanner, the Analysis model also takes
atmospheric and environmental factors into account to develop an
accurate portrait of the biology of life detected using a Life Scanner.
The system can, for example, indicate the physical configuration
of detected life, approximate its food requirements, and produce
additional critical signals that will inform the user on how to prepare
for any direct encounter with the life form.

Cr 40,000, Ship-Mounted as part of the standard sensor cluster

HOLDING FIELD (TL 15)
A holding field is an advanced system that has a variety of uses.
High energy gravimetric beams or spreads of beams (a field) are
strung between a generator unit and a receptor unit to create an
impenetrable barrier that may or may not be visible to the naked
eye, depending on the energy used and the desire of whoever sets
up the field. Generally, a holding field is designed to contain without
causing damage although, again depending on the kind of energy
used, damage may be caused if the field is touched.

As the beam is continuous and is designed to be held for prolonged
periods of time, the energy source needs to be reliable and highly
efficient. Therefore the generator and receptor units may be bulky

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS

and cumbersome but, once established and functioning, offer a
way of providing fast, easy containment without the need to erect
physical fencing.

At TL15, the generator and receptor units are contained in a single
pillar-like device with settings on the exterior to dictate the unit's
polarity (either generating or receiving), so that discrete devices are
not necessary. Two units used together create a single-line barrier;
three a triangle, four a rectangle and so forth. Onboard computers
automatically calibrate to the other units used in the matrix and
provide continued energy correction for optimum use. The height
of the barrier is determined by the height of the generator/receptor
unit. A simple pair of units is 2m in height; add a further Cr5000 for
each additional meter of height required.

The Holding Field's range (the maximum distance that can be
attained between the two units) is cost-dependent. A basic pair of
2m high units can span up to 5m. Add a further Cr5000 for each
additional 5m span required.

As the idea of the Holding Field is to contain, physical damage
is rare. The energy field offers a solid resistance (and is warm to
the touch) just as a physical barrier offers resistance. However, if
enough energy is exerted, then a Holding Field can be overcome. A
basic Holding Unit generates a Field Strength of 6D+6. To overcome
it, the opposing force must achieve a higher Effect than that created
by the Holding Field. This could be kinetic energy from something
swinging at or charging the field, or a weapon system overloading
the field itself. Of course, if the units are targeted and damaged,
then this will either impair or negate the field. For this reason the
generator/receptor units are usually equipped with 8 points of
armor (further points of armor cost Cr200 per unit).

Cr10,000 per unit (2m height, 5m span). Add Cr5000 for each 1m in
height and/or 5m span. Add Cr200 per additional armor point.

In the Third Imperium Traveller setting this item is not available
until TL 18 at the earliestk, since the societies within this setting do
not have sufficient understanding of gravitational forces.

First Contact Communicator (TL14)
The first contact between races is a critical moment. The First Contact
Communicator used by the Scout service is designed to optimize
the nature of the first encounter. The communicator is a mixture of
translation device and message transmitter. It is a book-sized box
worn slung on a belt or backpack and, when activated, broadcasts
messages of welcome, peace and prosperity, along with critical data
about its user (homeworld, astronomical co-ordinates, biological
basics, and so on) in an array of known languages, plus standard
binary code, on a low-level, non-aggressive frequency. Any new
race that is capable of receiving radio and microwaves can intercept
the information and, if they have sufficiently advanced decoding
technology, gain, at the very least, a basic understanding of the

transmitter's intentions. The messages are broadcast in a friendly,
calm, reassuring tone that has been developed by Scout linguistics
and First Contact specialists to be completely non-threatening and
encouraging to peaceful dialogue. The communicator also includes
a translation unit (see above) to begin the language translation
process immediately. Integral digital cameras record the first contact
moments, and a palm-sized display (which can be enhanced by a Tri-
Dee projector) can show images relating directly to the messages
being broadcast, or images chosen by the user.

operation in gravity environments, its primary purpose is to perform
all routine sensor and scanning functions, assist with First Contact
protocols, and to inform all other contact and survey work.

Roughly 100cm in diameter, the APD is equipped with a full First
Contact Communicator array, surface to ship comms equipment,
short range environmental sensors, medi-kit and a small number of
hardware tools for performing basic mechanics tasks (at Level 1).

For an additional Cr8,000, the drone can be equipped with a Genuine
Personality Profile unit. This allows the drone to communicate with
a distinct personality representation, either modelled on a known
person or fitted from an extensive library. Library personalities
include:

Sarcastic but Caring
Warm, Generous and Loving
Acerbic and Glib
To The Point
Loquacious but Right
Friendly and Supportive
Do Not Mess With Me
Paranoid and Pessimistic
I'm Your Best Friend
I'm Your Best Friend (But Not His or Hers)
Diplomacy and Tact Epitomised

Countless others are available. None inhibits the actual function of
the APD, but the personality profile chosen may suit some tasks and
sensibilities more than others.

### COURIER

The Courier branch makes extensive use of high-end communications
equipment, including all communication items found on pages 90
and 91 of the Traveller rules. Additional items include:

Scout Cryptography Unit (TL 7+)
Cryptography algorithms are crucial to messaging. The full
cryptography units of the Scout service dedicate masses of
processing power to codes and ciphers, but this portable, hand-held
unit, is designed for field use and quickly encrypting a message that
needs to be hastily prepared.

No roll is necessary to successfully encrypt a message. A message
prepared and sent with the Cryptography unit can only be successfully
decoded by someone using the unique decryption code that the unit
generates and sends in separate message packets. Intercepting an
encrypted message, using one of these units, allows the message to
be encrypted on a roll of 12+, with DMs allowed for decryption skills,
and +1/–1 for every two TLs in difference between the encrypting
device and the decrypting device.

For example, a message prepared on a TL8 unit can be decrypted
on a TL12 unit. The roll is 12+, with a +2DM for the TL12 unit's
greater processing power and faster, more accurate algorithms.
Conversely, a TL8 unit trying to decrypt a message prepared on a
TL12 unit suffers a –2DM to the decryption throw.

Cr8,000 (+Cr2000 for each TL above 7).

Military Grade Cryptography Unit (TL 9+)
This is an installed cryptography unit used by the dedicated
messaging teams of the Courier branch. It works on similar principles
to the portable unit; however the roll to decrypt a message prepared
on it is 15+, and the military grade unit gains a +1DM for deciphering
for every 1 TL level in difference to the machine that prepared it.

Cr25,000 (must be installed in a comms/computer room as a
dedicated server array).

Secure Storage Wafer (TL 10+)
A data wafer that carries a military-grade encryption algorithm,
the SSU comes in storage sizes of 10Gb to 10Tb – literally capable
of storing thousands or millions of messages, along with the
necessary, space-hungry encryption and decryption metadata to
hold the content securely.

The SSI also has nano-sensor built into its fabric that cause the
wafer to self-destruct if any access attempts are made that are
unaccompanied by a recognized Scout service identifier code, as
transmitted through either a portable or installed cryptography
unit.

Cr50 (10Gb) – Cr500 (10Tb)

Secure Storage Unit (TL12+)
Using nano-gears and seals, and memory plastics, secure storage
units are boxes ranging in size from a book up to a full packing
crate. Each box requires a unique electrochemical signature to
open, the configuration of which is usually transmitted separately
to a destination. Without the signature, the box remains fully sealed
and can only be opened if subjected to the equivalent of 66 points of
damage – which will also destroy the contents.

The material of the box is, naturally, stab and bullet resistant. It is
also resistant to infrared, X-Ray, meson bombardment and thermal
imaging. The perfect attaché case.

### EXPLORATION AND SURVEY

The Exploration branch draws on the full array of Sensor equipment
found on page 96 of the main Traveller rules, but also has the
following items available:

Advanced Combination Telescope Array (TL
11)
Different types of telescope collect information in different ways:
radio telescopes, for example, operate in the radio frequency portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum where they can detect and collect
data on radio sources. Optical telescopes collect light, presenting it
as an image. The larger the telescope, then more data it can collect,
and the farther away it can view.

The Advanced Telescope Array in use by the Scout service is effectively
a processing unit that can be networked with any number of telescopes
of any different type. The information collected from each telescope is
processed, amalgamated, calibrated, and then presented to the user
as either a single, discrete dataset, or as a combined image and data
readout that collects and correlates all information into a single place
for analysis. When connected to a Tri-Dee projector, then the results
of astronomical study can be startling.

The ACT does not replace the need for telescopes or sensors, but it
does reduce the effort placed into studying the information returned
from several telescopes. Further more, two or more ACT arrays can
be networked together via wireless or wire information technology to
pool material from many telescopes into a single study matrix. This
is highly useful for extensive field observations of a large system or
a particular stellar anomaly that requires multiple viewpoints and
different fields of analysis.

The ACT array is moveable but not man-portable due to its bulk.

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS

Spatial Inferred Neutrino (SIN) Sensor (TL 14)
The Spatial Inferred Neutrino Sensor is used to detect and image
normal and collapsed matter in stellar space. It relies on an extremely
sensitive array capable of detecting background neutrino radiation
and the effect on this from astral objects.

Dense and hyper-dense matter, collapsed matter or objects
absorbing a significant portion of neutrinos, display as areas in
a Tri-Dee screen as radiating from light grey to the purest black,
indicating the density of the object under scan.

To use this sensor the ship or operator must be away from other
neutrino sources and must not have a fusion or fission powerplant
currently operating and must be stationary in space. Mapping the
background radiation before inferring the effects of objects is a slow
and painstaking process.

The SIN sensor comes into its own when studying stars, gas giants,
nebula, large planetoids and other bodies of significant mass. In
a wide angle mode, the chemical composition, decay states, and
other activity can be defined within a few seconds. In a narrow angle
mode, particular areas can be subjected to highly detailed study that
is impossible to achieve with standard sensors or telescopes.

Cr50,000
Weight: 2000kg

Stellar Anomaly Analysis Array (SA3) (TL 12)
Using high-end, but conventional, sensor techniques, the Stellar
Anomaly Analysis array can be combined with telescopes and ACT
arrays to focus specifically on particular stellar anomalies, excluding
all standard, background emissions and noise. Using a vast library
of pre-studied stellar anomaly data, the SA3 array is capable of both
analysing, retro-analysing, and forecasting anomaly behaviour with
99% accuracy.

The SA3 array works with both ACT and Tri-Dee packages.

Cr20,000

Advanced Probe Drone (TL 12)
The logical development of the Probe Drone (see Traveller, page 95),
the Advanced Probe Drone has double the range and speed of its
standard cousin, although it is roughly similar in size. A required part
of a surveying or exploration arsenal, a typical survey/exploration
will carry and deploy up to four of these units. Four such units take
up 1 ton and cost MCr 0.8 per ton when installed in a ship.

Point Marker Beacon (TL9)
Used during system survey operations at each phase of a survey,
a Point Marker Beacon is a 0.5m diameter globe equipped with
appropriate logging and sensor arrays to note the status of a mission
and the next critical stage. A survey mission typically carries 20 or
so beacons in a bridge-controlled dispenser fitted to the outer hull
of the vessel.

### SPECIAL OPERATIONS

Special Operations utilises any and all equipment that can be
employed in its covert surveillance and espionage operations.
Special equipment includes:

Advanced Chameleon Suit (TL 13)
Using nano-cameras and micro-sensors, the chameleon suit is a
full-body fitting suit that samples and reproduces the immediate
environment to permit near-perfect camouflage. The suit operates
on micro batteries that give approximately 6 hours of operational
use per charge; when not running, the suit is a dull grey in colour.

When activated, the suit gives a –6DM against all attempts to spot
the wearer when motionless, or –4 if moving against visual, UV or
IR sensors. However, against other EM sensors the technology is
less effective, with the suit giving a –4DM against all attempts to
spot the wearer when motionless, or –2 if moving. It provides no
advantage against acoustic sensors.

Cr75,000

Defraction Screen (TL 11)
An aerosol based distraction mechanism, a squirt of defraction
screen propels millions of highly reflective droplets into a cloud
roughly one cubic meter in diameter. This interrupts both direct
and peripheral vision, providing a –3DM to any visual reliant rolls
attempting to penetrate the area within, or behind, the defraction
cloud. The cloud dissipates after 5 minutes and a single aerosol has
12 uses.

Cr150

Makeover Unit (TL 12)
A head-fitting unit that is equipped with inbuilt cosmetics and latex
patches, plus a powerful imaging and replication program. When a
facial image is loaded into the unit, via a standard data wafer, the
unit can replicate the cosmetic features of the image onto the face
of the recipient using make-up and heat-formed latex prostheses.
Once complete, the makeover is as close to the original image as
possible, allowing for obvious differences in bone structure, hair
colour, and so forth.

A standard makeover takes 1 hour to apply; 2 to 4 hours if the face
being replicated is particularly complex (deeply lined, unusual

features, and so on). The unit cannot handle distinctly alien
makeovers: it could not, for instance, give a human the semblance
of an Aslan or vice versa.

### VEHICLES

All Terrain Mule
The All Terrain Mule is a workhorse of any Scout survey operation.
A four-man vehicle, available in either six-wheeled or tracked
configurations, the mule comprises of a forward command module,
which houses the powerplant and crew cockpit, and a rearward
supply module which can come in one of several formats, as
described below. The two connect by an articulated drive train
and coupling mechanism which can be quick-released from the
command module.

The mule is designed for rough ground and unstable terrain. The
command module is supplied with a 6x6 gearbox and independent
steering for each wheel. Its large engine is fitted with a turbo and
overdrive, perfect for dealing with difficult conditions on solid
planetary surfaces. The command module has a front-mounted
heavy-duty winch and grapple to assist in steep climbs and reeling-
in large objects. The winch can sustain up to 50 tons of direct bulk
at its maximum torque settings.

The command module is also pressurised and climate controlled.
A loft unit above the cockpit can sleep two crew members, whilst
the seating in the cockpit can be formatted to provide an additional
two bunks.

The attachable survey modules come in the following
configurations:

EQUIPMENT MODULE
A large, wheeled or tracked trailer capable of containing essential
supplies and field equipment. The module has a small generator
(type dependent on TL) and includes a grapple and winch.

MOBILE LAB
A laboratory unit that can be configured for a range of scientific
endeavors: geological survey, biological survey, life-sciences, med-
lab/mobile clinic, surveillance/communications, and atmospheric
sampling.

SURVIVAL MODULE
Pressurised and climate controlled, this is, in effect, a mobile
housing unit with a limited laboratory capability.

Command Module Specifications
Weight: 15 tons
Height: 3m

Width: 2.5m
Length: 6.2m

All modules have similar size specifications:

Weight: 8 tons (basic)
Height: 3m
Width: 2.5m
Length: 6m

The Equipment module can carry up to 30 tons of equipment.

For the Mobile Lab and Survival Module, add 8 tons to the basic
weight.

Unicopter
Used for short-range aerial surveillance, the unicopter is a single,
rotary wing helicopter that contains an auto-stabilization gyroscope
to maintain level, stable, horizontal and vertical flight without the
need for an additional, boom-and-tail fitted, vertical airscrew. Small
jet thrusters mounted flush to the fuselage provide additional
forward momentum, and can be angled through 180 degrees for
additional manoeuvrability.

The unicopter is a compact, lightweight, ovoid design that can carry
up to three people when pressed, but is designed for either one or
two crew members. The nose of the craft can be fitted with small
sensor arrays and camera equipment, making it a highly useful,
short-range aerial reconnaissance vehicle that is primarily used as
a pathfinder for more detailed research vehicles such as the Mule
(described above).

At a cost increase of 40%, the unicopter can be fitted with a whisper
unit, vastly reducing the craft's engine and rotor noise, enabling it
to be used in general stealth operations.

Ground Effect Bike
A single rider, grav-generator fitted personal transport, ground effect
bikes come in a variety of styles and general configurations (open
or closed), and mimic the standard Air Raft in basic concept. Highly
manoeuvrable and with a good basic range, ground effect bikes are
excellent for a lone Scout to cover a wide area. The bike has basic
controls and cannot be fitted with sensor or surveying arrays, but
offers fast, personal transportation for forward reconnaissance or
scouting where local conditions prevent the use of equipment such
as a unicopter.

Rapid Survey Buggy
A light, 2 or 4-man tactical ground vehicle, the rapid survey buggy
is designed for rough terrain surveying where larger vehicles (such
as the All Terrain Mule) are unsuitable, and there is no need for a
sealed cockpit. The buggy is a 4x4 configuration, with a high-end
manual and automatic gearing differential, integral, high-impact roll
cage, and sealed, environment-proof powerplant. Its large, rugged
wheels use run-flat tyres, and the vehicle can either carry 2 crew and
up to 800kg in payload, or 4 crew and 100kg in payload. It includes
an integral winch and grapple with a 1400kg capacity.

Weight: 500kg
Height: 1800mm
Width: 2400mm
Length 5000 mm

Sled
For cold, snow-bound environments, the Sled is the ideal vehicle.
Built to a similar size and configuration as the All Terrain Mule,
the Sled is equipped with side, forward and aft skids, and is given
motive power by rear-mounted tracks, chain-linked to the drive unit
housed at the rear of the vehicle. The skids can be raised or lowered
to account for differing snow conditions.

The Sled is not designed to draw additional payloads, as is the Mule,
but it is capable of mounting two ground effect bikes on side-rigs
attached to the upper portion of the skis.

Weight: 15 tons
Height: 3m
Width: 2.5m
Length: 6.2m

Mariner
The Mariner is the Scout service's dual-purpose liquid environment
craft. A streamlined, surface and sub-surface hull, with a transparent
front section makes the mariner both a surface boat and a submersible
research vessel that can, in a standard water environment, dive to
an optimum depth of 600m or an equivalent of 60 atmospheres
(in liquid environments where the liquid density is higher than that
of water). The hull is made from crystaliron, hence its excellent
resilience, with spacecraft hull technology being deployed to make
this a versatile and strong surface and sub-surface vehicle.

Typically equipped with starship sensor arrays, calibrated to liquid
environments, the Mariner can support a 4-man crew for up to 1
week of liquid environment operations. Its quarters are as cramped
as those aboard any traditional Scout vessel, with the Mariner
dedicating space to sensors, a small lab, strengthened bridge, and
basic sleeping quarters.

The Mariner is generally deployed from an atmosphere-going Scout
ship, being lowered onto the water/liquid using a specially designed
winching rig from an underside-configured cargo hatch. The crew
accompanies the vessel as it is lowered to its environment, and then
taking full control once the winch has been disengaged.

Weight: 25 tons

##### EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS

### SHIPS

The workhorse of the Scout service is undoubtedly the Type S Scout,
based on a 100-ton, wedge-shaped hull. This vessel is a common
sight in the spacelanes and starports and, for many, the Type S
is the Scout service. Another vessel frequently used is the 50 ton
surveyor (see High Guard , page 92), a specialist small craft rarely
found outside of the scout service.

However the Scout service uses many other types of ships in
its operations, including variations on the Type S. This section
details the most common variants found, along with notes on the
advantages and drawbacks of each design or configuration.

Type SX Frontiersman
The SX is a 150 ton TL11 Scout vessel designed to operate in low
stellar density, lower technology frontier areas. The initial design
specifications support at least a range of jump 4, coupled with a
simplified maintenance requirement that does not reduce the
performance of the classic Type S scout, and would be easily
reconfigurable for multiple mission profiles. The result is a ship
which is a 150 ton, stretched Type S with the additional capacity
dedicated to extra fuel and modular mission modules, a highly tuned
TL11 jump drive and a vastly upgraded avionics and sensor suite.

The Key to the design is the type 4 computer system, more typical
of a ship much larger in size, which allows a highly automated and
reduced cockpit design (less than half the volume of a typical 100-
200 dton ship). Additionally, the cargo bay is configured to hangar
a 30 ton Ship's Boat or, if fuel and endurance is reduced, a 50 ton
Surveyor (see page 75).

While the original intent was to use standardized 30-ton cutter
modules, in practice the mission requirements resulted in customized
modules that must be installed in pairs, with extensive cross linkages
and the ship to function. The bays can accept standard modules,
but they are generally non-functional except in the simplest cases,
and the performance and range of the ship is reduced to that of an
excessively bulky Type S scout. Similarly, the custom modules can
be singly fitted to a standard cutter for transport, but are essentially
non-functional. As a result, the SX has never been as physically
modular as the Scout service desired, and while variant load-outs
do exist, they are generally installed at initial construction, and
require shipyard work to change. The loss of modular functionality
nearly doomed the design from the beginning, but a limited number
were contracted for under the hope that they would provide a “mini

survey scout” for areas which did not rate a regular 400 ton Survey
Scout. Initial deployment indicated that the loss of modularity was
less crucial than anticipated, and that while its effectiveness as a
mini-survey ship was less than perfect, it makes an excellent sensor
/picket vessel with its range and low maintenance requirements.

ADVANTAGES:

- Jump 4 Range; Jump drive and Main computer optimized for
    rapid sequential and/or deep space jumping.
- Highly configurable high-power sensor and computing systems
    allow extreme sensor range and acuity, Scout specific sensors
    and telemetry, and rapid jump calculations.
- Good manoeuvrability while in evasion mode as well as massive
    ECM and ECCM potential for displacement class.
- Cheap and simplified maintenance at TL12 systems; standard
    maintenance at TL10 and TL11 systems for non-avionic
    components. Difficult, but possible, at TL9 for non-jump
    components.
- Expanded vehicle bay and increased cargo space relative to
    Type S standard.
- Can function in limited mode without modules, and secondary
    type 1b computer allows jump independent of main computer.
- High-end computer makes the SX excellent at running
    encryption programs. Coupled with its range, it is a first-rate
    Courier vessel.

DISADVANTAGES:

- Required crew generally larger than usual for displacement
    class (double cabin occupancy assumed), resulting in generally
    cramped crew quarters, particularly on the long duration
    missions common to this type of ship.
- Computer systems non-hardened, and vulnerable to EMP effects.
- Extensive reliance automation in bridge and control systems;
    ship control rapidly and extensively degrades if main avionics
    system damaged or offline.
- No armor, one turret.
- Magazine space hard to access, and split between scientific
    probes and military packages.
- The type 4 computer stretches the requirement for TL11
    maintenance. Unlike the rest of the ship, it is cutting edge
    TL11, and as a result, the avionics and bridge controls are best
    maintained at TL12, and only below that by sophisticated TL11
    shipyards.

LONG RANGE EXPLORATION MODULE

If there is a typical configuration for the module bay it is the long range exploration module. Particularly in frontier and rift areas or operation,
this is standard equipment, and the ship may never have done a module switch, and indeed, may not even have access to extra modules.

The lab module is a useful variant, allowing a small research team to operate more economically than with a lab ship or heavy survey vessel.
Unlike most modules, the Lab module can be deployed on its own either in orbit or planetside., and is designed to be detached from its ship
with minimal effort. If planetside use is planned, the solar panel and sensor arrays are replaced with planetside versions and a small craft
sC power plant (1.8 Tons) is added to the cargo bay, along with 1 ton of fuel. This will allow 8-16 weeks of power depending on demand and
solar panel effectiveness.

In this configuration, if both surveyors are carried, the ship jumps as a 250 ton hull, and performance reduces to Jump1 and 1G.

This configuration was an early attempt at developing a survey carrier. Unfortunately, while it can carry out its mission, it is extremely
cramped while the surveyor crews are on board, and its ability to service and supply the surveyors on station is somewhat limited, as is its
range. While not a successful variant, and largely replaced by the auxiliary merchant conversions and dedicated survey rider (see below)
existing examples are still in use for budgetary reasons.

In this configuration, the ship jumps as a 180 ton hull. The 36 ton drop tank allows an initial 1x J2; total internal fuel is 44 tons, allowing
1x J2 and 28 days duration. **The ships boat is a modified stealth/assault version carrying 12 passengers, (team leader , medic 10 team
members and 2 crew
Officially, this configuration is used to insert cultural survey teams onto precontact moderate or low tech planets. Unofficially, it is a
favorite of the scout special forces teams; additionally many of these ship variants have been transferred to various military branches as
commando transports, and deep penetration espionage teams. Typically these versions have their drives upgraded to include both rapid
and stealth jump options, and a stealth hull. Medical bay and medic are to maximize survival of low berth crew/passengers.

This Module is used to transport dangerous or highly valuable cargoes or lifeforms. The stateroom is for one or two special handlers/
guards who often accompany such shipments. The Vaults can each maintain a different life support and gravity environment and/or
be reconfigured to provide from one to three contiguous storage areas. All vaults are also equipped with hazard reduction and breach
containment equipment as necessary. In extreme cases the stateroom space can be used to install an appropriate self-destruct device. The
module does not have a dedicated airlock, but does have an armored high security access door in the stateroom, which can potentially
double as an airlock. The vaults are generally configured to require removal from the module before access is possible.

EMERGENCY MODULES
Two other modules are the emergency/refuge modules of the turtle series. These are generally only carried for relocation purposes, and
are intended for autonomous operation. The Turtle class station is a cheap and reliable emergency refuge, often scattered around belts ,
near remote outposts, and likely gas giants. Interestingly, the design predates the Frontiersman class , and has been in use since the first
Imperium, Many functioning stations from that period can still be encountered in some systems, albeit with a T10 control system of double
mass and cost of the standard TL12 system. Support of the turtle station was one factor in designing the SX frontiersman to support a 50
ton module.

The goal of the station is to provide a basic survival habitat at minimum cost, using low tech components, and to generally be too cramped
and utilitarian to use as a clandestine base or source of spare parts. Any entry into or docking with a Turtle will immediately cause it to power
up, and activate a long range emergency beacon, which cannot easily be disabled without official codes. The station will also be activated by
a distress signal. Where possible, survivors and or damaged ships will approach the station and either dock or airlock transfer.

In addition to providing emergency shelter and life support, a turtle is capable of limited response to distress calls using remote or
programmed control in situations where the survivors cannot reach the stations location. The station can be signalled to use its reaction
motor for a two burn acceleration/deceleration flight to a rendezvous point. Note that fine control of the rendezvous is difficult, and
velocity matching with the survivors is inexact at best; but minor mismatch in velocity is often an easier problem to overcome than a great
distance.

Operational radius with reaction drive is approximately 600,000 km with continuous burn, much further with a coasting period. Alternately,
the station can make planetfall if at least 1 G hour of fuel is still available, although doing so will generally damage the station beyond
reusability.
Note that the station can itself support one module if needed, although reaction drive endurance is reduced to 2 Hours.

The upscale version of the venerable Turtle, the Turtle II station is
capable of fully autonomous response to distress signals, and is in
fact fairly mobile. The terrapin can maintain full life support and 1g
constant acceleration for 2 weeks, giving it an operational radius of
close to 2,000,000,000 km.

With solar arrays deployed, and operating at low thrust (.1g) power
can last for 8 weeks, or indefinitely if at minimum power. It is
typically found in richer systems with moderate volumes of traffic.
It was originally intended to allow the turtle to be phased out, but
cost and practicality has thwarted this plan. Unfortunately, it is also
more likely to be hijacked or used as a hideout, despite the addition
of security measures.

Civilian Variants
As the increased cost and complexity of the final version of the SX
frontiersman reduced the Scout Services orders, the primary builder,
Martin-Lamaar of Remulak (MLR) has released civilian versions with
modules permanently installed (reducing cost as the hull space is
no longer modular) and civilian grade sensor and avionics systems.
All such versions are only capable of a single 2 parsec 259jump.
These variants of the Frontiersmen class hulls are sold as the popular
Connestoga class light trader with a basic type 2 (or 1 bis) computer,
and civilian grade sensors. Note however, that some frontiersmen
have made it onto the surplus market, generally with sensors intact,
and occasionally with the hugely overpowered type 5 computer.

The basic Connestoga versions are the liner and cargo hauler types
with permanent installations of the basic passenger or cargo module.

##### EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT ANDAND S SHIPSHIPS EQUIPMENT AND SHIPS

In an attempt to gain access to the luxury and megacorporate
market, MLR shipyards have produced a luxury variant: the “Gold
Star” class yacht, with a non modular configuration as above. The
sensors are typically civilian standard, but the computer is retained
to provide a majordomo/head butler AI for the ship.

A long range variant (Rift Star class) omits the launch, 4 ton
stateroom, library and briefing room for 30 tons of fuel and 2 tons of
cargo allowing a second consecutive two parsec jump.

Modular survey and Interdiction Station
In keeping with the modularity concept, the Scout service has
designed the Terrapin class scout station. This design is typical of
a scout survey station, and typically deployed in orbit around the
mainworld. Solar arrays may or may not be deployed, depending on
the need for secrecy.

While the Terrapin station is capable of deployment as is, it
invariably has at least 4 modules attached , typically 2 lab, 1 cargo,
and often 1 passenger or 1 long range sensor. When used as station
modules, the fuel storage in the module is typically replaced with
cargo storage.

The station can support four surveyors by itself, although double
occupancy will be required if full crews are used. The cutter is used
by the main station crew as needed.

It has also been used as an interdiction station in situations where
interdiction is combined with study. Typically, one missile bay
module will be included in such cases. A few have been pressed
into service as defence Satellites, typically supporting 3 fighter
modules and one cargo module dedicated to stores, military spares
and reloads.

Type FS Survey Scout 'Far Reach'
Based on a 500 ton, streamlined, wedge-configured hull, the Type FS is designed with long-range survey and exploration missions in mind.
Its configuration is designed for practicality and utility rather than comfort, and in this configuration it is kitted to the minimum survey and
exploration standard required by the exploratory branches of the Scout service.

As the Far Reach is designed to operate in regions where high EMP activity is a possibility, its electronics and other sensitive systems are
hardened. Its computer system is a modified Model 4, with integral telescope calibration and tracking. Once slaved to the various additional
sensor packages (SA3, SIN Sensors, and so forth), the Far Reach is an excellent example of the kind of survey vessel the Scout service
relies upon for long-range scouting and exploration missions. It is equipped with a laboratory, allowing for field samples to be analysed to
a reasonable degree.

For close-up work, the Type FS carries, as standard, a 50 ton Surveyor, which is intended for planetary activities and to supplement the main
ship's surveying and exploratory capabilities.

Normal crew consists the pilot (and captain), a navigator, 2 engineers, 3 gunners and 8 surveyors.

ADVANTAGES:

- Jump 4 Range; Jump drive and Main computer optimized for rapid sequential and/or deep space jumping.
- Highly configurable high-power sensor and computing systems allow extreme sensor range and acuity, Scout specific sensors and
    telemetry, and rapid jump calculations.
- Equipped with a full sensor and telescope array for extensive field work
- Hardened electronics prevent against EMP damage. In times of military need, the Type FS makes an excellent advanced, long-range
    scout vessel for a main battle force.

DISADVANTAGES:

- Deploying a full flight crew and survey/exploration mission team requires double cabin occupancy, making the ship cramped in the
    crew quarters. The laboratory can be jerry-configured to offer additional sleeping quarters.
- No armor, one turret
- Telescope arrays are susceptible to attack or interference.
- Limited attack/defence capabilities
- Low cargo capacity (4 tons)

200 Ton Special Circumstances Rapid Transit (Hornet)
Using a wasp-waisted, streamlined hull, this ship is used for Special Circumstances teams who need to operate in a comfortable environment
for long periods either within a system or between them. The ship is equipped with arms and armament commensurate with needing to
evade and return fire, but is essentially designed for fast transit and getaways.

As the crew need to operate for long periods, it is equipped with a Luxuries package which departs from the usual Scout mentality of living
as basically as possible. Hardened Scouts denigrate the Hornet as an easy-living option for softies, but Special Operations agents praise the
vessel's versatility and (relative) opulence.

The ship is equipped at TL12 and its computer systems and software offer excellent evasion capabilities at this level.

ADVANTAGES

- Fast and heavily armored for a craft of its size
- Hardened electronics
- Pop-up turret for covert operations where obvious weaponry is a disadvantage
- Comfortable by Scout vessel standards
- Excellent endurance and evasion capabilities

DISADVANTAGES

- Very limited cargo space
- No onboard vehicles (such as an Air Raft)
- Distinctive hull design

400 Ton 'Fat' Surveyor
The Fat Surveyor was an interim design while the Survey Rider concept was being developed; it proved useful enough to be retained,
especially in areas where its J1 is sufficient range.

Normal crew consists of a pilot, engineer, navigator, 2 small craft engineers and 18 surveyors.

It is simply a purchased or leased 400 subsidized merchant ship (Fat Trader) with a prebuilt survey package installed into its cargo space.
Note that this is not configurable space, and requires extensive work, and a dockyard to add or remove.

The Fat Surveyor can deploy and support three surveyor boats (50dt), but is not itself capable of survey operations. While less effective at its
task than the Survey Rider class, it is nonetheless far cheaper, and considerably faster to build, given that the basic hulls are already built.

Survey Rider
The Survey Rider is the scout service counterpart to the Navy Battlerider theory. Designed to deploy and maintain 4 Surveyors, the Survey
Rider is an effective survey ship on its own, and operates at M2 while the external ships are detatched. Thus far, the design has proven
successful in terms of time required to survey a system at multiple levels, but the cost analysis is less clear.

Normal crew consists of the captain, 2 pilots, a navigator, 4 engineers and 24 surveyors.

100 Ton XP4 (Firebird)
The XP4 (eXpress, Packet J4) is commonly deployed as part of the Xboat network and on the frontier areas of the empire without xboat
service. The firebird is the standard hull used to supplement the xboat system when physical delivery is needed, and in wartime, as a fleet
courier or advance scout. In the latter role, the ship generally carries a 50 ton drop tank for an initial jump allowing two consecutive four
parsec jumps, and typically has the configurable space committed to sensor upgrades and fuel. Several civilian versions exist, often used
by megacorporations to allow secure private communications routes.

support a jump 6 –a jump 3 is possible, though this would seldom be used except in the direst of situations, as wear and tear on the ships
high tuned systems is essentially the same as for a jump 6.

Vault is either 6dt cargo, or stateroom +1-2 escape bubbles. (~=2 Mcr additional).

The Mustang is designed, and its crew trained, to deliver an intact cargo at any cost, as fast as possible. Typical missions for the XPS6 would
be transport of critical personnel in war time (such as a renowned admiral), vital military or political intelligence (a treaty, declaration of war,
news of crucial assassination) of fantastically valuable items –such as ancient artefacts.

The bridge is not compact, avoiding -1 dm to pilot rolls – but double stateroom occupancy is required for the crew, and endurance is limited.
No fuel processors are carried as it would never jump without refined fuel. Scoops are included, as power plants are much less effected
by unprocessed fuel. The ship is armed, (turret maximizes point defence) but the emphasis is on escape in any kind of hostile encounter.
In passenger mode, the vault is sealed and able to maintain life support independently for one man/weeks. Extra space in the vault mode
is invariably committed to sensor upgrades if possible. The intellect program is capable of running pilot-2, and bringing the ship to its
insystem destination by itself.

XLC5 (Stingray)
The XLC5 (eXpress, Long range, Courier) Stingray's official configuration and use is as a high speed packet courier able to outspeed the
standard xboat system. In this version, it excludes the fixed double particle array, Air/raft and fuel processors, allowing an additional 6 tons
of configurable space. Note that all XLS hulls are based with the equipment necessary to rapidly convert them to the intruder variant.

In the unofficial configuration, nicknamed the “Mighty Munchkin” (derivation unknown) , the Stingray takes advantage of its massive
powerplant to mount a particle beam weapon , is equipped with a stealth drive, and is entirely dedicated to “black” or raiding missions.
With jump tanks it is capable of two rapid 5 parsec jumps.

It cannot be found legitimately on the civilian market. In wartime, it is used as a deep penetration commerce raider, courier interception, or
an insertion ship for special forces (using double staterooms or low berths as needed). In peacetime it is seldom used, but if so, generally
as an escort for couriers or the occasional Sunday punch against pirates or other small-scale opponents. Based on its cost (which, with the
stealth drive, is hideously expensive) and the fact that it is far more vulnerable than either, its missions are generally very important and
highly secret and there are very few of these vessels in service.

# FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY

This chapter deals specifically with two areas of prime importance
to the Scout service: what happens when a new race is discovered
(or an old acquaintance is strategically re-established) and the
exploration and survey of existing and new systems and worlds.

These areas are specifically in the remit of the Scout service. Save
for accidental, chance encounters, no other service has either the
mandate or the bespoke capabilities to exhaustively survey or
approach First Contact situations. The Scout service is tasked with
extending knowledge, influence and understanding, but do so in
a non-militaristic, non-threatening way. It takes dedication and a
certain skill and mind set to achieve these ends successfully, and
the Scout service is equipped to do so. As a result, the Scout service
is entrusted with the representation of the prevailing authority,
human or otherwise. It is up to the Scouts to act as the primary
ambassadors, establishing a solid base for relations, before other
professionals (with keen agendas) to take over.

Survey and First Contact go hand in hand; one often leads to
the other. They are, however, discrete activities with their own
specializations and protocols. If a Survey mission identifies
intelligent life, it does not automatically initiate First Contact:
instead it watches, assesses and then calls in the Contact branch,
arming it with all pertinent information so that the First Contact
procedure is as informed as it possibly can be. Conversely, where
Contact has discovered a new race but the system and world
has not been surveyed, Contact ensures that all information and
permissions are secured to facilitate Survey branch doing its job
fully and with as little chance of a risky incident as possible.

## FIRST CONTACT PROTOCOL

The First Contact protocol is an extensive and rigorous process for
establishing initial relations with a new intelligent species. Even
before the protocol begins, certain facts must be established, usually
by answering the following questions:

1. What is the technology level of the species?
2. What observed behaviours have already been demonstrated?
3. Does the species know of our existence, or is it possibly aware
    of it?
4. Has any known species already undergone First Contact with
    the new species? What were the results?
5. Might establishing First Contact damage the new species in
    any way, or lead to its damage?

Simply because an individual from an advanced, space-faring race
is capable of initiating First Contact, it does not necessarily follow
that First Contact should occur. The Scout service's Contact branch
always asks itself the five questions above before First Contact

protocol is initiated. If the answers to the questions are such that
First Contact might be damaging to either party, in either the short,
medium or long term, then Contact is fully sanctioned to withdraw

- either to leave the species completely alone, or to maintain a
discreet distance, monitor, and establish what future point will
serve as the best time for a First Contact attempt.

The answers to the basic questions depend purely on the new species
and the circumstances of discovery. Therefore Contact branch is
completely free to reach its own conclusions, after assessing all
risks, and then taking the necessary action.

However, when it is decided that First Contact Protocol should be
initiated, it works thus.

First Assessments:
Assess the potential for mutual communication. If there is the
opportunity to begin linguistic analysis in order to build translation
modules, then this should form the primary step before any further
contact is made.

Assess the immediate Impact of Encounter: what is the likelihood of
aggression? If aggression is possible, what is the level of the threat?
Once established, appropriate defensive (but not aggressive)
measures may be put in place before contact begins.

##### FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY

Assess two-way threat potential. Does the species and its technology,
appear to pose an imminent threat or possibly cause harm to
human life? Conversely, does human life and/or its accompanying
technology appear to pose a threat or cause harm to the species? If
any risk is evident, First Contact should be terminated immediately
and only resumed when the threat can be countered.

Course of Action:
If it is perceived or verified that harmful impact, whether mutual or
unilateral, is imminent or likely, action must be taken to separate
the Contact team from the species. Practicality must always dictate
efficiency: if it is more practical to retreat, then this is what should be
done. In general, withdrawing from the species' home environment
is the best option. It must always be assumed that both the species
and the Contact team are a potential source of pathogens and micro-
organisms that may be harmful to life.

Where it is necessary and practical to do so, the Contact team
should construct a suitable environment for the species, if this will
facilitate successful first contact. This may be a habitat supporting
a particular atmospheric type or other environmental factors. The
overwhelming consideration is the comfort and safety of the species,
once all other risks have been taken into consideration.

If conditions do not permit a retreat, or, alternately, if separation
and/or isolation of the species is not possible, and a potential
impact or threat seems likely to arise, defensive measures may be
necessary and are permissible. In such an event, self-preservation is
likely to dictate action. However, all discipline must be exercised if
defensive action proves necessary. Where physical force is the only
alternative, the dictate is:

Use no more force than is absolutely necessary to secure a safe
withdrawal. Do not inflict force until it has been either inflicted, or its
outbreak is inevitable. Hurt rather than maim. Maim rather than kill.

If injury or death results from the initial encounter, but no further
injuries or losses are sustained upon withdrawal, then the incident
is to be classified as either Accidental or a Self-Defence response: no
further retaliatory action is to be considered or initiated.

### ENVIRONMENT

The environment for the contact must be fully assessed and
established. Primary questions:

- Is the contact in space/orbit or planet-side?
- If in space, is the contact aboard a species' vessel or a Contact
    vessel? Does a mid-way, neutral point need to be established?
    What are the atmospheric considerations?
- If planet-side, is the contact in the open or within confines? If in
    the open, is the area accessible for withdrawal transportation?
    If in confines, has the safety of all parties been ensured, and are

exit routes clear and visible? If at all possible the confines should
be visited first, or scanned for permeability, beforehand.

- What necessary protection or environmental factors need to be
    established to ensure the comfort of the species?
- What customs/traditions/greetings/formalities need to be
    observed? Ensure that all members of the Contact team are
    rehearsed in performing expected or required actions.
- What is the likely impact of Contact technology upon the initial
    meeting? If overt displays of technology are likely to cause
    offence or provoke a threat, Contact members are sanctioned
    to use covert or discreet devices for monitoring purposes only.

Contact must always consider and assess the impact of waste
discharge/disposal upon the environment. EM Field interference (or
other force/radiation interference) and its probable effect will need
to be determined before contact begins.

Whenever it is possible, and to the best of one's capabilities, Contact
should always minimise its impact.

If the environment for the contact initiation is unsuitable it may
become unsafe for either party, Contact should consider a withdrawal
rather than following through the initial meeting and being placed at
risk. If it is possible to negotiate the environment for the meeting,
then this is encouraged, as long as the environment remains equally
beneficial (in terms of comfort and safety) for both parties.

Communication/Means of Contact
Before contact is commenced, the Contact team should fully
establish:

The means of communication used by the species: audible/vocal,
visual, chromatic, aromatic, pheromonic, mental/psionic.

Where an evident incompatibility of communication medium exists
between species, time should be taken to attempt to understand
and construct a bridge for communications. If this proves
impossible, withdrawal from the contact situation is preferable to
miscommunications, or frustration through miscommunication
leading to an escalation of violence or a similar threat.

No assumptions about the intent of the species, relating to its
wishes, desires or agendas must be made. All contact comes with
an open mind and non-judgmental approach. Contact agents are
required to suspend all preconceived notions about a species
or race and to adopt a fully open stance when establishing and
commencing communications. Personal feelings are to be fully
subsumed at all times. No degree of prejudice, disdain or revulsion
is to be exhibited.

Where possible, and where technology permits it, initial contact,
certainly with the purposes of establishing a common language
for communication, should be via computer and communal

##### FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY

may be acting upon a similar ethical principle of non-interference
or minimal impact and may wait for communication from Contact,
or its technological aid. In such a case, the species may provide a
primer for one or more congruent modes of communication. If not,
and if the species seems to be making no clear instructive signs, then
trial and error is the only way of proceeding. Contact is expected to
prepare a comprehensive list of communication methods and work
through them methodically, with a full catalogue of results and
conclusions, for entry into the Contact Log.

Contact must always remember that any potentially superior life-
form may still be harmed and/or impacted by any 'less' intelligent
entity, through an accident/mistake in the course of the interaction.
On a potentially less severe level, sometimes this will be an error
in the use/misuse of language that initiates a negative and/or
unhelpful response. This is natural in any case where translation/
interpretation of a foreign language is operant. Such an event is also
an opportunity to assess the social intelligence of the species.

If a direct form of communication has been established, whether
rudimentary or advanced, whether auditory, visual (including
sophisticated forms such as symbolic representation or logic), or
tactile/other sensory methods and the communicative environment
is assessed to be non-threatening/hostile, then the acquiring of
basic categories of information about the AE*{and presumably the
HE*} should typically follow the following agenda:

Identity
Purpose
Needs
Plans

Identity: to establish a basic form of indication or enabling reference
to both Contact and the species. Once such basic indicators have
been established, a more complete identification of the species
is necessary. What is the status/role/position of the species
representative in regards to its own kind? Is the species a leader
or official/designated representative of its kind? Alternately, is the
representative a refugee of some kind? It is imperative to gather
as much information about the species as possible before seeking/
requesting contact with any form of leadership. If, however, the
species representative has communicated clearly that it is a scout/
ambassador or other mandated representative of its race, then this
issue of leadership should be addressed. Contact is always acting
in a fully mandated capacity, and all Library programs aboard
standard Scout vessels carry the appropriate marks of authority in
all known languages.

Purpose: determine the specific and general reasons that the species
has come to its current location. Care must be exercised where the
purpose may involve the species' cultural reality (war, for example),
religious beliefs and/or customs. The species may have what is
akin to a human scientific agenda/purpose. Such a possibility may
provide a valuable opportunity for cooperation/collaboration.

Needs: the survival requirements of the species. Needs
assessments will typically follow from purpose assessments. A
species may have need to be where it is due to the presence of
one or more dependent resources. This can also be an important
opportunity to establish a cooperative/beneficial relationship. It is
important to be thorough in assessing the needs of the species to
avoid potential sources of conflict.

Plans: the methods or strategies for securing the species'
needs. Needs assessments will require more advancement in
communication, as well as mutual trust. A species may be reluctant
to communicate its plans, or reluctant without communication with
others of its kind, or those which it represents. The species may have
no such plans in that in may be self-sustaining (via technological
or organo-structural means), or simply be engaged in harmless
exploratory activity (vacation, or its equivalent).

Subsequent Assessments
In the event that contact and compatibility of means of
communication has been assessed, and whether or not the species
possesses a congruent consciousness, and communication has
been established, more detailed assessments of the species must
be made. This is particularly so with species that are assessed to be
incongruent with Contact's consciousness or ontological structure.
It is presumed here that all life-forms, whether possessing an
analogous physiologic nature (an analogous genetic “code” or
replication memory structure), or not, have evolved under selective
pressure(s) of some kind (Knowledge of the indigenous conditions
of the species' native world will aid in identifying these pressures).
Some information in this regard may be collected via the First
Assessments Protocol. However, no such assessments, no matter
how thorough/detailed, can accurately ascertain the full and true
nature of the species.

Given the above presumption, basic biological needs must be
determined. It is also presumed that all life forms require the intake/
extraction/utilization of energy of some kind in order to function, and
that all life forms have developed strategies to obtain/secure these
energy needs. Given this, what are the energy sources/resources
required by the species? What are the AE's strategies for securing
its energy needs/resources?

The Contact branch of the Scout service presumes that all life forms
possess some means of self-replication/regulation, although such
means may not be obvious or immediately discoverable. What are
the reproductive/replication needs of the species? What strategies
does the species use to ensure reproduction? How do these
strategies impact upon Contact?

Can the short and/or long-term survival strategies of the species
be determined? Can advantages/disadvantages to Contact be
assessed? If such assessments cannot be made at the present time,
and communication with the species is not/no longer possible, then
a commitment to long-term study/analysis may be required. Remote

AE: Alien Entity; HE: Human Entity*

##### FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY

information networking. Once communications have reached a
stage where a physical meeting has been agreed, then authorization
is given to establish the details for the meeting (subject the earlier
parts of the protocol relating to safety and withdrawal). All meeting
arrangements must be mutual. All electronic communications are
to be encrypted, stored and archived. No deviation from agreed
meeting procedures is permitted unless extenuating circumstances
(such as those relating to safety of either party) dictate it.

Translation programs must be initialised as soon as possible.
Translation sub-protocols are as follows:

- Understanding of basic communicators (I, You, We, They, Us.
    Names. Simple nouns, verbs and adjectives.)
- Establish simple mathematical concepts (Base, common
    distances, ages, time measurements)
- Establish and use words for Peace, Co-operation, Trust,
    Agreement.
- Establish position in galaxy using simple descriptors, followed
    by astronomical co-ordinates if possible
- Establish a framework for more complex conversational
    propositions: words to use and avoid. Sentence length. Amount
    of time spent speaking.
- Avoid all reference to relative military strengths or capabilities,
    including your own. All First Contact exchanges are to be kept
    neutral.
- Technological development and achievement may be discussed
    as long as this specifically avoids military discussions. If
    mutual scientific help can be established, especially relating to
    healthcare, then it should be done so immediately.

IMPORTANT NOTE: _An unintentional/accidental communicative
event or exchange may occur spontaneously or immediately upon
first encounter. In this event, Contact must withdraw and make an
immediate assessment of the impact of the incident. If communication
can be resumed, then it should be resumed at a mutually agreeable
point. Apologies should be resisted initially; this may send signals of
weakness. However acknowledging an error is permissible and is likely
to prove necessary if communication is to be resumed._

In the absence of signs or instructive signals from the species to
communicate within a specific mode, and given it is Contact which
desires to communicate it is incumbent upon Contact to adapt its
exploratory efforts to the assessed means of contact/communication
of the species.

If the AE appears to have light spectra sensory capability, then forms
of visible light-based communication may be explored.

If the species has been assessed as being superior in adaptive
intelligence and means of communication, and also having been
assessed as benign, then communication might first be initiated by
the species. However, Contact should remember that the species

viewing/sensing is often the best method of achieving this end and
this First Contact protocol authorises Contact teams to establish
such measures.

Typical Contact Mission Structure
Where Contact is involved in a First Protocol exercise, the personnel
structure is usually thus:

MISSION LEADER
A Contact branch operative with at least 3 terms of service within
the Scouts (and at least one term in Contact). The mission leader
is responsible for ensuring that the First Contact protocol is fully
observed, and for maintaining the welfare and safety of both his
crew and those involved in the First Contact endeavor. It is usual
for the Mission Leader to assume the role of primary contact with
any new species, but he may delegate this responsibility to any
member of his team, based on the spread of skills and experience
available to him.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
The Comms Officer is responsible for handling all electronic
communications with a First Contact species, including translation
and decryption protocols. Additionally he must establish a First
Contact Log and ensure that each and every stage of the mission is
fully recorded and approved by the Mission Leader. He may or may
not form part of any direct contact delegation, and it is usual for the
Comms Officer to remain remote from the main contact endeavor
in order to ensure accurate records are maintained.

RISK OFFICER
The Risk Officer assesses all risks according to the First Contact
protocol, and advises the Mission Leader on rising or falling levels
of risk, and when a contact mission should be aborted. Before
any mission involving a face to face meeting takes place, the
Risk Officer, accompanied by the Security Officer, is in charge of
surveying the meeting place and ensuring its compatibility with the
First Contact protocol. If the First Contact is as a result of a third
party encountering the species, the Risk Officer interviews that
person or party in order to obtain all information that will inform
the Contact mission.

SECURITY OFFICER
The Security Officer is in charge of ensuring the immediate security
an d welfare of the mission and its personnel, as directed by the
Mission Leader. Working with the Risk Officer he will determine exit
and other defensive strategies. It is usual for the Security Officer to
have at least one subordinate (usually two) who assist with planning
and implementation of any security strategies.

FIRST CONTACT OFFICER
This post is often the Mission Leader, but may be someone else
who has been involved in First Contact missions previously, and

##### FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY

who has served at least two terms in the Contact branch of the
Scout service. The First Contact Officer is responsible for all direct
contact with a new species and is expected to work fully within
First Contact protocol guidelines unless directed otherwise by the
Mission leader.

SCIENCE OFFICER
The Science Officer always has at least Level 1 in two Science
branches. His responsibility is to assess all biological/environmental/
technological needs of any new species and inform the Mission
Leadxer accordingly. If certain requirements need to be fulfilled,
then he is expected to co-ordinate the necessary work. The Science
Officer is often assisted by one subordinate and is usually part of
the face to face contact delegation when a meeting occurs.

FLIGHT CREW
The flight crew usually consists of at least two pilots, a navigator,
a comms officer and an engineer. Roles may be doubled with the
mission team, but sometimes discrete flight and mission teams are
assigned to a particular mission. The flight crew is answerable to
the Mission Leader, but where the operation and safety of the ship
is concerned, then the more experienced pilot is usually designated
as first officer and responsible for the direct welfare of the ship.

Sophontological Categorization

Sophontology is the study and categorization of intelligent
and self-aware creatures. The general categories of beings
recognized under sophontology are:

Biological Intelligents (Biont):
Life that has evolved naturally from organic compounds, whether
earth-like or exotic chemistry, as well as gene-engineered
sentients. This category, the largest of all, includes

- Bionts (biological intelligence) such as baselines/
    nearbaselines (those organisms that resemble, or appear
    close, to homo sapiens)
- Tweaks (creatures genetically optimized for the their
    environment)
- Su (baselines that have been genetically enhanced to
    exhibit superior characteristics to homo sapiens),
- Provolves (uplifted races, such as Vagr and Aslan)
- Splices (a deliberate amalgamation, or splicing, of two
    separate genomes to create a single, sentient or sapient
    entity)
- Bioborgs (biologically augmented bionts)
- Neogens (a generic term for any biont in which the original
    genotype has been artificially created or spliced from other
    species).

ARTIFICIALS
Any constructed, engineered creature (such as robots, androids
or sapient AI networks/drones)

CYBORGS
The deliberate combination of Biont and Artificial, where
constructed augmentation is used to enhance the biont.

SYBONT
A sophont syborg or sybornetic neogen. Artificial organisms
that are neither purely organic, purely artificial, nor a cyborg-
like patchwork, but rather a uniform mixture of artificial and
biological.

VIRTUAL
A sentient that does not have a physical body, or uses one only
temporarily.

SUBLIMED
An intelligence that has completed transcended its original
state of being to occupy a new form of existence or
consciousness(perhaps extra-planar, or non-physical).

### SURVEY AND EXPLORATION

The basic survey routine for new systems breaks down into five
sequential phases:

1. Pre-jump assessment,
2. Initial system overview
3. Overall system survey phase
4. Mainworld survey phase
5. Final survey and Departure phase.

For archival purposes, each of the first four phases requires a log
beacon to be dropped or updated, as appropriate, before the next
phase is initiated. In all case a passive log beacon must be dropped
or updated before departure jump.

Further, note that the first four phases all have both a range of
goals and partial and complete mission abort criteria which must
always be considered. Partial abort situations terminate the current
phase of the survey, but may or may not preclude further survey
actions; a mission abort terminates the mission, and requires an
exit jump at the earliest possible opportunity consistent with the
abort conditions.

Pre-jump assessment phase
The prejump assessment phase is generally carried out from
closest system to the target of survey system (TOS). Ideally this
will be no more than 2 parsecs distant, but circumstances will often
require longer range, and, hence, less accurate initial assessment.
Accordingly, any existing data on the system should be used, and
compared with real time data wherever possible. In extreme cases,
a deep space jump may be required to reach the TOS system, and
this can be used as the prejump assessment point.
Typical survey equipment used in this phase will be archival data and
extreme range passive EMS scans, including wide aperture visual
survey. Typical time can range from one to five days, depending on
range to TOS and preexisting data.

NOTE: in all cases Gas Giant (GG) Presence must be confirmed or
eliminated by real-time observation, if return from TOS will require
refueling before return. If no GG is detected, assume deep space
refueling procedures will be needed.

GOALS
Confirm Existing basic data if previously surveyed. If unsurveyed ,
assess:

- Gas Giant Presence and gross system structure.
- Companion Star Presence
- Initial system structure
- Stellar anomalies

ABORT CRITERIA
Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
abort prejump immediately upon detecting:

- Evidence of red zone star or companion or GG type(extreme
    hazard)
- Evidence of Starfaring Habitation
- Evidence off red zone Anomalies
- Evidence of significant and unexplainable alteration or
    manipulation of system
- Evidence of anomalous artifact(s) at pre-jump distance

Outer system arrival and system overview
phase
Entry into a new system is typically made at much greater distance
than a typical system jump. The default entry point is above the
system's orbital plane (ecliptic) in the Oort region (typically 50,000
AU from the star); this allows maximum chance of avoiding
uncharted bodies, minimal interference in system scanning, and
maximum discretion if system is inhabited.

Typical survey equipment used in this phase will be long range
passive EMS scans, Neutrino and Jump particle detectors (ie, Deep
Radar), as well as gravitic/densinometer scans as possible, and
narrow aperture visual observation.

Typical time can range from one to two weeks depending on range
to TOS and preexisting data.

GOALS
Confirm Existing basic data if previously surveyed. If unsurveyed ,
assess

- System structure: Number of significant planets belts and
    companions by orbit
- General Planetary description: classification of above orbit
    residents into basic types; as possible determine provisional
    UWP descriptions
- Identify technologically advanced inhabitation of system
- Identify provisional Mainworld;

ABORT CRITERIA
Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
abort upon mission confirming

- Evidence off red zone (extreme hazard) anomalies able to effect
    outer planetary system
- Evidence of red zone star type(extreme hazard)
- Evidence of Advance Technological inhabitation (TL 6+, extra
    planetary travel obvious)
- Evidence of significant and unexplainable alteration or
    manipulation of system
- Evidence of intrusion by foreign polity

Overall system description phase.
Once the initial system overview is completed the survey will typically
proceed to an identified Mainworld or specified TOS; alternately, the
survey will continue inward until either a Mainworld or TOS can be

##### FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY

observation drones will be used, as well as translators and advanced
computing resources.

Typical time can range from one to twelve months depending on
biosphere complexity and the existence of local inhabitants.

GOALS

- Confirm Existing basic data if previously surveyed
- Extra planetary survey sub-phase
- Confirm physical UWP, confirm Biopotential and initial
    biocomplexity rating
- Confirm habitation and assign initial UWP social descriptors
- Locate and assess satellites or anomalous planetary orbital
    residents
- Locate and assess any extra planetary settlements or artifacts
    in the Mainworld orbital system.
- Consider contact protocol if significant extra planetary
    settlements are found.
- Consider Covert survey protocol based on nature of native
    society.
- If surface contact is considered
- Assess detailed atmospheric composition.
- Assess biocompatibility with Standard life profiles , and general
    biocomplexity
- Where appropriate and/or necessary, determine technological
    level of inhabitants, population distribution, and militarism/
    xenophobia
- If planet not obviously inhabited, assess planetary complexity
    and sentience probability rating.
- Apply appropriate biohazard and contact protocol with regards
    to any landing or intentional contact.

Surface survey sub-phase
Following distant and close orbital survey, a surface survey is often
appropriate. At all times biological hazard protocol consistent
with world biotype must be employed until proven unnecessary.
Additionally potential unidentified sophont life must always be
assessed for and considered. If a surface survey is initiated, a third
log beacon should be dropped, or, alternately the second should be
updated.

- Consider First Contact protocol if inhabited or if sentient life
    suspected. This may require a mission abort so that Contact
    branch can be briefed and a Contact mission established.
- Consider Covert survey protocol based on nature of native
    society.
- Physical landing
- Immediate assessment of biosphere and physical environmental
    hazard.
- Immediate assessment of environmental impact potential of
    extra planetary life
- Immediate assessment of inhabitant reaction and social hazard
    where appropriate

identified and/or located. If refueling is required, this operation is
the first priority of this phase, and should be accomplished at the
furthest possible point from the system's star;

Typical survey equipment used in this phase will be active and passive
EMS scans, as well as gravitic/densinometer scans and direct visual
observation. Flyby probes and non-recoverable encounter drones
may be used if deemed necessary.

Typical time can range from one to five weeks depending on system
complexity and course and distance to TOS.

GOALS
Confirm Existing basic data if previously surveyed. If unsurveyed ,
assess:

- Identify or Confirm location of Mainworld or TOS; initial log
    beacon should be dropped at this point.
- Assess habitation status of Mainworld at all points
- Approach to TOS should be plotted so as to maximize survey
    opportunities for as many other orbital residents as possible,
    consistent with allowed duration of mission. For any such
    secondary orbital residents.
- Assess physical UWP parameters.
- Where possible or relevant, assess Biological potential of non-
    TOS orbit residents
- Where appropriate and/or necessary, determine provisional
    Biocomplexity and social UWP ratings.
- Note Planetary anomalies and/or non TOS colonies/stations

ABORT CRITERIA
Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
abort mission immediately upon detecting:

- Evidence of red zone TOS (extreme hazard)
- Evidence of use or deployment of Nuclear or Biological
    weaponry
- Evidence of extreme militarization by inhabitants
- Evidence of colonization or settlement by hostile foreign Polity

Mainworld description Phase
In general, the Mainworld description is the heart of a survey
mission. This phase will involve both orbital observation, and
,where appropriate, on planet survey. A second log beacon should
be dropped in orbit or at the trailing Lagrange point as appropriate.

Typical survey equipment used in this phase will be active and
passive EMS scans, as well as deep scanning gravitic/densinometer
sensors and direct visual observation. Extensive use of flyby probes
and encounter drones is typical. Surface surveys will typically add
neural activity sensors, and extensive passive motion, thermal and
visual bugs, as well as handheld and vehicle mounted versions of
previously noted sensors. In contact situations extensive covert

- Crew or Drone EVA as appropriate
- Initiate and begin Biophysical survey protocol
- Initiate and begin Sophont Contact protocol – but only if
    previously sanctioned to do so by Contact, or if a Contact
    mission team forms part of the Survey team.

ABORT CRITERIA
Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
Abort entire mission immediately upon detecting:

- If the survey will likely result in an unsanctioned First Contact
    situation
- Evidence of militarization by foreign or unknown stellar capable
    polities
- Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
    abort close survey immediately upon detecting
- Evidence of nuclear or biological weapons capability by
    inhabitants
- Settlement or militarization by advanced stellar society of
    unknown, or known hostile origin
- High probability of impact upon planetary biosphere
- High Xenophobia, Militarism or Fragility rating of space capable
    inhabitants
- Unless specified as possible mission target or risk environment,
    abort surface survey immediately upon detecting
- Use of nuclear or biological weaponry in current or recent times
    (4 standard years)
- Extreme biological hazard compatible with standard life
    profiles
- Evidence of extreme negative impact on native biosphere
- Evidence of high Xenophobia, Militarism or Fragility rating of
    inhabitants capable of accessing landing area.

Anomaly description and departure phase
Following the successful conclusion of the Mainworld survey phase,
or a mission abort limited to Mainworld survey, a survey mission
will typically assess any significant non TOS anomalies based on
importance, and allowed mission duration remaining. Finally,
system departure is typically made for the outer system to allow
for the follow-up assessment of other orbital residents; additionally,
in inhabited systems, a distant departure minimises transfer of
information regarding advanced travel systems to the inhabitants.

Typical survey equipment used in this phase will be similar to
appropriate phases above.

Typical time can range from one to six weeks depending on residual
survey needs, and distance to planned exit point.

GOALS

- Initiate survey of non TOS anomalies deemed significant, as
    appropriate to standing orders and mission duration parameters.
       - Update and or expand existing data as possible and consistent
          with exit point course and mission duration parameters. For all
          such survey objects,
       - Assess physical UWP parameters.
       - Where possible or relevant, assess Biological potential of non-
          TOS orbit residents
       - Where appropriate and/or necessary, determine provisional
          Biocomplexity and social UWP ratings.
       - Note Planetary anomalies and/or non TOS colonies/stations
       - Before actual jump, a final Log beacon must be dropped with
          the full data from the survey. For any such secondary orbital
          residents.

ABORT CRITERIA
All previous criteria potentially apply to this phase of the mission,
as appropriate to whatever additional survey activities are being
carried out.

General Mission Abort Criteria
The following mission abort conditions apply at all phases of the
mission

- Evidence of red zone conditions affecting ship (extreme
    hazard)
- Evidence of active militarization by hostile advanced foreign
    Polity
- Unexpected intrusion by or evidence of previous military
    intrusion by hostile advanced foreign Polity
- Initiation of hostilities by or with native inhabitants or by any
    advanced Polity unit, or entity
- Uncontrolled native biological activity within the ship or crew
- Infestation of any crewmember's face, body or brain by
    Geigeresque parasites or Lovecraftian entities.
- Contact with any entity or artifact reasonably described
    as “madness inducing”, “fatally and soul-rendingly
    incomprehensible”, “sanity wrecking”, “amorphously
    squamous”, or possessing or displaying extra dimensional,
    blasphemous or non-Euclidean qualities or powers.

TYPICAL SURVEY MISSION STRUCTURE
Every survey or exploration mission is equipped for prolonged deep
space activity. The personnel can vary, but generally the personnel
structure is as follows:

MISSION LEADER
Usually a Scout scientist with at least four terms of service, two in Survey
or Exploration. He is also usually at Level 2 in two Science branches.
The Mission Leader is responsible for each of the five phases of the
survey mission and is in charge of all abort decisions. At this level, the
Mission Leader is directing the mission team rather than engaging in
scientific work himself, but it is not uncommon for the Mission Leader
to take a lead or involve himself in particular area of expertise.

##### FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY

SENIOR SCIENTIST
The Senior Scientist deputises for the Mission Leader and is
responsible for the co-ordination of all scientific efforts conducted
as part of the mission. He is expected to know, and understand,
what each scientist is doing as part of the mission's goals, and to
make regular reports to the Mission Leader. The Senior Scientist
generally has similar experience to the Mission Leader.

SCIENCE OFFICERS
Each survey mission usually carries a complement of the following
scientists (one or two, depending on craft size), each with a minimum
of Level 1 in their respective skills:

- Physical Sciences: Chemist and Physicist
- Life Sciences: Biologist, Geneticist
- Social Sciences: Archaeologist, Sophontologist (if the mission
    is sanctioned for First Contact)
- Space Sciences: Planetologist, Astronomer/Astrophysicist,
    Xenologist

Roles are often doubled-up, so a scientist with expertise (at least
level 1) in two or more sciences will take on dual (or more) roles.

TECHNICIANS
The Technicians are engineering and mechanics responsible for
the maintenance and calibration of all equipment associated with
the mission. The Technical team is headed by a senior Technician
(Engineering 2+) who answers to the Mission Leader – not the
Senior Scientist. Generally the Technical team consists of the Senior
Technician and two general Technicians.

SECURITY OFFICER
The Security Officer answers to the Mission Leader and is responsible
for all matters relating to security, safety and risk assessment. It is
his call on when a survey team should withdraw from a particular
situation, although this generally requires some sanction by the
mission leader.

FLIGHT CREW
The flight crew usually consists of at least two pilots, a navigator,
a comms officer and an engineer. Roles may be doubled with the
mission team, but sometimes discrete flight and mission teams
are assigned to a particular mission. The flight crew is answerable
to the Mission Leader, but where the operation and safety of the
ship is concerned, then the more experienced pilot is usually

designated as first officer and responsible for the direct welfare
of the ship.

System Mainworld Cartography
From the viewpoint of any stellar system survey mission, there are
six primary considerations for the Mainworld of a system:

1. Where is it relative to other planets in the system?
2. How big is the 100/10d limit for the star, and is the destination
    inside this limit?
3. Where are the gas giant(s), if any?
4. Where are the asteroid belts and the other planets?
5. Are there other important ports in system?
6. Where are the other non-Gas giant planets relative to the
    Mainworld?

The system presented here is designed to supplement the main
World Generation rules found in the Traveller rulebook, and to
enable the referee to answer the above 6 questions with a reasonable
chance of the system not sounding improbable.

Definitions & Caveats:

- Orbits is a key term, and as used here simply means 'the order
    out from the star of an actual planet', with no other requirements
    or specifications.
- No attempt is made to provide actual distances within the
    system. Travel time between planets should be either prorated,
    based on general values (near world, near gas giant, and so on)
    made up, or based on actual distances generated with a more
    detailed system (the planned Worlds book for the Traveller
    series, for example).
- Most of the planets other than the homeworld and explicit
    choices by the referee should not be rolled for using this system
    beyond what is provided. This system is intended to locate the
    homeworld in relation to the non-homeworld planets, locate
    the belts (for space opera danger and mining campaigns) and
    locate the Gas Giants (for fuel).
- Finally, the system allows existing generated worlds to be
    positioned in systems with some degree of likelihood. It also
    allows the system to influence the world generation for new
    planets.
- The actual relationships of the orbits to each other are
    categorical, not continuous – there are no actual distances
    implied or generated, just the order of planets outward from
    the sun.

### MAINWORLD CARTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM

1. Roll the jump shadow (JS) of the star. This defines the 100d sphere in which any jump is risky. As the star is unspecified, this is a relative
measurement, not absolute.

Jump Shadow (JS)=1d6 orbits.

2. Roll the number of significant planet/orbits for the star: Again, this is not intended to capture all the planets/orbital bodies; just the ones
significant to play and or spaceship movement, broadly defined.

Significant planet orbits = 1d6+JS

3. Note if there are any gas giants from the standard system rules in the core Traveller rules.
4. Determine the three abstract zones for the system: Inner, Habitable, and Outer.

- Roll 2d6.
- The low dice is the number of the last Inner orbit;
- The high dice is the orbit number of the first Outer orbit.
- Any orbits between these numbers are the habitable zone.
- A tie means no planet in hab zone orbit, as does a difference of only one.

5. For each orbit , roll 2d6 testing from the star out, retain the dice as rolled

- Double 6 in any orbit indicates a significant (close) companion star in the last orbit.
- Pairs suggest a gas giant, if any exist in that orbit

1. In the inner system, only double 1places a Gas Giant;
2. In the outer system any pair, or a total > half the orbit.
3. Stop placing Gas Giants once all Gas Giants noted in step 3 have been placed
4. Unplaced Gas Giants should be added to the outside of the system in new orbits (but inside any companion start, naturally)

- If there is no Gas Giant in that orbit, there is a terrestrial, iceball or belt. Read the individual dice to describe which is present.
    Remember, there are no empty orbits generated by this system based on the definition of an orbit. The actual spacing is not specified
- For orbits in the inner region, read the lower dice,
- For outer region, read the high one :

1 = small rock, (roll size as 1-3)
2 = large rock, (roll size as 4+)
3 = planetoid or belt (roll size as 0-1)
4 = small ice, (roll size as 2-4)
5 = Large ice (roll size as 5+)
6 = Planetoid or belt. (roll size as 0-1)

- Once an orbit is assigned, reroll for the next orbit.

Once all orbits are assigned, move to step 6.

6. Mainworld planetary placement. The Mainworld is the planet defined in the UWP for the system.

Method I : Standard orbit.

- This is best used when the UWP has already been generated.
- Most homeworlds will be in the middle orbit of the Habitable zone, randomly chosen otherwise.
- If no Habitable zone exists, roll 1d6: on a 6 it is the moon of the first Gas Giant; otherwise it is in the last inner orbit.

##### FIRST CONTACT AND SURVEY FFIRSTIRST C CONTACTONTACT ANDAND S SURVEYURVEY

Method II: Random orbit

- This is best used when the UWP has not been generated.
- Test each orbit from the last Habitable zone orbit inwards to the sun: roll 3+ on 1D6 for it to be in that orbit.
- If no inner zone or Habitable Zone world is indicated, test each orbit going outwards: 3+ on 1D6 for it to be in the orbit.
- The orbits of Gas Giants are not skipped –a roll indicating a homeworld in that orbit places it as a moon.
- If the orbit indicated is a Gas Giant or Stellar Companion, the Mainworld is a satellite of that body.

Method III: Orbit determined by the pregenerated world.

- This is best used when one has a desire for more detail, and the time to indulge it.
- Generate the homeworld. as normal. Final orbit location is determined by planet atmosphere. This will replace the rolled orbit occupant
    (eg large rock, etc) Read the Atmosphere code (Traveller main rules).
- Atmosphere A+ needs to be either in the last habitable zone, or an outer zone orbit:
- Start at the last habitable zone orbit, and roll outwards for each non Gas Giant orbit : 1d6 roll of 3+ places the planet.
- If it fails to place, it replaces the first Gas Giant in the Outer zone which moves to the last orbit (inside a companion)
- Atmospheres 4-9 are placed in habitable zones if available.
- Roll for each Habitable zone orbit: 3+ on 1D6 places the planet. If the orbit contains a Gas Giant, the Mainworld is a moon of the Gas
    Giant.
- If not in the habitable zone, the last inner zone and then the first outer zone should be checked for 1d6, with 5+ resulting in the
    placing
- If this fails to place, it is a moon of the first Gas Giant in the Outer zone.
- Atmospheres 0-3 can go in any orbit.
- Start in the first habitable zone orbit and test outwards, with 4+ on 1d6 resulting in a placing, up to the last habitable zone;
- Then , the last inner zone orbit and inwards; then first outer zone orbit outwards.
- If it the planet fails to place, it is a moon of the first Gas Giant in the Outer zone.
- Size 0, 1 or 2 are generally moons or planetoids in a belt.
- Initial placement is the first belt in the habitable zone, or as a moon of the first planet in the habitable zone (optionally, roll 2+ on 1D6
    for each planet in the habitable zone, working outward)
- If not placed, choose the belt closest to the habitable zone. If equidistant, take the one closest to the sun. Otherwise, test each Gas
    Giant going outwards (3+ on 1d6) for it to be a moon.
- If still not placed, roll for each non Gas Giant orbit starting from the first (3+ on 1D6).
- If STILL unplaced, it is the satellite of any companion, or in the last inner orbit.
- If no belt, it is a moon of a planet in the habitable zone

##### IISS SCOUT SERVICE

This chapter is for those referees setting their campaigns in the
Third Imperium. It includes detail on the structure of the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) make-up and modus operandi, with
a particular operational focus on the Imperial Grand Survey (IGS)

Accordingly, the IISS is divided into several offices, in many cases
reflecting historical merges with other organizations. Currently,
these are Exploration, Survey, Administration, Communications,
and Operations Offices.

Administrations Office
The contains the bureaucracy that keeps the IISS functioning smoothly.
Its three branches are: Personnel, Finance, and Procurement.

The Personnel Branch maintains several functions. It is primarily
responsible for the service records of Scouts and ex-Scouts, for
recruiting, hiring, and retirement, and for personnel transfers

# IISS SIISS SCOUTCOUT S SERVICEERVICE

'Welcome to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, the most
exciting and adventurous arm of the Imperial Bureaucracy,
assuming you don't count the marines as part of the bureaucracy,
and take into account that much of what the IISS does would be
done better or certainly with better equipment by the Navy, or
faster by a private firm, or more safely by robots and automated
probes, and finally considering the fact that you are not in the
cool Field branch of the Exploration Service, but rather the ISS
(Imperial survey scouts) branch of the Survey Service of the
IISS.'

Mariel Syngher, Director, IISS Recruitment

## IISS ORGANOGRAM

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) is the organization
charged with exploration on and beyond Imperial frontiers. it actually
predates the empire, descending from the explorations services
amalgamated by the fledgling empire. Across its many years, it has
moved beyond simple exploration, adapting to the current need,
and adding functions as needed. It has acquired responsibility for
maintaining and updating cartography throughout the Imperium,
directing basic, expanding and maintaining communications
throughout the empire via the postal and courier service, and,
obviously, the crucial xboat network.

Combat operations and the Scout Service

The primary goal of a scouting mission when attacked, is to
run away.

Obviously, an exception to this very clearly stated rule of
engagement occurs when Scouts are ordered to do otherwise.
Other exceptions can occur in situations where the act of
running away involves fighting, or when running away proves
an impossibility.

Where combat is unavoidable, Scouts have a reputation for
being dangerous in a fight. In truth, this is due to their extremely
amateurish over-response to the smallest provocation as well
as their extreme unpredictability caused by complete panic and
lack of any preconceptions or standard tactics based on training
or experience.

##### IISS SIISS SCOUTCOUT S SERVICEERVICE

between branches. It manages the careers of the members of the
Scout Service and is in charge of co-ordinating all recalls for ex-Scout
members. Within its remit is the Identification and Tracking service,
which maintains a comprehensive database on all ex-Scouts and
their whereabouts. When a recall is necessary, it liaises throughout
the Scout service network branches to issue and effect the recall.

The Detached Duty Office was created to keep track of all retired
and detached Scout personnel in order to be able to swiftly contact
them and return them to active service in an emergency. In addition,
the Detached Duty Office controls all surplus IISS craft (scout ships
and courier vessels), making them available to some ex-Scouts if
that will help the IISS in its missions, The office is divided into two
branches, Records and Intelligence.

The Records Branch maintains documentation on all Scouts serving
on detached duty. Virtually all former Scouts fit this classification
and are subject to recall for military service or for specific missions.
Normally, however, only those Scouts with surplus scout vessels on
loan to them are actively monitored.

The Intelligence Branch is an information gathering agency for the
Scouts. Its primary function is to debrief detached duty Scouts when
they visit scout bases for refueling or maintenance on their vessels.
The Intelligence Branch also maintains active agents (spies) in areas
where information is vitally needed.

Finance is responsible for payroll for Scouts (salaries, pensions,
bonuses, and other rewards) and payment for goods and services
procured for the service. Working closely with Procurement, Finance
is a highly accountable department with the Scout service, forever
budget-conscience, driven by prudence, and always with a beady on
eye on potential cost savings.

Procurement is responsible for purchasing the goods and services
which the service requires. It establishes standards for material to
be used by the service, and negotiates contracts with suppliers for
material and equipment - everything from uniforms and microfilm
readers to starships. As the Scout service is a large-scale procurer,
it enjoys substantive discounts with major manufacturers, and
access to military-grade equipment on a mission-specific basis.
Procurement also monitors and tracks Scout vessels issued to
retired Scouts as part of their retirement benefits and has control
over when or if a vessel needs to be recalled to active duty (with or
without its owner). Procurement is frugal in all its dealings, making
use of all existing equipment before spending money on new kit.

Most Scouts have little direct contact with Administration and, for
the most part, it is the faceless Human Resources department that
either interferes with, or enhances (depending on personal point of
view) the real work of the Scout service.

Exploration Office
The exploration office is the original core of the scout service,
and still carries out much of its original remit. As a result of the

unique demands of basic exploration, the Exploration Office utilizes
the greatest variety of equipment and ships, including mobile
exploration bases, frontier cruisers, and a vast array of customized,
and ad hoc conversions of standards designs. Currently, the two
major divisions are the Exploration Branch and the Contact and
Liaison Service.

Exploration Branch
Exploration Branch is devoted to the actual exploration of space and
systems, reporting and analyzing local life forms, basic planetological
data, and identifying particularly dangerous areas, life forms, or
hazards to navigation.

Contact and Liaison Service
Contact and Liaison service was officially added to the IISS orgchart
out of a desire to professionalize contact with newly discovered
populations, and reduce the then current demands of the military
to provide such services. Accordingly, Contact and Liaison is
responsible for both initial contact, and subsequent relations with
new, non-starfaring peoples as they are found. Additionally, the C&L
branch has acquired responsibility for technology transfer to new
races (so as to minimize social shock and thus economic disruption),
and dissemination of cultural information throughout the Imperium,
with a goal to reducing the inevitable intercultural conflicts.

Often having to work closely, and in concert with most of the other
offices of the IISS, in particular Exploration, but also special services,
they are most likely to be cooperative and neutral as regards turf wars.

Communications Service
The communications branch deals with information and its transfer
throughout the Imperium.
As with exploration, there are two major divisions:

- X-boat Office This branch was created from general
    communications to operate the logistically intensive Express
    communication system throughout the empire. They are the
    most restive service with regards to their prerogatives, ad are
    always agitating to be elevated to an independent Service.

They operate a fleet of specialized bases, tenders and, most
obviously Xboats, as well as postal couriers to extend the system.
Express service vessels do not concede any right of way, off duty or
on, and particularly when flying, so be sure and yield right of way
in all situations. X-Boat service is renowned for its excellent quality
legal and military grade stimulants and sedatives.

Imperial Courier Branch (Communications) was the original core of
ComServ, and has never adapted well to the coequal splitting off of
the xboat system. The ICS maintains ad hoc minor postal routes,
and transports items that cannot be sent through the X-Boat system
and transport of crucial or important personnel. This sections
assets and attitudes are generally similar to the xboat network,
but add impatient and/or self-important Imperial dignitaries and
military officers.

##### IISS SIISS SCOUTCOUT S SERVICEERVICE IISS SCOUT SERVICE

Rhylenor Taoiseach
A covert paramilitary intelligence unit established from local scouts
and military commandos by Admiral Olav Haut-Plankwell during
his tenure as a frontier commander, it accompanied was retained
by him following his seizure of the throne, and survived the ensuing
civil war period

As a highly independent imperial level troubleshooter force,
tasked to proactively identify and neutralize potential threats
to the Empire's security. Generally camouflaged as a kind of a
harmless traveling think-talk and information service, the Taoiseach
preformed this service for several hundred years, with strategy
and control vested solely in the Emperor. In later years, it seems
to have been involved more in palace power struggles and political
maneuvering; reported irregularities in its involvement in at least
one questionable imperial death, and its subsequent loss of cover led
to its eventual disbandment in 907; curiously, its charter and basic
public information group remains current, and provides interesting
if generally banal summaries of news and cultural and technological
trends throughout the empire. Rumors that the commando
functions still exist as a clandestine part of the organization are of
course, unfounded and absurd.

### TECHNICAL SERVICES

This office is responsible for scientific and technical activity within
the service. It is divided into the Education Branch and the Research
& Development Branch. Education Branch provides information
and data to offices, branches, and individual Scouts who need it.
It maintains education and intelligence enhancement courses and
treatments necessary for individuals to accomplish their missions.
It is responsible for the development and dissemination of library
data programs for Scout Service vessels. In addition, the Education
Branch maintains and administers standards for skills learned In the
Service, and provides educational courses to Scouts in order to fill
their time when on duty or on long voyages. Research & Development
Branch is responsible for scientific inquiry into data obtained by the
Scout Service, and is responsible for the development of equipment
needed by the Service to accomplish its mission. The R&D Branch
is also responsible for the design of specialized scout vessels used
by the IISS. It is forced, naturally enough, to work with the Finance
and Procurement branches of Administration, and is a significant
consumer of the IISS budget. However its work is also sold, on a
contractual basis, to various arms of the military and approved partner
contractors, thus helping to mitigate its substantial costs.

The Survey Office
The Survey office was originally an independent imperial organization
known as the Imperial Grand Survey. The eventual absorption
and subordination of the IGS by the IISS was the result of a long
administrative struggle, which the IGS lost. The survey office is still
generally referred to by its original tile, both internally and to the
general populace. The final division of responsibilities and authority
with the exploration Service gave the IGS control of exploration and
mapping within the defined borders of the imperium. In addition to

survey duties the IGS is responsible for disseminating its cartographic
information, as well as regulating and maintaining established
shipping traffic, and maintaining and enforcing the safety and
training requirements for starships within the empire. IGS personnel
often work closely with the Starport authority to maintain traffic and
jump zones, and generally regulate transportation flow. They are also
responsible for continuing exploration within the Imperial boundaries,
but this is generally underfunded and supplied, receiving only a small
proportion of the IGS budget. Administratively, all cartographic
functions are retained within the main branch of the IGS, with other
ad hoc units being created as need to meet various demands, and
to absorb new functions as necessary. The most important of these
units are noted below.

Pathfinder Branch
Historically, the pathfinder service was created to deal with a
cartographic/administrative oddity: the fact that many poorly
explored or occasionally uncontacted areas are technically within
the Imperial borders (such as the Outrim Void) As a result,
exploration and survey in these areas are the responsibility of the
IGS rather than the rival Exploration Office. Accordingly, to carry
out this mandate (and to prevent erosion/transfer of headcount,
mission, and funding to the Exploration branch) the IGS maintains
a very small and grudgingly-funded clone of the Exploration branch
known as the IGS-Pathfinders, also known (confusingly) as the
Imperial Survey Scouts (ISS), and generally referred to by the rest of
the IISS as “External Mapping Service”. In addition to exploration
and contact, the duties of the ISS are often extended/augmented
to cover courier and postal support duties, local search and rescue
operations, dealing with mail and trade piracy (and commerce
raiding), anti smuggling, border patrol and customs enforcement
duties as well as the more traditional scout tasks of survey, contact
and navigational infrastructure support and maintenance. Units
and resources of the ISS are also not uncommonly loaned out to
other frontier/colonial departments (also operating on a shoestring
budget), generally in exchange for budgetary transfers or political
considerations, but also for lack of any other resources.

#### OTHER IMPORTANT UNITS OF THE IGS

Beacon Branch
A smaller subgroup within the IGS, specializing in maintaining
and deploying navigational aids and beacons; and maintaining
nonmilitary aspects of red and amber zones.

Rescue and Emergency Department
Within the empire, the scout service maintains a dedicated rescue
service in many systems that are unable to provide it otherwise,
although in some cases they are specifically contracted by the local
authorities. The RED provides such services as needed. Generally
the RED assets are non-jump based ships, modified for rapid
response and emergency medical intervention. As a rule all such
vessels are unarmed and marked with the local or Imperial script

##### IISS SCOUT SERVICE IISS SIISS SCOUTCOUT S SERVICEERVICE

for GK (see below). The ships transponder broadcasts a continuous
location signal, and an emergency identifier that requires all ships
to surrender priority in flight paths and landings.

Typical ships are modified Modular cutters, with a specialized
rescue module, upgraded M drive, and sophisticated passive
sensors. Modified type S ships are also used, some retaining jump
capacity for rapid redeployment. Refuge and survival stations are
also stationed in systems, typically at crucial locations such as gas
giants or wilderness planets typically used for fuel scooping. The
Imperial laws of navigation, and a series of treaties with independent
polities requires any ship to respond to, and give assistance to
distress calls where possible and without risking life and limb to
do so. The typical distress signals are quite ancient, and include
the original Vilani signal GK (Gashimeku Kaalariin, Vilani for vessel
in distress), the Terran SOS, or Mayday signals, and the Zhodani
DCQ (best translated as Distress: Dome Quickly). Note that the 732
Samaritan Treaty of Jewell specifies that in peacetime, Zhodani and
Imperial ships (and allied clients) may enter each others territory
to respond to such calls. It is also important to note that misuse
of such signals is regarded as a crime against the Emperor in the
imperium, enforcement of which specifically transcends internal
and local legal jurisdictions.

Note on Imperial Cartography
The IGS designed the Imperial system of mapping, specifically the
familiar Subsector/Sector/Quadrant organization. The system
is adopted from the original Viilani cartography, and significantly
predates the actual imperium. It is somewhat archaic, and more
appropriate for a smaller polity, but as it uses very traditional and
rigid design it avoids continual revision from political jockeying and
short-term issues. It is only altered by changes in observational,
and practical data, and maintained unswervingly by the IGS. It is
extremely centric to the Imperium, but because of its apolitical
design, has been adopted by most other local polities, even those
traditionally opposed to imperial culture.

Directional plots are relative to the planet Reference, the Galactic
core, and galactic rotation. The standard directions are Coreward,
Rimward, Spinward and Trailing. Directions above or below the
galactic plane are noted as a positive or negative azimuth value.
Galactic North and South are unofficial designations used by
media and the general public. The north/south distinction is used
unofficially by most scouts in the field, though, as “Pirates of the
galaxies southern galactic main “ sounds better than “Pirates of
Spinward Az -324.5”, and.

Imperial cartography is based on a grid overlaying the observational
data of space without regard to number of systems or political
boundaries thereby enclosed, and are thus of a constant size, organized
into sectors and subsectors. Sectors are named grids of 16 named
subsectors, each of 8x10 parsecs. On the average sectors contain
500 to 700 systems, and subsectors generally contain some 30-50
systems, varying dramatically in rift or cluster locales. Subsectors are

noted by the sector name, and the characters A to P (omitting I and o).
Individual systems are noted by sector, subsector and grid coordinate
within the grid of the subsector. Names of Subsectors and planets are
changeable, and in fact often do so, but basic notation is consistent
across time and political boundaries.

Quadrants and Octants are semi-official charting designations comprising
(respectively) four and two subsectors, used by trade and popular media
and the names given often vary from the standard subsectors defined in
the IGS Precise Ephemeris. It is suggested that the name be the lowest
lettered sector or partial sector enclosed by the chart.

Navigational calculation uses a detailed coordinate system
overlapping the cartographic grid, using entirely mathematical
referents relative to Reference and the Galactic Core.

The Imperium comprises 27 sectors; the Zhodani Consulate, 13; the
Aslan Hierate at least 13 (depending on the trans-rift areas); the Hiver
Federation 13; The Two Thousand Worlds claim 14; and the Solomanii
Confederation, 11 (although it claims approximately 15). The Vargr
extents geographically cover 14 sectors, but Vargr systems and
enclaves are found throughout Coreward and Spinward sectors.

Interdiction
Interdiction of worlds within the Imperium generally occurs at
the request of a major department of the government, and must
be approved by the throne. In practice, almost all interdictions
are proposed by the scout service or the military. The practice is
somewhat controversial, as the re are no specific qualifications
for such interdiction, save that of pressing and significant need.
Typically, the scout service interdictions are based on considerations
of indigenous culture s, or on sensitive or intense research activity,
or the possibility of extreme hazard from natural or unexplained
situations. Military interdictions are typically to quarantine hostile
and or politically dangerous worlds, or worlds that present a natural
threat to the Imperium, such as disease. Crucial military resources
are also interdicted by military request, as well as sensitive military
research and testing sites. Finally, interdiction is also used by military
and occasionally diplomatic services to punish a given system.

In general, scout interdiction is appropriate to situations requiring
a quarantine or inclusionary Cordon Sanitare; military intervention
to situations requiring an exclusionary blockade. Interdicted worlds
automatically are given red travel ratings by the traveller's aid
society, although not all red zones are interdicted worlds.

Operations Office
Responsible for the activities of the Service in the establishment,
maintenance, and operation of its bases and fleets. It is divided into
Maintenance, Security, Bases, and Scout Fleet branches. The Maintenance
Branch is charged with preventive maintenance of the equipment used by
the Scout Service and with repairs as necessary. Maintenance is capable
of repairing many Imperial Navy vessels as well.

##### IISS SIISS SCOUTCOUT S SERVICEERVICE

### INSTALLATIONS AND FACILITIES

Scout bases
The Scout Service maintains a variety of scout bases both within and outside the Imperium, generally worlds with starports type C
or D and typically in systems more out of the way than are naval bases. Scout bases are surface installations with basic fuelling and
minor maintenance activities oriented toward ships of 1,000 tons or less.

The scout bases maintain explorations hips, logistic support for distant on planet operations, and provide dispatch and services
connecting the xboat system with more remote worlds. Scout bases also have other responsibilities, including administrative
responsibility for scouting operations locally. Typically, where multiple bases share a subsector, bases will typically specialize in
function within the subsector, such as cartography, technical research and support, and contact or liaison activities.
A scout base is more extensive than an xboat station, but less comprehensive than a way station.

X-Boat Station
The express boat network maintains small installations along the route for service and dispatch of Xboats, as well as transmission
and routing. Such stations are generally located at the edge of a system, and always support one or more Xboat tenders, as well
as providing extensive storage, signal analysis, route scheduling, and often highly automated retransmission facilities. Incoming
Xboats immediately transmit their data to the local station and await pickup. The local system splits off and retransmits data
continuing along the network to a waiting xboat on the appropriate line. Local traffic can be either for the local system, or for
transmission to non-Xboat couriers (typically, but not exclusively a Type S), which connect the network with more distant planets.

Stations also maintain one or more offices on the mainworld, to accept and deliver messages. There will always be one such office
at any class C or better starport, Scout or Naval base. Scout and Naval offices are not always available for public use.

The xboat system is highly encrypted and secure, and all communications are completely confidential; however, the xboat network
will only accept unencrypted messages from the public for retransmission. All further security and encryption is carried out by the
network, and cleared before pickup.

Way Station
Way stations are the main maintenance and support nodes for the Xboat network. Where several lines coverage, the analysis and
transmission resources will be correspondingly increase. Otherwise, a way station is essentially a standard station with extensive
refit and overhaul facilities for Xboats, couriers and tenders. One can model the entire Xboat system as a distributed torrent
network, with an immense packet size (the Xboats data load), but a minimum latency of 1 week. Xboats in particular regularly make
multiple jumps with minimum delay, occasionally changing pilots, but always working up and down the xboat lines as quickly as
possible. As a result, they require reliable and frequent maintenance, and the tenders and couriers are only marginally less busy.
Typically, an xboat will be pulled for service (and immediately replaced every one –three waystations (depending on separation).
Waystations stock significant stores of scout related equipment and parts, provisions, and spare crews, as well as recreation and
relaxation facilities. Their maintenance capacity and installations are similar to naval bases, with a general upper limit of 10,000
tons or less.

The Security Branch is charged with providing security and law
enforcement for the Scout Service. Security Branch Scouts serve
as police enforcers on Scout property, as commandos or shipboard
light troops, for special Scout activities, and as clandestine agents
for Intelligence Branch. Agents of the IISS Security Branch have
great authority to arrest, detain, or question individuals suspected
of violations of Imperial law, and can demand cooperation from
local authorities as the need arises. The Base Branch is responsible
for the operation of the Scout Service's bases, way stations, and
other establishments.

The Scout Fleet consists of all of the vessels used by the Scout
Service. Because the operation of space vessels requires a great deal
of supervision, training, and control, the Scout Fleet is organized
similar to a naval unit. Vessels used in the Field (for exploration
or communications, for example) belong to the Scout Fleet, even if
operated by individuals not specifically assigned to that office. The
Scout Fleet supports the Communications Office and Exploration
Office activities, and provides ships (as well as some personnel to
crew them to those offices.

##### IISS SCOUT SERVICE

As part of their service routine, especially in the Survey and Exploration
branches, Scouts are regularly faced with hostile environments that
requires a thorough understanding of survival techniques.

Although excellent equipment counts for much, there is no
substitute for knowing the basic lessons of survival. Any character
trained to Survival level 0 knows these basics; further skill levels
reflect extensive training and experience in survival situations.

The chapter covers those survival basics and examines the survival
methods necessary for a number of key environments.

## THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SURVIVAL

## EQUIPMENT

Relying on first-rate equipment is insufficient for survival.
Equipment can fail, and nature can regularly produce unexpected
conditions which challenge and defeat the tolerances of even the
best equipment. The first psychological lesson for all Scouts is
therefore not to place complete and unconditional reliance on any
one piece of equipment – be it a ship, vessel, or vacc suit. Of course,
in some environments – vacuum for instance – the failure of a vital
piece of equipment can mean death. For this reason, the psychology
to be applied to all equipment is:

- Maintenance – regular, thorough, challenging.
- Check for Safety – not once, not twice, but three times. Test all
    systems and all potential points of failure.
- Back-Up – back-up as in data storage, and back-up as in carry a
    spare if possible, or essential spare components.
- Understand its use – make sure you are fully familiar with how
    to use your equipment properly and effectively. Incidents arise
    as much through improper use as they do through external
    circumstances.
- Practice emergency drills – evacuation procedures, fire-fighting
    procedures and life-support isolation/restore procedures.
    These are essential.

In game terms, characters need to be competent (level 0) in the
skill that the equipment falls under, in order to run full safety and
maintenance checks, as outlined above. The roll to make is 8+ using
the relevant skill with any DMs the referee might want to impose
due to various constraints:

Safety Assessment DMsSafety Assessment DMs DMDM
Equipment has undergone recent safety and
maintenance testing

+2

Equipment has been neglected for some time –2
Equipment is checked in haste –1
Equipment is old or obsolete –1

If the assessment check succeeds, then the character has either
spotted any possible problems, or the equipment is in good
working order. If flaws exist, and are spotted, the only constraint on
implementing a remedy is time and available resources.

In terms of safety drills, such as evacuation procedures, then
characters need to roll Int 8+, with a DM equal to the Survival skill
level. If the roll fails, then the character is deemed to have forgotten
a vital part of the procedure, resulting in lost time or encountering
other hazards. These need to be adjudicated on a situation by
situation basis, and according to the severity of the circumstances.
If the character is operating in a regime where regular drills are the
norm, he gains a +1 DM to the roll. If regular drills are neglected,
then the DM is –1

# SSURVIVALURVIVAL

##### SSURVIVALURVIVAL SURVIVAL

Basic Survival Psychology

_'The art of survival is the refusal to give up.'_

_Scout saying_

Living through a survival situation takes more than equipment,
training and expertise. Some people with little or no survival
training manage to survive life-threatening circumstances; some
with survival training fail to use their skills and die as a result. A
major component to survive a situation is the mental attitude of the
those involved: the psychology of survival.

Having survival skills is important, but having the will to survive
is essential. There is a psychology to survival. A Scout in a survival
environment faces many stresses that ultimately impact on his mind.
These stresses can produce thoughts and emotions that, if poorly
understood, transform a confident, well-trained operative into an
indecisive, ineffective mess with questionable ability to survive. It
is therefore essential for every Scout to be aware of and be able to
recognize those stresses commonly associated with survival, and
both act and think accordingly.

It is also essential for characters to be aware of their reactions to the
wide variety of stresses associated with survival.

STRESS
Stress is a condition every character experiences and can be
best defined as the reaction to pressure. Despite the negative
connotations, stress has positive benefits:

- Stress provides challenges and therefore opportunities to learn
    about strengths and capabilities.
- Stress tests adaptability and flexibility, stimulating us to do our
    best. Because unimportant events are not considered stressful,
    stress is an excellent indicator of the significance attached to an
    event: in other words, it highlights what is important.

Any game event has the potential to become stressful, but
routine, mundane events rarely do. Stress occurs for characters
when unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances challenge the
character's perceptions and abilities – and these take a wide variety
of forms. Even training in particular endeavors, such as combat,
does not necessarily mitigate stress but it does help to cope with
its effects.

As an optional rule, the effects of stress (which always come into
play at the referee's discretion) are handled thus.

The referee assesses the Stress Level. This should range from 8 to 12
(or higher) and reflect the situation. Immediate, rapid, life-threatening
situations should rank as SL 12; things that are foreseeable and can
be countered to some degree should rank as 8 or 9.

Characters roll 2D+Endurance against the Stress Level. Characters
gain a positive DM for each level of Survival.

If the roll succeeds, the character remains rational, calm and level
headed, taking no penalties to further skills. If the roll fails, the
character suffers DMs equivalent to the Effect of the failure to all
skills until the threat creating the stress has been resolved and the
character has the chance to relax. In addition, characters suffering
from the effects of stress undergo one (or more) of the following
personality/psychological changes for the duration of the stressful
period:

- Difficulty making decisions.
- Angry outbursts.
- Forgetfulness.
- Thoughts about death or suicide.
- Trouble getting along with others.
- Withdrawing from others.
- Hiding from responsibilities.
- Careless
- Apportions blame inappropriately and disproportionately.

Example: Surveying a planet with a highly turbulent atmosphere,
Variss's scout ship undergoes an avionics failure and the ship goes into a
high-velocity nosedive. The referee sets the Stress Level at 11. Variss has
End 8 (+0) and Survival 1. He needs to roll 10 or more to remain calm.

Variss rolls 4, adjusted to 5 for his Survival. His effect is –3 (5-8), so all
skills until the nosedive can be corrected will be at a –3DM. Luckily,
Variss is not the ship's pilot, and the pilot does manage to bring the
ship out of its dive and onto an even flight path. However this takes
several minutes and, during this time, Variss rages angrily about him,
blaming the navigator and pilot for a situation that was clearly beyond
their control...

Assessing the Situation
Every survival situation requires a clear, logical assessment of the
circumstances: both the local conditions, and the short, medium
and long-term factors. The things to be considered are:

- Where am I?
- What is my physical condition?
- Am I mobile?
- Am I alone?
- Do I need medical attention?
- If injured, what do my injuries prevent me from doing?
- Do I have the means to communicate (with others and wider
    afield)?
- Is habitation nearby, and can I reach it?
- Are the local inhabitants friendly, neutral or hostile?
- What are my immediate resources (water, food and shelter,
    primarily, in the forms of locally available resources, personal
    equipment and rations designed for survival purposes,
    resources that can be improvised)?

##### SURVIVAL SSURVIVALURVIVAL

- Have I the means to alert others to my condition?
- What are the environmental conditions? How can these change
    and how quickly?
- What is the atmosphere type? Can I breathe unaided? If I must
    rely on a vacc or environment suit, what condition is it in and
    what are my oxygen reserves?
- How much time do I have before death becomes a likelihood?
    What can be reasonably accomplished in this time?

The answers to these questions allow for the formation of a Survival
Strategy; prioritising what can be done, assessing and mitigating
controllable risks, establishing a communication plan, and then
how best to deploy the resources one has available, whatever they
might be.

Referees can use the checklist of conditions to guide stranded
characters through the essentials of survival. If the character has
the Survival skill at 0 or better, then a successful 8+ roll indicates
that the checklist is run-through and the character gains all available

information to assemble his Survival Strategy. The strategy itself
can be abstracted or played-through, element by element (using the
checklist above as the flow for the actions), with other members of
the group being assigned specific questions to answer in order to
advance the strategy and arrive at answers.

Each of the elements in the checklist might carry their own Stress
Level, or a single Stress Level might be applied to the whole
checklist, depending on the level of detail needed for the situation. If
multiple stresses are used, then every failure to cope is cumulative:
it is therefore possible for characters to become, literally, paralysed
by fear and panic as the stress of the situation overwhelms them.

Some answers to the checklist questions will be clear-cut; others will
be more complicated to answer or are unanswerable. All available
answers depend on the local conditions. Individual skills and skill
rolls will provide some answers, but others will clearly require
investigation. A list of skills and how they can be used in assembling
and managing the Survival Strategy is as follows:

SkillSkill UseUse
Comms Checking the status of communications equipment, establishing communications with others,
establishing distress signals or alerts.
Computers If computer equipment is available, checking for information on local conditions, course-plotting,
establishing communications. Much depends on connectivity.
Deception Improvising disguises and camouflage, hiding the remains of wreckage.
Engineer (electronics, life
support), Mechanic

Checking equipment status, understanding how salvageable or available life support systems from
vehicles can be optimized for use in the conditions.
Investigate Assessing specifics of local circumstances. Finding clues relating to the environment and inhabitants.
Leadership Each level of Leadership can be used to reduce the Stress Level by 1. Successful Leadership rolls help
inspire and motivate others in managing the Survival Strategy
Medic First aid, and keeping wounds free from infection. Includes improvising splints, bandages, dressings
and so forth.
Persuade Where characters are clearly affected by stress, Persuade can be used to gain their co-operation and
positive action. Can also be used to persuade local populace to assist, even if hostile.
Recon Gain an overview of local conditions: terrain, weather type, likely hazards or obstacles, enemy positions,
and so forth.
Remote Operations If remote support is available, and the remote ops equipment is working and available, then Remote Ops
can be used to signal or remotely invoke a variety of communications or rescue plans already established
or programmed into ship/vehicle systems.
Science (various branches) Establish the specifics of the environment and likely impacts on survival to an accurate degree rather
than in general terms.
Seafarer If the survival situation is at sea, then this skill can be substituted for the Survival skill. Even if not,
Seafarers understand a variety of environmental hazards and can use this skill to assess things such as
wind direction and chill, star navigation possibilities, and so forth.
Survival Implementing the basics of the Survival Strategy and completing the kinds of actions listed on page 58
of the Traveller rules.
Tactics Prioritising and executing each component of the Survival Strategy effectively. Every two levels of Tactics
can be used to reduce the Stress Level by 1.
Vacc Suit (and Battledress) Establishing Vacc Suit reserves, effecting repairs, and optimizing Vacc Suit systems for optimum
performance
Zero G Moving effectively in low gravity or zero g. If the situation is in such an environment, then every two
levels of Zero G can be used to reduce the Stress Level by 1.

##### SURVIVAL SURVIVAL

### SURVIVAL NECESSITIES

Assuming that the survival location is planetside, the survival
necessities are as follows:

1. Food
2. Water
3. Shelter
4. Fire
5. First aid
6. Signals

The order of importance varies, depending on conditions. For
example, if characters are injured, first aid has top priority no matter
what the climate.

If the survival situation is a cold climate, fire and shelter come first,
whereas, in an arid environment, characters will first need think
about water, locating it, preserving it, and protection from the heat.
Once these priorities are attended to and stabilized, then signals
can be examined – everything from communications equipment/
distress beacons, through to creating air-visible SOS signs close to
the survival camp.

Water
Water is essential to the human metabolism for survival; more so
than food. The body can exist for longer without food than it can
without hydration. However, thirst is not a reliable guide for water
needs. Characters using thirst as a guide will drink only two-thirds
of their daily water requirement. The basic rule of thumb for water
requirements are:

- At temperatures below 38 degrees C, 0.5 litres of water every
    hour.
- At temperatures above 38 degrees C, 1 litre of water every
    hour.

Drinking water at regular intervals helps the body remain cool and
decreases sweating. Even when the water supply is low, sipping
water constantly keeps the body cooler and reduces water loss
through sweating.

Characters who are able to drink enough water (according to the rule of
thumb above), and conserve energy through limiting physical activity
to the essentials, suffer no undue effects. However, if the requisite
amount of water cannot be consumed every hour, a character begins
to suffer. Roll End 8+, with the following modifiers:

_Only half or less of requisite water requirement was consumed in the
previous hour: –1DM
No water consumed in the previous hour: –2DM
Food eaten in the previous hour: –1DM_

DMs are cumulative. If the End 8+ roll fails, then 1d3 points of
damage are assigned to either Strength, Dexterity or Endurance,

determined randomly. This simulates the effects of dehydration,
resulting in fatigue, cramp, lethargy and diminishing energy levels.

Referees should call for Endurance rolls as appropriate, and
depending on conditions (heat, water availability, physical effort
expended, and so forth).

Note that food requires water for digestion. It is better to forgo
eating and drink water (or eat very small amounts) rather than to
eat and drink little water.

WATER QUALITY AND TESTING
Local sources of water depend on planetary type, but it is not an
uncommon compound, existing in the form of water vapour, ice,
snow and surface water sources such as rivers, lakes and oceans.
Salt water can be purified using either a water purification unit (TLs
4+) or through separating the salt through evaporation. The process
is not difficult, given basic equipment, and can be accomplished
through either a successful Science (physics or chemistry) roll at
7+.

Water testing kits, including purification tablets, form a basic part
of the standard Scout Survival Kit (see page 105), which indicates
the suitability for drinking. The HandPacs issued to Scouts include
a water testing sensor and read-out to indicate trace minerals and
toxins.

In arid environments water is most frequently present below
the surface in aquifers. Detecting an aquifer can be done using
a sensor package and the Sensors skill, or Survival through
observing local plant-life or signs of surface moisture. Reaching an
aquifer depends on its depth below the surface layer: plants with

##### SURVIVAL SSURVIVALURVIVAL

deep roots and water storage can be used as a proxy method of
getting to water, but otherwise a borehole needs to be sunk down
to the aquifer itself and requires both drilling equipment and an
Engineering or Mechanics roll.

One difficulty with water found in arid environments is its mineral
content (borax, salt, alkali, and lime, for example) which makes the
water undrinkable unless treated. Even wetting clothing in untreated
high-mineral content water (to provide relief from the sun or heat,
for instance) can pose a hazard as the minerals can irritate the skin
and bring infection to any open wounds. Make an Endurance 7+
roll (9+ if an open wound is present) for using untreated water in
this way; if the roll fails, a point of damage is sustained to either
Strength, Dexterity or Endurance, representing the discomfort of
the irritation and exacerbation of infection.

In cold environments, water availability is less of a problem because
it is likely to be present as snow or ice. Salt ice is a dull grey in
colour, whilst fresh water ice is bluish in colour. Ice melts more
quickly than snow, but either is a ready water source.

Food
The availability of food is always dependent on local conditions.

Arid and cold environments are likely to be almost devoid of
vegetation, and animal life that can be hunted may also be scarce.
Jungle and temperate environments are likely to offer far less
problematic in terms of foraging, but have the added complication
that many plants are hazardous or offer little nutritional value. And,
on an alien world, where plant and animal life will be either highly
or completely unfamiliar, without being able to run full chemical
analysis on a potential food sample, there is no way of being sure
that either vegetable matter or animal protein is not hazardous.

The referee has to be the arbiter in these decisions, deciding if
something character can forage or hunt is going to injure them

- or offer the fuel required to assist with survival. If characters have
access to ship or vehicle rations, or high-tech food synthesisers
and testing kit, then the problems are reduced but referees need to
decide what foods are available and what harm they might do.

The Survival skill covers foraging – finding edible items in the
wild – and, to a limited extent, identifying what may or may not be
harmful. At Level 0 characters are able to identify known toxic plants
and herbs native to their homeworld. At Level 1, they can make an
educated guess at the likelihood of harm on a roll of 8+. At Level 2
and above, they can deduce the probability of harm from unknown
species but cannot guarantee their deductions without detailed
sample analysis.

HUNGER AND STARVATION
Food is essential to fuel the body. Without it, the body feeds upon
itself, breaking down muscle and organ tissue to provide itself with
fuel: this is starvation.

Humans can survive on little or no food for 1+1d3+Endurance DM
weeks before starvation begins to take effect. Starvation results in many
complications, but the most common physical complications are:

Dehydration – hence the importance of water in the diet, and at regular
intervals
Pain – as muscle tissue is broken down for sustenance
Lethargy – as fat reserves are consumed for energy

Weight loss is inevitable, as is a decrease in willpower, accompanied
by hysteria, hallucination, depression and paranoia.

Starving characters suffer 1D6 points of damage per week. This
damage is apportioned equally across all three characteristics
(Str, Dex and End) with any odd points of damage being applied
randomly. This damage can be mitigated on a roll of Survival+End,
but the target number for the roll increases by one for each week
after the starvation point has been reached.

For example, Variss, with an End of 8, can survive for 1+1d3+0 weeks
without sufficient food. The 1d3 roll is a 3, so he can survive for 4 weeks.
At the end of week 4 he must roll Survival+End 8+ to avoid sustaining
1D6 points of damage. At the end of week 5, he must roll Survival 9+; at
the end of week 6, 10+, and so on.

Both physical and psychological effects need to be adjudicated by the
referee as appropriate, and taking into account other factors such as
the climate, injury, stress and so forth. Starvation can be either a
slow or a rapid killer, depending on contributing circumstances.

Shelter
Shelter is both physically and psychologically necessary to survival.
A good shelter protects against the elements and offers a feeling of
safety that can mitigate the effects of stress.

Where it is necessary to improvise, Scouts are taught to use
whatever natural materials are available to construct a shelter, and
Survival at Level 1 indicates that the character is practiced in finding
suitable components to build a basic shelter that will offer modest
protection from the elements. Additional skills, such as Mechanics
and Engineering, can also be used to construct a more robust
shelter. Whatever the skill used, calculate the Effect, using its value
as an indication of the strength and sturdiness of the shelter (the
higher the better).

##### SURVIVAL SURVIVAL

EffectEffect ShelterShelter
–3 or less Very flimsy. Offers shade and a certain
psychological comfort, but is easily demolished
in adverse conditions
–2 Flimsy. Leaks, draughty, but will hold-up for a few
days.
–1 Weak, but will hold-up for 3+1d3 days
0 Stable. Offers modest comfort and protection
1 Decent. Dry, relatively warm and draught free
2 Good. Will weather adverse conditions and keep
the occupants warm and dry
3+ Sturdy. Will support a relative level of comfort for
several weeks, if not months.

DMs are gained for equipment and resources appropriate to the
shelter being built. For example, building an igloo obviously requires
snow, but having an ice-axe to cut blocks of compacted snow gains
a DM of +1; have just one's hands gains a DM of –1.

Having a Weak, Flimsy or Very Flimsy shelter adds +1 to any
prevailing Stress Level situation. Having a Decent, Good or Sturdy
shelter lowers it by 1.

EXPOSURE
If shelter is not available and characters are exposed to the elements
for any duration (End characteristic in hours), then exposure, in the
form of hypothermia, sets in. Hypothermia is the reduction of the
body's operating temperature, and it does not require a large drop in
temperature for hypothermia to have a profound effect.

Once hypothermia takes hold, the only cure is to gradually warm the
body again, through a steady and gentle application of heat through
blankets, warm drinks and shelter. Hypothermia occurs in stages:

Stage 1
Body temperature drops by 1-2°C below normal temperature (35-
36°C). Mild to strong shivering occurs. The victim is unable to
perform complex tasks with the hands as they become numb.
Breathing becomes quick and shallow. Goose bumps form, raising
body hair on end in an attempt to create an insulating layer of air
around the body (which is of limited use in humans due to lack
of sufficient hair, but useful in other species). Often, a person will
experience a warm sensation, as if they have recovered, but they are
in fact heading into Stage 2.

Stage 2
Body temperature drops by 2-4°C. Shivering becomes more violent.
Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent. Movements are slow
and laboured, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion,
although the victim may appear alert. The victim becomes pale. Lips,
ears, fingers and toes may become blue.

Stage 3
Body temperature drops below approximately 32c. Shivering usually
stops. The character has difficulty speaking, sluggish thinking, and
amnesia starts to appear; inability to use hands and stumbling
is also present. Below 30c, the exposed skin becomes blue and
puffy, muscle coordination becomes very poor, walking becomes
almost impossible, and the victim exhibits incoherent/irrational
Major organs fail and clinical death occurs – although, because
of decreased cellular activity, the body will actually take longer to
undergo brain death.

The referee needs to determine the movement through each stage,
depending on the local conditions. However, without warmth or
shelter, the degeneration can be rapid with no more than a few
hours between each stage.

Characters suffering from Stage 1 hypothermia halve their physical
attributes. All physical skills suffer a –1DM in addition to any negative
DMs from the reduction of physical characteristics. If warmth is not
applied within 1+1d3 hours, Stage 2 results.

Characters suffering from Stage 2 hypothermia reduce all physical
characteristics to 1. If warmth and shelter cannot be found within
1+1d2 hours, then Stage 3 results.

##### SURVIVAL SSURVIVALURVIVAL

In Stage 3, the character is unable to move and death will result
within 1d3 hours unless both medical treatment and warmth/shelter
can be found.

Fire
A source of heat is essential to survival, both for keeping the body
warm and for preparing food. The Survival skill is used to forage
for materials that will sustain a reasonable fire, and to get it going
using a variety of natural methods (assuming mechanical means of
starting a fire are unavailable).

Once lit, a fire will burn for as long as it is fed and tended. Without
care, and shelter from the wind (a bigger threat than rain), it will go
out. Having a fire present reduces any prevailing Stress Level by 1
and will help stave-off the effects of hypothermia. When building a
fire, have the character make a Survival throw. The Effect of the roll
is the fire's quality, and its quality increases the number of hours
between the stages of hypothermia. If characters are in danger of
suffering from hypothermia at stage 1, but it has not yet taken hold,
a fire of quality/effect 2 will prevent it from taking effect, as long as
the fire is maintained and characters remain in its vicinity.

If a fire is not properly attended by either Survival or Int (8+) rolls
every 3 hours, reduce its effect by 1. If it reaches an effect of –1, then
it has gone out. Successful rolls either increase the effect or keep it
at an established effect for the next 3 hours.

First Aid
First Aid relies on the Medic skill and available medical resources,
such as a first aid kit, or other items that can be improvised – such
as redundant clothing or cloth for use as bandages, dressings
and slings. The Medic skill covers such improvization, as long as
materials are available.

A successful Medic roll will clean and dress a wound sufficiently
to prevent infection. However, in the wild, infection is a constant
problem due to the natural environment and a lowering of
the immune response to stress and other conditions, such as
hypothermia. Wounds susceptible to infection must be checked
every 8 hours and a further Medic roll made to redress/re-clean the
wound. Apply a DM of –1 if essentials such as fresh dressings and
clean water are not available, with all DMs being cumulative.

If a wound is not kept clean and infection free through the successful
application of the Medic skill, infection occurs if an Endurance 8+
roll is failed by the victim. Infection increases any damage suffered
through other means (starvation or hypothermia, for instance) by a
further 1d3 points every four hours. Once infection sets-in, hospital
facilities or dedicated drugs are the only way of controlling and
eliminating it – even if other forms of damage are eradicated.

Signals
Forms of signalling and many and varied, and rely on resources,
available equipment and ingenuity. Both the Comms and Survival

skills can be applied to signalling efforts, but all such efforts are
going to be hugely dependent on others being able to see, and
respond to, the signalling efforts made.

### SURVIVAL IN SPECIFIC

### ENVIRONMENTS

Arctic/Cold
Any environment where local temperatures remain at, or below the
freezing point for water, are covered by this kind of classification.
It is possible for some arctic environments for temperatures to
rise above 18 degrees Celsius in summer months, but generally
temperatures remain close to, or at, zero degrees and can dip as low
as –60 degrees (or lower), exacerbated by windchill (see page 107)

Excluding altitude, generally the further away from the equator
the colder the conditions will be although prevailing warm air
currents (similar to the Earth's Gulf Stream) can affect this. Arctic
conditions may have no land mass, being, instead, a floating sheet
of permanently frozen ice At a planet's poles, both arctic and
antarctic regions usually have only 2 seasons: a long winter which
has perpetual darkness in mid winter, and a short summer which
can have perpetual daylight.

Temperatures and high winds produce the most hostile environment
known to humans. For example, Antarctic winds of 177km have been
recorded and in the autumn, winter winds reach hurricane force and
can whip snow 30m into the air giving the impression of a blizzard
even when it is not snowing. Larger planets and those with more
erratic climates than Earth-equivalent bodies are likely to have even
more severe conditions.

Flora
Most arctic regions are devoid of any large flora species and areas
of permanent ice are devoid of any plant life. That said, large fauna
in cold regions tend to occupy the top of the food chain and are
merciless hunters, with little fear or timidity of humans: survival in
such conditions is dependent on eating, and large predators (bears,
for example) will have little fear of man.

FAUNA
Warmer conditions offer tundra. Here the plant life is limited as
the ground is subject to permafrost and the roots of plants cannot
penetrate the frozen ground. Mosses and lichens are common -
low, bushy, simple plants that grow on the ground. Lichens can be
edible, but must be thoroughly boiled or soaked in water for several
hours before being eaten.

Below tundra regions, large areas of coniferous forest may prevail.
In some areas this can be very extensive and cover a vast area,
creating, in effect, a cold weather jungle. Such regions may well
support far more abundant flora and fauna.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
The Arctic areas are without doubt some of the most inhospitable
areas on any planet. In tundra areas going can be slow due to deep
snow and dense forests. In times of warmer temperatures rivers
can rapidly thaw and become extremely dangerous, with strong,
unpredictable currents and localised flooding.

Wind-chill/ breathing
As well as extremely low temperatures exposed arctic areas -
especially upland areas - are subject to strong, chilling winds. Wind
chill can have a tremendous effect on the body. Inhaling very cold
air burns the lungs, causing haemorrhaging and chilling the body's
core temperature, leading to hypothermia. In these conditions
the number of hours before hypothermia sets-in is Endurance/2
hours, rather than Endurance hours. And, if a character is in panic,
having failed to resist the effects of Stress, then the threshold is
Endurance/3 hours. Panicked characters tend to hyperventilate or
take shallower, uncontrolled breaths, with increases the amount of
icy air taken into the body.

The wind chill factor is the temperature felt on exposed skin. The
action of the wind affects how quickly heat is lost from the body,
as it is carried away by convection. In arctic environments, where
altitude and wind speed can be high, and combined with a low air
temperature, wind chill can be very dangerous.

##### SURVIVAL SSURVIVALURVIVAL

The following table determines the temperature experienced by
humans due to windchill. Cross reference the wind speed against
the ambient temperature to determine the windchill temperature.

60 2 -2 -16 -23 -31 -38 -45 -53 -60 -68

FROSTBITE
The combination of cold temperature and poor blood flow can cause
severe tissue injury by freezing the tissue. Frostbite is most likely to
happen in body parts farthest from the heart, and those with a lot of
surface area exposed to cold. High windchill (typically in mountains
or high altitudes with snow) are often where the most serious causes
of frostbite occur. If frostbite is not treated immediately then the
damage and the frostbite become permanent. Nerve damage occurs
due to oxygen deprivation. Frostbitten areas become discoloured,
turning purplish at first, and soon turning black. After a while nerve
damage becomes so great that feeling is lost in the frostbitten areas
and blisters result. If feeling is lost in the damaged area, checking it
for cuts and breaks in the skin is vital. Infected open skin can lead to
gangrene and amputation may be the only remedy.

When dealing with windchill, note the following effects for
frostbite:

- Frostbite occurs on exposed skin within 30 minutes below -30
    degrees centigrade
- Frostbite occurs on exposed skin within 1 minute below -51
    degrees centigrade
- Frostbite can occur on exposed skin within 30 seconds below
    -59 degrees centigrade

Characters suffering from frostbite suffer a loss of 1D6+1 points
of Dexterity, and if not rapidly treated this becomes permanent.
Even when treated, frostbitten characters lose 1 point of Dex
permanently.

CARBON MONOXIDE
Once characters reach a shelter they tend to focus on getting warm
and frequently neglect any problems of ventilation. Despite the
temptation to use stoves and fires for extra warmth once they have
been used to cook, this can be very dangerous as temporary shelters,
such as snow shelters, are often poorly ventilated. Carbon monoxide
can quickly build up and is odourless. A tired or sleeping character
can quickly fall prey to the gas. Signs to be aware of are sudden or
progressive drowsiness in a poorly ventilated area. If caught in time,

then extinguishing the source of the carbon monoxide and leaving
the shelter to get clean air is the solution. Scout handpacs contain a
carbon monoxide sensor as a standard part of their sensor array.

SNOW BLINDNESS
Snow blindness is the result of the glare of sunlight
upon the surface of snow. It can be caused rapidly and
reoccur once experienced. Even brief exposure can
result in snowblindness and a relatively overcast day can
also produce it. Symptoms start with the eyes loosing
the ability to detect variations in ground level which
can be dangerous in its self. As the condition worsens
the eye becomes inflamed and sensitive, and then
painful even when exposed to weak light. This is why
snow goggles should be worn at all times. Characters
affected by snowblindness halve ther Dexterity characteristic, even
if it has already been affected by other conditions. Treating snow
blindness involves 1d3+2 days of complete darkness and rest.

Arid/Desert
Arid and desert environments are clearly hostile with their own sets
of challenges. In these areas there are seven environmental factors
that require consideration:

- Low rainfall.
- Intense sunlight and heat.
- Wide temperature range.
- Sparse vegetation.
- Sandstorms.
- Mirages.

LOW RAINFALL
Low rainfall is the most obvious environmental factor in an arid
area. Some desert areas receive less than 10cm of rain annually,
and this rain may come in brief torrents that quickly run off the
ground surface. The prime survival consideration is therefore water:
reserves, alternative sources and its conservation.

INTENSE SUNLIGHT AND HEAT
Intense sunlight and heat are present in all arid areas. Air temperature
can rise to 60 degrees C or higher during the day, for Earth-like
worlds, and considerably higher on planets closer to the home star.
Heat gain results from direct sunlight, hot blowing winds, reflective
heat (the sun's rays bouncing off the sand), and conductive heat
from direct contact with the desert sand and rock.

In Earth-like deserts the temperature of sand and rock averages 16
to 22 degrees C more than that of the air. For instance, when the
air temperature is 43 degrees C, the ground temperature may be
60 degrees C. Intense sunlight and heat increase the body's need
for water. Shelter helps to conserve bodily fluids and energy, and to
reduce exposure to the heat of the day. Travel at night is therefore
preferable to lessen the use of water.

##### SSURVIVALURVIVAL SURVIVAL

Sensitive items of equipment, unless shielded, will malfunction if
exposed to intense, direct sunlight for any extended period of time.

WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE
Temperatures in arid areas may get as high as 55 degrees during the
day and as low as 10 degrees (or lower) during the night. The drop in
temperature at night occurs rapidly and quickly chills anyone lacking
warm clothing and is unable to move about. The cool evenings and
nights are the best times to work or travel.

SPARSE VEGETATION
Vegetation is sparse in arid areas leading to issues with food, water
and foliage to build or supplement shelter. Natural rock formations
and caves offer the best sources of natural shelter, both from direct
sunlight and heat; the temperature in shaded areas will be 11 to 17
degrees cooler than the ambient air temperature.

The lack of vegetation and, often, relief in arid and desert areas can
also have implications for navigation and estimating distance. The
emptiness of desert terrain causes most people to underestimate
distance by a factor of three, if a Navigation or Reconn 8+ roll is
failed: What appears to be 1 kilometer away is really 3 kilometers
away.

SANDSTORMS
Sandstorms occur frequently in most deserts and can be prolonged;
some Earth sandstorms, for example, can blow for up to 120 days.
In an Earth-like desert, winds average 3 to 5 kilometers per hour
and can reach 112 to 128 kph in early afternoon. Expect major
sandstorms and dust storms at least once every 6 days (a result of
1 on a roll of 1D6).

The greatest danger is getting lost in a swirling wall of sand:
Navigation and Recon rolls suffer a –6DM during any sandstorm.
Wearing goggles and a mouth cover prevents sand from getting into
the eyes and lungs; any character without such protection must roll
Dex 10+ each round to avoid being rendered temporarily blind and
incapacitated by choking sand.

Dust and wind-blown sand interfere with radio and sensor
transmissions. Therefore, characters should be ready to use other
means of signalling, such as pyrotechnics, signal mirrors, or marker
panels, if available.

MIRAGES
Mirages are optical phenomena caused by the refraction of light
through heated air rising from a sandy or stony surface. They occur
in the interior of the desert about 10 kilometers from the coast. They
make objects that are 1.5 kilometers or more away appear to move.

This mirage effect makes it difficult to identify an object from a
distance. It also blurs distant range contours so much that character
may feel surrounded by a sheet of water from which elevations stand
out as islands.

The mirage effect makes it hard for a person to identify targets,
estimate range, and see objects clearly: apply a –4 DM to all skills
relying on accurate visual observation. However, with height (3
meters or more above the desert floor), it is possible to get above the
superheated air close to the ground and overcome the mirage effect.

### EXOTIC ATMOSPHERES AND HIGH

### GRAVITY

Scouts frequently survey star systems where the planets have exotic
atmospheres and far higher gravity than Earth-standard. Here, the
survival principles are straightforward: long, medium and short-
range sensor scans are constant on the approach with a continual
assessment of the planetary conditions. As much work is done
remotely as possible, with drones or heavily shielded surveyors
being used for work that needs to take place close-up.

As survival in an exotic atmosphere or high gravity environment is
completely dependent on the protection offered by a ship – a costly
resource – distance is by far the best survival technique. Where
an exploration to a planet's surface is necessary (and sanctioned),
Scouts rely on vacc suits and appropriate vehicles, and completely
minimise the time spent, planet-side, in order to lengthen the
survival odds.

Any atmosphere displaying corrosive or highly toxic components
is never entered by individuals unless there is no other alternative.
High gravity environments are considered to be those where
gravity is twice Earth standard and, again, planet-side exploration is
avoided because the working conditions are simply too hazardous
to be effected. Therefore Scouts use distance and sensor/telescope
arrays to conduct their surveys, helping to contribute to their survival
rate. Scouts who shun the strict survey safety procedures, and thus
jeopardise the lives of their crew and ship, are drummed-out of the
Scout service and tend to earn the disdain of their colleagues. In
a harsh universe, such ostracism can be every bit as difficult to
survive as the physical challenges of the environment.

Jungle
Jungles offer some of the most hostile environments on any world,
by their very nature containing vast areas of dense woodland and
undergrowth often in intense heat and humidity as well as a vast
array of stinging biting and poisonous fauna and flora.

The term jungle describes an area of dense undergrowth and
woodland, generally occupying a tropical area. A tropical climate is
generally defined as any environment with a year-round temperature
of at least 18 degrees Celsius and high levels of humidity. Seasonal
variations in temperature and foliage are minimal but some areas
have distinct dry and wet seasons with daily rainfall in a wet season
(tropical monsoon) being extreme and bringing extra hazards.

Dense jungle covers undeveloped river basins and mountain areas
and may contain areas of swampland. Jungles at a high elevation

##### SURVIVAL SURVIVAL

may still be very wet but can have a more temperate climate and
even come close to freezing at high altitude during the night.

Jungles are, by their nature, undeveloped in terms of settlements.
Natives may be nomadic or occupy well-hidden, localised
settlements that are only reachable along known paths. The dense
canopy of a jungle environment makes signalling difficult and
elevated, eye-sight observation almost impossible; locating a group
of survivors in a jungle is most effectively done with sensors locking-
onto positioning relays and personal ID transmitters, although the
climate and plethora of mobile fauna may mask or confuse signals.

NAVIGATION AND MOVEMENT
Jungles are often very wet with many rivers which can be fast
flowing and contain harmful parasites or dangerous fauna. Heavy
rain can produce rapid bank erosion and white water rapids or heavy
vegetation can block and slow rivers producing swamps. When in
search of rescue or aid, remaining close to a clearly navigable river
can be a wise course of action, especially as most settlements will
be near such waterways.

Movement overland can be very tiring, dense undergrowth can
be near impossible to cut a path through and very exhausting.
Endurance rolls of 8+ may be required at regular intervals (every
2-3 hours) to test the characters for fatigue. Sharp leaved plants
can cut clothing or unprotected hands and the slightest cut can
quickly become infected in such humid conditions. Navigation is

particularly difficult as a clear view of the surroundings is often
impossible. All Navigate and Reconn rolls are subject to a –1DM in
addition to any other conditions that may affect visibility and sense
of surroundings.

Normal techniques of compass navigation such as using handrails
or taking bearing off terrain features are useless as the dense
undergrowth prevents line of sight. Compass navigation is still of
use if carried out in a very disciplined way, as it requires the use
of pacing and the leap frog technique to keep on a bearing and
accurately judge distance travelled. If characters have contact with a
ship in orbit that acts as a Global Positioning Sensor (and most ship
sensor packages offer this as a standard feature) GPS navigation
can be used - although such systems are not without drawbacks.
First, deep jungle valleys and dense canopy can actually block the
system from getting a signal to pinpoint the position, leading to a
loss of accuracy. Secondly most systems rely on batteries, which
have a limited life span, which is further reduced in the hot, humid
conditions. Unless GPS or similar equipment is moisture/humidity
resistant, reduce its battery life by 25%.

JUNGLE FLORA
The high temperature and heavy rainfall results in an almost
continual growth of native vegetation. Changes in vegetation type
tend to be gradual.

Primary Jungle is an area of tall evergreen trees normally in lowland
areas with a rainfall above 200cm per year. The high humidity and
heavy rainfall causes trees to rot from the inside and some trees
may fall without warning. The trees in this type of jungle normally
grow up to 60 meters (or more) high with branches not appearing
below 25 meters on most large trees. The overall light level is about
the same as twilight and movement on foot is fairly easy as the
dense canopy prevents thick ground level foliage. One problem for
rescue is the almost total cover from being seen from the air and
any smoke from single fires will be well dispersed by the time it
penetrates the high canopy.

Secondary Jungle is the result of an area being cleared by fire or
logging and then left. Exposure to sunlight results in rapid growth (2
–3 meters a year). Heavy ground foliage makes travel arduous and
visibility only around 20 meters; some areas will be impenetrable
and progress both noisy and tiring.

Native peoples are well versed in finding food from their jungle
environment but for the inexperienced there are many poisonous
or harmful plants. Vines and creepers should never be grasped
and pulled by the naked hand as many have sharp thorns, or can
split into extremely sharp fibres, which can cause deep lacerations.
Bamboo, and bamboo-like plants can split to form sharp stakes
when mature and any minor cut can be very serious due to the
high risk of infection. Although vines and creepers may seem to be
an excellent source of water (the old image of an explorer hacking
a vine and drinking the clear, sweet water flowing out of it), it is

##### SSURVIVALURVIVAL SURVIVAL

generally _not_ a good source of drinking water. If such water is red,
yellow or milky in colour it is not safe to drink, as it carries natural
toxins, harmful residues and parasites. Large sections of bamboo
and bamboo-like plants _can_ contain safe drinking water. To test for
it tap the section of stem with blade or hard object and listen for a
change in tone or sloshing sound. If present (Survival 8+), then such
water is safe to drink.

Where shelter is concerned, jungle plants are very well adapted to
such a damp environment and finding suitable leaves to make a
waterproof shelter is often an easy task: Survival rolls for finding
shelter gain a +1DM in a jungle environment. However, many plant
saps contain irritants or toxins, which can be absorbed through the
skin, so skin contact with plant sap should be avoided. Fungus is a
major source of infections, as, in the high humidity, the body can
become the perfect growing environment for a variety of unpleasant
fungal parasites. Keeping feet dry is essential, if at all possible, as
fungal foot infections in the jungle can quickly slow a person and
turn a healthy one into a casualty.

JUNGLE FAUNA
The image is often of a jungle alive with large and dangerous
predators. In reality jungles do, indeed, teem with such life but the
greatest threat comes not from large animals but from invertebrates
and smaller poisonous reptiles. Large predators will rarely attack
adult humans - although they can be a real risk. Much more
dangerous is the vast array of stinging and biting insects which
can cause sickness or be carriers for disease. If scratched, insect
bites can quickly become infected in such conditions draining
morale and strength from the person involved. The watchword in
a jungle environment is to keep as much skin covered as possible,
regardless of the heat and humidity. Exposed skin attracts biting,
blood-feeding insects, and characters can expect to receive 1d3 bites
per day. Increase this by +1 or +2 depending on how much exposed
flesh is on offer. Reduce the roll for the use of repellents – although,
on an alien world, standard repellents may prove to be ineffective.

Many insects and invertebrates like warm, dark, damp hiding
places, so checking footwear before putting feet into them is vital. If
possible, sleeping should be done in hammocks above the ground,
or in sealed habitat units, to offers some protection against nocturnal
hazards. Larger predators and scavengers can be attracted by waste
food and bodily waste so camp hygiene is essential.

Whilst large jungle fauna can be a good source of fresh meat,
hunting is strenuous and difficult – even with modern weapons
and techniques. Plus, due to the variety of parasites and climate
conditions the consumption of jungle meat could prove risky; and,
eating carrion of any kind is to be strongly avoided.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
As already mentioned jungles are extremely hot and humid places
and such conditions can place an enormous strain on the body.
Despite the humidity dehydration can be a real problem and
although water can be plentiful, clean water may not be. The rules
for hydration, found earlier in this chapter, as applicable in a jungle
environment as anywhere else. The jungle has a reputation for
quickly destroying the fitness levels of the inexperienced, through
dehydration, malnutrition, disease and fatigue. Psychologically
the jungle's constant wall of green, and low light levels beneath
the canopy, can seriously affect motivation and the sounds of the
nocturnal animals can also be disturbing for those unused to them.
All jungles have a basic Stress Level of 10.

Vacuum
No environment is more hostile than the vacuum of space. An
absence of air, intense cold and high radiation levels mean that
humans, without a vacc suit, have little chance of surviving for more
than a few seconds in pure vacuum.

The principal functions of a vac suit are to create a pressurized,
oxygenated atmosphere and to protect from ultraviolet rays and
extreme temperatures. Without it, a character would asphyxiate
from the lack of breathable air and suffer from ebulism , in which
a reduction in pressure causes the boiling point of bodily fluids
to decrease below the body's normal temperature. Since it takes
a little bit of time for these things to kill, it is possible to make it
through a very short period without a vacc suit, or in a vacc suit
that has been compromised.

Any character can remain conscious for a number of seconds equal
to his Endurance characteristic +1D6 before asphyxiation takes
place. Holding one's breath, as in a pressured environment, will
not help; in vacuum, oxygen expands within the lungs, causing
severe internal damage. Therefore, if a character knows he is going
to experience vacuum, he must expel all the air from his lungs
(Survival 8+) to prevent this possibility – or he will experience 4D6
points of damage across his physical characteristics, in addition to
all other vacuum effects.

Unconscious characters have, at maximum, 1D6+1 minutes before
asphyxiating, even if unconscious. In this time, ebullism results
in all moisture close to the surface of the skin beginning to boil,
inflicting a further 2d6 damage.

DAMAGED VACC SUITS
The vacc suit is, of course, the most important piece of equipment
any character can have for protection against the effects of
vacuum. All vacc suits are designed to be pressurised, heated, and

##### SURVIVAL SURVIVAL

radiation retardant. They are also designed to minimise pressure
and oxygen leakage due to damage through small tears, rips and
so forth. A relatively minor amount of damage to a vac suit will
not pose too much of a threat to its occupant; self-sealing pads in
the vac suit's fabric come into play to minimise the effects almost
immediately, although an additional repair patch over the leak on
the exterior of the suit is standard vacc suit protocol and covered
in the Vacc Suit skill.

More serious damage – that which will impair the suit's integrity

- poses a more immediate risk of death. Substantial tears through
weapon damage, debris strikes and so forth must be repaired
immediately using the Vacc Suit skill and with the repair pouches
carried for the purpose. Assign the damage a severity rating from
8 to 12 (or higher) representing the degree of damage. This is the
target number for the vacc suit repair roll the character must make.
If it is a success, then the vacc suit has been repaired to a minimal
standard, but the character needs to return to safety so that a full
repair can be made. If the roll fails, then the Effect represents the
amount of time the character has before the suit fully malfunctions
and ceases to offer pressurised life support. If the Effect is 0, then

the character has 6+2d6 minutes to return to safety. If the Effect
is –1 or –2, the character has 2d6 minutes. Effects of –3 of greater
give just 1D6 minutes. After this period the suit loses pressure and
heating, resulting in the ebullism effects noted above.

RADIATION
Space radiation is comprised of atoms in which electrons have been
stripped away as the atom accelerates in interstellar space to speeds
approaching the speed of light – eventually, only the nucleus of the atom
remains. Space radiation is made up of three kinds: particles trapped
in the magnetic field of a planet; particles shot into space during solar
flares (solar particle events); and galactic cosmic rays, which are high-
energy protons and heavy ions from outside a solar system. All of these
kinds of space radiation represent ionizing radiation.

Galactic cosmic rays include heavy, high-energy ions of elements
that have had all their electrons stripped away. Cosmic rays, which
can cause the ionization of atoms as they pass through matter, can
pass practically unimpeded through a typical spacecraft or the skin
of an astronaut. The energy that ionizing radiation loses as it travels
through a material or living tissue is absorbed by that material or
living tissue. The ionization of water and other cell components
can damage DNA molecules near the path the particle takes – a
direct effect of which is breaks in DNA strands including clusters
of breaks near one another; breaks that are not easily repaired by
cells. Such DNA break clusters are much less frequent, or do not
occur at all, when cells are exposed to the types of radiation found in
planetary systems. Because it can disrupt an atom, space radiation
also can produce more particles, including neutrons, when it strikes
a spacecraft or its occupants – this is called a secondary effect.

Starship hulls and vacc suits use materials high in hydrogen
composition, which greatly assists in protecting against direct and
secondary effect radiation doses, and are thus shielded against
the effects of radiation, and physical damage of the kind described
above is unlikely to impair the suit's capabilities to any great
extent. However any character that is caught in space without a
vacc suit, or other, similar, anti-radiation protection, risks being
irradiated by the cosmic rays found everywhere in space. Refer to
the radiation rules on page 141 and 142 of the Traveller rules for
details on the effects.

There is little anyone can do to combat the incessant radiation
of space, or that emitted during solar particle events. Spacecraft
sensor arrays continually probe for solar particle events whenever
a ship enters a system, and if a solar particle event is occurring
(Sensors 8+) the safest course of action – even given the shielding
of a ship's hull and hydrogen fuel tanks – is to seek cover behind a
system object such as an asteroid or in a planet's shadow. Referees
may call for Pilot (spacecraft) rolls to take evasive action when a
solar particle event is detected, to check the ability of the Scout to
minimise solar radiation effects.
