Dhurgeng, a high-level officer of the [[Kforuzeng]], is a [[Vargr]] of considerable and increasing charisma. He has been promised command of the _Ozarr_ (the new ship being built to house one of the meson guns) and its supporting squadron, which will probably become the second most important position in the organization. Consequently, he is devoting his every effort to making certain that the sale proceeds without difficulty.
