# Marquis Leonard Holden-Tukera of Aramis

![[CT-TTA-055-3.jpg]]
Marquis Leonard Holden-Tukera of Aramis, nineteenth of the line, is [[Marquis of Aramis|hereditary head]] of the government of [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis|Aramis]]. This translates primarily into the ability to grant favors, concessions, or jobs, usually in return for a monetary consideration. Most of this is easily handled by a secretary, leaving the Marquis free for other pursuits. This is fortunate, for the Marquis is a useless profligate who spends most of his time enjoying his wealth and social position. The Marquis is married to the Lady Arianne Tukera, a member of the large Tukera family and heir to a large block of stock. Her connections have persuaded the Marquis to back [[Tukera]]'s attempts to maintain its position in subsector trade. He has also, from time to time, meddled in Tukera's local business dealings, generally in an attempt to enforce his sense of fair play; [[Bulolo]] resents these incidents, which force him to spend valuable time convincing the Marquis that what [[Bulolo]] already wants to do is morally right (difficult because it usually isn't; easy because the Marquis is gullible).
