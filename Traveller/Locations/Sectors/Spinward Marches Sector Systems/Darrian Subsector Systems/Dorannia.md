### DORANNIA
Dorannia is one of a cluster of three worlds lying just off the [[Bowman Arm]] of the [[Spinward Main]] and accessible by jump-2 ships from the main or the central cluster of the subsector. None of these worlds is especially important, although [[Bularia]] has a reasonable trade in agricultural produce.

Dorannia is an independent world with a population numbering somewhat less than a million. It is administered by a fairly efficient civil service government that follows established patterns in an unimaginative way; laws are strict, largely as a consequence of a harsh environment that can kill the unwary. Mistakes can have terminal consequences for others, too.

The planet is small, with low surface gravity and a very thin atmosphere tainted by radioactive dust.  This requires a compressor mask or full air supply when working outside settlements, along with strict decontamination procedures within the settlements. The latter tend not to be large, with towns of a few thousand being more common than cities. The towns are each administered by local government, which in turn answers to the central administration at the capital.

Dorannia has very little water and virtually no food production outside of colony domes. Most towns have an area dedicated to food production, which also keeps the air fresh, but few are self-sufficient. Extra foodstuffs are brought in from more specialized settlements, which grow bulk crops in huge environmentally-sealed greenhouses.

Transport between the settlements is by rail or large, slow transport crawlers. Grav vehicles are expensive and Dorannia is not a rich world, so the few available tend to be in the hands of the government or well-off private owners rather than as commercial transport.

Dorannia has little agriculture, air or water, but what it does have is fissionables. The world was originally settled as a mining colony to extract and process radioactive ores and this is the mainstay of its offworld business. However, the remote location of the world makes it a poor choice as a supplier so the mines make a modest profit but never enough to put Dorannia on the economic map.

In recent years, a new industry has emerged on Dorannia.  Rather than simply mining and exporting radioactives, the world's industrial base now constructs a range of fission-based power systems, including full-sized nuclear powerplants suitable to power a large town or major industrial complex, as well as smaller plants for vehicles and miniature reactors for small-scale applications.

Nuclear fission is a mature technology on Dorannia, which uses reactors to power its towns, industrial centres, railways and even large transport crawlers.  Safety records and reliability are good, although fission power will never be as safe as fusion, nor can fission match the output per unit mass of a fusion plant.  Nevertheless, it is a viable alternative for mid-tech worlds that want a power system maintained with local resources. Thus far, Dorannia's products have found a few buyers and the future seems promising. A recent campaign run on several worlds invited prospective buyers to visit 'Atomic Dorannia' and showcased a range of novel nuclear energy applications.

All is not entirely well on Dorannia, however. The scattered nature of the world's settlements makes them ideal targets for planetary raiders. These spaceborne thugs either raid settlements for whatever they can grab or else hold them hostage under the guns of their ship, demanding tribute. On a sealed-environment world like Dorannia, the consequences of taking fire could be catastrophic. After a string of raids in 1102-3, one of which wrecked a starport, the government decided to do something about the problem. A mercenary unit comprising an armed merchant ship and associated personnel was hired, providing protection in the short term and advising on the creation of planetary defences for a more permanent solution.

The latter took a form that would simply not be allowed in the [[Imperium]]. Batteries of crude nuclear missiles were installed near many settlements, guided by rather basic tracking and fire control equipment.

DESCRIPTION



Crawlers of all sizes are used on Dorannia, to cross its inhospitable surface, and this represents the largest, capable of carrying both cargo and passengers over rough terrain in safety. It is not especially well-appointed but running costs after purchase are relatively cheap and a well-maintained crawler can keep moving for decades before being replaced.

Dorannia PAD Missiles The Planetary Aerospace Defence missiles used on Dorannia are classed as torpedo-sized weapons, similar to the multi-warhead torpedo found in High Guard (page 32). In theory, they could be fired from a torpedo launcher on a ship but possess some drawbacks when compared to traditional torpedoes.

•  The target acquisition systems of Dorannia leave something to be desired and all attack rolls made by a PAD missile suffers DM-2 (for a total DM-4 when targeting a ship smaller than 2,000 tons).
•  The use of a first stage to boost PAD missiles into orbit mean they cannot target any ship within Adjacent, Close or Short range.
•  Most settlements protected by PAD missiles have 2D silos, each capable of launching a missile every combat round. Larger settlements will have two or three times this number.
•  Each PAD missile carries six warheads that overwhelm anti-missile defences (DM-2 to all point defence fire) and multiples the number of torpedoes in the salvo by 6.

The homebuilt missiles are not up to the safety standards required in the [[Imperium]]; although the [[Imperium]] permits nuclear munitions to be owned by world governments for planetary defence in the event of major war, there are many volumes of regulations for their safe storage and circumstances under which they can be used. Whereas most ship-to-ship missiles, even aboard warships, are non-nuclear, Dorannia has launched more nuclear munitions under combat conditions since 1103 than most planetary navies in their entire history. The fact of the matter is that
'Atomic Dorannia' has become trigger-happy with its new arsenal.

Since Dorannia has no capability to conduct boarding and search operations in space, the only option is to use the threat of annihilation. Vessels that seem even slightly suspect are targeted and told they have numerous missiles aimed at them. They are permitted to either sheer off and go somewhere else or otherwise proceed to land at the port very slowly and carefully.

Several vessels have been fired upon and as the guidance systems of Dorannia's missile arsenal are not the best, accuracy is problematical. The answer is, of course, to fire large salvoes in the hope of a hit. As a result, a typical Dorannia PAD (Planetary Aerospace Defence) missile consists of a large ground-to-orbit bus section and six independently targeted short-range missiles, each with a tactical nuclear warhead. PAD silos are supplemented with smaller turrets carrying traditional missile racks (again, armed with nuclear missiles).

A number of vessels have been induced to flee in the face of this crazily aggressive response and at least one has been destroyed. It is not possible to tell from an expanding cloud of radioactive debris and gas whether the target was actually a raider or simply a merchant vessel whose bad-tempered captain chose the wrong frontier world to get stroppy with traffic control. In any case, word seems to have got round, as the raids have stopped.
