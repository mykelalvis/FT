# Offroad Solutions

Offroad Solutions builds rugged vehicles for frontier exploration, transportation and utility tasks. It has a grav vehicles arm, which mainly builds standard air/ rafts and enlarged versions for a variety of purposes. Most of these are little different from any other air/raft, other than being designed to seat eight or ten people or to carry a small amount of cargo in addition to four personnel. A few variants stand out, however.

Among these is Offroad Solutions’ heavy-lift platform, marketed under the Strongarm brand. This vehicle is modelled on the standard six-seater air/raft but has additional lifters on outriggers. It is designed to carry a small crane but is sometimes deployed as a simple heavy-lift truck. Another interesting variant on this vehicle is the Strongarm Bridgelayer, which carries a pair of folding arms with a light roadway over the top. The Strongarm Bridgelayer is a quick but expensive solution to the problem of getting ground vehicles across an obstacle. Its automated systems will keep it in place while a convoy passes over but its power is not unlimited; at some point a proper bridge must be constructed.

Most of Offroad Solutions’ vehicles are wheeled. They are usually driven by electric motors powered from a rechargeable fuel cell but hydrocarbon-burning variants are available. These often have filter and compression systems to enable use on thin or tainted atmosphere worlds. Offroad markets a range of SUV-type ‘light trucks’ which mostly use a four-wheel chassis. Some have six wheels instead, but all vehicles of this sort are fairly light in terms of load they can carry. This does not prevent Offload’s light trucks from becoming popular with insurgents and militias – and low-budget mercenary units – all over the sector. The usual conversion is to mount a machinegun in the bed of a pickup truck style vehicles, but other conversions have been seen.

Heavier vehicles include an eight-wheel offroad truck, which can be paired with an eight-wheel trailer unit to create an outback cargo hauler. These vehicles can be provided with a pressurised cab and life support for the crew, and are popular with colonial operators or explorers. There are numerous colonies where what passes for infrastructure consists entirely of trucks of this type pounding across the undeveloped countryside between small settlements.

Offroad also produces a popular family of All-Terrain Vehicles, including a version of the fairly standard eight-wheel ATV. A small four-wheel version, marketed as the ‘All-Terrain Scout’ has most of its components in common with the larger members of the family and is often paired with them for larger expeditions. A dedicated transport version of the standard eight-wheel ATV is also in widespread use, largely with private operators but also with some planetary military forces as a lightly armoured all-terrain transport vehicle. Some of these transports have been converted to weapon carriers, typically mounting missile or laser systems, but this is not an officially available option.

Vehicles produced by Offroad Solutions make extensive use of off-the-shelf standard components, and are thus easy to maintain in the field. This has proven a strong selling point to date, making Offroad Solutions one of the larger transportation firms in the region despite the existence of higher-specification vehicles marketed by its competitors.
