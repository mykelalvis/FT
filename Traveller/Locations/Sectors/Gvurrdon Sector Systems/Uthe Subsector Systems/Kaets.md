Kaets is a nonindustrial world, that requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society.

- In a technological universe, societies without industrial capability generally suffer as nearly all manufactured and high tech goods must be brought in at significant cost.
- As a nonindustrial world, it requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. The need to import most manufactured and high technology goods drives the price of these goods up in the open market.
- It is a Non-Aligned world dominated by Vargr sophonts located in the [[Uthe Subsector]] of the [[Gvurrdon Sector]].

- This world has a Vargr Corsair Base.

Kaets is a cold world with a very thin breathable atmosphere and about 60% ocean coverage. There is enough atmospheric pressure to keep the oceans from boiling away, but visitors will want both cold weather gear and breathing masks. The starport is located in the arctic circle amongst ice locked mountainous terrain. Why anyone would build a starport in such an inhospitable place seems strange until you consider that it is a free port, founded by Vargr Corsairs. They didn't come here for the climate, they came because the largely underground complex they've built is well protected from orbital or ground attack.

The oceans barely stay liquid most of the year round except near the equator, with icebergs a regular sight throughout the oceans across most of the northern and southern hemispheres. The systems G0 IV sun has a mass approximating 1.15 of Sol and puts out reasonably high levels of heat. The thin atmosphere doesn't provide much protection so this is a world where you can easily freeze to death while also suffering from severe sunburn.

There are very few settlements; a town is located around 500km from the main starport, which crews who want a bit of variety can take a shuttle to and party down away from the ruffians at the port. There is very little industry on world, with the economy devoted entirely to running the starport and taking as much money off visiting Corsairs as possible.

Paradoxically, it is rare for merchant ships approaching the world to be attacked. The starport exists to give Corsair crews some R&R and to spend their ill gotten gains. The cartel enforces an uneasy peace, forbidding attacks on shipping heading to and from the starport and funding a bounty on crews who transgress. Offenders will be targeted by irate Corsair crews not only annoyed that their free port is a bit shorter on luxuries but also keen to claim the generous bounty. The same does not apply to ships just passing through, or who try to refuel at the gas giant; there is a high likelihood of attack in both circumstances.

There is a bare-bones orbital port to handle non-streamlined ships from which cargo is shuttled down. It is largely automated. While the starport does have sensor arrays, these are set up to monitor ships approaching the port, and so focus on the northern hemisphere. By approaching the planet from south of the equator and staying in the sensor shadow of the planet, a ship can avoid being detected as it approaches (as long as it is careful and lucky enough to not be spotted by a Corsair ship which happens to be in orbit).

While a small world, Kaets still represents a significant area to search for signs of the evacuated crew. The referee can have the players describe their search plan in as much detail as the players are inclined to work out and can make the search as challenging as they want, but ultimately they should be able to locate a Pinnace landed by a large lake in the area marked with a red diamond on the map below. If the local Vargr had been inclined to explore the southern hemisphere of the planet, they probably would have found it years ago.
