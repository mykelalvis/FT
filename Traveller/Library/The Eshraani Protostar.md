# The Eshraani Protostar

A protostar is a cloud of interstellar gas which is beginning to coalesce into a star. As yet, while the cloud is becoming denser at its centre, it has not yet begun to undergo nuclear fusion in the core, and thus is not luminous. The only real difference between a protostar and a gas cloud is that there is enough mass present that someday the protostar will be a star. Over time the rotating cloud of gas will coalesce into clumps, becoming hotter and denser until thermonuclear fusion begins at its core and a star is born. That day is long distant in the case of the Eshraani Protostar, but there is much to learn from studying this fascinating phenomenon.

The Eshraani Protostar can be located in a rift or other area currently without a star. It is not likely to be detected from one or more parsecs away using normal starship sensors as the gas cloud is not yet very dense and is not luminous. A laboratory ship or a scout vessel with good sensors will pick up the signs that a protostar is present from a few parsecs away, but the typical navigational sensors of a merchant vessel cannot do so. The protostar does not interfere with jump travel in the area as it is not dense enough.


The protostar is of scientific interest, and subject to both long-term and short-term study. Scout and scientific vessels sometimes enter the gas cloud to take readings, though this is the source of some controversy. There are those who believe that this activity might disrupt the formation of the star or influence it in an unpredictable manner. Arguments rage between scientists even on distant worlds, providing the occasional scientific- interest piece (which is commonly rather cheaply wrangled into a human-interest story by provoking an on-air row between rival astrophysicists) after which the public tends to forget about the protostar once again.


The Church of Stellar Divinity, which believes that stars are gods, is sharply divided on the subject of entering the gas cloud. Some of its leaders think the proto-god should be left completely alone, others think it should be worshipped from nearby starships and helped to grow with songs and prayers. Some take a middle ground and say that properly blessed ships can enter the gas cloud for scientific and religious purposes since the proto-god will know they mean no harm, and even claim that such intrusions cannot possibly affect the starâ€™s formation because it will welcome them.


The Eshraani Protostar could be part of an adventure as the destination of a scientific mission, or could be nothing more than a passing incident as the Travellers see a science ship being blessed by priests or harassed by true believers. The Travellers might be accosted by earnest young people wanting their support for a campaign to ban research on the protostar, or even to take part in a covert action inspired by the dispute. Perhaps someone wants a prominent scientist scared off or rescued from protestors, or wishes to discredit one side of the dispute by underhand means. The protostar might be the focus of an adventure, or the reason for a situation that leads to one.
