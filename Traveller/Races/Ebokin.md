> The Ebokin are a very alien race to human eyes, resembling a centipede-like creature with eight legs on a long rear section of the torso, plus four short arms on a frontal section of the torso, which is typically carried upright. In addition to acting as manipulators, these arms are used for communication. Ebokin cannot perceive sound other than as vibrations, as they possess no hearing organs. Their language requires four arms, although a pidgin version exists for use by humans and similarly inadequately enabled creatures.
>
> Ebokin are adapted to the environment of Yebab and breathe methane rather than oxygen. As a result of their homeworld conditions, their vision range lies in the ultraviolet, making interactions with humans difficult unless technical assistance is available. The Ebokin have a mature TL7 culture and are aware that much greater things could be achieved. As a species, they are keen to advance their scientific knowledge.
>
> Ebokin society is matriarchal and extremely conservative. Social change is slow, with strict laws that limit capacity for adaptation. This suits the typical Ebokin, who views human society as a chaotic maelstrom of changing views, lies and shifting moral ground.
>
> Ebokin rarely venture far from their homes but a small merchant/explorer caste has emerged in recent decades, bravely seeking to learn about the wider universe through trade and purchase of scientific knowledge. A few travel aboard vessels crewed by other sophonts but some starships are entirely operated by Ebokin, most converted from standard human or occasionally Vargr designs.
>
> Physically, Ebokin are much more heavily built than humans, with a typical individual massing around 130kg. This makes them tougher than the typical human but less agile.
