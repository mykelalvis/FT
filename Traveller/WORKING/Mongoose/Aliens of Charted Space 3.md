# INTRODUCTION

Charted Space is home to hundreds of alien races. Some have risen from their homeworlds and spread to the star systems around them, others are either incapable or content to remain where they are. When playing an alien race, it is tempting to focus on a couple of points that make them stand out from humans but this can result in all aliens seeming one dimensional. The beauty of playing a member of an alien race is to dig down into what makes them different and how that difference affects their interaction with other races.

This book focuses on five alien races.

The Darrians are known to be a pacifistic race who value excellence in scientific and artistic endeavors. Many militaristic races have scoffed at this, thinking Darrians an easy target, or that their outlook makes them inconsequential on the galactic stage. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Darrians are heirs to some of the most advanced technology available in Charted Space and their advancement continues. For those who believe they can conquer this race of pacifistic scientists and artists, the Darrians have a feared weapon capable of causing a sun to go supernova – giving any aggressor pause – the Star Trigger.

The Geonee have claimed to be the decedents of the Ancients and they have the ruins and remnant technology to support their claim. When first contacted by the Vilani, they were thought to be a Major Race until it was discovered they had reverse engineered their jump drive from a recovered Ancients starship, causing the retraction of their position and relegating

them to become a Minor Race. The Geonee have struggled to have their achievements recognized by the greater interstellar community ever since.

Dolphins where gifted sophoncy by GenAssist, a genetic engineering corporation founded on Solomani principles with the intent of providing the humans of Terra companions to colonize the galaxy with. The project was a success and Dolphins have become recognized as a Minor Race in their own right. Their communities are based on principles of total freedom and equality but they owe a debt of honor to the humans who gave them reasoned thought.

The Orca are another race granted sophoncy by GenAssist but this time grudgingly. The project to raise them up to a Minor Race suffered a serious setback, which nearly ended the program if not for the generosity of the people of Sufren. Matriarchal and aloof, the Orca are far less friendly than their Dolphin cousins and do not share their outlook. Instead they hold principles of matriarchal veneration and mindfulness as the core of their civilization.

The Bwaps evolved amid the swamps of an alien world, their civilization grew slowly through cooperation and the universal belief that they all have an individual and unique place in the universe to fulfil. Their obsession with minutia and fine detail placed them in the perfect position to make themselves indispensable to the bureaucracy of the Ziru Sirka and their close relationship with the First Imperium allowed them not only to influence their position within it but gain access to technology denied other races.

# THE DARRIANS

On the far spinward side of Charted Space, caught between the Third Imperium and Zhodani Consulate, is the Darrian Confederation – a polity that barely expands across a subsector. Populated mainly by a human Minor Race known as the Darrians, they seemingly rose from nowhere. The Darrians achieved their pinnacle thousands of years ago thanks to Solomani fleeing the collapse of the Rule of Man who were integrated into Darrian society and added their diversity to the Darrians, spurring their achievements, developing technology that even today is beyond the scope of what is possible by other interstellar nations. A tragedy befell the Darrians when they experimented with one of their greatest inventions – the Star Trigger. Destabilizing their own sun, the Darrians caused an electromagnetic pulse to be ejected, not only wiping out the electronics on their own world but continuing on to affect nearby stars, plunging the Confederation into turmoil. This was followed by a coronal mass ejection that boiled their oceans and superheated their atmosphere. This ecological and technological disaster plunged the Darrians into a pre-spaceflight level of technology.

The collapse of the Confederation followed, isolating Darrian colonies and forcing them to prosper or fail without assistance. Gradually the Darrians recovered, recontacted lost colonies and re-established their Confederation. With time and dedication, the Darrians have slowly reclaimed much of their technology but are still unable to grasp the technological heights achieved before the fall.

### PHYSIOLOGY

The Darrians descend from human stock relocated to Daryen over 300,000 years ago by the Ancients. The new world the transplants found themselves on was of low gravity but otherwise hospitable to human life. Initially free from the pathogens and diseases of their new world, they developed new ones from the bacterium and viruses within their own bodies. The combination of lighter gravity, arid environment and increased level of ozone led to unique adaptations not found in other humans.

The reduced gravity of Daryen led to the development of a taller and slighter build, with an equal reduction in strength. Freed from the shackles of restricting gravity, the physiology adapted by 'stretching' the body, making them much lither. This stretching also gave somewhat sharper features and an exotic look that has been described as almost elfin. Reduced air pressure caused a slight elongation and tapering of the ears to improve audio capacity.

Most pure-blood Darrians grow to a height of 2.10–2. meters tall, while those of mixed blood tend to be a little shorter. Males average 78 kilograms in weight while females average 71 kilograms, somewhat lighter than an average human of similar height.

For most of their history, Darrians lived in harmony with their native ecologies, taking great pleasure in observing nature and maintaining a pleasurable alertness of their surroundings. This has led to slightly sharper eyesight and hearing than other humans. The Darrians have a greater tendency towards music and mathematics, perhaps due to the thicker and larger number of connections between the hemispheres of their brains. This has also resulted in almost 20% of all Darrians being ambidextrous, with the remaining 80% almost equally divided between left and right handedness.

Daryen has a large percentage of ozone in its thin atmosphere, more so at higher altitudes, leading to Darrians developing a resistance to ozone poisoning. Later research revealed that the resistance originated with a retroviral RNA subsumed into the Darrians' own DNA. This discovery led to a vaccine being developed for the Solomani people among them.

Darrians are not very tolerant of dense atmospheres, feeling much more comfortable in standard and light atmospheres. This intolerance is due to Darrians becoming partially adapted to low pressure atmosphere, when crossing the high attitude mountain passes of their homeworld, and because many of their colonies have thin or very thin atmospheres because of low gravity. Darrians require specialized breathing equipment to function in anything above 1.1 standard atmospheres.

An interesting adaption with no clear cause is the widening of the pelvis in both male and female Darrian. Their legs also extend straight down from their hips, not like the slightly knock-kneed arrangement of other humans. Darrian footprints are parallel, with the toes pointed neither in or out. This gives them a graceful

gait but they have some difficulty balancing on narrow surfaces. The wider pelvis has also led to significantly fewer difficulties in childbirth and allows for a longer gestation period and slightly more developed babies with greater brain development.

Darrians do not possess melanin to protect them from ultraviolet radiation. Instead, they have a chemical called protremelanin, which absorbs UV radiation without tanning, giving them a golden skin tone and much greater protection from the ultraviolet spectrum. Their skin also has a glowing quality that others refer to as their 'inner light'. Stressed or unhealthy Darrians lose this glow and their complexion becomes a greyish-yellow. To complement their skin tone, Darrian hair ranges from white to platinum-blonde and exhibits the same slight glowing nature. The introduction of Solomani genetics has given rise to a somewhat ruddier appearance amongst Darrians of mixed heritage but an individual will either have melanin or protremelanin in their skin, never both.

Darrians are unable to store subcutaneous fat, hence metabolising everything they eat to be used for energy or internal heat. They have a variable appetite based on their environmental requirements. If too many calories are consumed, they are just expelled as waste product. Although an autonomous process, this has led other humans to be somewhat envious of Darrians, who never have a need to diet.

A by-product of their variable appetite is a resistance to cold and frostbite – a Darrian with plenty of food can survive perfectly well in climates other humans would find far too cold. They also resist diseases somewhat by entering a short feverish coma that burns up most human bacterial and viral infections.

Darrian physiology is adapted to an arid environment. They perspire very little, tending to go through long periods of inactivity when their body temperature is too hot. Their pigment, high surface to mass ratio and autonomous metabolic control generally allows them to remain cool without perspiring, unless undergoing exercise.

**LIFESPAN**
Darrians have a gestation period of 11 months, giving the baby a head start with increased brain development. Linguistic ability begins moulding in the womb and motor skills shortly after birth. Most can walk, run and start imitating speech at three months.

Despite this early development, Darrians are considered children until they are 18 years old when they reach majority but are not considered mature adults until 22 when they complete their advanced or professional education.

Darrians are considered to be in their prime from the ages of 22 to 40, after which they begin a very slow decline of physical prowess.

Due to their resistance to oxidising agents, Darrians in warm climes can often live to 100 years or more without medical treatment. Darrians forced to live in very cold or high gravity environments tend to live shorter lives, dying at the age of approximately 60, due to increased cardio-pulmonary stress. Anagathics can extend this. Elderly Darrians tend to be physically able but increasingly fragile due to osteoporosis.

### DIET

Like many humans, Darrians are omnivores, able to enjoy a wide range of fruit, vegetables and meat in their diet. They originally ate the fruit produced by the Orchard Trees provided by the Ancients, supplemented with meat hunted from native animals. As civilization grew, the practice of animal husbandry developed in preference to hunting.

Despite their fundamental respect for life, Darrians understand that predation is natural and therefore continue to raise livestock and consume animal protein. They ensure that animals raised for food are treated well and have comfortable lives, foreswearing any unnecessary cruelty in slaughter.

### SOCIETY

While certainly not a monoculture across the entire Darrian Confederation, society is based on the teaching of the ancient Taledh school of thought. Darrian social codes are a series of laws that define civility, tolerance, law and punishment. Each colony follows the general code but subcultures have differing interpretations.

As a pacifistic society, Darrians are viewed with contempt by more militaristic races. They prefer to settle disputes and conflicts via negotiation or clever ruse but there is more to Darrian pacifism than meets the eye. Darrian society is based on the wellbeing of the community rather than gratification of the self, with a strong emphasis on scientific and artistic excellence, stringent self-control, acceptance of others and stoic persistence.

Darrian culture is also influenced by member races of the Confederation. Citizens are treated equally regardless of race or origin. The breakdown of the collected world's populace is 75% pure strain Darrian, 12% mixed strain Darrian, 8% Aslan, 3% pure strain Solomani and 2% other races. Since their arrival on the Darrian homeworld, the Solomani have been absorbed into the culture but in return they introduced novel concepts such as personal freedom and ambition. The Aslan, with their more alien society, continue to follow Aslan traditions but have been slowly and voluntarily adopting Darrian characteristics such as monogamy, prohibition against unnecessary killing and pursuit of intellectual rather than militaristic pursuits. Non-
Darrian Aslan see this as a betrayal of traditional ideals, considering their brethren to be barbarians and traitors to the true Aslan way.

### FAMILY

Darrian form monogamous marriages of a single coupling, within which families are raised. Before marriage, young Darrians are encouraged to try diverse relationships, both different and same sex, even polygamous groupings. This allows young Darrians to experience and experiment with multiple partners to discover what will make them truly content in a relationship.

Once married, Darrians are expected to remain faithful to their partner for the rest of their natural lives. Divorce is extremely rare and socially unacceptable among Darrians. Where a relationship does not result in an enduring and loving relationship, Darrians are expected to stoically endure, maintaining a stable relationship for the sake of their children and social reputation. Self-discipline is another column of Darrian culture

- romantic extramarital affairs, be they emotional or physical, are disapproved of.

Marriages normally produce an average of two or three children. Family names are descended from the paternal line but in return the mother has the right to give the child it's birth name.

Children are raised to be respectful of their elders and the community, to seek knowledge and be open-
minded to opposing thoughts. Behaviour is re-enforced through social ostracism – antisocial, non-communal and selfish acts are punished with exile of the perpetrator from their peers.

Darrians are considered adolescent when they reach

14. Self-reliance is taught at this age and any anti-
social conduct is punished with cessation of societal benefits, cutting the youth off from food, shelter and transport until they realise their error and that they cannot function as a complete individual without the support of others. Continued misbehaviour normally ends with exile and occasionally death of the perpetrator, normally through malnutrition or exposure. While this is viewed as unnecessarily harsh by citizens of the Imperium, this method has been in use for thousands of years and death is rarely the outcome unless the individual truly desires it. Those who wish to continue in their selfish anti-social behaviour may choose to exile to the world of Rorre or elsewhere beyond the borders of the Confederation.

At 22, a Darrian is legally considered an adult. At this point they are encouraged to leave home and begin lives for themselves. Family bonds remain close and during their declining years parents are normally cared for by their children, grandchildren or great-
grandchildren, often cycling between them to reduce unnecessary strain.

**COMMUNITY**
Darrians have no concept of tribe, clan or nation. Instead, they think of themselves as a unified world and even that is second to the identity of the Confederation. Each member world of the Confederation has its own minor variations in culture and tradition but this is to be expected from a polity splintered for a significant amount of time. Since their return to interstellar travel, the worlds have knitted together into a surprisingly homogenous civilization. No matter who they are, Darrian, Solomani, Aslan; they are all members of the Confederation and they are all Darrian.

Darrian societies aim to be egalitarian meritocracies, where everyone is treated equally. Nothing stands in a citizen's way of attaining authority except their own capabilities. Social services and governance are structured in suitably sized authorities, based on geography and population of each world. Some operate on the level of a village, others may be city level, while others may be continental or planetary. Naturally, some worlds come closer to this ideal than others but it is always the goal.

### PERSONAL EXCELLENCE

From an early age, young Darrians are encouraged to strive for scholastic excellence to achieve their intellectual potential. This is not restricted to purely scientific pursuits, extending to artistic and sporting excellence as well. Sporting and artistic endeavors are encouraged through apprenticeships or grants to study under leading luminaries in their fields.

Darrians understand that not everyone can be a leader in their field. This is addressed by encouraging the study of multiple disciplines. Those who cross train in multiple fields are highly regarded, as workplace and social adaptability are vital. Many Darrian heroes were masters of multiple fields of study.

### PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE

Darrians, like all humans, work and play. Their jobs however, are necessary for the well-being of their society and for profit – they provide individuals with the basic means to pursue life and leisure.

The unusual aspect about Darrians is not their vocations but their avocations. Darrians enjoy recreation – leisure is important to their lives. Tourism is a major industry on most worlds of the Confederation, and most tourists come from within it.

Idle recreation is not the only leisure that Darrians partake in. They have a keen fascination and desire for knowledge, with libraries and computer databases standard utilities in every community. Darrian education fosters intellectual curiosity and provides training in posing logical questions and finding answers. Many Darrians develop an avocation for research. Each selects a broad subject or topic that interests them and will usually spend a lifetime studying that topic.

Darrian research is undertaken on two levels, primary and secondary. Primary research is undertaken in a preliminary fashion, exploring and recording theories and discoveries made by individuals or groups of researchers. It is recorded, published and peer reviewed as normal. Secondary research is an analysis of the findings of primary research. Scientists and casual scholars review primary research papers to find new discoveries or come to new conclusions not covered in the original works.

Secondary research is published on central information systems for others to review and analyse. Most Darrians have composed at least one analysis of existing research and published it electronically – if only as an exercise during their education. Some secondary researchers follow an area of interest for the rest of their lives, becoming experts in their fields, commenting on primary research as it appears and making correlations within the field.

Every secondary researcher in the Confederation dreams of making that one momentous discovery by taking two or more published pieces of primary research and drawing together wholly unexpected or previously unsuspected results. Darrians view secondary research as superior to primary research and a successful secondary researcher is a highly respected individual.

### TOLERANCE

The greatest strength of Darrian society is without doubt the ability to see issues from multiple points of view. This is not empathy as such but rather the ability to logically analyse a situation and extrapolate from this a decision. Their tolerance is an outcome of their pragmatic way of thinking, as intolerance invariably leads to conflict, wasted resources and often violence.

Darrians couple their cold reasoning with an often disarming sense of good humor. They take great pleasure in being tolerant and enjoy negotiations, knowing it more often leads to a constructive and efficient future.

Darrian tolerance is not unlimited however. Certain crimes, such as cruelty, assault, plagiarism and slander are punished ruthlessly. Non-Darrians who repeatedly offend, lie or break contracts are banned from the Confederation. Tolerant does not equate with stupid and many foreigners who travel to the Confederation to threaten, coerce or con citizens find themselves harshly treated.

Due to embracing the virtue of tolerance, Darrians are often viewed by other races as pacifists, institutionally unable and unwilling to fight or defend themselves or their territory. Those who act on this premise will quickly discover how erroneous that is. Threats from neighboring civilizations are initially addressed with negotiation and, if that is unsuccessful, they will attempt more subtle methods to avoid open warfare. If no other option remains, Darrians demonstrate a total social commitment to combat and prove their excellence is not just limited to intellectual pursuits.

### STOICISM

In their own eyes, Darrians have suffered a series of catastrophes, each greater than the last. Despite these setbacks, they have survived, endured, persevered and used their ill fortune to only grow stronger. Darrians have embraced the concept of weathering any calamity. No matter how bad the situation, how overwhelming the odds, Darrians accept that fate is often stacked against them and do not complain, instead always seeking a way to persevere.

This stoicism has led the Darrians to developing an innate foresight, always planning ahead to improve their likelihood of survival. For millennia, they have been creating caches of technology and knowledge against some unforeseen tragedy. Many still exist hidden away, waiting to be rediscovered.

### BELIEFS

Religion to Darrians is a matter of philosophy, a personal belief of divinities and the universe. All Darrians are free to worship or believe in whatever they choose, as long as it brings harm to no one and causes no inconvenience. The social functions that a religion is expected to perform, such as charity work, emotional support, youth assistance and counselling are all fulfilled by a number of associations and organizations unaffiliated with religion.

Most schools of philosophy are based on courtesy, open mindedness, rationality and respect for intelligence. Many have a wide following but the common societal approach of encouraging multiple and diverse views also prevents them from achieving political power. Most Darrians tend to make a distinction between an individuals' philosophy or religious beliefs and their political leaning; many philosophical teachers have large followers who subscribe to their views but do not form political power blocks.

The introduction of new races into the Confederation has naturally brought new philosophies and beliefs. These new ideas are not considered any less valid than those traditionally Darrian in origin. All are equally accepted as long as they adhere to freedom from harm and inconvenience; it is not unusual to find a wide variety of philosophies and faiths in any community, regardless of size.

### GOVERNMENT

While the member worlds of the Darrian Confederacy have their own governments, they all aspire to be egalitarian meritocracies. Any citizen, regardless of race, is capable of holding political office but, by and large, only the most skilled or knowledgeable are selected. Thus, a politician voted to the Ministry of Finance generally has an education founded on economic theory and practice, a wide body of publications, years of field work and is regarded as a leading professor of the field by their peers.

The political organization of the Confederation uses the following structure.

**Municipal Government:** One local officer is elected for every 1,000 citizens to oversee and represent his electorate. Local in this sense can be quite abstract, as the citizens may be residents of a densely packed city block or spread across a lightly populated continent. These officers become de facto leaders during non-
military catastrophes, if communication or social structure breaks down.

**Planetary Government:** Varies according to world.

**Confederation Government:** A collection of five bureaucracies, known as the Ministries, ruled by the Confederation Council.

The government of the Confederation is a loosely formed bureaucracy. The Confederation bureaucracy is broken up into five Ministries – The Ministry of Finance, Trade, Information, Defence and Confederation Appeals.

Unlike many worlds in the Imperium, Darrian bureaucracy is minimal, employing only a small fraction of the population. The rationale for Darrian bureaucratic efficiency is many-fold, but can be summarised as follows.

As a part of their upbringing and high standards of living, Darrians are inherently honest. They do not try to manipulate taxes or take advantage of the welfare system, knowing that to do so will undermine the system and there is little for them to gain. Most administrative tasks are based around self-declaration via centralised computer systems, each very easy to understand due to simplified, global regulations. Few staff members are required to interact with the populace in general.

From birth or acceptance of Darrian citizenship, all personal records and finances are stored electronically. While each planetary database ostensibly holds only the detailed records of its own population, they all share the exact same

structure and design. Crosschecking data on a citizen from another planet is a formality, merely requiring a delay of however long it takes for the next data update to arrive from that world. Citizens who anticipate a need to perform bureaucratic business offworld usually request copies of their records to be sent ahead before leaving.

The Confederation is a cashless society and accounts are indelibly linked to a citizen's biometric ID – all financial transactions are easily traced by the authorities and automated programs run checks within other records to detect fraudulent activity, such as welfare, employment and education databases to ensure no oversights or mistakes are made.

With most administration tasks being fulfilled by citizens themselves and doublechecked by software, what few bureaucratic staff remain are usually assigned the role of aiding politicians to adjudicate problems, revise old systems or manage work schedules. Most bureaucrats have no set responsibilities but are assigned to new ones once a project is completed. Bureaucratic staff are selected for their versatility, a good grounding in statistics, administration, data analysis and up to half a dozen other social, financial and natural sciences. Their task is not to be a better specialist than the elected politician but to convey to the politician the effects any policy will have on other areas of society and the environment.

During its climb back from the disaster of the Maghiz, the Darrians experimented with a number of different policies and interstellar structures, due to a series of egotistical ministers who believed their particular theories to be superior. Over the centuries, the Confederation has grown more homogenous and efficient. With the experience of different paths taken, more radical politicians never reach a position to be able to undermine the stability of the system. Despite that, there is still a wide variety of political and policy opinion throughout the Confederation. The current structure is not ossified and rigid – it still changes and adapts to new circumstances – and any changes are taken in a much more measured manner than in earlier days.

The Confederation government cannot technically interfere directly in the running of any member world. However, to become a member of the Confederation, each system must agree to a constitution that grants the basic rules and regulations of Darrian society to the population. All citizens must uphold these basic statutes but, if desired, the planetary government may impose directives in addition to the constitution, as long as they do not create conflicts. Likewise, municipal governments may impose further regulations specific to the local community.

DARRIAN SUBSECTOR

**SPINWARD MARCHES**

**MINISTRY OF FINANCE**
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for both the collection of taxes and assignment of the annual budget from collected monies. This task is made simpler due to the readily available banking records of both individuals and businesses. Taxes are automatically garnished from wages or business transactions. Additional revenue is gained from taxation of cargo both imported into and exported from the Confederation, as are non-
citizens visiting the worlds whether they are conducting business or merely tourists.

The number of taxes in the Confederation are few but applied to all. A sliding scale adjusts taxation rates to ensure those who earn more are taxed at a greater rate than those who earn less, ensuring no great hardship placed on the poorest. Anyone working in the Confederation, citizen and non-citizen alike, are required by law to be paid into a Darrian bank account where money can be traced. Many non-Darrian megacorporations sometimes pay their employees a second wage specifically sent into the Confederation, otherwise top executives would have their locally disproportionate wages severely taxed.

The Ministry also sets the minimum wage for different careers. Wages are weighted in terms of value towards society, personal danger and distastefulness of the work; sanitation engineers and military personnel have some of the highest pay rates in the Confederation. As a symbol of faith and loyalty to the Darrian people, politicians and bureaucrats are paid a salary equal to the average wage on their homeworld.

Since it is almost impossible to hide credit flow, Darrians are typically honest and Confederation taxes are relatively low compared to other polities. As a general guideline, income tax starts at a base of 10% of earnings beyond a tax-free allowance. Planetary taxes are in addition to this, and can vary according to the inclination of that world's government, but rarely exceeds the Confederation tax level. In addition, Travellers arriving at any Confederation port are subject to a Cr25 arrival tax. Hauled cargo is charged a Cr50 per ton transit fee when delivered to a starport, although speculative trade is only taxed at half the going rate, making the Confederation a lucrative market.

### MINISTRY OF TRADE

The Ministry of Trade is responsible for the flow of interstellar commerce between member worlds and the regulation of goods both entering and exiting the Confederation, also monitoring the numbers and having control over interstellar Travellers. They record all data concerning trade volume and publish statistics for business to use for analysis.

The secondary function of the Ministry of Trade is the maintenance of transport standards, starport infrastructure, and ensuring product quality, achieved by a combination of legislation and random inspections. In addition, the bureau employs customs officers who ensure all cargo entering or leaving each system is free of illicit materials or Darrian high technology artefacts. Darrian customs officials are carefully selected for politeness and good humor to avoid alienating foreign traders.

### MINISTRY OF INFORMATION

The Ministry of Information was created as a centralised system for recording the results of research and disseminating information to all who wish to use it. The Ministry of Information handles such diverse aspects as research studies, copyright registration, archival storage of all available information, publication of important data and statistics, and the establishment of standards for information transfer. The ministry maintains the Court of Information to hear complaints of inaccuracy or plagiarism, including charges of personal slander and libel as these too are misrepresentations of objective facts.

### MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

The Ministry of Defence controls the security of the Confederation as a whole. Economically, all Darrian worlds maintain their own defence forces but the Ministry of Defence sets minimum military requirements for each system. The majority of forces are kept on a reserve status. In the event of an emergency, units are activated and placed under the command of the Confederation. To supplement local forces, the Confederation also funds and trains its own core fleets and armed forces, the Confederation Navy and the Confederation Guard.

The ministry also controls a third force – the Special Arm. A small and highly select force, the Special Arm is responsible for the maintenance and deployment of the Star Trigger weapon system. Since the Star Trigger is the major deterrent preventing annexation of the Confederation by the Zhodani Consulate, the Special Arm is surrounded by a heavy layer of security and provided within its own fleet of advanced starships with which to deploy the weapon to other systems.

### MINISTRY OF CONFEDERATION APPEALS

The Ministry of Confederation Appeals is the supreme arbiter of disputes in the Darrian Confederation. It does not handle criminal cases, which are heard by the courts of individual worlds but hears civil cases that have already been tried and judged when an appeal to the ministry has been lodged. In addition, the ministry considers disputes between individual Confederation worlds and the Confederation government. Even systems whose militaries are greater than local Confederation forces comply with adverse rulings without complaint.

### CONFEDERATION COUNCIL

Sitting above the five Ministries is the Confederation Council, composed of one representative for each system in the Confederation, selected by the government of each system in whatever manner they deem appropriate. For example, the representative of Zamine (a balkanised world) is elected by the leadership of all nations of Zamine. The representative of Terant 340 (a charismatic dictatorship) is appointed by that world's dictator. Since Engrange is currently a colony of Ilium, it does not get a separate representative. Each representative is appointed for a term of four years and may be reappointed any number of times. The Confederation Council meets in weekly sessions.

The Council is nominally led by a President, representatives voting one of their cohort to take the role. The President sits a term of four years and then another vote is held. Unlike representatives, a President may not hold office for a contiguous term but may be voted into the position for other terms. The President of the Confederation Council acts as signatory of all legislation passed by the Council and has the deciding vote on tied matters.

The capital of the Confederation is Mire. The Confederation's bureaucracies are all based on Mire, as is the Confederation Council. Each Council member is accorded an office with supporting staff to handle details that must be dealt with by major political figures.

### LAW

While laws can vary between member worlds of the Darrian confederation, each is based on a set of decrees from the 20,000 year old Taledh Codes, which are a guide to correct living and forbid murder, theft, assault, slander and cruelty. Legal codes are also merely guidelines for judges, not rigidly defined laws, and therefore require

interpretation in the courts. Generally, Darrian law is based on the ethics of each case, rather than technical application of legislative loopholes or prior ruling.

Theoretically, there is no difference between criminal and civil law. Both harm society and are treated with equal severity. A plaintiff has two options when seeking justice – either taking the case to court or having it settled in arbitration. In practice, most criminal cases are taken to court, unless the crime is minor.

Arbitration requires a case to be brought before a scholar of philosophical law. Those involved enter a binding contract agreeing that they will abide by the decisions of the scholar regardless of outcome. Each individual may make their case in front of the scholar, taking no more than one hour to present what evidence or argument they have. The scholar then deliberates on the case before making their decision, deciding on any punishment or fine appropriate. The rulings of the arbitrator are final and cannot be overturned or appealed unless the scholar has been found to have acted in a criminal manner themselves.

Some of the judgments handed down by arbitration have been rather unusual, making the most popular scholars those with a sharp wit and sense of humor. For example, a landlord who brought their tenants to arbitration over failure to pay rent could have his property turned over to the tenants for unreasonable rental rates or for not keeping the property in a reasonable condition. A famous case involving the Minister of Finance suing the sanitation department for allowing a blockage in the sewerage system led to the Minister being ordered to clear the blockage by hand as it was their family members who had caused the blockage by disposing of unsuitable material in their toilets.

Arbitration is the normal form of seeking justice in Darrian society, due to the speed that judgements can be made but it cannot impose capital punishments or exile for serious crimes. For these a full court is required.

Courts require at least three government councillors

- or local officers on smaller worlds – to hear cases that may result in punishments such as imprisonment, exile or death. The plaintiff in most court cases is the government itself, either law enforcement or one of the Ministries. The court is presided over by a respected arbitration scholar of many years' experience, who first vets the case to ensure it is serious enough to warrant a full court. Government employed advocates are randomly selected to serve as either prosecution or defence. The case is limited to one day in which the prosecution and defence have equal time to present

their case. The witnessing councillors are given until the end of the following day to reach a unanimous guilty or not guilty verdict. If no unanimous decision is reached in this period, which can occur with large numbers of witnessing councillors, a vote is held and the majority opinion carried. The sentence is set by the scholar.

Court cases are held no more than once a week, and usually more intermittently, often leading to a backlog of cases to be heard.

Between the length of time waiting for a full court case or the sometimes 'random' nature of arbitration judgements, there is a third form of dealing with disputes. Private Settlement is the consensual agreement between individuals to prevent more serious penalties of a threatened arbitration or court hearing. In such cases, an 'eye for an eye' methodology is most commonly used instead of financial reimbursement or compensation, so the perpetrator of an injustice experiences what they have inflicted on the plaintiff. Such settlements are usually presided over by envoys that remain scrupulously neutral during negotiations.

**DARRIAN EXILE**
Exile is a form of punishment rarely seen outside the Confederation and one that fascinates sociologists from the Imperium. Its use is reserved for 'criminals' who transgress socially accepted codes of conduct but pose no direct threat of physical harm or potential sabotage. In general, those who refuse to willingly work within or contribute towards Darrian society are ejected from the care of that society.

Such offences can vary wildly and no rigid list exists. Consistently avoiding taxes, persistent public rudeness or avoiding an initial term of service in the military if dropping out of graduate education are all common causes of suffering exile. The effect of being exiled is the immediate freezing of the exile's bank accounts and computer access, followed by being ignored by those aware of the sentence. Lacking credit access soon makes life extremely difficult for an exile, being unable to buy food, pay rent or use public transport. More are forced to move into rural areas to live as scavengers until the sentence expires or they accept a one-way ticket out of the Confederation entirely.

The duration of exile can vary according to the severity of the misdemeanour. Minor transgressions last for a week or a month, enough time to show the exile they cannot survive long outside of society and it is better to conform to its modest requirements instead of trying to cheat or rebel against the system. More serious

transgressions such as large-scale theft or industrial negligence resulting in injury to others can result in a term of exile lasting years or decades. Only the most serious of crimes like treason or sedition results in being exiled for life.

Those sentenced to exile are completely outside the law and have no way to access social services. An exile can be mistreated with impunity, frequently being
'encouraged' to move on by local inhabitants who use an escalating series of methods ranging from politely ignoring the individual up to physical assault. Exiles considered to be a threat to property or life are at risk of serious injury as they are barred from hospitals and doctors, and cannot receive medical treatment. Most exiles are identifiable by their unkept appearance, poor hygiene and unhealthy greyish cast to their complexion.

Such sentencing seems inhumane to other cultures, even out of character with Darrian philosophical beliefs, but becoming exiled is considered an education. Those who serve their time in exile are welcomed back into society, their past misdeeds cleared by the purging experience. During their exile however, no aid or consideration can be extended to them, for fear of undermining the purpose of the punishment. Anyone caught aiding an exile is vulnerable to being charged with a criminal act, although this does not always prevent a subtle act of kindness now and then to help an exile survive their term.

Criminals psychologically predisposed to inflicting further serious crimes involving violence, destruction, murder or arson, are either incarcerated or executed instead of being exiled.

### SOCIAL SERVICES

Life within the Darrian confederation is extremely good compared with neighboring subsectors, due in part to the communal nature of Darrian culture providing extensive social services. Darrians support those willing to contribute to the whole and see the necessity of providing thorough educational and health services.

### EMPLOYMENT

Darrian employment is at almost 98.7%; jobs are readily available for those with the appropriate education. The employment rate is carefully maintained by government grants to set up new businesses or refurbish infrastructure. The biggest employers in the Confederation, besides ubiquitous service and manufacturing industries, are the innumerable research departments of the Confederation universities.

### WELFARE

While it is true that Darrians embrace the philosophy of Stoicism, they also understand the need to support those who suffer misfortune. Unproductive members of society are not tolerated, however, and those seeking support during extended unemployment are either assigned simple labour duties or drafted for another term in the military. Welfare is generous but has strict limits. Once exhausted, a citizen must maintain a job for an extended period of time before being eligible for welfare again.

### HEALTH

All citizens in the Confederation have full access to health care. Since most worlds have advanced medical technology, Darrians lead full, healthy lives until they reach advanced old age. Darrians, like many in the Imperium, have a deep-seated distrust of cybernetic replacements, mostly from how technology failed after the Maghiz. Most patients prefer biological replacement parts cloned from their own tissues, even to the point of travelling to another system to gain access to appropriate technology. Anagathics are not sponsored by the Confederation but governments of less densely populated worlds often ignore their importation.

### EMERGENCY SERVICES

Darrians maintain overly abundant emergency services for almost every conceivable eventuality. As well as more traditional fire and ambulance departments, specialized units cope with biological contamination, radiation spills, virulent pandemics and flood protection. By mutual consent, every world has enough shielded subterranean bunkers to shelter its civilians for six months in the case of planetary invasion or a repeat of the Maghiz.

### POLICE

Darrian police departments are somewhat smaller than their counterparts in the Imperium due to a significantly lower number of crimes per capita. Police are universally armed with stunners but rarely expect to use them. Officers are trained in psychology and act as on-the-spot councillors, often preventing the need for legal action to settle disputes or misunderstandings.

### EDUCATION

Darrian children begin education at the age of five and spend the next 13 years developing a broad base of learning. At 18 they leave school and must undertake either compulsory military service or continue advanced education in a university. Just over half choose to continue learning, leading to specialization in a specific subject.

### DRESS, ART AND ARCHITECTURE

Darrians like their clothing to be visually pleasant, often incorporating geometric designs and patterns. Formal wear is full sleeved tunics or robes with embroidered cuffs and lapels, belted at the waist and worn over trousers for men and skirts for women. Embroidered or bejewelled waistcoats are worn over the tunic for very formal occasions. Formal footwear is knee-length boots, decorated with further embroidery or complex pattern lacing. Casual wear tends towards sleeveless tunics with loose baggy slacks, allowing a greater degree of movement. Preferred informal footwear is sandals with distinctive cut-outs and straps.

Darrians do not tend to wear multiple layers unless it becomes seriously cold, relying on their metabolism to keep warm. They prefer lightweight fabrics, taking pleasure in a range of different textures from soft to silky. Comfort is preeminent. If forced by local conditions, hooded over-tunics are worn to prevent hypothermia but more practical clothing such as coats, gloves and hats are deemed too constricting and a sign of indolence.

They tend to avoid wearing jewellery except for social events. Instead, functional communication devices are incorporated into bracelets, rings or headbands, and personal computers built into ornate belts or bracers. Most also wear a wrist or ankle emergency rescue beacon if travelling away from civilization. Personal ornamentation is based more on how Darrians style their hair with length, beading and colouration being quite fanciful. Young Darrians usually have bold styles with plenty of sparkling adornment but as they age styles take on a more simplistic tone and a plain mullet or braid can grant an aura of gravitas.

Artists excel in almost every medium from music to floral arrangement and artwork is a major export of the Confederation. Aside from exceptional painters, composers, playwrights and authors, one particular art form reigns above all others – gravitic art.

The most famous and breath-taking gravitic art is flame sculpture. Originally developed on Daryen prior to the Maghiz, technicians stumbled upon the idea of shaping gas flames with gravitic generators. Their original objective was to design hyper efficient cutting torches but somebody took the idea further and used it to create company logos, constraining the flames into simple letters, akin to florescent signs. Artisans took this concept and generated exquisite three-dimensional images, from busts to full landscapes.

Flame sculptures have many forms. The earliest and arguably purest form is the static image, where the shape of the sculpture never changes, just flickering with internal flames. Most of these are of Darrians in classical poses or animals.

More complex sculptures add additional elements such as chemically tinted flames of unusual colours. The most advanced sculptures are dynamic – changing form between a series of images related to a common theme. The most complex morph constantly between thousands of geometric shapes. The best sculptures can mesmerise viewers with their ethereal beauty and are often used by psychiatrists to assist in relaxing patients.

Darrian flame sculptures are categorised according to the date they were crafted. The rarest are classed as Early Period, coming from before the Maghiz, and the Night Period after the Maghiz struck. With the formation of the Confederation comes the Neoclassical Period where technique and technology returned to common use and colour began to be added. The Modern Period sees the introduction of animation and reaches a new artistic pinnacle. Examples of Darrian flame sculptures have even been displayed in the capital of the Imperium.

Due to their rarity, few early sculptures are ever let out of the Confederation, as they are regarded as

treasures. Modern sculptures are often booby trapped by their creators, safely self-destructing on opening their workings to protect the secrets of construction. Although the technique has been reverse engineered by a few high-tech worlds, few artists outside the Confederation appear to have the finesse or talent to match the individual creativity and skill of the Darrians.

Flame sculptures are only one branch of gravity art, as the same principle can be used with a range of different mediums. Darrians have applied the same techniques to water, narcotic incense smoke and even falling snow and flower petals.

Darrian architecture has many similarities to their Aslan brethren. They prefer buildings with an organic feel to them. While straight walls are more practical, they are considered soulless and square architecture is avoided except for the construction of emergency shelters or technology caches where space must be used efficiently.

Favored building styles are circular, semi-circular, or oval shaped rooms and domed roofs, preferences harkening back to the time Darrians still lived in the Orchard Trees of their homeworld. Hundreds of thousands of years spent living in a symbiotic relationship with the trees has placed an almost instinctive feeling of security when surrounded by curved walls.

Similar to Aslan tradition, Darrian architects and engineers never construct the same building twice. Even mass produced, prefabricated housing is made distinctive and unique with the inclusion of random variables to each home as it is formed on the manufacturing line.

Buildings are surrounded by trees and gardens, landscaped to appear natural rather than designed. This predilection also extends inside homes and work environments, with modified plants growing up walls or across ceilings. When forced to build underground, subterranean dwellings have captured sunlight channelled to false windows or skylights and fresh air is wafted into rooms to complete the illusion of being on the surface.

Darrians dislike building cities with towering skyscrapers in the middle of an open landscape, preferring to build within forests and jungles. No building is permitted to extend more than a few meters above the canopy and paths connecting buildings weave organically between the native vegetation. Transport links and infrastructure are constructed in tunnels below ground so as not to spoil the natural environment.

Huge skyscrapers and archologies are built in more precipitous regions, where they can be excavated out of, or abutted against, natural cliffs or mountains. External appearance always compliments or mimics the local surroundings.

### RECREATION

Most Darrians find significant contentment in their work but they also like to relax and pursue other diversions. By far, the most common diversion is the pursuit of knowledge. Most continue to improve their education as an informal hobby, reading works on specializations that interest them. A few strive to make breakthroughs in their field or discover new interdisciplinary relationships by analysing published research of different fields. The thirst for knowledge and analysing new interdisciplinary relationships often colours conversation. Debates are held over scientific concepts more often than politics.

Travelling is the other major form of entertainment. Darrians love to travel and absorb new places, people and experiences. One of the biggest industries within the Confederation is tourism, both internally and out to the worlds of the Imperium.

The arts hold a significant place in Darrian recreation. Theatre and concerts are very popular since people like to witness the skill of live performances rather than the technical wizardry of polished, and most likely artificially tweaked, holovid recordings. Communal entertainment is another popular activity, such as singing and storytelling. Improvised theatre with audience participation is especially enjoyed and group dances are also favored.

Art exhibitions are highly appreciated for the skill of the artist and the emotive nature of some artworks. Darrians also gain a great deal of personal satisfaction in creating unique objects, whether clothing, flame sculptures or breeding unique varieties of plants and flowers.

Sport is somewhat a lesser form of recreation. Team sports are played for enjoyment, being one of the few areas of Darrian society where open competitiveness is actively encouraged, although good humor and sportsmanlike behaviour is always expected. Personal activities such as marathon running or mountain climbing are as much a spiritual as a physical exercise, allowing the Darrian to maintain fitness while clearing their mind at the same time.

### BUSINESS

Commerce and industry are the lifeblood of the Darrian Confederacy, linking member worlds together. Many Darrian corporations are generations old, having gradually grown and changed to fit the niche they fill. The conservative nature of Darrian society makes it difficult for new companies to become established on the interstellar level, although many Imperium corporations continue to slowly make their way into the Darrian markets. Recent instability and loss of the Entropic Worlds cluster has caused a number of established firms to fold, opening the field for newer enterprises.

Corporations are generally owned and run by families, which normally fill most executive positions. Where a franchise is extended to a new Confederation world, a local family is usually sealed to the owning family by marriage.

No exclusive concessions or monopolies are granted within the Confederation; all corporations are legally forced to compete on a level playing field. Those that reach interstellar status achieve success through talent and intelligent market analysis – corruption is relatively

unknown within Darrian society, although it is possible some organizations use external agents to manipulate markets in their favor.

The Confederation is small and wedged between two semi-hostile polities, so there are no Darrian megacorporations. This situation may change if their corporations begin to develop TL16 goods.

### THE MILITARY

The Confederation military is divided between colonial planetary forces and Confederation forces. Planetary forces are normally stationed on their world of origin but can be seconded to other planets to reinforce their strength during war or perform large scale military exercises.

There are three branches in the Confederation military

- Navy, Guard and Special Arm, all generally better trained and equipped than planetary forces. Darrians do not use mercenaries, as they do not trust their self-restraint or loyalty. The Confederation will accept aid from the Imperium, coordinating counter-invasion or espionage missions alongside Imperial Marines or special forces. The Confederation will also accept military aid in the form of a covert program that exchanges technological information with the Imperium in exchange for building capital ships too large for the most advanced Darrian shipyards to construct.

Darrians are not a war-loving race, nor do they glorify armed exchanges. Despite their reputation as pacifists, when offered no other option than to fight Darrians are coldly rational and focused on survival, making them implacable foes. They improve their odds by equipping forces with the best military technology they can design and the surgical application of the limited TL16–17 weaponry reserved for such situations. The Confederation packs a far larger punch than should be possible for a small polity. If pushed to all-out war, almost half of the population can be mobilised, ensuring enemy forces occupying their worlds suffer horrific losses.

**NAVAL ORGANISATION**
The navy is organised into two tiers; planetary and Confederation navies. Planetary navies patrol local systems with their main responsibilities being piracy suppression, search and rescue operations, and system defence. The Confederation Navy is responsible for exploration, border patrols and strategic defence of the Confederation as a whole. Although outnumbered by their planetary cohort, Confederation officers hold superior rank and are able to commandeer

local vessels during military or civil emergences, although they must have good reason or risk court-
martial after the event.

Planetary navies are financially supported by their home government, so smaller systems usually have fewer ships and may have running costs subsidized by the Confederation. Most colonial warships are TL13 cruisers and escorts handed down from the Confederation Navy, which is in the process of replacing older vessels with updated TL15 craft imported from the Imperium. System defence boats are universally TL15 vessels built in the Confederation. Taken together with their ancient TL16 vessels, the Darrians arguably have the most advanced navy in the Spinward Marches. Obsolete colonial assets are taken in by the Ministry of Defence in exchange for newer assets, gutted and transformed into vessels for a lightly armed tender fleet.

Most Darrian systems uphold unusually large squadrons due to recent hostilities in 1084 when the Entropic Worlds were annexed by the increasingly aggressive Sword Worlds. In addition, Darrian sociological analysts have predicted imminent direct conflict between the Zhodani Consulate and Imperium. Therefore, as part of rebuilding their losses from the Fourth Frontier War, the Confederation is preparing itself for the outbreak of another conflict. Whilst the lower population worlds cannot afford significant home fleets, those bordering the Sword Worlds are bolstered with elements of the Confederation Navy.

The Confederation fleet is based around a core of 24 advanced TL16 cruisers of various classes, 12 additional TL15 cruisers, 24 modern TL15 destroyers and a number of auxiliaries; generally obsolete vessels refitted as tenders, specialized SDB transporters and assault landing craft. These squadrons are mainly used to picket the Sword Worlds and Zhodani borders, and provide a strategic reserve in case of invasion.

The advanced TL16 cruisers were recovered in 390 from a naval cache dating from before the Maghiz. The ships boast prototype TL17 weaponry and defences but are currently irreplaceable. The Confederation rarely commits these vessels unless an overwhelming force can be mustered to guarantee their survival. They form three separate squadrons posted at several covert locations between stars – one near the Queron subsector, one near the Sword Worlds and the last held in reserve at an ultra-secret TL16 naval base.

Due to the necessity to protect these priceless capital ships, the main elements of the Confederation fleet on picket duty are Imperium-constructed cruisers supported by colonial escorts. These reserves frequently travel between member worlds to perform wargames or collect ships assigned to their squadron, providing crew with valuable tactical experience and sustaining inter-fleet cohesion.

### NAVAL TACTICS

Naval doctrine does not support the use of fighter craft, believing missiles are more stealthy, manoeuvrable and capable of being carried in far greater numbers. With its edge in sensor technology granting greater ECM capabilities, the Confederation encourages colonial squadrons to invest in missile-armed SDBs and covert missile pods to fill the gap.

Darrian marines are treated as a subdivision of the navy and not considered an independent military arm. They are used exclusively as ship boarding or counter-
boarding troops but never for orbital assault, which is the responsibility of specially trained units of the Confederation Guard.

### GUARD ORGANISATION

The Confederation Guard are a small cadre of highly trained brigades that specialise in advanced weaponry. They comprise mobile infantry and armor battalions, designed to support planetary militias, and jump troop battalions intended for planetary assault. All equipment is TL14–15, although rumors abound of a special forces brigade armed with TL16 weaponry. A disproportionate number of battalions in the Confederation Guard are formed of Aslan troops. There are no mixed species units, due to the specialized equipment that each race requires, but the two work well alongside each other with little intra-species tension.

The Confederation is rarely engaged in direct warfare, so the normal function of these troops is to provide training for militia forces or perform garrison duty on the few balkanised worlds of the Confederation. The recent annexation of the Entropic Worlds has caused Guard units to enter a higher state of readiness.

Each member world also provides its own militia brigades of light resistance units working in concert with a small core of standard infantry, air power and armor. Every citizen, on completing their basic education, is expected to serve a term in either the military or advanced studies, resulting in approximately 40% of the adult population possessing basic military

skills. While most resistance units are no match for professional infantry in direct combat, a world with almost half its population trained in guerrilla tactics poses significant problems to a potential invader.

### GUARD TACTICS

Guard doctrine supports an overall burnt earth strategy, destroying key choke points such as water, energy and transport infrastructure, points deliberately positioned in places that form natural killing zones. Each world government is responsible for building deep earth command posts, hidden ordnance dumps and food caches to supply long term resistance movements or survive planetary bombardment.

Heavy infantry train in hit and run tactics, preferring to enact lightning strikes and rolling retreats, but never remaining in a fixed position. The lighter militia units use similar tactics but concentrate on ambushes, guerrilla fighting and civic sabotage. Darrian resistance units cross-train with low technology weapons and methods to operate with little chance of detection by a technologically reliant invader.

When working together, the Guard and militia complement each other – Confederation troops retreating through militia ambushes, or vice versa, the militia deliberately triggering an overstrength response answered by prepared artillery or armor strikes. The refusal to dig in and hold territory has proven to be a great irritation to Sword Worlders during their recent hard fought conquest of the Entropic Worlds.

Despite the Darrians losing the Entropic Worlds, they were able to inflict disproportionate losses on Sword Worlds personnel and munitions. This was carefully orchestrated by Darrian Psych Warfare officers taking advantage of the Sword Worlders need for aggressive close combat. Darrians still maintain, 21 years later, a highly active resistance movement, intermittently contacted by covert communication. The ongoing sabotage and terrorism campaign has severely undermined Sword Worlds morale, causing the native populace to suffer severe reprisals that have done nothing but strengthen the resolve of the stoic Darrians, and driving planets into bottomless credit and manpower pits – a situation encouraged by the Ministry of Defence since it diverts resources as the Confederation plans its counterattack.

Darrian jump troops train intensively with Imperial Marines and are fully conversant with conventional planetary assault techniques. Rumors persist that the Confederation has several brigades of marines seconded from the Imperium at the Nosea naval base.

**SPECIAL ARM ORGANISATION**
The Special Arm branch has been expanded beyond its original responsibility of commanding the Star Trigger. It has now taken over several other key duties, including security for other highly classified projects and providing a counter espionage agency – performing all sensitive tasks inappropriate for the Confederation Guard. Their relatively small number of personnel includes elite special forces units occasionally deployed on missions outside the Confederation.

As part of their primary responsibility of manning the Star Trigger strategic defence, the Special Arm controls a number of non-military TL16 ships on which the devices are installed.

### LANGUAGE

As part of the natural tendency towards unification, the Darrians have a standard common language. Prior to the Maghiz, the Darrians had five separate languages in concurrent use, one from each basin of their homeworld. Only one, _te-zlodh_ , was specifically used for colonization protocols, since it had reached ascendency as the language that best expressed scientific and technological concepts. In an ironic stroke of fate, the majority of Maghiz survivors on Daryen were in the undersea cities in the Zlodh Basin where _te-zlodh_ was the primary language.

Modern _te-zlodh_ is known as _te-zapet_ , which translates as 'the home language'.

While _te-zlodh_ is spoken and understood on all Confederation worlds, it has gradually evolved specific vocabularies and dialects. It is possible to identify the planet a Darrian is from, and sometimes even the region, just from their accent or colloquialisms. Since many technical terminologies and slang are unique, identifying the profession of the speaker is potentially quite feasible.

After the arrival of the Solomani, _te-zlodh_ assimilated a huge number of words from Galanglic. A large portion of these were science-based but all sorts of odd phrases and concepts have muddied the language. Modern Solomani can often understand the occasional word in an overheard Darrian conversation. To encourage social tolerance, the majority of Darrians learn Galanglic and Trokh (Aslan) as secondary languages at school. The older Darrian basin languages are usually reserved for historians or those specialising as linguists.

Aslan citizens of the Confederation cling to Trokh among themselves but have increasingly turned to learning te-zapet in order to communicate clearly with Darrians, since the human palette cannot form the guttural sounds of the Aslan tongue. This reluctantly adopted linguistic flexibility helps greatly during trade or military maneuvers, when use of translators can be a hindrance.

### DARRIAN SCRIPT

Technically there are five original Darrian scripts, one for each of the basins that had independently developed its own writing system. The eventual supremacy of the Zlodh priesthood subsumed the peoples of other basins and forced them to adopt the script used by the scholarly priests while retaining their own language. The system uses a syllabary – symbols representing syllables, much like a shorthand script. The glyphs look like jagged squiggles, the simple flowing symbols fast to scrive, assuming they did not have to be carved. This written form is called yaser te-yulep – 'the old script'.

When the Solomani arrived and made their presence known, the Latin alphabet was introduced. Known as the rome te-yulep , 'the Roman script', it was introduced to ease linguistic difficulties faced by settlers. Although this alphabet grew in importance due to its ability to represent phonetic sounds of Solomani technical terminology unknown in te-zlodh , it did not replace the old script completely. Currently yaser te-yulep remains in use for legal documentation, classical literature, poetry and news feeds, where speed and efficiency of the syllabary allow for rapid reading. Scientific and educational documentation remain written in rome te-yulep. On Rorre, whose population adhere to a pre-Solomani way of life, the Latin alphabet is legally forbidden.

### ASLAN IN THE CONFEDERATION

The second most common race in the Confederation, the Aslan are a welcome addition. Their timely arrival prior to the First Frontier War swelled Confederation ranks and they valiantly travelled deep behind enemy lines to undertake raiding campaigns. In exchange for this service, the Darrians gave the Aslan the most valuable gift possible – land on established colonies.

Over the last five centuries, most Aslan settlements have slowly integrated into mainstream Darrian society, adopting greater levels of tolerance, monogamy, learning te-zlodh and even embracing concepts like lifelong study. To the Hierate, the Darrian inhatai have become barbarians. Only the Aslan of Roget have striven to preserve their traditional ways of duelling and honor – which is unfortunate for the Confederation,

### HUMANITI IN THE CONFEDERATION

There are few non-Darrian humans in the Confederation, as the original Solomani have long since been subsumed into the Darrian racial profile. Most humans who visit the Darrian subsector are either tourists travelling to see exotic worlds or scholars wishing to advance their studies by accessing Darrian libraries and universities.

The Confederation is such a haven for research that many professional scientists apply to immigrate. Darrian policy is reluctant to welcome destabilizing personalities or Imperium citizens with questionable records. Any application for immigration is carefully scrutinised for cultural compatibility and academic achievement before a request is sent to Imperial Security for thorough background vetting. Those who pass this long drawn-out process are warmly welcomed as new citizens.

A small number of other humans are granted long term residence visas, usually employees of non-Darrian corporations who have offices on Darrian worlds, interstellar journalists or foreign embassy staff. Those foreigners suspected of acting as spies or agents are submitted to light observation and tracking but no effort is made to stop them from making regular reports to their government or patron organization.

## DARRIAN HISTORY

Darrians, like other races, have a rich and colourful history. As a pre-space travel culture they dominated their world peacefully. They assimilated a refugee population of approximately 30,000 Solomani and raised their own culture from TL3 to TL10 in a matter of decades. With that running start, they further raised society from TL10 to TL16 in the next five centuries – higher than the Third Imperium has achieved with any dependability.

The Darrians devised the Star Trigger, a device for triggering solar flares, but during its first test it destabilized their own sun and shattered their civilization, dropping them back to the Stone Age. It took them nearly 1,000 years to regain the stars. The tales of Darrian civilization after the Star Trigger is one of heroic accomplishment.

The flares caused by the Star Trigger not only scalded their planet but destroyed every piece of electronic equipment in the system. In the ensuing years, the wavefront from the flares spread towards neighboring systems at relativistic speed. As it broke over each world, it destroyed the delicate electronic mechanisms that civilization relied upon. These worlds spent the next century re-establishing themselves and clawing their way back to the stars. By -350 they were back, exploring space within 30 parsecs of their homeworld, searching for valuable resources, trading with indigenous races and refining their own science.

**DARRIAN ORIGINS**
Three hundred thousand years ago, the Ancients visited Terra, probably several dozen times in the span of a decade. During the first visits, the Ancient scientists took samples of Terran life. For reasons still unclear, they then took sample groups of primitive humans. One of those samples are now called Darrians.

In all likelihood, the original Darrians were taken to an Ancients world for testing and evaluation. It is possible there was some co-mingling of the Darrians with other samples. Present day genetic tests, regardless of how advanced they are, provide little confirmation of which samples were mingled with which. After a time, the Darrians were taken to a world and deposited there.

Why the Darrian sample was taken from Terra and transported to a world in the Spinward Marches remains a mystery. Archaeological evidence suggests

a single Ancient – identified as Onsorik in Darrian mythology – supervised their transportation and took a fatherly disposition towards them, caring for their needs and protecting them from the dangers of the new world.

The original population was probably no more than 100 individuals in a tribal setting, presumably very similar to one from their original Terran home.

### THE ORCHARDS

The surface of Daryen is divided by long, high mountain ranges into five basins, each centered on a sea fed by rivers draining from the surrounding territory. On Daryen, the basins equate to continents. Within a few years, the original Darrians outgrew their small camp and Onsorik created five new communities – one for each basin.

The communities were intended to provide all essential needs of the humans on Daryen. Each basin offered a vast housing area and provided them with shelter, food and warmth.

At the center of each community was a vast Flame Pit, each surrounded by extensive Orchard Trees ideally adapted to human needs. A Flame Pit, approximately two kilometers in diameter, was a bed of coals fed from below by natural geothermal action. Natural gas flowed through it and produced characteristic yellow flames in the center, while long vertical seams of coal produced glowing embers the Darrians used for their home fires. Natural action slowly pushed up more coals from below where the Darrians could collect them.

Extending in a radius of approximately 10 kilometers, the Orchards surrounded the Flame Pit, providing both homes and food for the Darrians. Individual trees were spaced at intervals of 10 meters on rays extending from the central pit. The trees of the Orchards had semi-circular trunks, encompassing a width of approximately five meters. Inside, individual families made their homes and, as their numbers grew, they expanded to new trees, uniquely adapted to human use. Their fruit grew and ripened on the inside of the trunk, ready to be picked and eaten, and remaining unspoiled while still connected to a branch. Picking the fruit stimulated the tree to grow more. Uninhabited trees bore little fruit but once a family moved in the tree naturally grew more. The trunk of the tree protected those living within and natural waste of the humans provided fertiliser for the trees.

Each Orchard numbered about 250,000 trees. Theoretically, the Orchards could support a population of a million humans; in practice, over the course of the next 1,000 years, communities reached populations of about 100,000 and remained stable at that level.

The five communities, named Boyr, Zlodh, Nyadh, Rimb and Abh, were established shortly before the Ancients War began. Being virtually indistinguishable from the native forest, the Orchards avoided the bombings and planetary devastation characteristic of the Ancients'
battle tactics. Onsorick was either killed or fled. Left to their own devices, the primitive Darrians spent the next several thousand years in idyllic peace in their Orchards.

### EARLY DEVELOPMENT

Whether by design or accident, the Orchards provided a number of stimuli for the early Darrians. The Flame Pits made fire, which the Darrians used to keep warm and cook food. The fruit produced by the Orchards tasted better when cooked. Water was not directly provided by the trees, so the Darrians had to venture out if the stored water was exhausted. Collected water provided the impetus to make vessels to carry it back to their homes. The Darrians learned to build tools and this led naturally to the development of irrigation, bringing water directly to their homes. While fruit from the Orchard Trees provided all the nourishment that Darrians required, it was boring fare. They wanted more variety and so learned to hunt animals that lived within the Orchards. As the native animals learned to avoid the hunters, Darrians travelled further afield to hunt but remained securely within the boundaries of their basins.

The fact that the Darrians lived for so long in such a densely populated area had profound repercussions on their genetic heritage. The Darrians weeded out those genetic factors that did not fit with dense populations. Troublemakers, neurotics, psychotics, sociopaths and others whose activities were aggravated by close, continuing proximity to others were naturally removed the population.

### FORCED EXPANSION

Between 80,000 and 100,000 years after the Ancients War, the Fire Pits began to fail. Flammable gases became intermittent, belching out noxious fumes and ash instead. Volcanic tubes below the surface began to cool and the replenishment of burning coals stopped. The Darrians knew how to make fire but the Orchard Trees suffered from the lack of geothermal heat that aided their lifecycle. The gradual dying off of trees led to terrible population strain on the Darrians, forcing them to move in an attempt

to find new Orchards. None were ever found but the Darrians' practicality and basic handcrafts allowed them to adapt to new environments, learning to create new shelters and preserve foods throughout the seasons.

The pits at Boyr and Nyadh ultimately burned out completely. The Rimb Orchard suffered a terrible plague born from bacterium brought to Daryen by the humans, which mutated into a deadly pathogen that swept through the settlement. Knowledge and society fractured. The sedentary Darrian civilization abandoned the Orchards and scattered across the basins.

Over the next 100,000 years the Darrians cycled through nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes and settled agriculture and animal herding. Populations swelled and then died back as the Darrians caused stress and collapse of the local ecosystems or suffered from newly mutated diseases. From each setback Darrian knowledge grew, permitting each recovery to be achieved at a faster rate.

Approximately 200,000 years after being removed from Terra, the Darrians finally developed the concepts of permanent housing and boats, leading to the settling of rivers and sea coasts. Water transport between settlements created trade and communication, seeing a level of cultural exchange not experienced since the days of the Orchards.

### THE RISE OF THE BASINS

The rise of permanent urbanization, supported by animal husbandry and rotational crop farming, brought with it sustainable population growth. Extensive settlement of available land led to exploration of the more hostile mountainous regions surrounding each basin. The mountains rose sharply, forcing pioneers to settle in the foothills due to the thinning atmosphere, making life at higher altitudes uncomfortable.

Years passed as the Darrians slowly extended their penetration into these areas, their bodies adapting to the thinner air. By the year -20,000 the people of the Southern Polar Abh Basin discovered a high-
altitude pass through the frozen peaks and into the neighboring Nyadh, Rimb and Boyr Basins. They discovered three independent cultures, each radically different from each other with unique languages, customs and traditions.

Initial contact was peaceful but fraught with fear and misunderstanding. Small embassies were followed by colonial attempts or militaristic expansions. The original exploratory missions devolved into raids

Darrian History

begetting further raids in reprisal. An age of discovery and sharing collapsed into an era of pointless wars. New routes through the mountains were sought, not for peaceful trade but to wage war.

Hostilities lasted for thousands of years, as conflicts rose and fell along with petty kingdoms that fuelled them. Not only soldiers crossed the mountain passes

- traders, philosophers and scholars also made the crossings during infrequent peaceful periods.

Circa -23,000 in the Boyr Basin, the philosopher-king Derir Lipit first formally stated the philosophical premise that shaped Darrian thought ever since – 'Every living thing has a right to live according to its own nature.' In the Nyadh Basin 1,000 years later, the hermit-philosopher Yikan Yikan declared the basic commandment – 'all living things must be allowed to live their lives'. The interpretation in Nyadh was an extreme one. Strict followers refused to take a life, ate only fruit, burned only wood from dead trees and wore only plant fibres or shorn wool. Interpretation in the Boyr Basin was more flexible.

Darrians were at the top of the food chain and accepted as a fact of life that animals needed to be killed for food to eat but the Boyr philosophy dictated that all creatures, animals included, be treated humanely. Values advanced and various philosophies evolved. Eventually the Rimb law-giver Notan Taledh distilled and combined the two philosophies into one – 'Animals live by predation but humans, because of their intelligence, live by production. Thus, a human who lives as a predator is living as an animal and not fulfilling their true nature as a human. Humans may use the lower animals for labour or for food but cruelty to them is not allowed. No human may prey upon another human.'

The great Taledh taught that rationality was the true nature of humans. Instinct and raw emotion are lesser, vestigial parts, which must not be allowed to take control. Darrian society is based upon this school of thought, tending to be even-tempered, lucid and difficult to alarm. They are not, however, self-repressive, instead freely able to express emotion as long as their expression does not cause offence or harm.

Taledh also created the first great code of Darrian laws, which were named in his honor. The _Taledh_ was comprised of three parts – the definition of crimes, the definition of punishments and moral guidance for determining the fitting punishment for each crime.

In defining crimes, Taledh considered any action or inaction that would or could cause harm to a living being as a crime. If the action or inaction could have caused harm but did not, it was an imaginary crime

and not subject to punishment. If an action or inaction did cause harm to a living being, then it was a crime subject to judgement and punishment in accordance to the crime. Furthermore, the punishment of a crime should be relative to the person who committed the crime – a richer person should be fined more than a poorer person, a stronger person made to suffer more than a weaker person.

### THE ZLODH EMPIRE

The ice-bound Zlodh Basin, surrounding the northern polar sea of Daryen, was the last to be opened by trans-mountain migrations. The first crossings took place in approximately -16,000 but major interactions with the equatorial basins of Nayadh, Rimb and Boyr did not begin until nearly 1,000 years later.

The center of the polar Zlodh Sea was a frozen cap but it was the largest ocean on the planet and the edges remained ice free year-round. Due to the harsher climate facing them, the inhabitants of the Zlodh Basin developed technology faster than other basins, eventually developing advanced sailing techniques to access their primary food source in the oceans. Innovative boat designs and crude navigation formed an extensive maritime trade network, laying the foundations for the first great Darrian civilization to develop on the shores of the Zlodh Sea – the Zlodh Empire.

The Zlodh Empire was founded on a scientific priesthood, responsible for the magnetic compasses, astronomic observances and meticulous records that made complicated marine navigation possible, allowing merchant voyages to travel vast distances without getting lost. The priests, through time, extended their power from the ocean to include authority over the land. The priesthood never ruled the empire directly but with their navigators vital to maintaining trade, stood as the power behind the throne. Emperors rose and fell as they found or lost favor with the priesthood.

The high priests treated science as real facts, and not just the works of whimsical gods, but restricted access to their knowledge from anybody outside their fraternity. With this rational approach and inquisitive minds, they were able to unlock the inner workings of many aspects of the world, resulting in practical weather prediction, higher mathematics and application of advanced naval techniques.

The scientific curiosity of the priests funded expeditions to the other basins, where they not only gained new knowledge but spread their scientific accomplishments. Seeing this as an opportunity to gain influence, the priests sent missionaries to share

Darrian History

minor knowledge with the inhabitants of other basins, increasing their status among them. The missions gained thousands of followers, allowing the priesthood to manipulate social beliefs with the intention of unifying the world under the empire.

Before they could achieve their goal, the priests belatedly realised they had inadvertently instigated a technological revolution. Faithful adherents had taken basic concepts taught them and extrapolated a plethora of new concepts and ideas. The empiric scientific approach and associated discoveries spread like wildfire, undermining the central authority the priests wished to maintain. Without the centralised structure the priests had built, the Zlodh Empire gradually fractured into a number of less authoritarian, petty kingdoms.

By -10,000, compasses, writing, printing, elemental dome construction and mathematics was available to all. The influence of the priesthood slowly ebbed and transformed into philosophical schools scattered across Daryen.

The intense intellectual curiosity of the Darrians led to thousands of years of studying their ecology and skies, although they had no great drive to conquer them. Understanding was far more important than control –
using their knowledge to predict seasonal changes to aid in farming, understanding the best herbs for medicine and practicing selective breeding to produce stronger and more resistant livestock. Whilst, botany, biology, mathematics and astronomy were valuable subjects to understand, the social sciences such as ethics, sociology and psychology continued to lead development.

By -1511, the Darrians had achieved unified peace. They had achieved a global TL3 and the theoretical aspects of some of their sciences reached as high as TL8–9.

### THE COMING OF THE SOLOMANI

Unknown to the Darrians, more than 100 parsecs away upheaval and war was taking place. The confrontation between the Ziru Sirka and Terran Confederation eventually led to the collapse of the First Imperium and the formation of its successor, the Rule of Man.

The Rule of Man was established in -2204 and collapsed in -1776. For the next 250 years, anarchy and chaos ruined interstellar trade and commerce, brought down old governments and raised new ones. Where they were able, refugees fled in search of new, previously untouched worlds.

The Solomani merchant corporation Itzin, originally founded in Turkey on Terra and later based on Dingir in the Solomani Rim, saw the oncoming collapse of interstellar trade and its owners decided to emigrate en masse to a new world and hide from the oncoming chaos. A select list of employees and their families were presented with the opportunity to leave with the company. Preparations were made and a fleet of transport ships assembled. Supplies, maps, charts and equipment were crated and stored, ready for departure.

In -1520, the Itzin fleet of 35 transports and 10 armed escorts departed from Dingir towards the Great Rift. The fleet travelled through Rule of Man territory to Vland, relying on written letters of transit when they were honored and armed conflict when they were not. After stopping at Vland in -1516 they ventured into the unknown, unsettled and unexplored territory of Corridor, Deneb and the Spinward Marches. In -1513, the fleet stopped temporarily at Sacnoth and from there mounted a fast survey of the sector. After finding several potential world sites, the Itzin leaders selected Daryen as their new home.

The Solomani came clandestinely to Daryen. The world was first surveyed from orbit, then a base located in an inaccessible area of the mountains at the junction of where Rimb, Boyr and Abh met. Once finished, the settlers relocated to the base and the ships were hidden in orbit. After a full analysis of the world and its people, the Solomani where ready to make themselves known.

In -1511, the people of the Itzin fleet appeared in the Rimb Basin. Their previous research had shown the Darrians where secular, so instead of appearing as sky gods, they made their presence known as ordinary terrestrial voyagers from a far-off land. To most, the Solomani were just another group of wandering Darrians, albeit rather short and stocky. It was the technology the arriving Solomani carried with them, their knowledge and equipment, that drew the Darrians'
attention. The Solomani freely traded equipment and knowledge, cementing lasting friendships and fortunes.

Using a combination of subtle dissemination and honest enthusiasm, the Darrians extracted whole new technological concepts from their offworld friends, gaining a broad new base of novel scientific concepts. Once the Solomani realised how quickly the Darrians embraced this new knowledge, the Izten leadership decided to enter into open partnership. The synergy between the fresh Darrian culture and strongly driven, more engineering and technology focused Solomani was explosive. The Darrians quickly adopted wholesale Solomani theories and engineering, exponentially accelerating their Tech Level and industrial base.

Darrian History

**THE DARRIAN SURGE**
Soon after revealing themselves to the Darrians the Solomani quickly integrated into their society, merging themselves into the mainstream of Darrian life and forming interracial marriages, which to everyone's surprise produced healthy children, although Darrian genes proved dominant. Darrians were hired to work for Solomani companies and, once native manufacturing capacity began to operate, Solomani became valued employees of Darrian companies.

The assimilation of the Solomani into Darrian society took approximately 100 years. The total number of Solomani arriving at Daryen was no more than 300,000. Their knowledge, expertise and experience where shared freely, benefiting both Darrians and Solomani alike. Once the Darrians mastered Solomani technology, they applied their own higher mathematical abilities to take them to their logical conclusions and began to make leaps beyond them.

By -1400 the Solomani of the Itzen fleet had been completely absorbed into the mainstream of Darrian society. All major leadership positions by this time were filled by individuals born on Daryen. At the crest of a technological renaissance, the decision to mothball the fleet was rescinded.

Operating from the formerly secret base in the mountains, the Itzen leadership sent an expedition to the mothballed ships in orbit. Immediately a problem was discovered –
110 years of inactivity had rendered the ships inoperable. Moreover, there was no longer a qualified cadre of trained starship operators; plans for using the stored vessels proved unworkable. Instead, the Darrians started over with existing and proven technology and theory, using the ships in orbit as examples. In 10 years, the Darrians had their first working design. In three decades, they had a fleet of scout vessels in operation.

Initial Darrian expeditions in -1395 to -1370 concentrated on worlds within the Darrian Group – Spume, Mire, Condria, Roget, Ilium, Rorre, Engrange, Edtron, Laberv and 494-908. Constrained by the jump-1 drives built for the first series of explorers, Darrian starfarers stayed within a few parsecs of their homeworld. By the end of this period the next generation of starships with jump-2 drives and increased fuel reserves were coming off the construction lines. Certain select ships within this class were equipped with jump-3 drives for even greater range.

By -1270, Darrian ships had explored the Spinward Marches to a radius of approximately 20 parsecs. In this time, the Marches had not yet been settled, so the region was uninhabited and open to future colonization. Initial exploration gradually gave way to in-depth scientific investigations.

### THE GOLDEN AGE

Pure scientific research remained a passion for Darrians. Whilst exploration teams explored surrounding systems, scientists were exploring all aspects of physics, gravitics, electronics, magnetism and radiation. Aided by their intuitive grasp of higher mathematics, advances were phenomenal. Their understanding of the universe grew in leaps and bounds. The advance of technology was also felt by the people of Daryen, the very character of Darrian life changing by increasing industrialization. For approximately 100 years, from -1400 to -1300, the quality of life declined as they become affected by the growth of industry, resulting in a strong Darrian movement demanding respect for the individual worker.

For 50 years controversy continued as to how much consideration an employer owed their employees. By
-1250, society had generally accepted the concept of a fair wage, reasonable working hours and a need to monitor the impact of technology on society.

The advance of Darrian civilization from TL3 to TL10 and beyond was not without complications. A nuclear power plant accident in the Rimb Basin contaminated hundreds of square kilometers of cropland. A second incident within weeks of the first resulted in a catastrophic meltdown, prompting rapid research into radioactive clean up techniques. Natural outgrowths of emerging technologies during the same time were also felt on Daryen – toxic waste contamination, unforeseen biological and cultural effects of drugs and chemical driven changes to the weather system. Many Darrians came to view the advance of technology as not necessarily a good thing, leading LoTech and Luddite groups to form.

These scattered organizations unified under the leadership of Ghorge Rorre with the intention of finding a new world that would not be contaminated with technology. They studied hundreds of scouting reports and decided on a world several parsecs away. Formal requests were made to begin an offworld colony. With no plans to start their own colonies, the basin governments granted consent, providing that prospective colonists funded and organised their own transport. Tens of thousands of Darrians pooled their resources, raising enough finances to manufacture several large cargo carriers. Loaded with colonists, the followers of Rorre left Daryen behind and settled the new world, which they named in his honor.

The new colony created a charter that included long-
term prohibitions against technology above TL3. Outside of the starport, where high technology was required to handle spacecraft, the colonists made the

Darrian History

collective decision to remain an agriculturally-based economy, emphasising preservation of the ecology and long-term societal stability. The cargo carriers continued to travel back and forth, bringing new colonists to Rorre and returning with exotic new produce to help fund their simple needs.

The lessons of environmental damage were not lost on those remaining on Daryen. Several new councils were formed to prevent ecological disaster, resulting in the building of an orbital infrastructure to remove hazardous manufacturing into space and utilising the resources of the solar system. Lacking several rare minerals, fleets composed of bulk carriers were loaded with cutting edge mining or refining equipment and transported to resource rich planets considered uninhabitable. Even today, signs of the vast Darrian strip mining operation on Debarre and the rusting remains of a gas refinery on Talchek can still be found.

### COLONIAL EXPANSION

Between -1250 and -1100 the Darrians thoroughly investigated the 11 worlds of the Darrian Group, establishing a number of residential research facilities to study the ecological or mineralogical resources available on each world. Such installations allowed the study of the psychological and physiological effects of long-term habitation on these planets. On the few worlds with no extant biosphere, experimental terraforming projects were set in motion.

During this time, the colony of Rorre finally established material independence from Daryen and the experiences of the colonists, faithfully recorded for scientists, were used to create guidelines for further colonization attempts. Hundreds of pioneers set out to begin constructing the infrastructure required for eventually self-sufficient colonies. As each new project neared completion, hundreds more colonists followed in transports filled with agricultural and other specialized equipment. Within a few decades most Darrian worlds were capable of feeding themselves but still reliant on Daryen for manufactured goods. The limited number of transports shuttled back and forth, packed with ever more colonists and goods.

### THE ULTIMATE DISASTER

In the 400 years since the arrival of the Solomani, Daryen had risen from a TL3 society to TL14. It was a natural belief among Darrians that they could easily push to TL22–23 in the next 400 years. Expeditions continued to visit and explore the hundreds of worlds

around the Darrian Group but the primary motivation was research. Everyone understood that the way to increase technology was through research and research was the primary focus of Darrian society.

In the ease of their advancement the Darrians become complacent, even arrogant in their rise. Their rush to master new forces and growing capabilities led them to begin experiments across a multitude of scientific disciplines, some of increasingly dubious nature. Darrians began to investigate antimatter production, bioengineering, artificial intelligence, psionics and the principles of matter teleportation. In approximately -1000 the now unified Daryen government began research into the life cycle of Tarnis, their rapidly spinning home star, gathering data. Expeditions to other systems in the Spinward Marches showed anomalies between theory and observed measurements of stellar output, causing scientists to worry about possible instabilities that might exist within Tarnis.

In -950 and -944 two parallel projects were created to define the internal mechanisms of Tarnis. The Abh Project (roughly translated as the Alpha Project)
operated from a base in the asteroid belt close to Tarnis. The Udh Project (Omega Project) was based at Zlodh University. The two projects developed separately. The Abh Project focused on physically delivering protected probes into the interior of Tarnis to telemeter data out. These scientists believed that large quantities of data would provide the answers that were needed. The Udh Project was more theoretical in nature. Its scientists used modern computers and newly discovered meson technology to remotely analyse the star to find patterns that would support theories of stellar lifetimes.

In -925, the Abh Project had completed the first of their heavily protected probes designed to survive the depths of Tranis while transmitting data for study. This first probe survived for a total of eight minutes and reached a depth of almost 18,000 kilometers before it was incinerated by the interior heat. In -924 a second probe with improved protection was launched, reaching an operating depth of 300,000 kilometers and transmitting data at a prodigious rate. The flow of data indicated increasing instability in the sun, centered on the probe. Before the decision could be made to turn off the device, a subsurface fulmination occurred, causing the star to blow off immense sheets of stellar material from its outer layer.

Darrian History

The first effects of the explosion were a series of gamma ray bursts of terrible power. Travelling at the speed of light, the radiation wave caused devastating EMP effects, fusing all electronic components as it spread out through the system. In space, every computerised device failed and powerlines shorted out in explosions, leaving crews of ships and stations to die of radiation sickness alone in the dark. Gravitic vehicles lost power and plummeted to the ground. Automated surface transports lost function and either ground to a halt or careened out of control. Computers lost memory – their processors melted into uselessness. Atmospheric communication channels were disrupted but as no devices remained operable to broadcast or receive, this was moot.

In a fraction of a second, a TL16 society was plunged into the Stone Age but worse was yet to come.

An extinction-level wavefront of expanding incandescent gas exploded from Tarnis, travelling at a little under nine million kilometers per hour and crossing the distance to Daryen in just under a day. The Darrians were unaware of their approaching doom and unable to prepare for it even if they were.

The superheated plasma struck Daryen like a blowtorch, buckling the planet's magnetic field. The ionised particles sheeted through the atmosphere, which was already weakened by the previous gamma ray burst, causing the whole sky to erupt with both auroras and titanic lightning bolts. Absorbing overwhelming quantities of energy, the upper layers of the atmosphere themselves exploded into plasma, irradiating everything on the surface with doses of soft x-rays and unfiltered UV radiation, blinding those unfortunate to be outside.

Darrian History

The surface temperature rose from 50o to 100oC in moments as the stratosphere struggled to radiate its heat. The oceans flash-boiled, sending gigatons of water vapour into the atmosphere that erupted into violent storms as vortices formed between hot plasma in the upper atmosphere and cooler lower air. Over the course of three days, cascading masses of stellar material continued to be ejected, striking Daryen several times more. Everything, save for a minuscule fraction of life, died.

The only remaining Darrians were those trapped in a few subterranean installations and the handful of submerged cities in the deepest parts of the Zlodh Ocean. The horrified survivors called the extinction event the Maghiz , the te-zlodh word for Chaos.

The hyper-flares did not stop at Daryen. They continued on throughout the system, devastating already functionless orbital manufacturing plants, drifting spaceships and a few outlying research outposts. In an unlikely chance of fate, the Abh Project station in the asteroid belt was located within a vast nickel-iron planetoid, heavily shielded to prevent stray signals interfering with sensitive equipment. The base, but not its surface communications or shuttles, survived the initial pulse. Nevertheless, the following flares caught most of the research team as they attempted repairs on both. The handful of survivors spent four years cannibalising remaining equipment to jury-
rig a single gig to take them back to the devastated nightmare on Daryen.

The gamma rays from Tarnis continued outwards into interstellar space, hitting each Darrian colony world in turn. Even with forewarning of 'Pulse Day', it was impossible to shield every piece of electronic equipment from the radiation wave – many colonies simply lacked the materials or machinery to construct enough protective cages. As it arrived in each system, electronic devices were powered down and earthed, but many still fried. Eventually, after nearly six parsecs, the wave front dissipated, unable to generate further EMP effect.

### NIGHT TIME

At the time of the Maghiz, colonies were still highly dependent upon Daryen as a source of knowledge, supply and interstellar transport. While some possessed a degree of manufacturing capability, they lacked the ability to produce microcircuitry, advanced pharmaceuticals or any number of advanced technologies required for a fully functional TL16 infrastructure. Nor did the colonies

maintain full databases of scientific information, each world possessing only a small subset of knowledge and whatever research materials their specialists brought with them. The idea that the homeworld could be destroyed had been inconceivable. No one had planned for it.

Over weeks, those transports fortunate enough to be outsystem when the Maghiz occurred jumped back to Daryen and discovered the devastation that had been wrought. Sensor officers scoured the world for signs of survivors and, by chance, re-established meson communications with the surviving Zlodh undersea cities, but realised they could provide no relief for the stricken citizens. The flash-heated surface of Daryen was now suffering violent storms and torrential rainfall from gigatons of condensing water vapour. Without hydrogen available to refuel them, the transports' own survival was in question until the arrival of a vessel capable of skimming fuel from the system's gas giants.

Faced with the harsh reality that almost all of Daryen's scientific community was annihilated and with no way to safely descend through the storms, the transports exchanged navigational data and returned to their homes.

For approximately two decades, Daryen and its colonies tried to continue with the barest communication and traded whatever surplus materials they had available. Rescue and relief missions were sent back to Daryen, with mixed successes. With few ships on hand and most useful equipment being hoarded against eventual failure, it soon became clear that it was not possible to continue as before.

In -905, all Daryen colonies agreed they would each have to make their own way. The remaining fleet of ships were divided equally amongst the colonies – who mothballed or cannibalised them for parts. All contact between the Darrian worlds ceased in -860. Between -860 and -275, the worlds of the Darrian Group devoted their efforts to survival. Stoicism was born during the hardships of this long night.

Overall, technology reverted back to pre-electronic levels. Most advanced equipment wore out and was discarded, the knowledge and infrastructure required to repair them long forgotten. Others were stored in museums, where they remained ready to rebuild each colony.

### REBUILDING THE CONFEDERATION

By -275, the colony of Mire had recovered to TL10, fully settling their world and exploiting its resources. A team of researchers investigated the museum-piece starships they had and realised they had the technology and industrial base to build new ones. After constructing a

Darrian History

The Sword Worlds Confederation

few jump-1 explorers, Mire re-established contact with other Darrian colonies, as well as Daryen itself, and began a new era of interstellar activity.

The rebuilt Darrian Group was led by Mire. Daryen, was still recovering ecologically so overlooked in the immediate post-Maghiz recovery. The homeworld responded slowly to contact and by the time it was participating fully, the power structure was fully established with Daryen relegated to the role of honored mother world without any real power.

**THE SWORD WORLDS**
When Darrians returned to space, the first thing they discovered was that they had neighbors. In
-399 Solomani colonists had arrived at an adjoining subsector and settled on Gram, approximately seven parsecs trailing of the Darrian Group.

When the original settlers of Gram arrived in the Spinward Marches, their cursory survey of the adjacent systems initially failed to detect the throwback Darrian civilizations. By the time the Darrians had been detected, the Sword Worlders – driven by their desire to create their own independent community – were fully occupied colonising their own subsector and settling the available worlds. By -200, the Sacnoth Dominate had been formed.

### THE ZHODANI

The Zhodani had been present in the Spinward Marches long before any other settlers. They had established a presence in the Chronor subsector in approximately -2500 and that region became the trailing border of the Consulate. It was just a matter of chance that the Darrian surveys did not reach far enough coreward to touch the Zhodani border and no Zhodani expeditions approached Darrian space between -1521 and -920.

It was not until -187 when a Zhodani exploratory trade mission encountered the Darrians. Trade with Zhodani proved to be a lucrative activity for the Darrians. Due to the Darrian adeptness at analysing and reproducing prototypes, the Zhodani found it profitable to buy refined and processed goods from Darrians rather than undertake refining and processing themselves.

After two decades of trade, the Darrians made a chance discovery; the Zhodani had been trading with the Sword Worlds for more than a century. It rapidly became apparent that the Zhodani had known of the devastated Darrian worlds but deliberately declined to lend assistance. Further, evidence mounted that the Zhodani had established observation posts to maintain surveillance on the Darrians.

The Darrians took offence, questioning why the Zhodani had not lent humanitarian aid. After analysis, it become clear that the Zhodani considered the Darrians a threat but at first nobody knew exactly why. Further investigation showed that no outside culture aside from the Ancients had been able to successfully do what the Darrians had achieved – trigger a stellar flare.

Darrian-Zhodani relations suffered a major setback, setting the tone for continued distrust between the two powers that continues to the present.

### THE THIRD IMPERIUM

Scouts from the Third Imperium eventually voyaged into the Spinward Marches and made first contact with the Sword Worlds in 53. As part of their spinward expeditions, the Imperial Scouts briefly visited Mire in 54 but no subsequent visits occurred due to another interminable outbreak of civil strife in the Sword Worlds. Recontact with the Sword Worlds was made in 73, forming new trade routes that briefly stabilized the region. The Darrians, still rebuilding their own civilization, were overlooked.

It was not until 148 that Imperial Scouts recontacted the Darrians, shortly after they had again renewed contact with the Sword Worlds. The return of the Imperium

Darrian History

marked a significant change in the nature of the Spinward Marches, which had previously been nothing more than just a few scattered polities. Development of the Marches began in earnest. Imperial settlements were established throughout the region and trade routes formalised.

Contact with the immense Third Imperium brought ready markets for goods and recourses. The Darrian Group, as an established and stable community of industrialised planets, was in an ideal position to support the Imperial cultivation of the Marches.

A natural rivalry with the Sword Worlds began as both communities vied for the same Imperial markets and contracts. The Darrian Group, smaller than the Sword Worlds, was more cohesive and manufactured better products. In addition, the Sword Worlds proved to be less stable politically, prompting preference for Darrian markets when long-term contracts were called for.

### THE FRONTIER WARS

The previous disasters that befell the Confederation led it to make preparations for unexpected calamities. The Darrians, once alone in the Spinward Marches, were now surrounded by other civilizations. Solomani refugees had colonized clusters of worlds and formed the Sword Worlds directly trailing the Darrians. Not only had they snatched prime real estate, the Sword Worlders proved to be aggressive traders, competent merchants and effective industrialists.

The size of the distrusted Zhodani Consulate coreward dictated that the Darrians could not defend themselves against the larger polity without outside assistance. To protect its interests, the Confederation entered the diplomatic arena.

The Darrian Confederation and the Sword Worlds traded warily and tentatively – their relationship was never satisfactory due to the contempt and hostility Sword Worlders held towards Darrian culture. At the same time, the two Confederations found themselves competing for the same external markets –
independent worlds within the Spinward Marches and systems along the Imperium's border. Taken together with the looming threat of the Consulate, the Darrians naturally searched for diplomatic means of neutralising its two natural adversaries. The only major power with the ability to achieve that was the Imperium.

For 800 years after it returned to the stars, the Darrian Confederation was content to pursue an independent course. Trade ties with the Imperium were inevitable but the Darrians maintained strict neutrality with regard

to military matters. In the 400s, Darrians began to see a need for greater military security within their sphere and so established the Special Arm and deployed the Star Trigger as a deterrent to aggression.

For the next 100 years there was an uneasy peace. The Zhodani and Sword Worlds made overtures to the Darrians, proposing alliances against the Imperium. The Darrians insisted on pursuing a neutral course and turned them down, then further reinforced their stance with a demonstration of the Star Trigger on a star near Stern-Stern. The Darrians explained that the Star Trigger could not be operated at full power, due to the damage it would cause to nearby systems, but the invited delegates were horrified to view the eruption of an unusually large solar flare, cementing the Confederation's desire to be left in peace.

The Darrians soon began to see that the Star Trigger was not the perfect deterrent they had hoped it would be. The threat of destroying whole star systems was enough to stop most aggression but it would not be enough if the entire region were engulfed in war. The threat of destabilizing stars might keep forces out of Darrian territory but it was unrealistic to assume the Star Trigger could be used to ban all warfare in the sector.

They were carefully attentive to defence planning throughout the 400s and 500s, and the uneasy peace in the Marches steadily deteriorated throughout the 500s. In 589, after a decade of increasingly belligerent border incidents, the Zhodani Consulate, in concert with the Vargr and the Sword Worlds, attacked the Imperium. The Darrian Confederation maintained its neutrality – it seemed the wisest course of action at the time. The Sword Worlds changed the situation dramatically. Before the war, there were several Sword World governments – when the war began, these governments united to create one ruling polity under the Sword Worlds Navy.

Mistaking neutrality for weakness, the Sword Worlds Navy invaded the strategically placed Entropic Worlds in 593 to capture a productive mining complex located there. That was enough to launch the Darrians into action and they mobilised their forces. Overtures to the Imperium produced a military alliance that pressured the Sword Worlds from two sides. The First Frontier War ended in 604, unfortunately without returning the Entropic Worlds to the Darrians. Peace however, was only an uneasy interlude. While the antagonists accepted an armistice, the Imperium itself faced a political crisis that plunged it into a civil war and the Darrians were helpless to watch as the Sword Worlds used Entrope as a dumping ground for political dissidents.

Darrian History

**THE ASLAN**
On the eve of the First Frontier War, amidst the massive military build-up, a new race arrived in Darrian space – an Aslan _ihatei_ fleet searching for new territories to claim. Seeing a golden opportunity to recruit allies to their cause, the Darrians requested aid.

Sensing a chance to win Sword World territories by force, the Aslan readily agreed, allying themselves with the Confederation. Aslan served alongside humans in Darrian troop units as well as in specially raised wholly Aslan mercenary companies, while spacers served aboard rapidly produced Darrian warships and on their own Aslan-built cruisers. Aslan in service to the

Confederation fought through the First Frontier War and maintained Darrian neutrality during the first half of the Imperial Civil War. They again fought with Darrians alongside Imperial forces against the Zhodani in the Second Frontier War. Aslan commerce raiders even ventured deep into Zhodani and Vargr territory to carry the war behind enemy lines.

Aslan loyalty was not bought with money but with the promise of the most valuable thing an Aslan male can possess – land of their own. When the First and Second Frontier Wars ended, Aslan troops and spacers were awarded vast grants of fallow territory on Daryen and other worlds within the Darrian Group. Their

### THE SECRET OF THE STAR TRIGGER

Of all the misleading cover stories that shield the Darrians, the Star Trigger is the most pervasive. The Confederation Council realised they needed a way to hold off an invasion from the larger and more powerful Zhodani Consulate. The Council's solution was to build a weapon that would act as the ultimate deterrent, one capable of causing another Maghiz. Yet, despite access to fragmented journal entries written by one of the surviving Abh team members in which personal notes about the probe had been made, the best scientists of the Confederation failed to replicate the effect.

Left with little choice, a small cadre of scientist used their advanced astronomical knowledge and sensors to precisely predict a major series of solar flares of an obscure star near Stern-Stern. A completely fake Star Trigger weapon was constructed and the Special Arm was formed to guard it and were trained in its use. Once preparations where complete, observers from the Zhodani Consulate, Imperium and Sword Worlds were invited to watch the carefully orchestrated demonstration. The ruse worked and the delegates were horrified by the results.

The Sword Worlders where not so easily fooled however, and doubted that the Darrians would have the courage to deploy such a weapon. Calling the Confederation's bluff, the Sword Worlders annexed the Entropic Worlds during the First Frontier War. After the cease fire, Zhodani analysis noted that the Star Trigger had not been deployed, despite it being obvious that such an action would have affected the Darrians' own systems as well.

Taking their lack of resolve as a sign of moral weakness, the Zhodani decided to penetrate Confederation space during the Second Frontier War. Alarmed, the Confederation Council ordered the deployment of the Star Trigger, completely unaware that it did not work. Faced with disaster, the handful of Special Arm agents privy to the truth were helpless to influence Council members, so they connived to briefly withdraw, allowing a small opportunity for Zhodani agents to detect the determination of the Confederation government. The ploy worked and the Zhodani incursion was rapidly recalled.

Over succeeding centuries, the Special Arm have carefully modified the light in which the Star Trigger is seen, turning it from the ultimate deterrent into a horrific genocidal weapon, capable of exterminating billions with a single application. Few in the upper echelons of the Confederation are now willing to suffer the moral consequences of using the Star Trigger, preferring more conventional methods instead.

Yet research has continued in developing a working Star Trigger. Scientists within the Special Arm are getting closer to discovering what precisely caused the Maghiz and the techniques required to create the Star Trigger.

Darrian History

service to the Confederation made them truly welcome in the years after the war and they integrated quickly into Darrian society as equals.

### RECENT HISTORY

Frustrated at the failure of the Imperium to return lost territory and the continued persecution of their people, the Darrians launched their own lightning strike in 788, successfully retaking the Entropic Worlds from the Sword Worlds. The aggressive action took the Imperium, Zhodani and especially the Sword Worlds by surprise, and caused the collapse of the unified Sword Worlds government.

With the Sword Worlds unable to organise retaliation, the Darrians made good use of the cessation of hostilities – decommissioning hundreds of gulags they found on Entrope and offering citizenship to any Sword Worlders who wished to change nationality. Funding new industrialization and infrastructure, the burgeoning populace began to turn Entrope from a frozen strip mine into a highly productive manufacturing world.

From 800 to 860, the Imperium undertook a series of psionic purges. While the Darrians were open-
minded regarding psionics, they subtly began to tone down the open use of them in order to maintain good relationships with their allies. The Psionic Suppressions drove many psions to seek asylum in the Confederation where they were covertly accepted and secreted on Rorre. While Imperial citizens believe the Darrians share their hatred for psionics, the higher echelons of the military and espionage services were aware of psionic enclaves within the Confederation but chose not to take issue with it.

In 848 the Sword Worlds government again collapsed, leading to four years of anarchy. The collapse was welcomed by most Darrians but political scientists feared this would eventually lead to a stronger, more authoritarian government. Their fears proved to be accurate with the formation of the Sword Worlds Confederation. To their relief however, the new central government were not able to re-establish a joint fleet.

The Darrian Confederation was not directly attacked during the Third Frontier War (979–986) but did send support elements to reinforce Imperial maneuvers. Fleet logistics revealed a technological lag in their military productivity, so after conclusion of hostilities, plans were set in motion to revitalise the Darrian manufacturing base, although a lack of funding to

construct new capital ship dockyards became an issue. The Imperium eventually offered to construct new classes of cruisers for the Darrians in return for the science behind any cutting-edge technological specifications incorporated in their construction.

With the terms agreed, the Darrians took advantage of the manufacturing infrastructure on Entrope to begin work on a series of modest commercial shipyards, together with a naval base to guard them. The plans were seen as provocative by the Sword Worlds, although they were impotent to intervene as the facilities slowly approached completion just two parsecs from their own forward military base in Hrunting.

The situation deteriorated further when the Imperium decided to build another naval base near Quar, which flanked Zhodani acquisitions in the Querion subsector. The Consulate protested such antagonism, fearing what might happen to the vulnerable spur if caught in a strategic pincer between two major fleet facilities. Seeing Quar as the more significant threat, the Zhodani staged a belligerent incident near the system that unintentionally led to the Fourth Frontier War.

Increasingly concerned by the nearly completed fleet facilities around Entrope, the Sword Worlds used the pretext of the Fourth Frontier War to launch an all-
out assault on the world, supported morally by their Zhodani allies. The surprise attack destroyed the base before its defences could be brought online. Flushed with success, the Sword Worlds fleet continued on to conquer the rest of the Entropic Worlds.

Suffering significant losses from the attack, the Darrian Navy was forced to withdraw from the Entropic Worlds, abandoning the outflanked penal colony on Torment in the process. Later reconnaissance revealed the penal installation to be empty, the fate of prisoners housed within unknown. Shortly afterwards, a spate of vicious pirate attacks was launched on merchant shipping and supply lines deep within the Confederation, which prevented a Darrian counterattack from relieving annexed worlds before peace was signed between the Imperium and the Zhodani.

The last 10 years has seen the arrival of the new generation of TL15 cruisers from the Imperium and the gradual build-up of Darrian forces in anticipation of further Zhodani or Sword Worlds aggression. The Confederation remains a close ally of the Imperium, although opinions are beginning to be voiced over Emperor Strephon's lack of effort or assistance in regaining the Entropic Worlds and the mistreatment of subjugated Darrian populations.

Darrian History

# DARRIAN TRAVELLERS

Darrians follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all creation and career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook._

### DARRIANS

Darrian Travellers have the following modifiers to their characteristics: STR-1, DEX+1, END-1, INT+1, EDU+1

**TRAITS**
Darrian Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Heightened Senses:** Darrians have slightly better hearing and vision than humans, granting DM+1 to any Recon or Survival check involving those senses

**Ozone Immunity:** Darrians are able to safely metabolise ozone due to a naturally occurring retrovirus present in their cells. Darrians take no damage from ozone poisoning.

**Temperature Resistance:** Darrians are somewhat resistant to heat and cold damage due to their variable metabolism. They suffer -1 less damage from extremes of temperature in their environment.

**STARTING AGE**
Darrian Travellers begin their careers at 18 standard years of age. At this point, they have the mandatory choices of entering university or joining one of the military branches. The first four year term must be spent completing this service before a Darrian is allowed to continue with another career.

**NAMES**
Every Darrian has three names; family name, birth name and taken name.

Family names are passed down from the father. They cannot be changed for any reason, not even for marriage into another family. They generally refer to an object or phenomenon in the natural world, ranging from animals or plants, to types of weather, stars or eclipses.

Birth names are granted exclusively by the mother and granted soon after birth due to superstition that the name moulds the child to be. These names normally describe a personal characteristic – either expressed or hoped to be expressed – or a type of flowering plant. The child is addressed and known by birth name until they reach the age of majority.

Taken names are what the youth chooses for themselves once they have graduated to adulthood (17 Daryen standard years), corresponding to 19.7 Imperial standard years. From this point on the Darrian is known by this name, usually based on something significant to the individual. It can literally be anything, from the name of an ancestor or great scientist, to a type of career or philosophical ideal. Often Solomani names are used but they will have been converted into Darrian form. Whatever is selected normally provides insight into the psyche of the Darrian and can be quite subtle and possess many levels of interpretation.

Some example common names are Geryen (explorer), Debhidh (David), Kim (Kim), Laris (writer), Miryem (Miriam), Peter (Peter), Rebhek (Rebecca), Rengil (equine-like animal), Rondigh (Roderick), Yander (Andrew) and Zben (Sven).

Only family members or close friends address a Darrian by their taken name only. Formal address, composed of the family name and taken name combined, is used by strangers, work companions or social services. The full three names are only ever used for legal documentation or civic records.

### TITLES

Darrians do not have titles in the sense of Imperial nobility, as such archaic feudal posturing is antithesis to an egalitarian society. Any Darrian granted an Imperial title cannot use it within the Confederation, as it holds no weight, but may use it at diplomatic functions where representatives of the Imperium may also be attending.

Darrians who make significant contributions to academia are recognized by their high SOC. These are often based on an administrative position at a university or by making important discoveries that furthered their field. Attaining such a title does not require a scholar to be well versed in scholarly skills – although it does help - but rather reflects the efforts made by the Darrian to support and further the course of knowledge as a whole by funding, voluntary teaching, revising historical data or even editorial work on research papers.

Most honorary titles are granted from the university attended during their education, in order to reflect well upon the institution. The number of titles granted however, is strictly controlled by the Ministry of Information.

Holders of official titles are treated with respect in Darrian society but gain few real benefits beyond that. Some titled scholars in administrative positions use their standing to find better funding or simply be promoted into more prestigious university or corporate posts.

**Darrian Titles**

### SOC

Title 10 Pedagogue 11 Preceptor 12 Adept 13 Doyen 14 Master 15 Savant

Intellectual achievements have their own titles. Any Traveller with EDU 10+ may request to be addressed as Professor. Those with EDU 12+ are addressed as Emeritus Professor.

**BACKGROUND SKILLS**
In addition to the 3+ EDU DM skills gained from background skills, a Darrian gains an additional Science 0 skill. This represents the more intense and broader base of study prevalent in Darrian society.

PRE-CAREER EDUCATION Darrians are required, for their first term, to choose to enlist in the military or continue with further education. Those who choose further education may use pre-
career education options from the _Traveller Core Rulebook,_ choosing university or military academy. Once they have graduated, they may continue in any career they choose, although many continue their studies as a Scholar.

### THE DRAFT

Darrians who fail to successfully enter pre-career education or the military for their first term will be forced to apply to the draft and be randomly sent to pre-
career education or one of the military services. After a Traveller's first term, if a Darrian fails to qualify for a career of their choice, they may enter the Wanderer career or apply to the draft again.

### CAREERS

Darrians lack a few careers common to other cultures –
namely Nobles, Rogues and Scouts. These professions either have no function in Darrian society or have atrophied from lack of application.

Agent: Darrians are, on the whole, law abiding citizens, so the public presence of law enforcement is minor. Behind the scenes however, the Confederation is a hive of foreign espionage activity, which the Darrians are hard pressed to restrict.

Entertainer: The range of Darrian arts is comprehensive, from the simplest songs and dances to epic historic poetry and the crafting of objects pleasing to the eye.

Envoy: Darrians have long used envoys to prevent unnecessary war and avoid disagreements from deteriorating into long feuds. They can be found at all levels of society, from the lowliest marriage councillors to the lofty heights of the Confederate government.

Guard: The Guard are the Confederation's heavy troops, who form regiments independent of home world. The Guard are generally equipped with the heaviest armor available, specialising in assault and fortification tactics. They train in conjunction with militia units so as to complement each other's strengths. The Guard are the functional equivalent of the Imperium's ground assault marines.

Merchant: Members of commercial enterprise, Darrian merchants crew ships of the large trading corporations or they may work as independent traders that carry chance cargos and passengers between worlds.

Militia: The militia are the home defence forces of each Darrian planet, specialising in guerrilla warfare, hit and run tactics and insurgency, leaving heavy combat to the Confederation Guard. Usually, militia forces are trained in primitive weaponry, deception and similar skills to make them nearly untraceable when blending in with local populations or attacking from ambush.

Navy: The Confederation Navy patrols space between its star systems. The navy has a responsibility to protect the Confederation against invasion and deter piracy by the lawless elements who cluster around Darrian borders. Primary of these threats are the Zhodani and Sword Worlds fleets against whom the Darrian Navy has clashed numerous times in the past.

Scholar: Knowledge and learning are almost an obsession amongst Darrians, something in their psyche driving them towards accumulating information, then analysing it with insatiable curiosity. Upon beginning adulthood, Darrians must decide whether to spend their first term serving in the military or continue higher education by entering a university. About half choose the path of learning. Despite only the first term being mandatory by law, many decide to continue a career in research, science or medicine.

Special Arm: The Special Arm is the mysterious third branch of the Darrian military – the secretive organization assigned to control and deploy the terrifying Star Trigger. Members of the Special Arm are occasionally seen travelling across the Confederation and have authority to commandeer ships to act as couriers or perform missions vital to Confederation security. More notable is the fact that new discoveries

of pre-Maghiz technology are usually confiscated by the Special Arm, although sometime later artefacts are usually returned to the original discoverer or university for further analysis.

Worker: While most Darrians serve in some duty, the majority work in corporations, industries and civil authorities that run societies. Depending on the employer, work can range from waste recycling to legal secretariat duties, with both blue- and white-collar vocations.

Wanderer: Some Darrians move about the Confederation without putting down roots in any one place. Most are transient workers or simple nomads wishing to see every aspect of Darrian culture. A few are exiles, keeping one step ahead of their blackened reputations by hiding at the few foreign outposts in the Confederation, crewing non-Darrian ships or assuming fake identities. Wanderers generally travel between worlds by working for their passage on ships.

### AGING

Darrian aging is the same for standard humans in its onset but generally less severe. The first roll on the aging table is made after four terms of service at 34. Thereafter, it is checked every four years and half the number of the Traveller's terms served is applied as a negative DM to the roll.

### DARRIAN LIFE EVENTS

The Life Events of a Darrian are simar to those of humans. Use the Life Events table in the Traveller Core rulebook.

### MUSTERING OUT

Passage to other worlds are always at the equivalent of middle passage.

### OTHER CAREERS

Darrians living in the Imperium or other human-
dominated societies may use careers in the Traveller Core Rulebook instead. Most such individuals are exiles or children of exiles. However, many Darrians decide to leave the safety of the Confederation and seek their fortunes elsewhere. For example, while rare, it is not unknown for individual Darrians to join a branch of the Imperial military or civil administrations. This service is accepted by the Confederation, because of the experiences and different viewpoints that are brought back when they eventually return.

Individuals in this career wander from place-to-place and job-

Qualification: Automatic for Drifter and Nomad. One does not 'qualify' for Exile; you got exiled as a sentence for a crime you may or may not have committed. Travellers entering the Exile assignment lose SOC -2.

### LEAVING THE EXILE ASSIGNMENT A

Traveller may not normally leave or be ejected from the Exile assignment – not even Mishaps will force them to leave. Instead, they have a value called a Parole Threshold. At the end of each term in the Exile assignment, if the Traveller's advancement roll is greater than their Parole Threshold, it means their Exile has come to an end and they may leave this career to return to normal Darrian society. Otherwise, they may not leave this career and must either continue in it for another term, take a career in another area of space (such as the Imperium) or muster out and begin adventuring.

A Traveller's Parole Threshold starts at 1D+4. A Traveller's Parole Threshold can never go above 12. For each term a Traveller spends as an Exile, their Parole Threshold is reduced by -1.

### ASSIGNMENTS

Choose one of the following:
Drifter: You travel from system-to-system picking up temporary work such as asteroid mining, salvaging, engineering and so on. Your wanderlust prevents you from settling down in one specific job, despite the high level of diverse skills you have picked up. Exile: Thrown out of the world you were born on, by all rights you should be beyond the borders of the Confederation or lying dead from exposure and starvation somewhere. Yet there are some refuges in Darrian space and not all are heartless enough to allow an exile to die, granting you brief shelter in exchange for work before ushering you onwards. Nomad: You journey between the worlds of the Confederation, trying to absorb the many varied and wonderful cultures each colony has developed. Whether you are collecting material for a scholarly work or simply love meeting new people is up to you.

### CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE: DARRIAN

Darrian equipment ranges from the practical to odd high-tech novelties, all of which are sculpted with soft ergonomic curves. Like their Aslan citizens, Darrians like natural materials but do not tend to use them in the manufacture of equipment, instead preferring functional, hard wearing substances such as metals, which last longer.

All Darrian equipment is built to last, partly due to the severe lessons learned after the Maghiz and partly to conserve natural resources. Most devices are sold with a guarantee of several decades. Equipment that breaks is returned to the manufacturer for refurbishment or, if replacement parts are no longer available, a partially subsidized replacement.

This cultural bias has a significant effect on Darrian economics. The base cost of any device is extremely high when compared to its Imperium counterpart - often 150% to 200% more – with further income generated from servicing and repairs. However, the lifespan of a device is decades rather than a handful of years for Imperium equivalents. When viewed over time, Darrian goods are actually cheaper. Confederation exports, however, struggle to find a market in the rapid turnover, materialistic markets outside its own borders, save in the province of military or high-quality luxury items.

Since most Darrian goods have been extrapolated to the maximum possible utility of their Tech Level, there is little scope for 'improved' versions or new functionality. Instead, Darrians venerate age in their devices. The older an operable piece of equipment is, the more aesthetically valuable it becomes.

In the event that a new technological advancement is made, a plethora of new designs appear, taking advantage of the performance increase. For many products, however, there is little that science can do to better the basic purpose.

Equipment in this chapter with a cost listed as 'not available' cannot be found on the open market but may be available on the black market.

### PERSONAL PROTECTION

Armor is rarely seen on most Darrian worlds, its use generally reserved for militia or special armed police units. Most Darrians prefer the freedom to move quickly and with stealth, using natural cover. However, battlefield conditions often leave little option since secondary effects of some weapons require a sealed suit for protection. Of course, the Confederation manufactures their own high end combat armor and battle dress, rivalling the Imperium's own but incorporating slightly different tactical specifications.

Civilian armor is sometimes used in hostile roles, such as vacuum mining, or with exoskeletal support when Darrians visit worlds of uncomfortably high gravity.

Gel Suit: Primarily used for recreation such as vehicle racing or contact sports, the gel suit is a skin tight body glove, similar to a wetsuit. It comprises a reactive gel sandwiched between two layers of ballistic cloth. Violent impacts cause the gel to solidify, distributing the force of the blow across a wider surface. Although the suit permits full mobility, it momentarily hardens when blocking damage, reducing the wearer's initiative by -1 for each attack it blocks in a round. The cost includes separate gloves and hood.

Guard Armor: Issued to infantry forces of Darrian worlds, guard armor is designed for direct conflict but still versatile enough for guerrilla tactics. A combat armor equivalent, guard armor acts as a normal vacc suit against pressure and radiation but carries an improved camouflage system, using an advanced bio-engineered molecular surface, which mimics its surroundings. Attempts to detect the wearer suffer DM-4 to Recon checks in both the visible and infrared spectrum. The entire suit is powered by bio-
mechanical motion, such as breathing or walking, to prevent extraneous electrical signals. Although the armor is stripped of electronic components, it remains expensive due to the unique hydraulic and biochemical technologies used in its construction.

Guard Armor

Hostile M in ing Vacc suit

Gel Suit

CSC: Darrian

Hostile Mining Vacc Suit: Used for mining operations on worlds like Terant 340 and Spume, the hostile mining vacc suit protects its wearer from poisonous atmospheres, fragmenting rock, micro-meteors and radiation. It incorporates extended life support for 36 hours of continuous use, a powerful emergency beacon, atmosphere tester, chemical alarm and an integrated personal automedic (see page 32 of the Central Supply Catalogue ). Power is provided by a tiny radio-thermal fission pile with a lifespan of five years. The technology of the suit is kept simple for easy maintenance on less developed worlds. TL14: At TL14, the hostile mining vacc suit has a built-in Expert system (computer/3) and compact densitometer to aid mining operations.

Militia Armor: The munitions-grade armor of the Confederation is designed for skirmish forces on planets with breathable atmospheres. It does not act as a vacc suit but is designed to be lightweight and maintenance free. Formed from a composite of plastics and synthetic silks to minimise sensor profile, every set includes camouflage, infrared chameleon and an integral gas/breathing mask. Tens of thousands of sets of militia armor are stockpiled in armories on every populated planet in the Confederation.

Battle Dress: Darrian battle dress is more refined than Imperial designs, integrating many additional subsystems and replacing hydraulic amplification servos with simpler, more energy efficient and lighter electro-contractive muscle pseudo-tissue. Since most powered armor radiates all over the electromagnetic spectrum, Darrian battle dress does not attempt stealth but focuses on battlefield technological supremacy and survivability. It is the battle dress dreamed of by mercenaries everywhere but the price places it beyond all but elite unit budgets; it is so expensive that only Confederation Mobile Infantry are issued with it.

The basic rig has environmental protection that protects the battle dress from corrosive and insidious atmospheres for 72 hours. The hardened computer/6 is equipped with an Intelligent Interface, a suite of Expert/3 software including Tactics (military) 3 and an Intellect/3 agent that can take control of the rig if the wearer is incapacitated. All software is hardcoded into the crystal memory and physically isolated from communications, save for the transceiver function switch, to make hacking impossible. The computer is directly linked to the musculature of the suit so it can perform DEX-based skills.

The comms suite uses an advanced TL15 tactical relay network, relaying audio/visual, medical readings, equipment status, ammunition levels and sensor information. Comms data is scrambled, encrypted and transmitted via tight-beam maser, with laser and radio as backup systems. Communications can be shut down if necessary to avoid drawing fire from a technologically equivalent enemy.

Core functionality of the battle dress includes heavy weapons stabilization, grav assist, extended life support up to 72 hours, grenade launcher with a magazine of six grenades, gauss pistols in each arm and is self-sealing.

Module attachment points are built into the back of the suit, allowing it to specialise its function.

Similar to the retro-design provided to Confederation Guard Regiments, these advanced suits contain the same functionality but include personal meson comms, psionic shielding, a neural carbine, which replaces one of the gauss pistols, and life support is further extended to 144 hours.

### BATTLE DRESS MODIFICATIONS

Darrian battle dress is designed to mount mission specific modules in the form of backpack units. Only one module at a time can be attached although they have self-contained power systems. These modules uniformly weigh 15 kilograms each (3 kilograms when supported by armor) but have different configurations based on function.

Anti-Armor: Heavy support uses the FGMP (TL15) with similar internal firing mechanisms as the VRF gauss rifle.

Item TL Kg Cost Anti-Armor Module 15 15 Not Available

Anti-Personnel: The standard weapons unit is a VRF gauss rifle with backpack mounted ammunition storage, carrying the equivalent of 20 magazines. Due to the mitten-like armor of Darrian battle dress gauntlets, the gun has no external firing mechanism, relying instead on the suit's internal finger sensors as triggers or the onboard computer to fire.

Ite m TL Kg Cost Anti-Personnel Module 15 15 Not Available

Command: Command modules incorporate a comprehensive tactical relay network hub, allowing a commander to share benefits of their Tactics checks with a unit in communications range, and command-
assist computer software. This equipment provides DM+1 to all Tactics (military) checks. The transmitters and bulky battlefield C&C computers take up the entire available volume of the module.

Item TL Kg Cost Command Module 15 15 Not Available

Electronics Warfare: Provides ECM/ECCM coverage to jam or monitor enemy signals, filling the wavelengths with incomprehensible noise within a radius of 50 kilometers for radio communication and 5 kilometers for tight beam laser communication. The module also has a meson communicator capable of ranges up to 500 kilometers that cannot be jammed.

Air Suppression: An air defence module containing an advanced anti-missile laser system, which is tied into the suit's sensor system for target identification. This allows the Traveller to ignore all negative DMs incurred for attacking a fast moving target. The module is also equipped with a rocket pod or heavy rocket pod (see page 133 of the Central Supply Catalogue ).

### SURVIVAL GEAR

Darrians have a number of devices designed to enable them to survive on worlds outside the Confederation.

Exoskeleton: These ubiquitous devices are used by Darrians travelling to worlds with a Size of two or more above their homeworld, until their physiology can adapt. The exoskeleton supports their fragile bone structure against the rigours of higher gravity, providing additional strength to pick up objects that weigh more in higher gravity environments, adding STR+2 for the purposes of lifting objects only.

CSC: Darrian

Powered by synthetic electro-contracting muscles, the exoskeleton removes skill check penalties normally associated with operating on high-gravity worlds before acclimation. The exoskeleton also incorporates an integral medkit and communicator mounted on the thigh braces to monitor and treat the wearer if they start to suffer circulatory difficulties or dial for emergency aid in the event of serious injury.

Item TL Kg Cost Exoskeleton 10 10 Cr10000

**Pressure Respirator:** A respirator that allows the wearer to breathe on worlds with atmospheric pressures higher than their own. Most models come as a full-face mask connected to a large belt mounted pump, which lowers internal pressure and makes gas mixture changes required to keep the wearer comfortable. At TL9 the mask is resized to cover just the nose and mouth, with the pumping device minimised to the size of half a pack of cards. At TL11 the micro pumps and exhausts can be woven into a fine mesh net, either incorporated subtly into clothing or worn next to the skull – the air flow used to waft the wearer's hair in interesting patterns.

Item TL Kg Cost Pressure Respirator 8 10 Cr2000 Pressure Respirator 9 5 Cr1500 Pressure Respirator 11 — Cr800

ELECTRONICS
**Atmosphere Tester:** A hand-held device that monitors air breathability and quality. A simple readout indicates pressure (thin, dense and so forth)
and whether the air is within breathable parameters. An audible alarm and flashing warning indicate unbreathable or toxic gas mixes but the unit does not indicate what the hazard composition is.

Item TL Kg Cost Atmosphere Tester 7 — Cr300

Field Surveillance Radar: A field surveillance radar unit is designed to provide surveillance of open areas in conditions of limited visibility. It has a range of 500 meters and comes with a tripod mount. The unit detects moving objects of 0.1 litres volume or more and requires external power such as a generator or vehicle power plant to operate.

At TL11 the surveillance radar has a range of two kilometers and has its own internal power supply lasting 12 hours before recharge.

At TL13 range is increased to five kilometers and is a small hand-held unit with its own power supply lasting 24 hours.

Motion Sensor: A motion sensor detects any and all movement within an area it is assigned to. It cannot detect between different kinds of movement – it just reports whether there is movement or not in an area of roughly six meters diameter.

At TL9, the motion detector can report the general qualities of motion – size, speed and duration.

The Electronics (sensors) skill is not required to use a motion sensor to detect motion. When trying to interpret data from a TL9 motion sensor, this skill may be used.

### NBC

Combination Analysis Unit: A personal alarm that automatically monitors for radiation, biological and chemical threats, and gives both an alarm and an indication of severity (mild-moderate-high-severe-
extreme). The standard model does not indicate the specific threat but will inform the user if the hazard is radiation, biological or chemical. The advanced model will indicate the specific threat if known to the unit's database.

### ROBOTS

Few automatous robots are found in Darrian Space. Not only are they considered a potential risk without true self-aware AI to control them but Darrians have an ethos that celebrates physical labour as part of keeping a healthy mind. Except for mass production, few robots are employed as workers.

Sensor Drone: A floating platform that can hold a range of sensor equipment and is lightly armored to survive hostile environments. It is normally operated as a remote drone but can be ordered to follow specific mission profiles or flight plans. More advanced models with better programming and skill software can be specially ordered. The platform does not come equipped with any sensor packages, which must be purchased separately.

### MEDICAL SUPPLIES

The majority of Darrian drugs are grown directly from small herbs and bushes. A few plants containing mild pain killers and antacids are freely available for purchase, with detailed consumption guidelines. More dangerous drugs are strictly controlled, requiring specialized soil additives, specific light wavelengths or for the plant to be tailored to the patient's genetic profile. Darrian apothecaries usually comprise a small arboretum tended by botanical pharmacologists.

Medicines are sold in a variety of forms:
•  Leaves, applied to an area to naturally defuse medications into the skin.
•  Leaves or fruits to be chewed or consumed raw.
•  Bark or roots that are infused into hot liquid and then consumed.
•  Salves produced from sap and mixed with a natural base of correct viscosity.
•  Intravenous serum rendered from sap or infusions.

All drugs in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ and _Central Supply Catalogue_ up to TL14 are available in Darrian space at the listed price. Unless specifically loaded into a device for automated delivery, all medical supplies come in the form of plant material. Anagathics are not available at all off the shelf but can be specially imported.

**Lizard Juice:** Only a few intact ampoules of lizard juice have been discovered in pre-Maghiz Darrian research bases and were rapidly confiscated by the Special Arm for analysis. Consumed by an injured individual, the silvery liquid heals all damage at the rate of END DM+1 per hour. Moreover, the elixir remains in the patient's body, continuing to heal wounds for years after being taken. It can even regenerate missing non-vital organs at a rate of one kilogram of tissue per day.

Such wondrous effects come at a significant cost. The nutritional requirements of the imbiber increase dramatically when injured, inflicting an unceasing hunger. Amputations are particularly dangerous, since a patient who is not conscious can starve to death during the regrowing process as their body is cannibalised for energy and building material. Any ampoule of Lizard juice is effectively priceless but brings the attention of the Special Arm upon anyone rumored to possess or, worse still, have consumed it.

Item TL Kg Cost Lizard Juice 16 — Not Available

### PERSONAL AUGMENTATION

No augments are available with the Confederation, save perhaps on Lebev. The Darrians dislike any form of augmentation or genetic modification, seeing them as a crutch for those lacking discipline to master intellectual or physical skills. Prosthetics are also frowned upon, especially since replacement limbs and organs can be easily cloned and are available without cost to taxpaying citizens.

From their cultural perspective, other than laziness to learn, the only reason for augmentation is either criminal or espionage – neither of which are well regarded by Darrians.

### WEAPONS MELEE WEAPONS

Due to their fragile builds, Darrians in general avoid hand-to-hand combat. They practice unarmed combat mainly for self-discipline but lack a melee weapon philosophy. In military situations where stealth is paramount, the Darrian military are often trained with knives to kill quietly from ambush.

Primitive technology missile weapons such as bows or slings are favored by militia forces for their inability to be detected by sensor systems. Low-
speed projectiles are quiet and can often bypass motion detectors set to ignore rapidly moving animals or insects.

### PROJECTILE WEAPONS VRF

Gauss Rifle: A light support weapon designed for an antipersonnel role, VRF gauss rifles are normally mounted on vehicles or equipped as the primary armament of Darrian battle dress troops. The rifle is designed to conserve its 8-millimeter ammunition, preventing the release of more than 30 needles when used in auto-fire mode.

Neural Rifle: A weapon that incapacitates enemies by duplicating the Telepathic Assault talent (see page 199 of the Traveller Core Rulebook ). Armor is no defence and only artificial psionic shields or the Telepathic Shield talent blocks its effect. The weapon projects no visible beam or sound, making it near impossible to detect the attack. Only a few dozen of these rifles exist, issued to Special Arm elite forces on a mission-by-

# VEHICLES OF THE DARRIANS

Before the Maghiz, most Darrian transport was via grav vehicle. After the disaster, cruder forms of transport were briefly utilised. With their recovery, Darrians have once again embraced gravitics, this time incorporating wings and lifting surfaces to provide gliding capability in case of failure.

Ground vehicles are nearly unheard of – there being little or no surface infrastructure for them to run on. A few exceptions do exist but they are mainly recreational vehicles.

### NEW GRAV VEHICLE OPTIONS

The following new options are available for grav vehicles.

**LIFTING SURFACE**
Grav vehicles can be built with lifting surfaces that, in the event of a power failure, allow the vehicle to glide to the ground in the hopes of finding a safe landing area.

**Tech Level:** 8
**Cost per Space:** +Cr3000
**Shipping:** +25%

**VARIABLE LIFTING SURFACE**
Using a variety of high-tech options, the variable lifting surface not only deploys during a power failure to improve the chances of a safe landing but is able to reconfigure during flight to improve the aerodynamics of the grav vehicle, improving agility and speed.

**Tech Level:** 9
**Agility:** +1
**Cost per Space:** +Cr40000
**Speed:** +1 Speed Band
**Shipping:** +10%

### MONOCYCLE

This odd-looking form of transport resembles a circular disk standing on its edge, about two and half meters in diameter with a central faring bubble where the driver sits. The outer edge is a tire about 30 centimeters wide, formed from dozens of compartmental sections and rotated by hidden drive wheels around the circumference. The monocycle maintains upright stability with gyroscopes, which also allow it to lean into tight corners. Designed as an off-road vehicle, the size of the wheel combined with a suspension system which reactively increases or lowers the pressure of each tire segment, grants a smooth ride except over the most rugged terrain.

GRAV BIKE A common form of transport on Darrian worlds, grav bikes are fast and manoeuvrable. Fairings dynamically reshape to control aerodynamic flow and act as spoilers for slowing or rapid changes of direction. If a power failure occurs, the fairings return to a default wing configuration, allowing the grav bike to glide safely to the ground. Ejector seats are included for circumstances where no safe landing is possible. Grav bikes include life support for high altitude flying and are capable of reaching orbit.

### SPHERE TANK

Most Confederation tanks use a spherical configuration six meters across, granting them a reasonably effective deflection surface from all directions. They conform to Darrian military philosophy of stealth, speed and agility over brute power. Gauss guns are the preferred weapon over plasma or fusion due to their reduced EM signal and avoidance of secondary radiation and fire damage to the environment. Each sphere is horizontally segmented into three compartments, which can rotate independently of each other. The smaller top and bottom segments contain the sensors, antipersonnel and air defence weaponry. The middle compartment houses the crew, drive, power plant and main cannon. Crew compromises of a pilot, gunner and comms/sensor officer who also commands the tank. All crew are trained as engineer/mechanics on their own specific equipment.

The TL13 sphere tank is standard equipment for armored divisions of planetary militia, designed for rapid deployment or retreat and extended battlefield endurance.

### HIGH GUARD OF THE DARRIANS

Darrians have adopted Imperium protocols and conventions for their ships, to provide compatibility for Imperial traffic. Since the Darrians inherited jump technology from Solomani settlers, the basic principles of jump travel remain the same with their vessels.

### HULLS

Most Darrian vessels have a slight Solomani design influence, exhibiting sweeping curves and practical streamlining. Internally, vessels have higher ceilings but reclaim lost conduit space by hiding them behind curved mouldings where floor and ceilings meet walls. Rounded edges give the ships a slightly organic feel, as well as providing perfect surfaces for integral lighting units. The general feel of Darrian ships is that internal proportions are tall and narrow.

All controls are ergonomically styled for Darrian physiology but can be reconfigured to be useable by other humans and Aslan. Integral furnishings such as seats and beds are built for long torsos with ample leg room.

### REDUNDANCY

Most onboard systems are built with mechanical redundancy in mind. Bulkhead doors can be opened with hand operated cranks and air purification modules physically pumped, for example. Such redundant safety concerns are at the forefront of Darrian design principles.

In similar fashion, all electronics, communications and computers are hardened, using Darrian crystal components. Ships are required by law to install a separate, redundant radio communication system, which can be used even if the main comms systems have been destroyed. This is little more than a primitive radio with simple EMP proof components, which is negligible in terms of space and cost.

### COMPUTER INTERFACES

Darrian shipboard computers are all capable of verbal communication in te-zlodh , Trokh and Galanglic. Passenger entertainment suites are a separate computer system with no physical connection to the vessel's engineering, life support or flight computers. The communication and sensor computers are only accessible from the bridge or flight deck.

### STATEROOMS

Since Darrians are egalitarian and sociable by nature, there is little demand for high passage in the Confederation. Liners run by bigger corporations have a small selection of luxury staterooms for foreign visitors but public areas are not segregated by class or rank.

While the Darrians have no dedicated scout service, they still utilise scout vessels, primarily used by the military to keep tabs on neighboring fleet movement. The Lehnd scout is designed to be hidden and quiet, jumping into a system far beyond the normally patrolled routes and drift through using a black globe generator to hide its presence. The

globe is briefly lowered for a few seconds several times during its parabolic trip so sensors can take a snapshot of traffic. The objective is less about getting information but to retreat without being detected. The Lehnd uses drop tanks to jump into a system, leaving it enough fuel for another jump-3 without need to refuel.

The most common type of military scout, the Thengg is designed for sensor saturation, rather than stealth. Their tactical purpose is to jump into a system ahead of a fleet and either actively or passively scan for all possible threats. After collecting and processing the data, it tight beams this toward the pre-planned fleet arrival point or points, which are usually far from where the scout jumped in. The collated and

pre-analysed data gives arriving ships a head start in responding to the tactical situation. The Thengg is built for speed and survivability, lightly armed for situations where it is unable to escape engagement. To add mission flexibility, the scout can start a mission using drop tanks, allowing it to make rapid surveys in enemy strongholds before skipping home quickly with its internal fuel.

heavy punch while taking a serious beating. The ship has been over-engineered to allow it to lurk under water or deep in the atmosphere of gas giants, using the environment to shield it from sensors and weapons fire.

# THE GEONEE

The Geonee are a curious race whose belief that they are the descendants of the Ancients has influenced every decision they have ever made. When first encountered, the Geonee's possession of the jump drive shook the proud Vilani to the core. Their claims of being the Ancients' descendants and discovery of jump technology marked them as a Major Race, and one which could shape the face of interstellar politics.

All that changed when it was discovered the Geonee had copied their jump technology from a derelict Ancients vessel. The loss of status as a Major Race was a blow to the collective Geonee psyche from which they have never recovered. The Geonee reject the Minor Race label, adamant they had only reclaimed technology they had lost, but their objections have fallen upon deaf ears.

How other races view them is ultimately immaterial. The Geonee know that their ancestors once ruled a vast interstellar empire, and believe that it is their destiny to reclaim the stars as their birth right. Right now, they have no choice but to bow to the whims of the Third Imperium, but they are certain that it is only a matter of time before they once again become masters of their own destiny and, be it by military might or commercial domination, the stars will once again be theirs.

### PHYSIOLOGY

The Geonee are a human Minor Race and, as such, share many, if not most, physiological features found in other humans. They are fertile with most other humans and are endothermic mammals, who give birth to live young and produce milk to feed them.

They were planted on Shiwonee – a high-gravity, dense-atmosphere world with an axial tilt of 43o and orbital period of over 95 years – approximately 300,000 years ago, and have evolved traits that suit their environment. Typically, they average 1.50 meters tall and weigh 75 kg, presenting a rather short and stocky appearance compared to other humans. There is no appreciable difference in height and weight between males and females.

Skin tones range from fair to light brown, and they tan or burn when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Their hair ranges in shades of white, brown, and black, with red tones being almost unknown. Males are able to grow sparse beards and tend to have heavy brows and coarser features than females. Their features are generally thick with wide lips and noses.

Geonee have slightly shorter arms and legs than Terran humans, and their heads are slightly larger. These larger heads have led to increased difficulty in childbirth, meaning a greater number of birthing fatalities.

Geonee have a greater percentage of muscle tissue than other humans, making them exceptionally strong on worlds with lower gravity than that of their homeworld. They store very little subcutaneous fat and are therefore more susceptible to cold environments, though they store visceral fat as effectively as other humans. This leads to Geonee having a very 'muscular' appearance.

Internal differences in the Geonee are minor, but noticeable under inspection. Their hearts are proportionally larger than those of other humans, resisting high gravity and providing an adequate blood supply to the brain. Pulse rate is low, ranging from 40-60 beats per minute in healthy adults. While their hearts beat more slowly than those of other humans, a greater volume of blood is pumped with each heartbeat. Geonee also have a larger volume of blood in their bodies – approximately 40% to 60% greater than other humans – leading to significantly higher blood pressure.

The valves in Geonee veins are stronger than those of other humans, assisting in the prevention of blood pooling. Furthermore, muscle fibres surrounding veins constrict autonomously, further assisting in returning blood to the heart.

The diaphragm is somewhat weaker in Geonee, as less effort is required to draw in the dense atmosphere on Shiwonee. This makes them susceptible to 'altitude sickness' when exposed to less dense atmospheres which other human species might find comfortable. Despite this disadvantage, Geonee are able to adapt faster to most new environments.

Geonee possess an internal skeletal structure that has evolved to be naturally denser and stronger compared to those of other humans. A dense bone structure makes them less susceptible to fractures and breaks on worlds with gravity lower than their homeworld. Breaks on worlds with similar gravity to their homeworld are statistically similar to those of humans from other gravities. Geonee joints are protected by significantly thicker cartilage, leading them to remain limber in their home gravity far longer than other humans. Likewise, their ligaments are also significantly thicker to prevent excessive wear and tear in high gravity.

They have senses equivalent to those of other humans except for hearing. The denser atmosphere of Shiwonee carries sound so well that they developed hearing that is less sensitive.

### LIFESPAN

Geonee have a gestation period lasting for approximately 8.25 standard months, which corresponds to nine Shiwonee months. Births can be difficult due to the large heads of babies compared to hip size. The death of both mother and child was common in the past, but modern medical technology has largely alleviated this issue. Single offspring are the norm; multiple births are rare and limited to twins. There is no significant disparity between the number of male and female young birthed. Young are generally weaned at one and a half years old.

The young normally remain in the care of their parents until they reach the age of 18, when they are considered adults. Whether a young Geonee leaves the family unit at this point is usually a matter of circumstance and gender.

Geonee are considered to be in their prime from the ages of 18-50, after which they tend to age quickly, though even old Geonee can be surprisingly strong. The loss of mental faculties tends to inflict a higher cost on Geonee as they age, often leaving them in the care of their children or a nursing home as they lose the ability to care for themselves.

They have an average lifespan of 70 standard years, assuming access to modern medicines. Anagathics significantly lengthen this lifespan.

### DIET

Geonee are omnivorous, able to consume both plant and animal protein, but they have a natural preference for meat. Vegetarian and vegan lifestyles are almost unheard of. Most Geonee prefer meat to be lightly seared, with a minimum of seasoning; they find most spices to be distasteful. Common dishes are composed primarily of an animal protein, served with a small amount of similarly cooked vegetables and covered with a simple sauce flavored with herbs.

They do not enjoy sweet foods, preferring bitter or sour flavors.

### SOCIETY

While there is considerable cultural diversity among the Geonee, there are a number of customs and traditions that are common among them.

### CONSERVATIVISM

The Geonee are naturally a conservative people, finding great comfort in traditions passed down from antiquity and still practiced in the modern day. Tradition covers almost every aspect of Geonee life, and those who stray from conservative values are viewed in a suspicious light.

The tradition of conservativism can be traced to the harsh environment of Shiwonee, forcing the Geonee to adopt behaviours that maximised chances of survival, and deviation from those behaviours could prove detrimental to both individual and society. This has led to traditions being seen as the 'right' way to do things and going against tradition the 'wrong' way, reckless and foolhardy.

This sense of conservatism should not be confused with lack of ambition or innovation. The Geonee value both highly, but they must be bound by tradition and the right way of doing things.

### PATRIARCHY

Nothing shows this conservative nature better than the strictly patriarchal society exhibited on most Geonee worlds. In traditional Geonee society, only males may own property, conduct business, or enter politics; females have almost no rights. Every female must be under the protection of a male relative. In extreme cases, this protection extends to keeping females under lock and key, but this exclusion is more common on Shiwonee than other Geonee worlds where necessity often overcomes traditional values.

When not in the protective enclosure of the home, female Geonee are expected to be accompanied by a male relative, who serves to protect her both physically and morally. Women are forbidden to interact with unrelated men unless permission is first sought by the male from the woman's guardian. If permission is granted, it is expected that the male guardian remains present at all times to act as chaperone. Traditionally, an unrelated male will only interact with a woman through her guardian.

Every aspect of a woman's life is governed by her male protector, giving them little power in Geonee society except within the home. Women control all aspects of running a household, from controlling finances to making decisions that affect the household as a whole. They are provided the same educational opportunities as males, albeit normally via a combination of home-based and virtual learning. A well-educated woman is a great asset to her family, able to exert significant influence over male relatives to the point of controlling businesses or having political impact through advice and manipulation.

CHIRPERS A subspecies of Chirper is native to Shiwonee, sharing an almost symbiotic relationship with the Geonee. Called selweeda or 'matchmaker' in native Geonee, these Chirpers have been integrated into every aspect of society and taken to every Geonee-settled world. They are seen as something between pet and friend, and play an important role in Geonee marriage tradition.

When a Geonee male feels he is ready to marry, he must attract and befriend a Chirper, which then becomes a symbol of the marriage. Chirpers are by nature very shy, and have the psionic ability to become invisible in the minds of others in order to avoid being seen. Establishing a lasting relationship with a Chirper is therefore a considerable challenge.

To prepare for marriage, a Geonee male will build a small dwelling on his property suitable for a Chirper, and begin leaving fresh food, water, and whatever he thinks might attract a selweeda. By diligently caring for this abode, a Chirper may begin using the dwelling as a home. After much anxious waiting, and when the Chirper feels safe and comfortable with its Geonee benefactor, it may choose to reveal itself. After a few months the selweeda may be happy enough in its new home that the Geonee can perform a special ceremony known as a krandee, or 'calling out'. In this ceremony, the Geonee must convince the Chirper to reveal itself for a few seconds to its benefactor's closest relatives. Only after the selweeda has been seen by the Geonee's male relatives – his father, uncles, and brothers, can he then marry.

Logically, the selweeda could be seen at night while it was sleeping, as its natural ability to become invisible is not active, but this goes against Geonee tradition.

### SELWEEDA

The Chirpers on Geonee worlds belong to a distinct subspecies, which differ from those encountered elsewhere in Charted Space. They have unusually low intelligence, putting them on the boundary of dull sophonts and bright animals, are stronger than other Chirpers and have larger wingspans that allow them to fly in Shiwonee's dense atmosphere despite its high gravity.

Like other Chirpers, they possess limited psionic capabilities, especially the ability to become invisible to other beings when feeling endangered.

Invisibility: Chirpers have the natural psionic talent to make people lose track of them or to escape notice. A Traveller who knows there is someone or something nearby can make a Difficult (10+) Recon or INT check to focus for a few moments. The Traveller will be able to see any mind-clouding Chirpers for 1D rounds for every point of Effect or one round if the Effect is zero. Maximum range is Very Long.

Skills Athletics (dexterity) 1, Flight 1, Melee 0, Recon 2, Stealth 3, Survival 2 Attacks Claws (D3)
Traits Flyer (very slow), Psionic (6), Small (-1)
Behaviour Gatherer, Omnivore

After the krandee, the Geonee male and his male relatives are permitted to approach the male relatives of the woman he would like to marry, and make his intentions known. The decision to allow the woman to marry is based on many things, not least of which is his social position, ability to care for her, provide shelter, and career potential. If the head of the woman's household agrees to the union, an appropriate dowry is arranged, and the woman's male relatives are taken to the selweeda to witness the krandee. If all goes well, the dowry and woman are exchanged and the marriage sealed.

The Chirper's trust is seen as a crucial symbol of the marriage bond. Indeed, if the husband ever loses his Chirper's confidence to the point that it leaves him, the marriage is instantly dissolved. It makes no difference if the marriage is brand new or well established, if there are children or not, or whether the couple are themselves happy with the marriage. According to Geonee tradition, it is the presence of the selweeda which determines the validity of the marriage. In fact, the absence of the selweeda is the only way, other than death of a spouse, to dissolve a marriage.

Of course, the disappearance of the Chirper is seldom noticed by any other than its benefactor, given its ability to become invisible. Regardless, most Geonee take the relationship between selweeda and marriage very seriously. While this makes it easy for a disgruntled husband to divorce his wife (just abuse the Chirper a little), happily married men take extra care in keeping their selweeda satisfied.

For most male Geonee, this is simply a matter of providing good food and a comfortable abode. For those who travel the stars, the only way to guarantee a happy selweeda is to take the Chirper along. A Geonee will never entrust another to care for his selweeda, so the Chirper follows him wherever he travels.

**MARRIAGE BY CAPTURE**
An unusual custom is the ekrondee, or marriage by capture. Under some circumstances, a female may be abducted or 'captured' by a male by forcing a female's relatives to give her up in marriage. When this is attempted, it usually results in bloody violence, because it assumes the husband-to-be must be desperate, and such a capture brings great shame upon the female's family, though it does serve to bypass the need to befriend a selweeda as a precursor to marriage. This form of marriage is recognized in Geonee law, but is very different from the standard form; the woman is seen as chattel rather than a full wife.

This marriage can also be achieved when a family voluntarily gives up unmarried females. This can occur when there are no living male relatives, or the family finds it can no longer afford the upkeep of their single women. If there are living male relatives, they will put up a nominal display of protecting the women, as the shame of not being able to afford the upkeep the family's women is even greater than having them abducted.

Naturally, the existence of this does nothing to discourage Geonee men from overprotecting their female relatives.

### FAMILY

Geonee families normally consist of a married couple, their adult unmarried daughters, and any children below the age of adulthood. While a male Geonee may only be married to a single woman through krandee, there is no limit to the number of wives obtained via ekrandee. In fact, it is a matter of great pride to be able to afford to upkeep a large number of women, but having more than they are able to afford is a source of great shame. Therefore, a Geonee will undertake some forethought before he undertakes ekrandee.

The head of the family is the eldest married male, responsible for all other family members. The patriarch is the ultimate authority. His position is followed by his unmarried sons, in order of birth, followed by the sons' mother – if they are from krandee birth – his krandee wife, his ekrandee wives, and finally his daughters. It is unusual for there to be more than one married couple living in same household. Orders and demands of males are to be obeyed, unless countermanded by a male of greater authority.

A couple will normally only have one child, assuming a male child is born. Inheritance is only through male offspring, and having a male heir is of paramount importance to Geonee fathers. Despite this, a family will hesitate to produce more children than they can afford, to prevent the shame of having to give up unmarried woman due to financial hardship.

Offspring produced though ekrandee are viewed slightly differently to those conceived within krandee. Males are seen as legitimate sons, and enjoy treatment equal to any produced in krandee. They are fully entitled to a share of inheritance upon their father's death, though a son born of krandee marriage will always have seniority, regardless of order of birth, to those of ekrandee.

Females of ekrandee are seen as their mother is seen – little more than chattel. They are effectively illegitimate, and never treated as equal to daughters produced within krandee.

In the past, Geonee have been known to practice infanticide of female babies. This abhorrent tradition was encouraged by the value held for males, and the demands required in the caring for females. This practice was far more prevalent in poorer families, who could not afford to raise female children, and is largely condemned and outlawed by modern Geonee – though they bear no shame in it having occurred in the past.

While the practice of female infanticide is publicly scorned, it still occurs on the core Geonee worlds in rural areas and among fundamentalist traditionalists. The practice causes a great deal of strife because of the sexual imbalances that it creates. Unwed young males often become a source of instability in society, a situation that is exacerbated by the practice of polygamy.

Formal education is required by law, except for illegitimate daughters who are only allowed what education their father deems appropriate. Children begin schooling at the age of five. Boys are normally sent to a boarding institution and only visit the family on holidays. Girls are educated at home, either by their mother, a tutor, or via virtual classes. Education must continue until a child is 18, at which point they are considered adults. Young men are free to continue their education or begin pursuing a career. Young women are no longer required to be educated by law, but many fathers choose to continue their daughters' education to improve desirability for marriage.

Traditionally, men enter the same occupation as their father, seen as an indication of a son's respect for his father and continuation of the family heritage. Many occupations have remained within the same families for countless generations, and it is a matter of great pride to be in a trade with a long familial tradition.

In traditional Geonee societies, women are not permitted to work outside the home, but it is not unusual for them to practice some sort of craft or industry that brings more income into the family. Some of the finest crafts created by the Geonee are produced by women, who have passed down knowledge from mother to daughter for generations. Traditionally, money produced by these products belongs to the patriarch of the family, but it is not unusual for women to receive an allowance for their efforts.

Males are free to leave home once they have turned 18, but many remain in the family home until they marry. Women are only permitted to leave home once they have been married.

**NOMADISM**
Shiwonee is not only geologically unstable, but also exhibits several climate peculiarities. In effect, the entire temperate zone moves across the planet's surface, following a 95-year cycle. All native life has adapted to this cycle by adopting nomadic and migratory patterns, and the Geonee are no exception. Even in eras of high technology, entire Geonee cities move to follow climatic changes.

Nomadism is a key aspect of Geonee culture. In the past, they have preferred to form small communities that can be quickly packed up and moved. In the face of necessity, they swiftly abandon their estates – but not their property rights – and move to find more hospitable locations. This has led to wealthy Geonee owning a large number of traditional properties and estates scattered across the surface of the world, inhabited when the climate was favorable and then abandoned, only to return a century or more later to take up residence once again.

Geonee living off their homeworld are similarly rootless. They willingly move from world to world, following economic opportunities as they arise. As a result, Geonee can be found almost anywhere in the Imperium and beyond.

**COMMUNITY**
The patriarchal mindset of the family is mirrored in the greater Geonee community. The patriarch of an extended family is the oldest male relative directly related to any younger Geonee. Extended families can become quite large, and hence hold significant weight within the community. While a married man is the head of his own household, he will still treat any older married men in his extended family with great respect.

Each family is a member of a nomadic group, expected to follow the traditions of and work towards their group's success. Each belongs to a nation, each nation a world, and each world to the Geonee Cultural Region. A complex web of community interconnections exists. Each stratum of the community is expected to work for the betterment of the larger whole, and failure to do so is shameful.

Regardless of the governmental structure of a Geonee world, there exists a class structure which strongly effects those within. At the top of this are the traditional noble families whose members have access to the best

education, best jobs, and best products. It is not unusual, even in democratic governments, for political positions to be held by members of the nobility. The other classes regard the nobility as the best individuals to lead.

Below the noble class is the high class, consisting of wealthy business magnates and entrepreneurs. They have risen from the lower classes either through accident of birth and inheritance, or successful business ventures. They are the driving force behind Geonee technical innovation. Regardless of their wealth though, the poorest noble still outranks the wealthiest member of the high class.

Next is the middle class, comprising the vast majority of the Geonee. This is the class of the common worker. While the high class is seen as the drivers of innovation, it is the workers of the middle class who strive to bring the desires of the noble and high classes to fruition. They are the tradesmen, labourers, office workers, technicians, and myriad of other occupations required for a functioning community. Through hard work and luck, a member of the middle class is able to rise to the ranks of the high class.

Below this is the low class, consisting primarily of women, married and unmarried alike. No matter to which class a woman is married into, or who her father is, she will always remain a member of the low class. Within the low class though, are a series of strata which place some women above others. For example, the wife or daughter of a noble is of greater import than that of a middle-class lawyer, and the wife or daughter of a middle-class sewerage worker is of greater import than any member of lower classes.

The lowliest members of the low class consist of the daughters of women married through abduction. They are viewed as property of their husbands and fathers, but not without rights. They are legally entitled to be well treated, provided with food, clothing, and privacy. Some women of this class are lucky enough to enter into a krandee marriage and hence rise to a higher stratum in the low class, but the best most can expect is to be forced into ekrandee union.

Below even the low class, are the classless. They are the women who have no living male relatives to protect and provide for them. These women have nothing and are often forced to subsist by whatever means available. While protected by law from being assaulted or killed, many find themselves in unsavory situations. Geonee governments provide group homes for these women, where they are provided with the minimum of food, clothing, and protection.

### TECHNICAL MASTERY

The Geonee place great value on technology and technological skill. This has its origins in the difficult environment of their homeworld and its severe seismic activity. During early Geonee history, quakes and volcanoes caused frequent disasters, repeatedly forcing communities to start anew. As a result, the Geonee regard nature not as a friend, but a hostile force to be feared and controlled; technology is the means to conquer and dominate nature.

The Geonee enjoy experiencing technical devises at work and their aesthetic sense is closely attuned to elegant design and smooth functioning. When handed a clever device, a Geonee will react with amusement and delight. When viewing a large, efficiently work of engineering such as a dam, grav city, or starship, they will experience admiration and even awe.

This enjoyment of technology does not mean science and technology should be pursued for their own sake, rather they should have a definite purpose in society. Technology and science must provide practical solutions to everyday problems. As a result, the Geonee tend to produce technicians and engineers rather than theoretical scientists, sometimes posing a problem with the development of major scientific breakthroughs. While they are not devoid of the capacity for innovation, making existing systems work is far more emphasised than devising new technology.

### OWNERSHIP

The Geonee view the concept of ownership as fundamental to order in society. The value of an individual is directly related to his possessions and an indicator of his achievements. Conversely, everything must belong to somebody. Geonee are always the first to ask who owns a particular item.

This preoccupation with ownership should not be confused with egotism or greed. For Geonee, ownership creates an order, allowing society to prosper and giving individuals concrete objectives. Ownership offers a sense of purpose.

Nearly every facet of society is related to this basic trait, which in turn influences the way society is conceived. To Geonee, the most critical function of government is to create a basic framework to ensure property rights. The objective of law is to protect ownership. This underpinning prevents the emergence of chaos and allows society to prosper and grow upon solid foundations. Businesses are viewed as the mechanism which allows ownership to change, thus avoiding stagnation.

### PRIDE

Pride and self-image are inexorably tied to group membership. Geonee feel a sense of belonging to their race, social class, profession, nomad group, and to any other group they identify with. This pride gives value to individual actions.

In Geonee society, an individual's position is tied directly to the position of the groups they belong to; an inferior group must be composed of inferior individuals. Thus, every Geonee constantly strives to demonstrate the superiority of their profession, their planet, their race.

### PSIONIC TOLERANCE

The Geonee have always been very tolerant of psionic abilities, which is not surprising considering the close, almost symbiotic relationship they share with the selweeda. While their chance of being psionic is the same as most other humans, Geonee have always celebrated psionic abilities when found among their own people. Psionic institutes were once found on many Geonee populated worlds, and the Shiwonee Psionic Institute was recognized as one of the best in the Imperium.

This attitude caused significant friction between the Geonee and the Imperium during the Psionic Suppressions of the late 700s. The Geonee at first considered the claims of the Office of the Emperor and Intelligence Agency of psionic operatives working to weaken the Imperium as only being relevant in the Spinward Marches – they believed the claims had no merit in the Massilia sector.

When evidence of Zhodani funding psionic institutes was made public, a panic swept over the Imperium. Psionic witch hunts were reported on hundreds of worlds, and public opinion of psionically talented individuals soured. The Geonee core worlds could not turn a blind eye this change.

The Meeralo Council made a public show of closing down Geonee psionic institutes and sent all psionically talented individuals to internment camps, strongly advising all other Geonee core worlds do the same. Naturally, this caused an uproar among the population, just as the Council knew it would. The public on all core worlds rallied in mass protests against the treatment of the psionically gifted. The Meeralo Council mobilised the army to contain the protests and military action provoked riots among the protesters, which caused the Council to respond with issuing martial law to contain the violence. From the outside, it appeared the Geonee were acting in good faith to put an end to the 'psionic scourge'.

Behind the scenes though, the Meeralo Council used the unrest to remove psionic institutes from public view and into clandestine operation. Secretly, word was sent out to far flung colonies that safety from the psionic persecutions could be found in the Geonee Cultural Region. Word continued to be spread by Geonee traders far from the core worlds. Gradually, underground 'railroads' sprung up all across the Imperium, taking psions to Geonee worlds where they could be hidden and trained safely.

The riots on Geonee worlds were eventually quelled, and most of those arrested found their charges quietly dropped. Those who did go to trial and found guilty were issued remarkably lenient sentences.

The institutes were no more, and the use of psionics outlawed. The Geonee were seen to follow the Imperium norm, with none being the wiser to the truth. The Imperium find the Geonee lackadaisical approach to the threat psionics pose to be something of a worry, commenting on the tolerance the Geonee show towards Chirpers living so openly among them. The Geonee just shrug and reply it is their tradition, and Shiwonee Chirpers are little more than animals, so how could they possibly be Zhodani spies?

**BELIEFS**
The Geonee do not view themselves as human, and reject the usual taxonomic classification of Homo sapiens geonesis. Rather, they firmly believe themselves to be the Ancients. In some Geonee, this belief reaches an almost zealous belief. In others, it is simply an irrefutable fact which the rest of the galaxy has no choice but to ultimately accept.

In their own language, the word geonee means 'old ones'. The singular, adonee, is seldom used to refer to an individual member of the race, and can be construed as an insult when spoken by another, serving to isolate the individual from the group, and hence their sense of self-worth. Instead, a Geonee will refer to themselves as Geonee-draveera or 'descendant of the old ones.'

They believe their ancestors came from the stars after a cataclysmic galactic war. 'Official' history claims the core Geonee worlds have been inhabited ever since the Final War, when their ancestors sought refuge.

According to Geonee, their ancestors possessed god-like technology and uplifted several species to sophont status, including the Vilani and Solomani. These species formed the basis for Humaniti. The Geonee also believe their ancestors uplifted Chirpers into Droyne and distributed them across the galaxy. The Vargr are another example of their ancestor's experiments.

These claims have found little support among independent scholars. However, some surprising facts have to be taken into account. All of the Geonee core systems have extensive asteroid belts, which arguably have their origin in the Final War. There are numerous Ancients sites in these systems, which include facilities obviously built with the Geonee in mind. Lastly, Geonee technology throughout history has been among the most advanced known.

The Geonee consider themselves to be a Major Race, equal in prestige and importance with the Solomani, Vilani, and Zhodani. Other races, and the Third Imperium as a whole, dispute this, since the Geonee gained their jump technology by reverse engineering an Ancients derelict. The Geonee response to this claim is the ship they gained the technology from belonged to their own ancestors.

Organised religion among the Geonee is rarely followed. There are examples of a form of ancestor veneration among some, a holdover from the primitive belief of the god-status of their Ancients forebears. This is more of a personal affair rather than organised religion, and generally considered an unsophisticated view to have in the light of modern science. Little is known of this veneration among outsiders, as it is rarely spoken of, and considered something of an embarrassment that such a technologically advanced race could still hold beliefs in supernatural gods.

### BREAKING WITH TRADITION

The origins of Geonee traditional values, particularly the control of females and enforcement of strict gender roles, has been attributed to many factors. Perhaps first and foremost are the conditions of the Geonee homeworld. Shiwonee is an inhospitable place, affected by high gravity, challenging climatic conditions, volcanism and natural disasters that occur throughout its surface. While the Geonee were genetically optimized to survive on Shiwonee by the Ancients, little was done to the planet itself to protect its inhabitants from the harsh environment.

The ancient Geonee became nomads, constantly on the move from one place to the next while fleeing natural disasters. This meant that most habitations were temporary, and few permanent cities developed. Most of the population were small, tribal groups. Their mobility frequently put them at odds with other Geonee who contended for the same resources. Much like other humans, the Geonee are largely driven by certain social instincts. Geonee females were strictly controlled, taken from their families and assigned to males based on tribal traditions including the use of selweeda
(Chirpers) and marriage by capture. This was a survival adaptation. Related males go to war with each other less often and tend to work together to defeat common foes or tackle environmental challenges. A byproduct of these behaviours was patrilineal descent lines and the relegation of women to the role of property.

Most modern human societies shed such barbaric cultural trappings, but for various reasons, Geonee oppression of women had not, until recently, shown signs of abating. The Geonee are an anomaly. Overachieving technological societies usually require significant contributions from all of their population, not just the members of one of its sexes. To compete on a galactic level, a species simply cannot perform well with
'one hand tied behind its back'. However, the Geonee were gifted most of their technology by the Ancients, who left enough intact relics to jump start their civilization, enabling them to maintain oppressive traditions long after they became impractical. The Vilani, who rightfully perceived the starfaring Geonee as a threat, did what they could to perpetuate traditional practises among the Geonee in order to suppress their advancement. After the fall of the Ziru Sirka and subsequent Rule of Man, the Long Night sent Geonee technological advancement into deep decline for nearly two millennia, perpetuating traditional behaviours even longer.

In modern times, Geonee culture has undergone revolutionary changes. While traditional practises are still enforced on the core Geonee worlds – such as Shiwonee and Lagna – many new settlements and colonies have done away with impractical traditions in favor of more expedient ones. Chief among these is the oppression of women. While women living on the core Geonee worlds can expect a life of domestic servitude, those on the frontiers of Geonee expansion live quite independent lives. Careers usually limited only to males are taken by females with varying levels of participation. Some worlds, even on the frontier, maintain the old traditions as best they can, keeping women in the home and out of sight from society; however, most allow a significant portion of their female population partial or complete autonomy in selecting a career outside the home. Independent females who have chosen not to wed a male become the heads of their households, a practice forbidden on the core worlds.

While women rarely occupy the top ranks of most careers, female admirals, generals and chief executive officers are not unheard of. These more liberal practices are enabled by the long reach of Geonee settlement. Not just any world can serve as a viable Geonee habitation; they prefer large worlds with high gravity and dense atmospheres, where they are most comfortable. They also prefer worlds touched by the Ancients, whom they believe to be their ancestors. Geonee particularity has resulted in a far-flung 'pseudo empire' of sorts with long tendrils reaching throughout the Massilia sector and deep into the Core, Diaspora, the Old Expanses and other neighboring sectors. Modern Geonee have access to the greatest technology available in the Imperium, but the distance between the settlements and the core worlds has resulted in greater cultural diversity. The settlements are like distant 'islands' of Geonee culture, many of which are free to chart their own paths and change traditions as they see fit.

The Geonee have great aspirations and believe that a supreme destiny lies ahead of them. Ironically, it might be the people of their most distant settlements and colonies who serve as the catalysts to achieve that destiny. To compete with the great powers of Charted Space, to walk among its giants, will require all of the Geonee, not just the male portion of their population.

### GOVERNMENT

Most Geonee worlds are traditionally governed, directly or indirectly, by oligarchic noble families. Shiwonee is governed by the Meeralo Council, an ancient body composed of 18 married men, representatives from each world in the Geonee Cultural Region, and chaired by the Duke of Shiwonee. The number of representatives a world has is based on population and importance, but Council membership has been traditionally maintained at 18. Members of the Meeralo Council hold their position for life and have the right to select their successors. In theory, any married man can be elected to the Council, but in practice all 18 positions are held by nobles. The head of the Council is Subsector Duke Karnordo Neowashee, and while his vote is equal to any other Council member, his opinion holds significant sway.

**MEERALO COUNCIL**
While the Meeralo Council only directly rules the homeworld, it significantly influences the core worlds within the Geonee Cultural Region. A holdover from the Geonee Confederation, the Geonee Cultural Region is strongly centralised. The Meeralo Council sets policy which directs the region and, where contradictions exist, overrules local planetary differences. The Council does not generally interfere with internal affairs of member planets, allowing them to govern themselves as they see fit, as long as the laws as set down by the Council are followed. Exceptions do and have occurred, especially when serious grievances are brought to the Council for adjudication.

Political disputes from any core world can be brought before the Council, whose decisions are final and binding. The Council also acts as the highest court of appeal in the Geonee Cultural Region. Any Geonee may bring their case to the Meeralo Council to be heard but, in practice, only the wealthiest can afford the expense.

As head of the Council, Duke Karnardo is also commander in chief of the Geonee Self Defence Force. With the support of the Meeralo Council, the duke has the authority to mobilise the navy and armies to defend the core worlds, and the subsector as a whole.

Below the Meeraloo Council are five sub-councils which oversee key functions, each headed by a member of the Council. Traditionally, the sub-councils are led by councillors from Shiwonee, but the Duke of Shiwonee is free to name whichever councillor he wishes as head of a particular sub-council. There is significant jockeying of power among councillors to be asked to lead a sub-council, as it imparts significant prestige and greater access to the subsector duke.

### DEFENCE COUNCIL

The Geonee Cultural Region funds and trains its own navy and a number of army brigades, which fall under the authority of the Defence Council. Called the Geonee Self Defence Force, it consists of the Geonee Self Defence Navy and the Geonee Self Defence Army. Each member world is required to provide defence personnel and equipment to the Self Defence Force, these forces normally stationed at their planet of origin unless involved in training exercises or mobilised for action.

The Defence Council is unable to mobilise the Self Defence Force without express approval of the Duke of Shiwonee.

### LAW COUNCIL

The Law Council is the legislative authority of the Geonee Cultural Region. It raises legislature which effects interstellar trade within the region, such as trade taxes and prohibited items, as well as providing oversight to legislature machinery of all member worlds.

Suggested new and revised interstellar laws are created in the Law Council, which are then ratified by the Meeralo Council before coming into effect. These laws cannot supersede Imperial Law.

In its capacity of oversight of laws, the Law Council reviews proposed laws raised by governments of member worlds to determine if they fall within the best interests of the Geonee as a whole, and then within the best interests of the world in particular. Proposed laws the Council deems as suitable are permitted to be ratified by the member world's government. Laws deemed not conducive to Geonee interests may be brought to the attention of the Meeralo Council for consideration. In these cases, a three quarters majority vote is required for the law to pass.

The Law Council also oversees the appointment of the judiciary which presides over breaches of Geonee interstellar law. In addition to hearing Geonee Cultural Region cases, the judiciary presides over cases brought to the Meeralo Council in its role as the supreme court of the region. Decisions made by the judiciary in these cases must be approved by majority vote of the Meeralo Council. In effect, the Council normally abides by the decisions of the judiciary, but there have been occasions where it has declined the decision of the judiciary and the case has been reheard.

### TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL

The Technology Council is the body which directly oversees the Association for the Development and Retrieval of Advanced Technology (ADRAT). The Technology Council reviews recovered technology and new innovations to ensure suitability for public availability, and ensures all approved technology and innovations are made available to member worlds. The council also provides oversight to the curriculum of ADRAT technical schools and allocates funding to individual ADRAT offices throughout Charted Space.

### COLONISATION COUNCIL

During the period of the first Geonee Confederation, the Colonization Council was deeply involved in establishing and monitoring new colonization efforts. When the Council was re-established during the Long Night, its role was been significantly altered to be responsible for contacting lost Geonee colonies and bringing them back under the oversight of the Confederation. With the formation of the Third Imperium and dissolution of the Confederation, the Council's focus was again changed to one of overseeing trade and diplomacy between Geonee worlds.

The current Colonization Council has two major mandates. The first is to maintain contact between far-flung Geonee colonies and encourage trade and cooperation between them and the Geonee Cultural Region. The second is to oversee the governance of the colony world Tlasov and the technological exchange between the Geonee and Llyrnians.

### FINANCE COUNCIL

The Finance Council is responsible for creating and administering the Geonee Cultural Region's annual budget, overseeing expenditure, and distributing funds to governing councils and agencies. It sets annual tax requirements for member worlds based on economic importance from which the annual budget is funded. It would come as no surprise that the majority of the funding is directed to the Geonee Self Defence Force and ADRAT, but the Finance Council also provides funding to many other institutions, not the least of which is the Meeralo Council itself. Each annual budget must be ratified by a simple majority vote of the Meeralo Council before it can come into effect.

### ADRAT

Arguably the most important Geonee institution is the Gradeea Bresaal Adonee Gaal, or 'Association for the Development and Retrieval of Advanced Technology'. To non-Geonee, the organization is simply known as ADRAT.

Originally, ADRAT was formed in -175 with a charter to coordinate technical research and antique technology retrieval. It was dissolved under Imperial rules but revived again after the Civil War and given an Imperial charter to 'foster technical knowledge and market technical innovation'. A combination of corporation and altruistic organization, ADRAT possesses a network of over 500 offices throughout Imperial territory and beyond, with more being opened yearly. The ADRAT headquarters and main office is located on Shiwonee and directly overseen by the Technological and Meeralo Councils.

An ADRAT office has three departments. The first is the Technical School and Academy, an institution devoted to educating technicians and expanding technical knowledge through research. In any ADRAT technical college, at least half of the instructors are Geonee. ADRAT colleges are renowned for the high-quality training they offer; any graduate will easily find well paid employment ranging from starship engineer to computer programmer.

The second department of an ADRAT Office is the Commercial Service, which aids Geonee traders and coordinates a commercial network centered on novelties and high-tech items. The Commercial Service aims to market advanced technology to appropriate worlds. The department is known to sponsor in-depth survey missions to backwater worlds to determine the most profitable way to market high-tech goods.

The third department is the Retrieval Service, which concentrates on locating and retrieving technological items. It frequently sponsors expeditions to remote worlds in search of technology of lost civilizations, with a primary focus on Ancients artefacts.

All Ancients artefacts within the Third Imperium belong to the Imperium by law, and their recovery is normally undertaken by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. The IISS will often work with the Retrieval Service when dealing with Ancients sites and artefacts; on Geonee worlds, these sites are supervised by ADRAT rather than the IISS. Rumors persist that ADRAT occasionally defies Imperial law by trying to recover Ancients technology even when not under IISS contract.

### LAW

Geonee laws vary considerable across individual worlds but those regarding ownership and property are universally harsh. For Geonee, with their obsession over ownership, there is nothing more despicable than a thief. Across all worlds governed by Geonee, punishments inflicted on those who take the property of others are among the most severe found in the Imperium.

In general, punishments towards theft are governed by what has been stolen. The most lenient punishment is given to those who steal money. The Geonee believe Credits can always be earned, so the loss of them is not as great as the loss of other property. Therefore, punishment tends towards the perpetrator recompensing the victim to the amount which was stolen, a fine issued by the court – which includes court fees – a public caning, and their identity placed on a list of offenders. Those who make a second offence are treated as if they had stolen property.

The punishment issued to those who steal property is somewhat harsher, with the perpetrator required to return all property stolen – or a sum of Credits equal to twice the value if the property cannot be returned

- a fine issued by the courts including court fees, their right hand removed, and their identity placed on a property offenders list. Those who make a second offence are treated as if they had stolen the wife of another Geonee.

Those found guilty of stealing another Geonee's wife are punished the most severely of all. The victim must be recompensed in Credits to a value decided by the court – normally twice the amount of the initial dowry, adjusted for inflation. All property owned by the perpetrator is seized by the state, and the perpetrator publicly executed.

The Geonee also have stringent laws against premarital sex and adultery, with both parties involved being punished with public caning. Male Geonee are also issued a fine to cover court costs and must compensate the male protector of the female an additional sum equal to the assumed dowry of the female, as issued by the court.

Due to cultural prejudices, Geonee favor male over female offspring. Males are held in high regard and given preferential treatment. From the Geonee perspective, a male child adds a productive member to the family, one who will be able to fend for himself in time and able to provide care for his parents when they

grow old. A female child is seen as a responsibility and financial burden, one which could potentially encumber the family for the rest of her life. The most a family could hope for with a female child is to attract a large dowry when she is married.

In the past, this preference has led to periods of legal infanticide of female offspring, routinely left to succumb to the elements, especially among poorer members of society. Naturally, this led to significant discrepancies in numbers between males and females after several generations. Fortunately, the Meeralo Council has outlawed infanticide throughout the Geonee Cultural Region. While this has caused some reduction in the practice, it is an open secret that it continues among the poor where families cannot afford the expense of a female child. In these areas, it is not unusual for authorities to turn a blind eye.

### DRESS, ART AND ARCHITECTURE

On most Geonee worlds, clothing is dependent on gender. Two cultural norms effect fashion; first, the Geonee have a cultural taboo regarding being seen with a bare head. Secondly, another taboo prevents excessive bare skin. It is expected for males be seen publicly with long sleeves and trousers – only face, ears, and hands are permitted to be exposed. Females on traditional worlds are expected to be completely covered in public, with only their eyes and hands exposed. In the home, it is permissible for a female's face to be seen by her husband and other relatives. Clothing is made from tough sturdy material which resists wear and tear.

Males prefer long-sleeved tunics and trousers over which is worn a vest secured with a broad belt. Tunics are often decorated with simple bold geometric shapes. Decorative collars, shoulder guards, and cuffs are common. Shoes are often pointed and curled upwards. A helmet-like hat with long 'sideburns' is worn in public, with the height of the helmet indicating the male's position in society. In private, males tend to do away with this and wear a simple cloth secured with a headband.

Traditionally females wear long-sleeved tunics with baggy sleeves cuffed tightly at the wrist over loose baggy pants cuffed tightly at the ankles, often with a long skirt over the pants. At home or away from prying eyes, it is permissible for a woman to wear a scarf or veil. Shoes are similar in design to those worn by males. When in public, a single flowing over-garment is worn over tunic and pants, covering them from head to foot, leaving only the eyes and hands exposed. The over-garment is often

brightly coloured and decorated with simple geometric shapes. On more progressive worlds, the over-garment has been done away with, and women instead wear scarves or veils in a manner to hide their faces.

Jewellery tends to be simple for both males and females. Geonee prefer gold over most other precious metals. Men will often wear one or two bold rings, whereas women will often wear earrings, multiple bracelets, necklaces, and rings. Nostril piercings are not uncommon among women, and nose jewellery can be quite elaborate, often with fine gold chains which connect to earrings.

Geonee are not well known for their art. Artists tend to be rather conservative in style which rarely finds appreciation among other races. They rarely create art which is kept permanently in one place but when they do, it is large, geometric, and simple. Sculptures have been described by other races as imposing. Other visual arts are created to be easily transported, ready to be picked up and moved in case of emergency.

One form of Geonee art which has gained a small following among other races is their songs and music. Geonee music can be described as rather dirge-like. Compositions tend to be long and mournful, featuring deep sonorous chanting by male Geonee.

Architecture tends to be big and bold, featuring minimalist constructions which accentuate bare building materials over decorative design. The style commonly makes use of angular geometric shapes constructed out of concrete, brick, or steel. Buildings tend to be broad and low, a holdover from styles used on Shiwonee where construction had to withstand the effects of frequent quakes. Important buildings such as museums, libraries, and government buildings are designed to withstand almost any natural disaster.

Like most other Geonee architecture, homes are angular and squat in nature, built to survive. Family housing is traditionally designed to be two separate wings, joined by a central courtyard.

The front part of the house is known as the 'public home', the abode of a male and any unmarried sons or relatives who live with him. This is where visitors are received and males enjoy rest and recreation. Only the wife of the owner is permitted in this part of the house, and here she must be covered as if she were in public. If strangers were to visit, not even the wife would be found in the public home.

The courtyard is often decorated with simple gardens which include flowering plants and trees. Ponds are also common. The courtyard is equally enjoyed by both men and women of the family. Children are allowed to

play together. Trusted male visitors are also permitted here, but only if any females of the family are suitably covered and a male family member is present.

A secluded section of the courtyard is kept aside for the home of the selweeda. This area is normally only visited by the owner, and kept in a wild state for the comfort of the Chirper.

Rear of the courtyard is the 'private home', where the women live. The only male permitted in this part of the house is the husband – as all the women are under his protection – and immediate male relatives. The women here are permitted to interact freely, and girls are educated. Young boys too young for school also reside in this part of the home with their mother.

Wealthy men can afford large sprawling estates and impressive homes with many rooms. Poor men can sometimes only afford a small home with the bare minimum number of rooms traditionally expected. Such a small abode is unlikely to show him in any favorable light to the relatives of a woman who wishes to marry.

Bachelors often dwell in apartments, either singly or shared, with no room to attract a selweeda and are therefore not suitable to house women at all.

Due to the volatile nature of Shiwonee's geology and climate, settlements tend to be much smaller than those of other advanced races. All cities, even the most modern, is designed with rapid and smooth evacuation in mind. Wide streets and avenues are the norm, and all buildings are easily accessible. Vegetation is kept to a bare minimum, found primarily within private courtyards of homes, where it is closely maintained and cared for. Where the technology is available, the Geonee have taken to building grav-cities which can easily move across the countryside to avoid environmental disasters and shifting climates.

### RECREATION

Geonee enjoy a large variety of recreational activities. Team sports are very popular, in particular ball sports such as grav ball. A particular Geonee sport called khundro keh has gained some popularity in the Imperium beyond the Geonee Cultural Region.

Kundro keh has three teams of nine players facing off against each other. Three balls of different colours are used, and each team must pass their ball through a ring to score points, while at the same time prevent the other teams from doing the same. The rules are somewhat complicated, but teams are permitted to

handle both their own and opposing teams' balls, and play consists of a team trying to keep their opponent's ball off them while protecting their own. The game is a full contact sport, and injuries are common, played both as a casual sport and professionally.

Geonee also enjoy strategic board games. Women in particular find these games enjoyable, but it is very common to find elderly males playing Giroto in the equivalent of coffee houses. Other common boardgames played are Solomani chess and backgammon, and the Vilani shukiimu.

Public performances are openly enjoyed, in particular a form of Geonee opera called bhegautru. An amalgamation of various artforms which developed over a thousand years, bhegautru is a highly stylised performance using elaborate costume, stylised movement, and exaggerated vocal performances. A single bhegautru opera is a drawn-out affair, with a single performance taking many hours over multiple days to complete. It is not a form of art commonly enjoyed by those other than Geonee.

Storytelling is also an ancient Geonee art form, particularly among women. In the past, there was often very little for women to do to entertain themselves; to overcome boredom, storytelling became common, with themes of tragic love stories and heroic epics.

### BUSINESS

Geonee are extremely competent and shrewd businessmen. Merchants and traders can be found throughout the Imperium and their nomadic nature has led to a network of colonies and settlements. These scattered communities often share information on commercial opportunities amongst each other, making them very effective over long distances. Geonee have not formed any megacorporations, but make up for this with a myriad of smaller companies which deal in all manner of products.

They are well known throughout the Imperium as engineers, technicians and merchants, and have access to the full range of Imperial technology; most of their worlds are at or above the Imperial average of TL12. Shiwonee is one of the handful of Imperial worlds that boasts a mature TL15. The main handicap Geonee face in interstellar trade is their semi-nomadic nature, which limits their ability to build or use large-scale industrial facilities. Due to this limitation, Geonee do not produce as many advanced manufactured goods as their population and Tech Level may suggest.

### THE MILITARY

The military consists of planetary forces which defend their homeworld, and a united force called the Geonee Self Defence Force (GSDF). Funding for the GSDF is provided by each world based on capability. Ground forces are normally stationed on their own world, but can be seconded to another if necessary.

Forces are generally trained and equipped at TL15, making them the equivalent of Imperial troops; they can be seconded into the Imperial military during war or to undertake large scale military exercises, but this is unusual. An exception to this policy occurred early during the Solomani Rim War. Losing ground to the Solomani advance, the Imperium was forced draw what assets it could. The GSDF were some of the first forces seconded in support of the war, and helped halt the Solomani from overwhelming the Imperium.

The Geonee do not necessarily glorify war, but certainly do not shy away from it. They are proud of their military might. All forces are well trained and ready to move into action when required. While the size of the GSDF is dwarfed by the Imperial military, it packs a solid punch.

On the core Geonee worlds, participating in the military is strictly a male occupation, while on the periphery of interstellar expansion females may be found in various military roles. The steadfastness of Geonee traditionalism dictates that those females who serve in the armed forces rarely return to the core worlds unless they adopt traditional roles, if only for the duration of their visit.

### NAVY ORGANISATION

Each world in the Geonee Cultural Region has established a navy for planetary defence and to conduct customs duties and security patrols. In addition, each world also has a number of jump-capable vessels. On other Imperial worlds, these ships would normally come under the command of their homeworld governments, though operations of these vessels are subject to regulations laid down by the Imperial Colonial Office and can be called into active duty if necessary. In the Geonee Cultural Region, these ships fall under the command of the Geonee Self Defence Navy under the command of the Duke of Shiwonee, with the charter of defending the region. The distinction must be made here that the Geonee Self Defence Navy is not the same as, or part of, the Shiwonee colonial or subsector fleets, or the Imperial Navy, but may join forces with either on the orders of the Duke of Shiwonee and approval of the Meeralo Council.

The navy was founded shortly before the conclusion of the Imperial Civil War. Many Imperial assets had been called away, leaving Shiwonee and surrounding subsectors woefully short of vessels to protect worlds from piracy. The Meeralo Council authorized the formation of the Self Defence Navy to protect the core worlds and surrounding areas. When Arbellatra took the Imperial Throne as regent, the Geonee Navy was instrumental in her victory. The fleet not only provided an impressive deterrent to piracy, but it was also instrumental in cowing several governments into accepting the change in Imperial administration. The regent thanked the Geonee for their support by creating the Duchy of Shiwonee, with a Geonee as reigning duke. Control of the fleet was transferred to him and has remained with reigning duke ever since, with a mandate to continue its charter of protecting the worlds of the Geonee Cultural Region.

The Geonee Self Defence Navy follows a similar structure to the Imperial Navy. The navy comprises primarily corvettes, destroyers, battle riders and their battle tenders, with only a handful of capital assets at its disposal, all obsolete vessels obtained from the Imperial Navy and refitted to TL15 standard.

### NAVY OPERATIONS

The Geonee have a preference for battle riders over larger jump-capable warships, and naval tactics are geared towards the use of battle riders overwhelming enemy forces while smaller assets ensure the safety of battle tenders and support vessels. [[Capital]] assets are used primarily as command posts and only brought into combat when defending retreating battle riders and tenders. Geonee naval tactics also favor swarming an enemy force with smaller vessels over large unit engagements.

Joint maneuvers are routinely undertaken and rotated between squadrons assigned to different worlds to ensure all units work seamlessly together. In a similar fashion, squadrons and fleet components are often rotated throughout the Geonee Cultural Region.

The vast majority of ships in the navy are constructed at TL15; Lagna has extensive orbital construction yards used to construct military assets and maintain vessels of TL15 manufacture. Surplus vessels obtained from the Imperial Navy which are below TL15 are upgraded to fit with the Geonee naval standard.

**ARMY ORGANISATION**
The Geonee Self Defence Army is a specialist force drawn from the ranks of armies raised on the worlds within the Geonee Cultural Region. The Self Defence Army consists primary of three main arms: the Ground Force, Support Force, and Space Assault Force. All equipment used is TL15.

Units from the Self Defence Army are regularly rotated out with battalions from planetary armies to ensure uniform training and experience, leading to a large force which can be drawn upon in times of crisis. Army units are organised into brigades named after their planet of origin.

Unlike similar military forces, the Geonee Self Defence Force does not have a marine branch. Instead, the Space Assault Force serves a similar duty and while they are a separate arm, they work very closely with the navy. The Space Assault Force normally acts as security on spacecraft navel installations, as well as an elite military and boarding force. It is also the Duke of Shiwonee's personal guard.

An interesting aspect of the Space Assault Force is their use of Llyrnians as shock troops. Equipped with TL15 arms and armor, Llyrnian shock troops present a terrifying front. Llyrnian and Geonee units train together to build cohesion, but Llyrnian units are normally commanded by Llyrnian officers, with only the highest level of the command structure consisting of Geonee officers. Llyrnian troops are treated as valued equals by the Geonee, who regard their combat capabilities highly.

**ARMY OPERATIONS**
The Geonee Self Defence Army has a reputation for its use of cutting-edge technology and brute force tactics backed by electronic expertise. Overall strategy is to overwhelm opposing forces with superior numbers and technology on two fronts; physical assaults with simultaneous cyberattacks. Once ground has been taken, the army will reinforce its position in preparation for another advance. Meanwhile, electronic and technological assets will be appropriated and used to support advancing troops.

The army favors heavy armored warfare, making great use of a variety of tanks of their own design. These range from the relatively small and agile Gorta light tank to Branak superheavy tanks, which are essentially enormous mobile weapon platforms. Supporting the heavy armored units are 'light'
armored units comprising battle dress-clad soldiers.

The Geonee have a dislike of jump troops, feeling the potential attrition rate during jump operations to be untenable. Instead, they use heavily armed and armored dropships supported by escort vessels to deliver troops to ground theatres.

Space Assault Forces are found primarily on starships, acting as ship's security, boarding prevention, and active boarders. They can be found at key points in ship access ways, and there are always two marines stationed on the bridge and in engineering at all times. Marines on spacecraft fall into the fleet chain of command, normally with an individual ranked as major or above answering directly to the captain. Shipboard troops are issued with weapons which will cause the least damage to delicate ship infrastructure and, like Imperial Marines, are always issued with a blade. When conducting boarding actions, Space Assault Forces are issued with more powerful weaponry.

The Space Assault Force is also responsible for piloting fighter craft and other support vehicles, as required.

### LANGUAGE

The most widespread Geonee language is Irkonee , or 'the language of the old ones', and is the official language on all Geonee worlds. The origin of the language is lost in time, and linguistic studies have failed to show it has any similarities to other human languages. Most Geonee only speak Irkonee , and those who choose to learn other languages typically learn Galanglic.

Naming conventions are heavily influenced by tradition. Fathers always name their children with no input from the mother. The name consists of four parts to identify an individual. The first part, or name, is a personal name, given to a child shortly after it is born.

There are no set traditions for what the first name for a child should be. Some Geonee will name children after grandparents, whereas others will choose a name they particularly like or are attached to.

Common Male Names: Breo, Brilee, Bruthwo, Dasdee, Drald, Duard, Duaree, Dralee, Dreo, Fornee, Gantee, Garro, Horgee, Logur, Khord, Murgo, Rando, Ravee, Trand, Tronk, Ular, Weltee

Common Female Names: Arama, Bara, Brilmara, Brilmaris, Dasdom, Dortara, Dortis, Ekwah, Gathar, Kalkis, Maskel, Mura, Murgara, Oondah, Tarea, Urdis, Ulartis, Urga, Vereen, Wardist, Weltis

The second name is always the first name of the father, regardless of the gender of the child.

The third name is the name of their cultural nomad group. There are only a finite number of nomad groups, which trace their heritage back beyond recorded history. Certain nomad groups hold great prestige, such as the Pordongee and Eowaree, and the Grakon have a particularly bad reputation which it has been trying to improve for millennia.

Common Nomad Group Names: Bakonee, Bewehd, Bronkee, Carndee, Etont, Eeworee, Gatond, Gavont, Gerbant, Kroot, Pordongee, Randee, Ravon, Tontee, Traveg, Vabon, Zandant

Last comes the name of the region or territory the nomad group travelled. No matter where a Geonee lives or has come from, this last name will always trace back to Shiwonee. Therefore, there are only a limited number of regional names, and all Geonee who share this name see each other as very distantly related, in name if not in blood.

Common Regional Names: Bartonde, Brygant, Geranto, Lakantee, Mirtanto, Natante, Pangont, Takaske

In everyday life, Geonee tend to go by just their first two names. In slightly formal occasions such as introduction or when receiving a minor recognition, the third name will be included. Only in the most formal occasions will the full name, including region, be used

### WRITTEN LANGUAGE

The Geonee language uses a written alphabet which can trace its origin to their distant past. The alphabet is best described as a form of cuneiform writing, and despite its apparent simplicity can impart the most complex concepts with remarkable elegance. The script shows some similarity to the writings found in the Ancients sites within the Geonee Cultural Region, though it has undergone significant evolution. Naturally, the Geonee see this as just more evidence which supports the belief that they are descendants of the Ancients.

# GEONEE HISTORY

Although the Geonee are adamant that they are the Ancients, the most widely accepted idea states they were brought from Terra by the Ancients approximately 300,000 years ago. Their world, Shiwonee, has an eccentric orbit and is geologically unstable, with many active volcanoes and frequent quakes. Some geological evidence suggests Shiwonee's instability is not natural, but perhaps the result of manipulation during the Final War.

### ORIGINS
Archaeological remains strongly suggest the original humans abandoned on Shiwonee by the Ancients were only slightly genetically modified, and continued to evolve naturally. Evidence indicates modern Geonee, _Homo sapiens geonensis_ , emerged close to -15000. Several other human subspecies have also been noted, with various adaptions to Shiwonee's heavy gravity and dense atmosphere, but all became extinct around the same time modern Geonee appeared in the geological record. Genetic testing has revealed DNA traces of the extinct species within the Geonee genome, suggesting significant interbreeding, and the Geonee are the successful descendants.

Shiwonee's instability had drastic impacts on Geonee culture as it developed, particularly on their inclination toward technology. Early tribal communities were often affected by natural disasters, a situation which gave value to technical skills and advantage to tribes which embraced them. Drastic climate changes added pressure to maintain a nomadic culture, and it was advantageous to keep populations focussed in small semi-nomadic communities which moved when areas were devastated by natural disasters and climatic vagaries.

Animal husbandry developed around -14500, allowing larger communities to develop with the acceleration of technological innovation. The first small semi-permanent communities were built during this period. The wheel was soon invented, which led to many more innovations.

The Geonee developed agriculture around -14000, primarily as a food source for livestock, but this soon extended to providing grains and vegetables for themselves. This milestone discovery led to

the founding, around -13800, of the earliest known Geonee civilization, the Pordongee Empire. This was still a semi-nomadic culture, but ruled by a single hereditary leader. The gathering of a large group of like-minded people quickly led to the invention of writing and mathematics. The earliest written record discovered in this period, known as the 'Chronicle of the Collapse', is a text which gathers legends from earlier periods. According to this text, the Geonee were the children of gods from 'beyond the stars' who were destroyed in a great war.

While the Porgondee Empire was the first nomadic empire, it was not the last and other empires and kingdoms arose. Due to their nomadic nature, civilizations met frequently, and conflict naturally ensued. The Porgondee Empire eventually collapsed around -12000, conquered by a smaller but more technologically advanced civilization from the north called the Eowaree Republic. By -12750, the effort to control the vast territories of the fallen Porgondee Empire caused the Eowaree Republic to collapse. No evidence of any further great civilizations has been found in the archaeological record until -11695 when the earliest signs of the Dowaree Republic can be found.

### THE COLLAPSE

The Dowaree Republic proved to be highly successful, ultimately conquering and controlling the majority of the continent and bringing all other civilizations into their fold. Instead of armed aggression, the Dowaree Republic made the promise of advanced technology to nations which joined it. The republic was ruled by a council of married noble men - traditionally from both the republic and absorbed civilization. The council members held their titles for life and were able to designate successors. This form of governance remained largely unchanged, except for the allowance of any married man to be elected to the council.

Technology continued to rise steadily, peaking at TL3 by -11000. Exploration was conducted across seas, and colonies were established on other continents. The Geonee found no more of their kind in the far-off lands they discovered. The Dowaree Republic become a world spanning empire and technological advancement rapidly progressed, by -10800 reaching TL6.

In -10700 disaster struck in the form of a winter caused by the simultaneous eruption of several large volcanoes. Dust and ash polluted the atmosphere, blocking solar heat, temperatures plummeted, and acid rain poisoned the seas and rivers. As crops withered and livestock starved, the Dowaree Republic collapsed, plunging the Geonee into a dark age which nearly drove their species to extinction.

The volcanic winter caused havoc with Shiwonee's ecology and biodiversity with thousands of species of becoming extinct. The Geonee managed to save a small number from extinction – mainly domesticated plants and animals – but were too focussed on their own survival to consider the welfare of wildlife. Still, some of the more forward thinking Geonee scientists managed to preserve tissue samples of a significant number of animal and plant species in well protected subterranean 'arks' in the hopes future Geonee would find them. Many arks were lost, but some were eventually rediscovered centuries later and the tissue samples used to successfully clone preserved species. Nevertheless, vast numbers of animal and plant species remained lost and have never been recovered.

By -10500, the effects of the volcanic winter diminished and survivors started to reconstruct their culture. Technical knowledge and expertise had been crucial for their survival during this Collapse, and was even more important for the reconstruction of civilization. Technicians had become some of the most important members of society, a position they retain today.

### THE SPACE ERA

The Collapse forced the Geonee to return to small independent semi-nomadic communities, scratching out an existence as best they could. As before, communities joined to pool their resources and civilization quickly returned, but individual settlements maintained independence and identity.

By -9500, the Geonee had regained their previous technical expertise and advanced their civilization to TL5. Despite their independent nature, the Geonee knew coordination between communities was not only advantageous but conducive to further advancement. With this in mind, nomadic communities formed the Meeralo Council. The Council was only a forum of unity between communities, with no authority to command, but as a method of coordinating movement, knowledge, and communication.

The council proved to be a success, and by -9300 the Geonee had achieved early TL9. The Council had sponsored a space service which explored the majority of the Shiwonee system. Colonies had been established on other planets, and the vast wealth in the asteroid belts was being exploited. The Meeralo Council felt it was time for the Geonee to spread beyond their world and declared the goal to 'travel again among the stars'.

In -9270, an expedition made a momentous discovery in one of the asteroid belts – a derelict Ancients starship. After 30 years of research, the Geonee were able to duplicate jump drive technology and built starships of their own.

The only system within reach of their first ships was visited, and the most habitable planet found was named Prindee, which means 'promise'. Despite the unappealing conditions on Prindee – low gravity and a tainted atmosphere – the Geonee established a small colony. Using Prindee as a waypoint, a small fleet of jump-1 starships explored and colonized the nearby Stenardee Cluster.

It was during this period when another discovery was made – the colonists at Lagna uncovered relics of Ancients origin, including Geonee and Chirper skulls. This portentous find was taken as evidence finally proving the interstellar origin of the Geonee.

### THE GEONEE EMPIRE

In -9100, after strong debate on the future of offworld colonies, a member of the Meeralo Council was able to gain sufficient support to force a more centralised form of government. He declared the Geonee Empire and was confirmed as Emperor Bradasee I by the Council. The new empire placed heavy emphasis on space exploration, surveying most of the Shiwonee and Shokee subsectors over the next 20 years.

Most of the newly explored worlds were empty, but a few held surprises for the Geonee. Among these was the presence of Chirpers at Theradway, the remains of an extinct human – but not Geonee – race at Tanny, and the presence of an intelligent but primitive alien race at Llyrn. Initial contact with the Llyrnians was somewhat strained, as they resembled descriptions of devils from mythology. Fortunately, level heads prevailed, and the Geonee and Llyrnians formed a strong friendship.

Based on these finds, the Geonee legends were correct – the Ancients had formed a vast interstellar civilization, and the Geonee where not only their descendants, but their heirs.


**VILANI CONTACT**
Around -9000, the Geonee were contacted by scouts of another starfaring human race – the Vilani. The meeting came as both a surprise and a shock to both, each of whom believed itself the only race with interstellar capability surrounded by a universe of primitives.

Contacts between the Geonee and Vilani were rife with misunderstanding and suspicion. The Vilani had legends of fearful god-rulers in the distant past, leading the Geonee to believe the Vilani had once been slaves to the Ancients/Geonee civilization. Once cultural exchange had advanced somewhat, the Vilani attitude towards technology and research seemed alien and foolish to the Geonee and they came to disdain the Vilani, considering them servile and stagnant.

Even after Vilani contact, the Massilia sector was still full of empty worlds, so the Geonee continued their expansion. In -8700, the furthest Geonee colony was established on Forquee, 13 parsecs coreward of Shiwonee.

In -8600, Massilia was under the formal supervision of the Sharurshid. Traders from this bureau discovered the first Geonee jump drive had been copied from a derelict of unknown origin. This was a serious blow to Vilani respect for the Geonee.

The Geonee took offence at the presumption that the derelict was of unknown origin, arguing it was an antique ship from the time of the first Geonee civilization. Regardless, the issue was not of great import to the Geonee – they had an interstellar society of advanced technology, active exploration, expanding trade, and progressive technical research. Vilani opinion, no matter how ridiculous and offensive, was irrelevant.

**THE FIRST CONFEDERATION**
For some time, Geonee emperors had become both more redolent and corrupt, while at the same time more tyrannical in their rule. Many colonies were being heavily taxed, and those which failed to pay taxes were placed under the authority of a governor who acted in the emperor's interest. The populace on the more remote colonies were forced to live in poverty as most were ruthlessly taxed and the resources of their worlds stripped away to support the decadent inner worlds.

Finally, in -8300, a colonial revolution raged through the remote colonies, leading to the execution of the emperor and many of his closest allies. The empire was recast as a loose confederation. The Meeralo Council

continued to administer the 'original worlds', while more distant colonies like Forque and Parahee were given almost complete autonomy.

The Vilani remained neutral during the colonial revolt, but Sharurshid increased commercial activity in Massilia, aggressively competing with Geonee commercial interests. In the following centuries, the Vilani and Geonee stood as rivals for interstellar power. Both competed in the exploration and development of worlds in the Massilia, Zarushagar, Core, Diaspora, and Delphi sectors. While occasional military skirmishes erupted, the relationship between the two starfaring powers remained generally peaceful, at least on the surface.

The Geonee were on the edge of achieving TL10 by
-7100, though they had yet to develop the jump-2 drive. When the Vilani finally developed it, they kept the knowledge to themselves, much to the disappointment of the Geonee. Some Geonee scholars advocate the idea that undercover Vilani agents prevented discovery of jump-2 by kidnapping key researchers and sabotaging critical experiments. Vilani scholars defend the alternate view that major jump drive achievements rely on extensive theoretical knowledge, something the practical orientation of Geonee technicians lacked. In truth, there is evidence to support both cases, and the truth may never be uncovered.

By this time, the nomadic communities had settled as far as the Lishun sector. The Geonee Confederation maintained only a loose connection with these settlements, its true territory never encompassing more than the equivalent of four subsectors in Massilia.

THE GEONEE-VILANI WAR The Vilani commenced the Consolidation Wars in
-5100, hoping to bring all known Minor Races into a Vilani-ruled empire. The Geonee Confederation applied every available resource to resist the Vilani, starting what became known as the Two Hundred Years War. The Geonee dealt heavy losses on the Vilani, forcing them to retreat from the central Massilia subsectors for decades. Unfortunately, Vilani tactics and the strategic advantages of jump-2 proved decisive. In approximately -4900, the Geonee were defeated and their worlds incorporated into the new Ziru Sirka.

After their victory, Sharurshid systematically attempted to eradicate the Geonee as a significant influence in Massilia. Geonee worlds were placed under military rule, and most Geonee communities were forcibly deported back to one of their core worlds or required to meet strict population control measures.


By around -4100, most of the remote colonies had been depopulated and their worlds resettled by Vilani. Despite Vilani attempts, the Geonee continued to survive on at least 30 worlds in Massilia.

For 200 years, the Geonee were a subject race of the Ziru Sirka. Military occupation was eventually lifted, but Geonee worlds continued to be ruled by Vilani bureaucrats and Law Levels were kept high. Occasional uprisings erupted, but were quickly and ruthlessly crushed.

### THE INTERSTELLAR WARS

In -2408, the Interstellar Wars plunged the Ziru Sirka into conflict with a recently contacted human race from Terra. The Geonee welcomed the Terrans as liberators and when war approached their worlds, they rebelled against the Vilani oppressors and allied with the Terrans. Quickly organised Geonee forces made up a significant portion of Terran forces in Massilia during the later wars and Geonee communities became advance bases and safe ports for Terran military. During this period, Geonee naval forces used thousands of Llyrnians as ship's troops, starting a long tradition of 'Llyrnian Devil Marines' and mercenaries serving on Geonee spacecraft.

After 200 years of intermittent warfare, the declining Vilani Empire was conquered by the Terrans. With the war ended, the Terrans were left in control of a vast territory they were ill prepared to manage. They soon came to rely heavily on Geonee advisors in Massilia.

### THE RULE OF MAN

The Second Imperium was established shortly after the end of the Interstellar Wars. In -2200, Hiroshi Estigarribia granted self-government to the Geonee worlds and, together with Llyrn and a few nearby Vilani worlds, the Geonee founded the Geonee Autonomous Region.

For the Geonee, the early Rule of Man was a time of jubilation. The Vilani bureaucracy had been eradicated, and all restrictions on research and technology imposed abolished. The Rule of Man permitted the Geonee to travel freely and settle new worlds. The Terran love of personal independence and initiative fit perfectly with Geonee values.

By -2000, several Geonee worlds had achieved TL12, then the cutting edge of technology. Interstellar trade was booming, and the long Vilani occupation all but forgotten. Once again, the Geonee had become a

common sight throughout Massilia and beyond. In the following centuries, significant numbers of Geonee joined the Second Imperium's navy, army, and scouts where they gained a well-deserved reputation for technical expertise.

### THE LONG NIGHT

Despite their best intentions, the management of the Second Imperium proved to be too much for the inexperienced Terrans. The year of -1776 is usually seen as the starting of economic collapse of the Rule of Man. The Terrans, not able to maintain an empire of thousands of worlds, were helpless to prevent the recession which destroyed what they had conquered. The Long Night soon descended.

The Geonee Autonomous Region was able to maintain interstellar trade for some centuries into the Long Night, but its volume steadily declined until individual worlds were all by isolated. The region had been too thoroughly integrated into both the Ziru Sirka and the Second Imperium to be able to construct a viable interstellar economy alone.

Only three Geonee worlds survived the Long Night, falling from TL12 to TL4. Once these worlds were at a locally sustainable Tech Level, progress once again commenced. The Geonee felt they had again lost the stars, but were far from discouraged – this was not the first time. Painfully, over centuries, the Geonee reconstructed a self-sufficient economy and advanced technology. By -250, Geonee worlds were able to launch space expeditions again, quickly followed by contact between them.

### THE SECOND CONFEDERATION

In -190, a collection of Geonee representatives, again coordinated by the traditional Meeralo Council, met at Prindee and declared the Second Geonee Confederation, renewing their goal to
'reclaim the stars'.

The Confederation was founded as an agreement between different dominant classes of the three Geonee worlds – the high-ranking bureaucrats of Hiponee, the industrial backers of Lagna, and the Meeralo Council and nation-state leaders of Shiwonee. It was natural in the early stages for all these classes to recognize each other's authority on equal terms to establish a system of nobility. The Confederation issued titles to the most powerful families, creating the nobility which would continue to rule the Geonee worlds, in one form or another, to the present day.


### LLYRNIANS

The Llyrian are a Minor Race native to the subterranean environment of a cold satellite orbiting a gas giant in the Shokee subsector. They play an important role throughout Massilia. Their homeworld, Llyrn, is a member of the Duchy of Shiwonee. By tradition, the Llynians serve as security troops on many Geonee ships and in return, the Geonee do much of the work of maintaining a high technology civilization on Llyrn.

Llyrnians are tunnel dwellers. Their cylindrical bodies are trilaterally symmetrical, with three locomotive limbs on the bottom and three manipulative limbs spreading from the top. The arms contain hearing organs, which are the Llyrnians' primary sense. They are able to sense both vibrations in rock and the faintest sounds transmitted through thin atmosphere. Three mouths open under the arms that are used for nutrient consumption. The body is covered with a tough external coat of organic silicates and the arms end in tough claws, with three vibratory membranes positioned on the upper body permitting a limited sonar capability. The body ends in a structure that contains three breathing orifices, which also act as olfactory senses, and a visual band which encircles the entire structure. Llyrnian vision centres on the infrared portion of the spectrum.

Lyrnians are trisexual, with Delver, Feeder and Warrior genders. Delvers build and maintain tunnels, Warriors defend the community and Feeders bear and care for offspring. Adult Llyrnians vary in size by gender but most Delvers and Warriors are approximately 1.67 meters long and weigh about 63.5 kilograms.

### CREATING LLYRNIAN TRAVELLERS

Llyrnian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END+2, INT-2, EDU-2

**Traits**
Llyrnian Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Armor:** Llyrnian all possess a strong outer carapace made of organic silicates. This gives all Llyrnians natural Protection +6.

**Burrowing:** Llyrnian are able to burrow through earth and rock by rapidly vibrating their arms and claws. Llyrnians may burrow through earth at a speed of three meters and through stone at a speed of one meter. They are unable to burrow through metal ores.

Claws: Llyrnians have three arms, which end with heavily clawed three-digit hands. When used offensively, Lyrian claws deal 3D damage. Furthermore, unless a device is specifically designed for Llyrians, they suffer a DM-2 for any checks related to using it.

Echolocation (25m): Llyrnians rudimentary echolocation sense permits them to navigate their environment, effectively allowing them to 'see' in complete darkness or through soil to a range of 25 meters.

Enhanced Senses: Llyrnian hearing is acute and they are able to detect vibrations. Llyrians gain DM+2 when making Recon checks to hear or sense vibrations. Llyrnian vision is based on the infrared spectrum, allowing them to see objects by the heat emitted. Their optical organs gives 360o vision, making any attempt to sneak up on them suffer DM-4.


In -180, the Confederation commenced a program to reclaim all former Geonee systems. The empty worlds of the Stenardee Cluster were surveyed again, and small colonies established. On these worlds, the Geonee found remnants of the former inhabitants. Newly recovered relic technologies from the Rule of Man were efficiently reverse engineered and replicated, improving the Geonee's technological recovery.

### SYLEAN CONTACT

In -150, advance scouts from the Sylean Federation contacted the Geonee. The Syleans were too remote for trade between the two interstellar polities to be profitable, but for several decades the Geonee Confederation was an almost mandatory stop for long-
ranging Sylean scouts and traders.

This era was also a time of internal strife and conflict on many Geonee worlds. A brutal civil war on Hiponee ended with the use of nuclear weapons, nearly exterminating the entire population. The Confederation made the radical decision to deport all survivors to the inhospitable world of Dreva, reserving the once beautiful Hiponee for the nobility. This reserved status has been maintained ever since despite the planet having completely recovered from the effects of the war.

### THE THIRD IMPERIUM

In year 0, Grand Duke Cleon Zhunastu of Sylea transformed the Sylean Federation into the Third Imperium. Vland and the Vilani core worlds joined almost immediately.

The Sylean ambassador to the Geonee formally asked the Confederation to join the Third Imperium too. The Confederation as a polity refused to join, acquiescing to opposing voices which refused to exist under the same rule as Vland. However, as Geonee traders promulgated through space, many of them accepted Imperial citizenship as individuals. Geonee colony worlds outside of the Confederation core also began to join. As the Imperium made new markets available, the Geonee profited as much as the Imperium did. Regardless, this was not sufficient to convince the Geonee nobility to integrate the Confederation into the Imperium. Commercial conflicts, espionage, and even minor skirmishes lasted for decades.

By 80, the Imperium was undertaking the Pacification Campaigns to unify nearby space under its rule. The Imperial Navy made a show of force in the Shiwonee

subsector, ensuing in a few isolated battles before the Geonee core worlds accepted Imperial rule. In an obvious insult, the Imperium placed the subsector capital at Tlasov rather than Shiwonee.

Integration with the Imperium proved difficult. In 120, a major anti-Imperial insurrection ended with the establishment of three naval bases at Shiwonee, Hiponee, and Ashavakuna, and kept under close scrutiny for centuries. Geonee nobility was not granted Imperial recognition until 350.

### THE IMPERIAL CIVIL WAR

The political situation dramatically altered during the Imperial Civil War. Kaner, a Geonee admiral, was an early aspirant to the Imperial Throne and managed for years to maintain a stronghold around Shiwonee. When Kaner was killed in battle in 615, Geonee troops and starships fought against Kaner's enemies, supporting several other candidates for the Imperial Throne.

In 622, a Geonee fleet intervened decisively for the future Empress Arbellatra in the Second Battle of Zhimaway. The fact that the male-chauvinist Geonee supported an Empress become something of a common joke, but Arbellatra repaid their assistance by creating the Duchy of Shiwonee in 625 and moving the subsector capital to the Geonee homeworld. Kaner's young son Brakor was made the first duke, and become the principal representative for the eight Geonee 'core' worlds. Duke Brakor was eventually accepted by all Geonee as the representative of their entire race.

After the Civil War, Geonee integration into Imperial society proceed much more smoothly. Old colonies across the whole Imperium soon sent ambassadors to the duke, and new commercial networks were established.

In 729 the Geonee petitioned Empress Margaret to re-establish the Geonee Autonomous Region. To fortify their petition, the Geonee obtained proxies to vote in their favor at the Imperial Moot, guaranteeing even if the empress disapproved of the request, she would have no choice but to grant it. The empress sent a fleet of warships to Shiwonee which arrived in 736 bearing the empress's respect for the Geonee people as members of the Imperium along with a gift of the Imperial flag. Once the message and gift were delivered, the fleet promptly jumped out of the system, denying Shiwonee the millions of Credits which would have been spent by spacers granted shore leave. The Geonee understood the thinly veiled threat and promptly retracted their petition.


**RECENT HISTORY**
The Geonee worlds steadily grew in prosperity again, to the extent that Tlasov had become a colony of Shiwonee by 796 in order to repay huge commercial debt. Geonee technical skills gained them an edge over surrounding worlds and earned them a prominent place in Massilia.

In 806, the Duke of Shiwonee, Valreega Neowahsee, petitioned the Imperial Navy to return an Ancients starship, the _Bradeeva_ , which was rumored to be in their possession, claiming that the vessel was the property of the Geonee. The Imperial Navy maintained no such vessel existed, despite Geonee arguments to the contrary. A special Moot commission was organised to put an end to the matter, with findings of the commission declaring the _Bradeeva_ did not indeed exist. The Geonee maintain the entire incident has been an Imperial Navy cover-up.

In 990, the Imperium declared war on the Terran Confederation, starting the Solomani Rim War. The Imperium fared badly for the first years of the war as Solomani fleets advanced into Imperial territory. In 992, Emperor Gavin made a personal request to the Duke of

Shiwonee for the Geonee Self Defence Navy to assist Imperial forces. The duke agreed and dispatched the navy with Fleet Admiral Hakur Bokar in command.

The Self Defence Navy proved to be a valuable addition to Imperial forces, seeing major action along the front. In 994, the Self Defence Army assisted in forcing a stalemate between the Solomani and Imperium as both struggled to rebuild their forces. In 998, the Self Defence Navy drove into the Solomani Sphere to assist in liberating several worlds from Solomani control, and in 1002 was an integral component in the destruction and routing of the Grand Solomani Fleet at the Battle of Dingir. The Solomani Rim War concluded in 1002 with the conquest and occupation of Terra by Imperial forces.

In 1105, the Duchy of Shiwonee, also known as the Geonee Cultural Region, is composed of ten worlds –
the eight core worlds (Bisk's Planet, Dreva, Hiponee, Lagna, Prindee, Rigaal, Shiwonee, and Sternadee), the Tlasov protectorate, and Llyrn. Duke Karnordo Neowashee holds the title of Geonee-Irkaveera , and is viewed not only as the ultimate authority in the duchy, but representative of all Geonee before the Imperium.

# GEONEE TRAVELLERS

Geonee Travellers follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers detailed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described there_._

### GEONEE

Geonee Travellers have the following modifiers to their characteristics: STR+2, DEX-1, END+2, SOC-1

**Geonee Traits**
Geonee Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Hyper-acclimatization:** Geonee are able to rapidly acclimatise to new environments. It only takes them D3 weeks to adapt to new gravities. Geonee who have the Athletics (strength) skill adapt immediately to high gravity and those with Athletics (dexterity) skill will adapt immediately to low gravity.

**Poor Senses:** Geonee hearing is not as sensitive as those of other humans. When in Atmosphere 7 or less they suffer DM-1 to all Recon checks which require hearing.

**TITLES**
The Geonee, like the Imperium, use noble titles. While the titles are different, they are comparable to Imperial titles and rank.

**Geonee Noble Titles**

Social Stance Geonee Title Equivalent Imperial Title 11 Vepaj Knight 12 Torpak Baron 13 Angat Marquis 14 Morov Count 15 Sarmat Duke

**BACKGROUND SKILLS**
In addition to their usual background skills, Geonee also gain one of Electronics 0, Engineer 0 or Mechanic 0.

### CAREERS

Geonee Travellers use the careers in the Traveller Core Rulebook with the following changes:
•  Geonee are practical scientists, preferring a hands-on approach to research than an academic or studious method. Therefore, they suffer DM-2 when attempting to qualify for the Scholar career.
•  The ADRAT career is available to all Geonee Travellers, who gain DM+2 when attempting to qualify. Any other Traveller can attempt to join the ADRAT with the listed qualification roll.
•  The Self Defence Army is the Duchy of Shiwonee's heavy troops. Each regiment is formed from the forces of the Geonee homeworlds. They are armed and armored in the highest technology available and specialise in full frontal assaults and overwhelming tactics. Geonee Travellers can attempt to enter this career.
•  The Geonee Self Defence Navy patrols the Geonee Cultural Region, protecting the area against invasion and deterring piracy and other illegal interstellar operations. Geonee Travellers can attempt to enter this career.

### ROLE PLAYING GEONEE

Almost all Geonee Travellers will be male; females are kept secluded and protected. A Geonee will have difficulties dealing with independent females and will be quite open about them being kept separate for their own protection. These difficulties will be compounded by a female in a leadership position.

Married Geonee males will always have their invisible Chirper companion with them most of the time. The Geonee will be able to see it but nobody else will. This will make the Geonee seem to act in a peculiar manner, staring at or speaking to apparently empty air. On board a spacecraft, the Geonee Traveller will insist on a large stateroom for himself, which is shared with the Chirper.

Ownership is a defining trait of all Geonee Travellers, who clearly mark their belongings and constantly try to clarify issues of property. 'Who owns this?' will be a frequently asked question.

Geonee Travellers will be fascinated by advanced technology regardless of their occupation. Gadgets and complex mechanical devices will provoke intense curiosity, especially if they are very advanced or unfamiliar. A Geonee Traveller will take great pride in any technological advance they can trace to the Ancients or their own race.

They are very concerned with personal success and prestige within the community. This concern extends to the company they keep and the success or prestige their associates have, as it directly reflects on their

own prestige, be it positive or negative. Geonee will strive to high achievements and great successes and encourage companions to do the same, both as a group and as individuals.

Geonee do not consider themselves as 'human' and use the term rather disparagingly. Geonee tend to take offence at being called human and will quickly correct those who label them as such. When speaking in languages other than their own, they usually translate Geonee as 'Ancients'.

#### CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE: GEONEE

Geonee goods are well known throughout the Imperium for their use of the best technology available.

### PERSONAL PROTECTION

Geonee rarely wear armor unless necessary for their occupation. Within the armed forces, personal protection is, by necessity, commonly worn in both functional and ceremonial capacities. Due to their smaller size Geonee armor must be made specifically for them, although it generally costs no more than standard. Armor designed for Geonee will not fit the average Imperial citizen.

A special note should be made regarding the Llyrnians and their armor. Llyrnians must also have their armor made specifically for them and, due to their differing anatomy, will cost 150% more than similar protection designed with a human in mind.

Ceremonial Armor: Geonee value their history highly and on special occasions it is expected nobles and warriors wear traditional ceremonial armor to add a touch of flare and create a sense of cultural and social presence. While the armor imparts an air of importance, it provides little in the way of actual protection. Ceremonial armor is made of lightweight textiles and light armor padding to provide a flexible frame for comfort during social occasions.

Llyrnian Traditional Armor: Llrynians are well protected by their armored hide but gain advantage when further armored. Traditional Llyrnian armor is largely superseded by more advanced protection but can still be found in use within some communities.

Llyrnian Combat Armor: Llyrnian combat armor is similar to human combat armor – a complete array of metal and synthetic armor, strictly confined to the military and not available on the open market. It contains oxygen tanks for 12 hours and a recycling unit that can more than double this endurance if the user is not unduly exerting themselves.

Llyrnian Battle Dress: Battle dress designed specifically with the anatomy of the Llyrnian in mind. When so outfitted, a Llyrnian presents a formidable opponent. All standard battle dress modifications can be attached to these suits and they possess an electronics suite based on their Tech Level as detailed on page 30 of the Central Supply Catalogue.

### ROBOTS

Geonee are quite comfortable with the presence of robots and make significant use of them in their communities. Robots are usually assigned to tasks which Geonee find tedious or hazardous situations where a sophont risks injury or worse.

Agrobot: The agrobot is a large, open-frame robot with little intelligence, yet it capably performs its duties –
farming and tending the fruit and vegetables. Equipped with a heavy grav-module, the agrobot can travel anywhere on a world's surface while carrying several hundred kilograms of supplies. A variety of peripheral devices enable it to plough, irrigate, plant, weed and harvest crops. An agrobot is able to clear an appropriate area and tend it by itself through the entire growing cycle.

Radio can be used by a home base to relay instructions and other information to far ranging agrobots, normally with a central computer that coordinates the actions of any agrobot assigned to it. Unless ordered otherwise, an agrobot only returns to its home base to recharge, carry supplies to or from the field, or seek repairs.

**Animal Care Robot:** The animal care robot is programmed to feed and tend a variety of creatures, regardless of the environment they live in. It is often found in research labs, zoos and even agricultural installations. The animal care robot is able to assist in tracking and recovering any creatures that escape, using its heightened vision and snub pistol. The pistol uses tranquiliser darts and the robot's programming allows it to estimate the size and metabolism of the target to automatically adjust the dosage required.

Some facilities will have several of these robots, which communicate with a central computer. The computer can give special instructions for the treatment of unusual animals and the robots can inform it of animal escapees or intruders.

Cargo Handler: Cargo handlers are found in docks, airports, spaceports and starports across the Third Imperium, loading and unloading cargo to free personnel to handle more demanding tasks. Large and heavy enough to carry a standard one-ton cargo container, the cargo handler robot can work as long as is needed and, if properly maintained, has a useful lifespan of approximately 40 years.

**Emergency Responder** : Emergency responders are used in areas during disasters, which would prove too hazardous for living responders. The robots are able to respond under their own initiative but normally overseen by a living supervisor to make important, lifesaving decisions. The robot is able to attend any number of emergencies ranging from fires to earthquakes to toxic material spills.

Emergency responders routinely attend fires, both to fight them and save individuals trapped within. The robots can provide first aid on the spot once a victim has been rescued and is strong enough to move heavy debris or tear through doors or walls. They have proven so successful that similar robots have been manufactured by many companies in the Imperium and beyond.

Eye-Spy Drone: The eye-spy is a small device used in areas where active surveillance is required in an unobtrusive manner. It is approximately the size of a softball and can float some distance from the area to be observed without reduction in capability. Eye-spies often work in groups, connected to a central computer where a living operator can monitor the bots and direct them to areas of interest.

Eye-spies are intelligent enough to detect suspicious behaviour on their own and focus on the disturbance or request additional units to provide backup surveillances, all while alerting the central computer. Occasionally, unusual or unexpected behaviour has confused the eye-spy, causing it to disregard a threat, hence the desirability of a living supervisor.

Horticulture Bot: Horticulture bots are almost routinely used by Geonee in maintaining their central courtyard gardens and their use has been extended to space habitats and starships. The horticulture bot uses tentacle arms to tend plants and is able to diagnose and treat plant diseases as well as eradicate minor pests. A small grav unit give the robot the ability to tend vertical gardens as easily as horizontal ones.

**Luggage Bot:** Luggage bots are a common sight in almost every starport. They are essentially a suitcase mounted on a simple robot chassis. Sensors and basic programming allow the robot to identify its owner and obey simple tasks such as 'follow me', 'stay', 'open' and so forth. Slightly more complex commands can be given if the robot is loaded with site floor plans, allowing it to deliver itself to a room or meet its owner somewhere.

More expensive models come with other features, such as additional security or an ability to pack or unpack themselves.

Maintenance Bot: The maintenance bot is a common feature at many starports, although few Travellers ever get to see them. Operating in maintenance and construction bays, their programming allows them to diagnose and repair ships without the intervention of a sophont. They are able to obey a large number of commands, as well as act under their own limited direction. The maintenance bot comes installed with full mechanical and electronic tool kits.

### MEDICAL

The Geonoee have full access to all drugs and medical advances available within the Imperium. They have also made significant medical discoveries of their own.

Focus Drug: Primarily used during interrogations or debriefs, focus drug sharpens the senses, allowing the user to notice even the smallest changes in facial expressions or body language, increasing the chance to detect lies. The drug is taken orally and provides DM+2 bonus to Perception checks. While under the effect of the drug, the imbiber's pupils will dilate slightly. The benefits last approximately 10 minutes, after which the imbiber suffers DM-2 to Perception checks for one hour. Further doses of focus drag are ineffective if taken within this hour. The drag is normally only available to military or law enforcement but can be found on the black market, although the price will be significantly increased.

Ite m TL Kg Cost Focus Drug 10 — Cr800

Minidoc: A compact version of an autodoc, the minidoc is a hard sleeve or cuff worn on the upper arm containing sensors that constantly scan the wearer and uses the readings to perform diagnostics and provide medication and medical care. The minidoc is paired with a reclining seat, view screen and store of medical supplies – the sleeve on its own is just a diagnostic unit. The screen provides up-to-date data on the patient as well as diagnoses. Unlike an autodoc, a minidoc cannot perform surgery but can give ongoing medical care. It is programmed with an expert system which emulates the Medic 3 skill.

At TL14, the entire unit is more compact and consumes less space but is essentially the same model.

Item TL Kg Cost Minidoc 13 150 Cr75000 Minidoc 14 100 Cr100000

Recall Drug: Recall drugs are used to bring memories into sharp focus, allowing the imbiber to relive them anew and perhaps notice things that may have been missed when the event actually occurred. The drug is taken orally, normally in pill form and allows the imbiber to vividly remember a single event. The drug also provides DM+2 to Recon or Investigation checks the imbiber makes to see things they did not notice during the event. The drug only lasts for 10 minutes before the

effect wears off. The after effects of taking it is similar to a hangover and inflicts DM-1 to all checks for 1D hours. Multiple doses may be taken to extend the length of recall but each dose doubles the penalty time.

Item TL Kg Cost Recall Drug 11 — Cr500

### MELEE WEAPONS

Moon Blade: Moon blades are semi-circular blades often used in pairs. The weapons have a traditional place among the Geonee and are part of the uniforms of both army and navy. The blades are not only used as weapons but also props in traditional military dances. It is forbidden for a woman to handle a moon blade.

The magazine is actually a 'smart-matter bank', which contains a dense and malleable polymer that forms ammunition of various masses on the fly. This allows the damage of the weapon to be finely adjusted from a minimum of 1D to the maximum of 2DD. The AP trait can also be adjusted downwards by altering the shape and mass distribution of the projectile.

Heavy Gravitic Cannon: The heavy gravitic canon has the same advantages as the gravitic cannon but is built to a larger scale and able to deliver greater damaging potential at a longer range.

Gravitic weapons have never gained traction in the Imperial armed forces but the Geonee have taken a particular shine to them and favor their use.

CSC: Geonee

# VEHICLES OF THE GEONEE

Geonee design their vehicles with a short stature in mind, making them somewhat uncomfortable for taller races to use. Vehicles intended to be sold outside the Geonee Cultural Region are more designed with the comfort of their intended market in mind.

Geonee make significant use of gravitic technology but often limit its ability to gain altitude, particularly in private vehicles. This allows the Geonee to keep higher altitudes free for military or commercial uses while still providing the versatility of grav vehicles to private individuals.

### GOSTA LIGHT TANK

The Gosta light tank packs a powerful punch for its relatively small size. The tank handles extremely well in almost all conditions and is armored enough to take a serious beating. An advanced anti-missile laser system provides adequate protection from missiles. The four-hour life support system combined with the hostile environment modifications means that even during a nuclear exchange, the Gosta keeps its crew alive. It is normally operated by a crew consisting of a pilot, gunner and commanding officer.

### BRANAK SUPERHEAVY TANK

The Branak is a terrifying vehicle, able to weather enormous damage while delivering a devastating barrage of fire. The linked heavy gravitic cannons are its main armament, backed up by a pair of plasma missile racks. The tank also bears four light autocannons for anti-infantry engagement. The tank has a crew of nine –
commanding officer, pilot and seven gunners.

Vehicles of the Geonee

### HIGH GUARD OF THE GEONEE

Geonee military vessels are built at the shipyards on Lagna and surplus ships purchased from the Imperium are refitted to a TL15 standard, sometimes stripping them back to their bare superstructure and rebuilding. While this leaves only two planets, Lagna and Tlasov, where ships can undertake major repairs or maintenance, it does provide the Geonee Cultural Region with an advanced fleet in the case of emergencies.

Civilian ships are built at the Imperial average TL12, so they can be maintained and repaired with greater convenience no matter where the crew find themselves.

Ships of Geonee manufacture tend to be quite blocky in appearance, with few if any rounded edges. Streamlining is not common except on vessels that routinely traverse atmospheres. Some liken the look of these vessels as similar to the Geonee themselves –
short, stocky and powerful.

They favor fast vessels with excessive computer power, so most Geonee craft have the fastest maneuver drives possible installed alongside the highest bandwidth computers available. While this makes Geonee ships much more expensive than their counterparts, the benefit of increased velocity and additional number of programs run simultaneously more than compensates.

Decks are somewhat lower than those found on other ships, more suited to the shorter stature of Geonee. This provides more space between decks for vessel infrastructure, large enough for a Geonee or sophont of similar stature to crawl through comfortably. Staterooms for single Geonee males are the same as those found on human vessels but those of a married Geonee must be large enough to house a Chirper as well. This is normally two staterooms side-by-side with internal access for both to share. Married Geonee who have their wife aboard the ship will have a stateroom set aside for her, normally with internal connections to his stateroom.

Many larger military vessels are purchased as military excess or an obsolete purchase. These ships are intensively refitted and brought up to TL15 as a matter of course. Because these larger vessels are bought when they become available, the Geonee generally only have a small number.

These scouts are the most common starship found within ADRAT, their main mission to search for lost advanced technology. Each ship has a fully equipped laboratory large enough for two researchers and the computer is programmed to assist in research. A detachable base module allows crew to establish a

temporary research facility on the surface of a planet, freeing the scout for other duties and the vault is a security measure used to protect valuable finds. The scout has a nominal crew of three but has enough staterooms for a scientist and can accommodate a total of eight individuals if double bunking.

The Brekat SDB is a heavily armed and armored fighting vessel used to patrol Geonee systems. The design has received favorable reviews by the Imperial Navy and can be found operating in planetary navies many subsectors away from the Geonee homeworld.

Armed with a small missile bay and two fusion barbettes, the Brekat is offensively powerful, while heavy armor and triple beam laser turrets provide an adequate defensive screen. The SDB normally boasts a complement of 20 marines providing both internal security and boarding forces, and its modular cutter and two boarding pods are also piloted by marines.

The Tagor is based on the spaceframe of the Gormandoacy-class, which is the predecessor for the Midu Agashaam-class destroyer. The Gormandoacy has been considered obsolete for some time and when several were made available by the Imperial Navy, the Geonee Self Defence Navy purchased as many as they could.

The process of refitting and upgrading the class proved successful and in almost every way the Togor is far superior. While the main weaponry was saved, laser turrets were upgraded along with the maneuver drive, creating a fast response vessel. Currently the Geonee Self Defence Navy have five Tagors in their fleet but hope to increase the number as more Gormandoacy vessels are removed from service in favor of the Midu Agashaam.

# THE DOLPHINS

Dolphins are spread across Charted Space, primarily within the Third Imperium and the Solomani Confederation. Some Dolphins were uplifted by the Ancients and planted on other worlds. These are the Dolphins most likely to be found in the Spinward Marches. Others were uplifted by the Solomani of Terra. Genetically enhanced and raised to sentience by the Solomani corporation GenAssist, Dolphins are one of the most successful uplifted animals from Terra. Developed during the Interstellar Wars period, they assisted Solomani colonization on water worlds.

The Imperium views Dolphins as an autonomous Minor Race. Solomani humans see Dolphins as junior Solomani partners; less than human Solomani but higher than other non-Solomani races.

### NATURAL EVOLUTION

The natural evolution of cetaceans on Terra is still something of a mystery. While the dietary pattern and teeth structure of the modern Dolphin indicates they

As noted, Dolphins have been uplifted at least twice in their history and this has led to some differences between the Dolphins found in Charted Space. A noted difference will be found in the section on Dolphin Travellers (see page 168)
and those found on page 35 of Behind the Claw. Those differences apply purely to the Dolphins uplifted by the Solomani.

While this book primarily covers Dolphins uplifted by the Solomani, most of the material found in this chapter is also suitable for Dolphins uplifted by the Ancients.

descended from carnivores, the structure of their stomachs and certain biochemical components link them to ungulates such as cattle.

Fossil evidence indicates cetacean precursors began returning to the oceans approximately 50 million years ago, when much of the earth was covered in shallow seas. In certain places, such as North Africa, competition for food on land was intense. In response to this, the proto-cetaceans began to forage for food in the ocean. As time passed, natural selection favored those which could swim faster or hold their breath longer. The first true cetacean appeared approximately 38 million years ago and the genus Tursiops first appeared in the fossil record about five million years ago.

### GENASSIST

GenAssist was established by the Solomani during the Interstellar Wars period. With their successes against the crumbling First Imperium, the Terrans found themselves acquiring more and more alien worlds. GenAssist was founded to assist in the colonization of new worlds, charging them with the adaption of native Terran life forms to alien biomes.

After a few initial missteps, one of which almost destroyed the natural ecology of Ishimshugli in the Sol subsector, GenAssist began to produce great breakthroughs in the understanding and implementation of genetic engineering techniques.

While scientists at GenAssist were hard at work making physiological modification to Terran livestock, agricultural crops and even humans, a splinter group within the organization began to look at other possibilities. Over the next several decades, under the guidance of Dr Francisco Montes and, later, Dr Victor Haerinck, modifications were made to the brains of several Terran life forms such as cetaceans, pachyderms, ursines and canines. By far, the most successful improvements were made to various cetacean species.

Early in their research, they abandoned work with the species Orinus orca which, although progressing towards true intelligence very rapidly, was deemed far too large to be easily transported off world. Although some fought the decision, GenAssist directors held fast; the firm's charter specified work was to be aimed at the promotion of offworld colonization.

One-by-one, other programs fell behind in progress and were dropped from the project. In the end, only the species Tursiops truncates was left. With the full attention of the GenAssist Sophontology

Program focused on them, the Dolphin rapidly attained true intelligence and, in -1988, just prior to the collapse of the Rule of Man, a handful of Dolphin colonies were seeded along the rimward frontiers of what is now the Solomani Sphere.

### PHYSIOLOGY

Dolphins are carbon-based aquatic mammals that are warm blooded, breathe oxygen, bear live young and produce milk. They are identified as bilaterally symmetrical tripeds, with a single tail (fluke) used for swimming locomotion assisted by two limbs (flippers). The triped designation is erroneous however, as Dolphins have a quadruped, land-based, ancestry. Some Dolphins possess vestigial leg bones near their hips and, in rare cases, a Dolphin is born with a second pair of vestigial flippers where the hind legs would have been. These atavistic remnants are left intact until the Dolphin is old enough to decide to have them surgically removed, or kept, as they see fit.

Dolphins have an internal skeleton that is composed largely of calcium and other trace minerals. The skeleton helps support the body of a Dolphin in water and assists in blood cell production, as well as storage for calcium which is used to activate muscle contraction.

Dolphins, like humans, are air breathers. A haemoglobin based circulatory system transports oxygen around the body and they have a single nostril, known as a blowhole, on the top of the head, consisting of an opening with a muscular flap. The flap is closed when the muscles are relaxed and open when they are contracted. Dolphin are voluntary breathers and must deliberately open their blowhole to breath.

Inhaled air is taken into a pair of lungs where oxygen is extracted and replaced by carbon-dioxide. Dolphins are able to store twice as much oxygen in their muscle cells and pancreas in proportion to their body weight as humans and are able to hold their breath for 15 minutes at a time, yet in practice many Dolphins wear air tanks to allow greater duration of underwater operations. When swimming near the surface (or when using air tanks) Dolphins breathe two to six times a minute but after a deep dive or a period of exertion this may be increased to eight times a minute.

Male Dolphins typically weigh 200–650 kilograms and measure between 2.75 and 4 meters from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the powerful tail and flukes. Females tend to be somewhat smaller on average.

Dolphins bear a strong resemblance to their _Turspiop_ ancestors, as witnessed by their rostrum, flippers and tail fluke. Their skin is rubbery to the touch, and colouration ranges from purple-black, brown or grey along the dorsal surface, graduating to light-grey or white on the ventral surface. Albinism occurs rarely.

Several anatomical modifications were made by GeneAssist during the uplift program. The brain, which is 1.5 times the size of a human brain, has increased folds on the surface and therefore a great number of neurons. To assist with tool use, the front flippers have been enhanced with two small prehensile digits – a thumb and forefinger – drawn from the phalanges found in the skeleton. Lastly, their larynx (Dolphins do not have vocal cords) were manipulated in an attempt to allow them to simulate human speech. This last modification proved to be highly successful, enabling Dolphins to speak without artificial aid with humans and other races.

Dolphins gestate their young, known as calves, internally, usually for a period of 13 months. Births normally occur underwater and consist of a single calf, although twins do occur occasionally. Calves are born relatively independent, able to swim for themselves shortly after birth and can vocalise a few days later. Calves do need assistance to be taken to the surface of the water for their first breath of air. Birthing Dolphins normally have the assistance of one or more midwives.

Calves are born tail first and are about one meter long and 11–18 kilograms in weight. The mother nurses the young with milk from her mammary glands and the calf feeds frequently through the day and night. Calves continue to suckle for three to four years and will remain with the mother for a few years after being weaned. Dolphins are considered adults at the age of 14. Unlike their wild ancestors, the rearing of young is shared between males and females.

Dolphins share similar senses to humans but differ somewhat; hearing is particularly keen, with their auditory range extending into the ultrasonic. There are two small ear openings behind the eyes. The auditory cortex of the Dolphin brain is highly developed and the auditory nerve is approximately twice the diameter of the human analogue, leading to more rapid sound processing. In addition, the auditory nerve supply in a Dolphin is three times that of humans, providing more ultrasonic information to their central nervous system.

### WHITESIDE DOLPHIN

The Whiteside Dolphin ( Lagenorhyncus obliquidens galactus ) is not as well-known as its bottlenose cousin. Whiteside Dolphins are a much younger race resulting from work completed shortly before the start of the Solomani Rim War. The intention behind their creation was to produce a race of Dolphins that was smaller and easier to transport than the bottlenose species and was based on the Pacific Whiteside Dolphin. These Dolphins grow to a length of 2.1 to 2.4 meters and mass up to 150 kilograms. The two Dolphin races are natural and enthusiastic allies of each other, frequently intermingling with each other and will often mate together, creating infertile hybrid offspring.

Whiteside Dolphins do not require the additional space requirements on spacecraft and vehicles as their bottlenose cousins.

### CREATING WHITESIDE DOLPHIN TRAVELLERS

Whiteside Dolphin Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR +2, END +2, SOC -4.

Traits Whiteside Dolphin Travellers have the same traits as their bottlenose cousins as detailed on page 168.

### CAREERS

Whiteside Dolphins have the same career options as their bottlenose cousins as detailed on page 168.

Dolphins have a form of sonar known as echolocation, which locates objects by producing sounds and listening for echoes. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is produced in a focused beam in front of the Dolphin and when the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, they bounce off and come back to the Dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the Dolphin the shape, size, speed, distance and location of the object. They can hear the echoes through their ears but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming and the Dolphin adjusts by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. The interclick interval also decreases as the Dolphin nears the target, as they wait for each

click's echo to return before clicking again. Dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an 'echoic image' or sound picture of their targets.

Around the blowhole and rostrum is a structure known as a 'melon'. A bioacoustic component, the melon provides a means of focusing sounds used in echolocation as well as creating a similarity between the characteristics of its tissue and surrounding water so acoustic energy can flow out of the head and into the environment with the least amount of energy loss.

Dolphins have acute vision both in and out of the water, with eyes on the side of the head. They have a double split pupil, allowing for similar visual acuity in air and water, and the eye is adapted to mitigate varying light intensities. In air, the lens and cornea of the eye correct for refraction of light caused by transition from aquatic to aerial vision. Without this adaptation, Dolphins would be near-sighted in air. They see somewhat better in the dark than humans, having a well-developed tapetum lacidum , which reflects light through the retina a second time to allow low light vision. Due to this adaptation, a Dolphin's eyes glow in the dark.

Their skin is sensitive to vibrations and concentrated nerve endings around the eyes, blowhole, genitals and rostrum lead these areas to be more sensitive to vibrations than elsewhere on their body. Dolphins have a limited capacity to taste, only being able to detect flavors of sweet, bitter, sour and salty. Additionally, they have no sense of smell.

Dolphins are completely aquatic and unable to survive out of water without artificial assistance. Their powerful tails are able to propel them at six kilometers per hour, with burst of speed up to 30 kilometers per hour when needed. They normally swim at a depth above 30 meters but can dive up to 300 meters when needed. Dolphins are also completely immune to caisson disease (the bends), a constant hazard to human divers.

To protect them from the cold, Dolphins have a thick layer of fat tissue called blubber. Blubber differs from other forms of fat in its extra thickness, which provides an efficient thermal insulator, making it essential for thermoregulation. Blubber is also richer in blood vessels than other fatty tissues. Not only does it protect from cold, it adds to buoyancy. In times of food shortage, blubber can be metabolised for energy.

When sleeping, Dolphins are able to keep one hemisphere of their brain active while the other hemisphere shuts down. The active hemisphere allows the Dolphin to surface and breathe while sleeping. They must sleep for approximately eight hours every day, either as a single block or broken into smaller units. When sleeping, Dolphins remain near the surface and swim slowly, occasionally closing one eye.

### LIFESPAN

Dolphins with access to modern medicine and living conditions can expect to live for 55 to 65 years. Those living in more primitive areas have a shorter lifespan due to poor living or environmental conditions and lack of medical advances. Dolphins are able to increase their life expectancy with the use of anagathics and other life extending technologies.

### DIET

Dolphins are obligate carnivores, derived from chaser/carnivore stock. They favor fish as their primary source of nutrition but also enjoy prawns, squid, molluscs and cuttlefish, swallowing only the soft edible parts. Dolphins require approximately 10 kilograms of food a day; more when they are particularly active. They do not ordinarily cook their food, preferring to eat it raw but, given opportunity and tools, Dolphins have been known to prepare food with various cooking techniques, especially when serving to other races.

They are able to adapt their diet to the ecosystem they live in if it has suitable lifeforms. Despite their carnivorous nature, Dolphins take great joy in sampling new foods and experiencing new tastes.

### SOCIETY

Dolphins are a gregarious and social race, craving the company of others. They enjoy being among their own kind and enjoy the company of most other races as well.

Their societies tend towards either communal anarchy or participatory democracies and on their own Dolphins tend towards non-hierarchical structures. The most common form of Dolphin social structure exists on several tiers, from a large grouping down to small collections of individuals. The largest social structure is the clan, which can consist of several hundred to hundreds of thousands of Dolphins from many different families. Clans are headed by elders; the oldest Dolphins in the group. Elders can be of either gender. The elders are not

exactly the leaders of a particular clan, although their opinion is respected and sought after, as they are seen as the wisest of the community.

**CLANS AND PODS**
Clans are best thought of by humans as a city or town of Dolphins, consisting of as few as 100 individuals or as many as 100,000. Clans interact with each other and members of one clan are free to join another as they choose, much as humans are able to move between cities or towns. Clans are associated with a territory such as a bay, estuary or other coastal feature. The term territory is somewhat misleading however, as Dolphins in no way feel they own this area. The term more accurately applies to the territory as it is able to support the number of Dolphins living within it and territories can grow and shrink with the size of the clan inhabiting it.

Clans are broken up into pods, which normally consist of two to 30 individuals, although superpods are not unheard of and can have over 1,000 members. Pods provide various functions within the clan and fall into four main types; nursery pods juvenile pods, bachelor pods, and elder pods. These groupings are open structures and Dolphins will often freely move between pods in their vicinity with no permanent 'membership' in any. While pods have no rigid structure, there is a social order amongst the members; the Dolphin with the highest SOC holding perceived influence over those with lower SOC.

Nursery pods consist of mothers, their still nursing calves and pregnant females, with a number of midwives who assist with the birthing and caring of young. Mothers and young will remain in the pod until the calves no longer need to be under direct care, normally at the age of three or four. Midwives remain as members until they are too old or infirm to be a useful member.

When a calf is weaned and able to fend largely for itself, roughly at the age of five, it joins a juvenile pod, although it will frequently return to spend time with its mother. The amount of time it spends with its mother declines as the Dolphin gets older.

Juvenile pods consist of both male and female Dolphins, along with one or two elders whose responsibility it is to educate the juveniles. Each pod provides a different type of education, such as life basics, academic pursuits, social education and theological studies. Juveniles will move from one

pod to another learning what streams of education interest them. The members of these pods engage in socialization and establish a prelude to mating. When a Dolphin reaches adulthood at approximately 14 years of age, they join a bachelor pod.

Bachelor pods consist of groupings of adult male or female Dolphins and are never of mixed gender. As adults, Dolphins tend to form close same-sex partnerships with one or two others, which can last anywhere from 10 years to a lifetime. These partnerships traditionally consist of related individuals but this is far from the rule and bonding can occur for any number of reasons. Bonded Dolphins will work together in a variety of activities such as co-operating in team sports, aiding each other in hunting, joining the same profession and attracting the attention of a member of the opposite sex.

When Dolphins reach the age of 45 to 50, they join elder pods. The Dolphins in these pods are seen as the holders of wisdom and knowledge within a clan. Elders are responsible for the education of juveniles, are the keepers of tradition and, when necessary, the adjudicators of justice. While not the leaders of a clan by any stretch of the imagination, elders are highly respected individuals and their opinions are not lightly ignored.

### FAMILY

Dolphins have no concept of marriage or monogamy but do form close relationships and hold blood connections in high esteem. They favor polyamorous bonding, where each individual is free to pursue other relationships at will. Polyamorous groups, like pods, are open structures with no clear hierarchy. An individual may be a member of a single polyamorous grouping or many, as they choose, making relationship ties at times difficult to follow. Relationships between Dolphins may last from a single encounter to several years, decades or a lifetime.

They have no taboos regarding the gender of mates. Same sex partnerships are as equally valued as opposite sex partnerships. In a similar vein, Dolphins have no taboos regarding platonic or intimate relationships with other races.

The connection of blood relatives is very important to Dolphins, especially the connection between mother and child. A Dolphin learns its first lessons from its mother; how to communicate, how to behave in a pod, the fundamental basics of life such as what is safe to eat, how to hunt, social interaction

and dangers to be wary of. The bond between a mother and child holds the highest social value. This relationship is of such importance that if a young Dolphin loses its mother, they will be adopted by another female Dolphin to continue raising and educating. Once a Dolphin is weaned and begins to mix with others, the bond with their mother weakens but still remains an important aspect of their lives.

Dolphins also form relationships with their father and siblings, although this is less close. Fathers leave the majority of the raising of young to the mother and other members of a nursery pod until the calf joins a juvenile pod. At this point, a father becomes more involved in the life of the calf, providing guidance, advice and further education.

The relationship with grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins are not as deep as those with the immediate family but still close compared to those of other races. Grandparents are often held in some awe and respect by their decedents.

Dolphin families, by their very nature, are complex and intertwined. While Dolphins have no trouble understanding these ties, other races tend to find it hard to untangle the web of interconnectivity between Dolphins and their relatives.

### OUTCASTS

Despite the importance of family and social interaction holds for Dolphins, there are individuals referred to as outcasts. These Dolphins belong to no clan or pod, and tend to live alone, although some will gather into a pod with other outcasts. Dolphins become outcasts for a number of reasons, the primary of which is being banished from their clan for a crime and are shunned by other Dolphins.

Dolphins may also become outcasts if they lose all members of their family and clan, either to disease or some other disaster. These sad individuals will often seek to join another clan as soon as possible who welcome these outcasts into their number quickly but Dolphins suffer greatly at the loss of their family and clan, and some choose never to join another clan again. They are seen as objects of pity by their fellows but their choice to remain alone is respected. However, outcasts can be viewed with some suspicion by other Dolphins until the reason for their banishment is known.

It is not unusual for outcasts to seek the family and social interaction they crave within another race. In these cases, Dolphins will treat the other members of the group as they would their own family or pod and, in this way, Dolphins are able to undertake roles and careers without the Dolphin companionship they would otherwise not be able to.

**JOCULARITY**
Dolphin predilection to jocularity is a usual part of their psychology. They are a fun-loving race, prone to seeing the humorous side to most situations. Most Dolphins find no point in taking everything seriously, often to the point where other races find their mind-
set distracting and annoying.

They are consummate jokers, both practical and intellectual. Nothing can make a Dolphin laugh more than a good practical joke; while never intentionally harmful, practical jokes are intended to embarrass the target in a good natured and friendly fashion. Competitions where Dolphins try to outdo each other with more and more elaborate practical jokes are not uncommon. Unfortunately, Dolphins are just as happy to inflict their practical jokes upon other races, some of whom may not take them in the light-hearted manner they were intended.

Intellectual jokes told by Dolphins tend to fall flat amongst other races, who can find them rather droll. Dolphins, on the other hand, find them outrageously funny. Dolphins do not like long drawn out jokes, as they find them boring.

**GREGARIOUSNESS**
Dolphins are a naturally gregarious race. They find comfort and pleasure in the company of other Dolphins and also enjoy the company of many other races but are particularly fond of humans. It is not unusual to find Dolphins forming strong bonds with humans and wanting to spend as much time with them as possible. These relations can also move into the realm of intimacy and while Dolphins are not averse to forming strong intimate bonds with other humans, the majority of humans find this distasteful.

This sense of gregariousness extends to the Dolphin love of play, which is an important part of their social interaction. Play helps form bonds with other Dolphins and this extends to other races; nothing will encourage friendship with a Dolphin more than an invitation to play a game. They find joy in games as simple as catch or tag, to impromptu sessions of
'keeping off', all the way to complex team sports and tabletop games. Game playing is an important form of stress release for Dolphins.

Despite this general gregariousness, there are several races that Dolphins do not like to associate with. They generally detest Gurungan – and the feeling is mutual – and do not get on at all well with Luriani where, again, this dislike is reciprocated. Dolphins tend to avoid and distrust Orca.

When Dolphins are forced to be alone, they often fall into a depressive state and lone Dolphins can be miserable in the extreme. They can refuse to eat and neglect their personal hygiene and, in the worst cases, they can lose their grip on sanity leading to hallucinations, schizophrenia and psychotic episodes.

### SUCCOURING

Dolphins have a natural instinctive reflex to go to the aid of injured or endangered cetaceans. Known as 'rescue fever' or 'succour syndrome', this natural reaction to the distress calls of another Dolphin can be wholly overpowering. Although a Dolphin may be able to wilfully escape the effects of a distress call, it is not easy. When a Dolphin succumbs to this, they effectively revert to a pre-sentient state and race to the side of the cetacean in need.

If a Dolphin manages to avoid the syndrome, they may act in a normal manner and take whatever steps they wish to secure the rescue of their endangered peer (or abandon them, if it seems the best thing to do).

### BELIEFS

Dolphins believe in total equality – everything is shared with all and each individual is entitled to the full benefits of all the clan's assets. For example, Dolphins are confused and even appalled at the importance other races place on ownership. Even the concept of becoming attached to an object often eludes them. If a Dolphin needs a tool or item and it is not being used by another, they will quite happily take it and return it when finished.

This attitude can cause some conflict with other races who see the Dolphins' lackadaisical approach as akin to stealing. For example, if a Dolphin sees a piece of unattended jewellery they like and wish to wear it to an event, they will take it for their own use and return it afterwards. If they are then confronted with the apparent 'theft', they will openly admit to their action, not really understanding what all the fuss is about.

Dolphins who spend time among races who value material ownership learn to understand that others do not have the same concepts of equality and will at least ask to borrow an item before taking it. Dolphins often see this a game where they must play 'fitting in'. Even so, it is not unusual for a Dolphin to combine personal generosity with a rather cavalier attitude towards their friends and co-worker's property.

The concept of money and trade is also completely foreign to Dolphins. They just do not understand the point of giving or taking something completely useless (such as money) in exchange for a desired item or service. Although some Dolphins who spend a lot of time among other races develop an understanding of the value money holds for others, to them Credits have no value whatsoever.

The concept of owning land is particularly confusing to Dolphins. As a marine lifeform, the medium in which they live is constantly moving, so they do not understand how anyone can own anything so transitory. They point out that 'the sea is always in motion, so how can you claim a portion of it?' In the same way, Dolphins will point out the land is also in motion (although far more slowly). Dolphin have a concept of territory, although this is based on resource management of an area and has nothing to do with possession or ownership.

Dolphins well integrated into other societies still only have a theoretical understanding of concepts like
'ownership' and 'borders'. Trying to explain human views on such concepts is both irritating (to human and Dolphin alike) and futile.

They believe strongly in balancing their lives with the environment and the health of the environment reflects on the health of those living within it. Dolphins support the preservation, restoration and improvement of the natural environment and in control of pollution and protection of plant and animal diversity. They will only take from nature what they need to survive and will not place undue stress on the environment with overpopulation. As a result of these beliefs, Dolphins are quite active in environmental movements.

Dolphins greatly respect their elders and hold them in particularly high esteem. This extends to a deep respect for previous generations and belief that those who live the longest have the greatest knowledge and wisdom. Elders hold an important place in Dolphin clans. Seen as keepers of knowledge and tradition, they are consulted before any major decision is made. Elders are protected and cared for and if an elder is unable to fend for themselves, a younger relative will happily provide for them. In the rare case an elder has no relatives, an unrelated Dolphin will take them into their care. In some clans, this elder veneration has developed into a religion of ancestor worship.

Related to their veneration of elders, Dolphins within the Solomani Sphere tend to be very loyal to the Solomani government. The reason for their loyalty has very little to do with political philosophies, as Dolphin psychology is radically different from their human patrons. Rather, each and every Dolphin is acutely aware that the Solomani gave them the gift of sophoncy and feel indebted to them for this. The Solomani have not discouraged this way of thinking;
they have fostered it.

Above all else, Dolphins value individuality and freedom as a universal right – all races should be free to follow their own wants, needs, desires and dreams as they see fit. They also believe individuality comes with certain rights and responsibilities to other individuals and the group as a whole. A Dolphin will not attempt to deny another of its right to follow its dreams but that right should not have a negative impact on another Dolphin, pod or clan. A Dolphin is accountable for their actions and decisions, and should be subject to due procedures if those acts harm another. A Dolphin deprived of individuality or freedom will fall into a state of depression, eventually losing interest in eating and then die.

Like others, Dolphins follow a number of different religions, both of their own creation and those of other races. Dolphins do not deny the right of any other Dolphin to follow any religion they choose but those religious beliefs are not free from examination and critical review. Debates between Dolphins of different faiths can be lively affairs and sometimes Dolphins may be swayed from their religious beliefs by the convictions of a solid argument. The Dolphins

**Eee-Squee-Kikik:** This religion ties in very closely with the Dolphin sense of environmentalism. Similar to animism, it professes both animate and inanimate objects have associated spirits, acknowledged to garner favor or appease them if slighted. Clans will have a number of spiritual leaders who are called shamans, normally elders who keep the traditions and act as the main intermediary between the spirit world and the material. A shaman will be consulted in matters of spirituality or asked to intercede with the spirits for an individual or group. Despite having spiritual leaders, any Dolphin may address the spirits as needed.

Eee-Squee-Kikik has no central organization or hierarchy. Each clan follows the religion according to its own tradition and as suggested by its shaman.

The followers of Eee-Squee-Kikik tend to favor particular spirits over others, feeling certain spirits have greater impact on their world. Spirits such as Ocean, Sun, Moon and Earth are particularly revered. Ocean and Moon are seen as intertwined spirits, siblings or lovers who are forever separated and yet forever struggling to come together again. Earth is revered as the spirit on which Ocean is supported, working together to give life and support to all other spirits, yet can also be a dangerous spirit, trapping Dolphins that have beached themselves and leave them at the mercy of Sun. Sun is seen as a dangerous spirit, jealous of Ocean and Moon's relationship and forever keeping them apart. Sun is also seen as a retribution spirit, the one which dries out the skin of Dolphins who have been beached, killing them slowly and painfully. The exact relationships between these spirits varies between groups of Dolphin and differences are common.

The spirits of animals are also acknowledged. Before a hunt, spirits are asked to be generous and to attract the prey they watch over. After the hunt the spirit is thanked for the lives taken. Likewise, the spirits of animals that hunt or injure Dolphins are also acknowledged and appeased to avoid confrontation.

Those who follow the precepts of Eee-Squee-Kikik do not believe in the taking of life except for the purposes of food. The taking of the life of another sophont, or killing for sport, is anathema to them.

**Carboneism:** This belief, which is more philosophical ethos than religion, is most prevalent in the Solomani Confederation and previous areas controlled by the Solomani. It was founded on the premise that the

Solomani genetic scientist, Dr Craig Carbone was divinely inspired to uplift Dolphins and Dr Victor Haerinck was his disciple, chosen to continue the work. They believe it is their manifest destiny to assist the humans of Terra in colonising the stars. While they do not believe that Carbone and Haerink are gods in the metaphysical sense, they do view them as the literal creators of their race. Other Solomani are venerated and seen as guides, mentors and guardians of the Dolphin race.

Carboneism expands on the loyalty many Dolphins feel towards Solomani – they feel they owe the humans an invaluable debt, one they must repay with loyalty and obedience. Some followers of Carbonism are incredibly zealous in their beliefs and quite militant in their outlook (which is unusual for the normally playful and freedom loving Dolphins). They believe quiet strongly that those Dolphins who refuse to follow the way of Carboneism are traitors to their creators and to the Dolphin race as a whole.

Dolphin Carboneists are often recruited by the Solomani military as ocean combat specialists. SolSec also drafts them to be planted into Dolphin clans outside of the Confederation to gather sympathisers to the Solomani Cause and sow unrest among Dolphins loyal to the Imperium.

While they rarely come in contact with each other, Carboneists have a particular hatred for Dolphins uplifted by the Ancients, seeing them as a heresy to their creators. They view them as inferior in every way – little better than trained animals – to the Dolphins created by Carbone and Haerinck. It is not unusual for Carboneists to act aggressively and even violently towards these Dolphins.

### DRESS, ART AND ARCHITECTURE

Dolphins have no taboos regarding nudity and feel no need to wear clothing except for those items which provide protection. In fact, clothing may prove dangerous in a watery environment, potentially slowing down and entangling Dolphins, reducing their agility and posing a drowning risk. When necessary, Dolphins don harnesses and belts to facilitate the carrying of tools and equipment, preferring to wear those that are both utilitarian and attractive. Intricate designs or the addition of small trinkets are common. Dolphins are very aware of their appearance and if they are going to wear anything, they may as well look good wearing it.

Dolphins also have no use for artificial construction, feeling much more comfortable in the open ocean than confined in a restricted area. While they generally have no personal use for buildings, Dolphins do recognize that equipment, machinery and other types of technology may require the protection of a structure. Dolphin architecture tends to be rather utilitarian, conforming to its intended use with no embellishments or decoration at all. When at all possible, Dolphins prefer to use natural materials in their construction, even foregoing anything artificial for natural caves and grottos. All architecture takes into account the effect it has on the environment and great care is taken not to cause undue or unnecessary disturbance in the natural world.

Sculpture is a highly valued art form amongst Dolphins and sculptors are held in a particularly respected light. Dolphin sculpture is generally not representational but rather abstract in nature, designed to illicit an emotional response and typified by organically flowing shapes with intricate detail. Special attention is made to create sculptures that can be viewed with closer inspection via sonar;
internal cavities, textures invisible to the naked eye and hollows which cause sonic resonances are seen as the highest manifestation of the art. To the human eye, Dolphin sculpture is rather ordinary but they do not have the senses to fully appreciate the art form. Regardless, some collectors will pay handsomely for pieces created by a famous Dolphin sculptor.

Dolphins have a particular love for theatre, both of their own and other races' creation. Dolphin theatre tends to be of the comedic variety and will have a moral lesson intertwined into the play. Traditionally a protagonist is featured suffering a number of humorous misadventures as they ignore tradition, go against nature or ignore the wise words of elders. Dolphins do not remain quiet to enjoy plays but like to join in, catcalling and heckling the performers, all in good humor. While humans may find these plays somewhat contrived and naive, Dolphins take great pride in them.

They have also developed an impressive appreciation for the works of the Terran playwright, William Shakespeare, finding great joy in the perceived follies of the protagonists. All of Shakespeare's works have been translated into the Dolphin language and renditions of these plays draw huge audiences of both Dolphin and human alike, especially those put on by renowned troupes.

Dolphins also enjoy watching human performances of Shakespeare's classics but other viewers and the actors themselves can find the Dolphin viewing experience to be rather distracting.

Just as Dolphins enjoy comedy in their theatre, they enjoy almost all comedy in general, regardless of its source. They tend to prefer stand-up or slapstick style humor; stand-up for its apparent spontaneity and slapstick for its exaggerated physical activity and inept use of props.

Song and poetry hold a significant place in Dolphin culture. Dolphins sing for comfort, joy, to pass on information, record their history, entreat spirits to provide a good hunt, thank their prey for their sacrifice and communicate over long distances, among other things. All Dolphins compose their own songs and poems, although some are better at it than others. Song holds a much deeper place in the Dolphin heart than just a source of entertainment but as the very core of their existence and who they are as a people.

Dolphins have only maintained their history orally, passed on through the use of both poetry and song. Important lessons are taught to young Dolphins through song to assist them in memorising the teachings. All Dolphin parents are expected to pass on the most common 'learning songs' to their young but a dedicated profession has arisen to maintain the oral history and traditions of the Dolphin race; the Historian-poet.

HISTORIAN-POETS Dolphins have a long and rich history, which is recorded in song and is remarkable as it records events that occurred before Dolphins achieved full sophoncy. Human historians have made incredible discoveries through the study of these history songs;
there is evidence that Dolphin historical records extend back as far as the Ancients' first visit to Terra but songs from that far back are so intertwined with mythology and folklore that it is difficult to be certain.

Historian-poets hold a unique position within clans. Seen as an intermediary between the elders and the rest of the population, their knowledge is sought after to assist with decision making. As keepers of the past, Historian-poets are able to pass on precedence on previous issues to aid in decision making. Even elders will seek their guidance on important issues before giving advice.

The training of these remarkable individuals begins at an early age when a talent for singing and memory is noted. Once identified, the young Dolphin is assigned to a Historian-poet master who undertakes their assessment and training for the role as a candidate. Learning the traditional basics of composition, melody and song, the apprentice is also taught the basics of poetry and how, for Dolphins, history, song and poetry are intertwined and shape their outlook and guides everyday lives.

If the Historian-poet master feels the candidate has potential, they will take the young Dolphin as an apprentice and their training begins in earnest. The apprentice's education continues until the teacher has imparted all their knowledge, taking approximately eight years. Once their training is complete, the Dolphin is considered a Historian-poet in their own right. At this point, they are expected to travel from clan-to-clan, teaching history and philosophy to juvenile Dolphins and lending knowledge and wisdom to clans and pods as needed.

It is not unusual for Historian-poets to travel to clans on different worlds. This allows them to learn the local history of other clans and to incorporate it into the overall record of the Dolphin race.

When the Historian-poet approaches elderhood, they end their travelling and join an elder pod. They are held in high esteem by the other members of the pod, as well as the rest of the clan. Their advice carries the weight of vast knowledge and wisdom, and is rarely ignored.

Elder Historian-poets will often act as spokespersons for their clan. They are consulted in matters of tradition and asked to provide opinion in matters of dispute.

Outsiders frequently consider elder Historian-poets to be the leaders of their clans. This is an erroneous assumption, as Dolphins have no hierarchical structure within their society. While Historian-poets hold a position of great respect, they have no authority over other Dolphins. This said, it is a most unwise Dolphin who ignores the advice of these highly experienced elders.

### BUSINESS

Dolphins do not have anything approaching businesses or corporations amongst themselves. As mentioned, they have no appreciation for money or trade and some barely comprehend the concept at all.

Despite this, some clans have had to create businesses to deal with the needs of other races. These are rather small within the interstellar scale and normally serve a single function centered on services rather than a manufacturing process. Services such as aquafarming, aquatic research, environmental consultation and aquatic search and rescue are common.

Dolphin businesses bear no real resemblance to similar human endeavors, as they have no internal hierarchy or structure humans understand. Employees tend to come and go as they will and business management seems to be handled as a consensus rather than being directed. Money made through business belongs to the clan as a whole and is spent on items the clan requires but cannot manufacture. Despite these obvious differences, Dolphin businesses tend to do well where they are established.

Dolphins employ members of other races – normally humans but exceptions occur – to oversee their businesses' financial concerns, especially on worlds where the maintaining of monetary accounts are mandated by law. Their lack of understanding of money and accounting makes it difficult for them to perform those tasks for themselves, exposing Dolphin businesses to risk of exploitation. Dolphins generally do not understand why they would be taken advantage of in this manner but are not naive and will vet individuals (or businesses) they hire to take on the financial concerns of their business closely.

Dolphins often become employees of businesses owned by other races, where they are valued for their expertise and skills, tending to work for businesses that have similar values to their own regarding preservation of the environment. Many businesses hire Dolphins to provide environmental advice, such as mining companies seeking to avoid environmental damage or to repair environmental damage that has accrued through past practices.

They frequently find employment in industries which operate in zero gravity, being uniquely adapted to operating in zero-g due to their marine evolution and take to working in these environments much easier than most other races. Both the Imperium and Solomani Confederation make good use of this in their orbital ship yards.

### THE MILITARY

Dolphins generally do not have an organised military, as they do not normally fight amongst themselves. They are aware there can be occasions when an organised military response might be necessary, such as in the case of an offworld invasion or the defence of territory from dangerous lifeforms. For these cases, Dolphins have a semi-military organization they call Guardians. This organization is loose in formation, with no formal rank structure, and only drawn together when needed. Joining the Guardians is voluntary but there is rarely a shortage of individuals willing to defend their clan if called upon.

The Guardians are essentially a combined aquatic army, police and emergency response force but with far less perceived discipline than similar organizations of other races. Like other Dolphin groupings, the Guardians operate on group consensus, taking the advice of elder Guardians in their unit before coming to a democratic decision. Other races find this military style to be highly inefficient but are surprised to find how well it works for Dolphins.

Individual Guardians are trained extensively in unarmed combat, the use of both melee and ranged weapons, armor and, in some cases, battle dress. Experienced Guardians train new recruits, while elder Guardians assign Dolphins to units and brigades. Assignments can be very fluid in nature and can change frequently. Guardians train regularly to maintain their skills and learn new techniques.

Dolphins who live within the Solomani Confederation, and particularly those clans which follow Carboneism, tend to be far more militant in nature when compared to other Dolphins. They routinely have fully organised armies, with all the rank and discipline that comes with it. These units train with human counterparts and exchange programs exist within military services where Dolphins serve directly in a human unit and humans within Dolphin

units for a period of time. Dolphins can be found within the Solomani military forces and the Solomani Confederation has a series of medals designed specifically for Dolphin servicemen.

### LANGUAGE AND NAMING

Dolphins use a language known as Delphinese among themselves, composed of various clicks, rasps, chirps, burps, creaks, hoots and whistles. In many cases the sounds pass far beyond the range of human hearing into the ultrasonic. While some humans are able to learn a rudimentary version of this language, it is virtually impossible for a human to speak fluently or understand.

Due to the spread of Dolphins across Charted Space, Delphinese has evolved into a multitude of dialects. It can take a Dolphin some time to learn a new dialect and errors can be made during the adjustment process but Dolphins rarely find these to be offensive. In fact, errors are often seen as humorous, providing countless hours of amusement at the expense of the equally amused Dolphin who makes them.

For communication with humans and other races, most Dolphins speak ordinary, if somewhat flowery, Anglic. Their voices are high-pitched and somewhat child-like and they tend to repeat clicking sounds
(like 'k' or 't') several times, making it sound like stuttering, and sounds made for letter 'w' tend to turn into high-pitched whistles or squeals.

Dolphins are given a name at birth by their mother, traditionally a derivative of the name the mother was given when she was born. This tradition enables Dolphins to trace their genealogy back for hundreds of generations. Birth names have no direct Anglic translation, as they originate from when Dolphins were pre-sentient. This birth name is used until a Dolphin reaches adulthood at 14, at which point they take on their adult name.

Adult names are either chosen by the Dolphin themselves or given to them by close companions. The adult name is always descriptive in nature, identifying something particular to the Dolphin in question. A name can refer to a Dolphin's colouration, habits or preferences, such as Dawn Wave Jumper, Dances Under Moon, Skin Like Glacier, Scar Under Eye and Laughs at Elders.

Once a Dolphin has chosen or accepted an adult name, their birth name is never used to refer to them again.

Dolphins will use their name when greeting others in a traditional manner; this is important as Dolphin features are rarely as individual as those of humans, so a formal announcement of who they are avoids any confusion. When translated into Anglic, the greeting is quite simply 'It is I, Bitten Fluke', for example. Dolphins will announce themselves in the same way to other races.

To humans, Dolphin names sound like whistles and clicks, such as Teree'ee or Kikilln. The syllables can extend into the ultrasonic, causing humans to miss the complete name. Dolphins are happy with humans and other races who use the Anglic interpretation of their name but do appreciate an attempt for their name to be pronounced in Delphinese, if possible.

NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION Before sophoncy was achieved, humans communicated with Dolphins using a simplified combination of sign language and verbalization. This language is largely lost among humans but Dolphins (especially Historian-poets) remember it. It was mainly a single-direction language, from human to Dolphin, and although understanding would be imparted by the Dolphin with head movements or flipper gestures but they could impart nothing even remotely complex back to humans.

Dolphin Travellers follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

# DOLPHIN TRAVELLERS

### DOLPHIN

Dolphin Travellers have the following modifiers to their characteristics: STR+4, END+2, SOC-4

**Dolphin Traits**
Dolphin Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Cold Resistance:** Dolphins possess a thick covering of blubber, which keeps them warm, providing DM+4 to all checks made to resist the effects of low temperatures.

**Deep Diver (300m):** Dolphins can dive deep underwater, to a depth of 300 meters without risk and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes.

**Echolocation (100m):** Dolphins use a highly sensitive echolocation sense to navigate their environment, effectively allowing them to 'see' underwater or in complete darkness to a range of 100 meters.

**Succour Syndrome:** When Dolphins hear the distress calls of other cetaceans they risk suffering from succour syndrome. If they fail a Very Difficult (12+) Gun Combat or Melee check (1D seconds, INT) both their INT and EDU temporarily drop to 0 and they must immediately swim as fast as possible to the side of the distressed cetacean.

**Swimmer (12m):** Dolphins are superb swimmers and can move through water at a speed of 12 meters.

**STARTING AGE**
Dolphins mature and age more rapidly than humans. Travellers begin their careers at 12 years of age. Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career to gain new skills and experience, and begin aging at the end of their second term at 20. Each term lasts for four years.

**TITLES**
Dolphins do not use the titles of nobility as humans of high SOC do. Within Dolphin society, SOC is an indicator of how well liked and respected an individual is. Dolphins can, and have been, assigned noble titles by humans but among other Dolphins these titles mean nothing.

### CAREERS

Dolphin who live closely with humans in societies at TL7+ have the same access to university and academy pre-career options. Dolphin always apply DM-1 when attempting to enter university but suffer no DM modifier when attempting to enter a Military Academy.

Dolphin careers, in general, are used as described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, there are exceptions:
•  There are two Dolphin-specific careers: Dolphin Citizen and Dolphin Military. A Dolphin may attempt to qualify for careers described in the Traveller Core Rulebook but only after first acquiring the Vacc Suit skill.
•  Dolphin Rogues are usually the last survivors of a family that has been wiped out, an outcast, or are acting as terrorists defending the heritage of their Solomani 'creators' behind Imperial lines.
•  Dolphins cannot become Drifters. Instead, the nomad assignment for Dolphin Civilian replaces Drifter for Dolphins. A Dolphin may automatically enlist as a Dolphin Civilian nomad.
•  Dolphins are unable to become Merchants since the concept of trade and commerce is unfathomable to them or Nobles since they believe in the absolute equality of all.
•  Dolphins enjoy the freedom of space and are naturally curious, finding careers as Scholars and Scouts to be exceptionally rewarding. Dolphins gain DM+1 when attempting to enlist in these careers.

### PSIONICS

Dolphins are as capable as humans in psychic potential, although it is rarely tested for. A Dolphin that has psionic potential is able to pursue the Psion career
(see page 204 of the Traveller Core Rule Book ).

### DOLPHIN SKILLS A

Dolphin with a waldo set can perform just about any skill a human can. Those without are limited to skills that do not require hands or legs. A few other special considerations apply to Dolphins.

**Athletics:** Dolphins use Athletics (dexterity) only for high jumping or long jumping if it begins in the water. Sprinting means fast swimming. Use the normal rules except that a sprinting Dolphin can cover 72 + twice their Effect meters with every check. A Dolphin may not climb. Athletics (dexterity) is also used for catching things with a Dolphin's teeth or rostum. Use Athletics (endurance)
for long distance swimming and Athletics (strength) for tasks such as swatting with a tail or ramming with a rostrum, although actual attacks use Melee (natural).

**Vacc Suit:** This is a very common skill among civilised Dolphins even if they do not serve in space. Dolphins may use their Vacc Suit skill to offset any negative DM inflicted by waldos but may not increase the DM above +0.

**UNAVAILABLE SKILLS**
Dolphin Travellers have some limitations on the skills they receive during their careers and may not gain the Broker or Gambler skills. If one of these skills is rolled, roll for another. If the second result is the same, the roll is lost and the career process continues as normal.

### SOLOMANI CAREERS A

Solomani Dolphin can join the Home Guard or become a SolSec Monitor. One of the more confusing jobs in Solomani Security is making sense of reports provided to the agency by Dolphin monitors watching other Dolphins but SolSec finds them useful for keeping track of human maritime activities.

When in careers other than Dolphin Civilian and Dolphin Military, within the Solomani Confederation Dolphins suffer the same penalties as non-Solomani humans (see page 125 of Aliens of Charted Space Volume 2 ).

### MUSTERING OUT

When rolling on the Benefits table, Referees must keep in mind that items received do not belong to the specific Traveller but rather are considered to be in their possession. Although the difference may seem trivial, it is actually very important. Consider the following: A Dolphin Traveller receives a starship as a mustering out benefit and, after using it for some time, the Traveller encounters a pod of Dolphins, which have been stranded on a world and now lack the resources to return to their home. It would not be out of character for the Dolphin Traveller to turn the ship over to them if the pods' need for it seems greater than their own.

Any Benefit rolls from careers other than Dolphin Citizen or Dolphin Military that result in Armor or Weapon may instead be taken as a travel suit (without waldo). Additional results of the same type can be taken as a waldo or additional travel suits. If a Dolphin already possessing a travel suit and waldo receives an Armor or Weapon result, they may instead raise their Vacc Suit skill by one level.

When rolling on a Cash Benefits table from careers other than Dolphin Citizen or Dolphin Military, all results are reduced to 10% of their Credit value to represent the total lack of interest in, or understanding of, money on the part of Dolphin Travellers.

Benefit rolls resulting in a Waldo, Walker Suit or Travel Suit grant these items to a maximum of TL12.

Dolphin Travellers

#### CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE: DOLPHINS

Due to their anatomy, Dolphins are unable to use many items designed for humans without penalty.

Items which require hands or fingers cannot be used at all unless a Dolphin is equipped with waldos or cybernetic hands. Likewise, any equipment requiring legs or feet are impossible for Dolphins to use. A Dolphin may be able to use some equipment that requires fingers, like a keyboard, by holding a probe in its mouth or using its modified flippers, at the Referee's discretion. This causes any check to go slower without decreasing the Difficulty (see page 60 of the Traveller Core Rulebook ).

In general, other equipment designed for humans may be found or modified for Dolphin use. Protective equipment such as vacc suits, combat armor, rebreathers and so on, must be specifically designed for an individual race and are not interchangeable between species. Such equipment for Dolphins will cost 200% of the normal price.

Electronic equipment must be specially sealed against water when being handled by a submerged Dolphin to avoid detrimental effects but this is a standard feature of all electrical equipment at TL10+.

### PERSONAL PROTECTION

Dolphins use personal protection for a number or reasons, the most obvious being the ability to move and function safely out of water. Other types of protection in the Traveller Core Ruleboo k or Central Supply Catalogue are available to Dolphins but cost 200% the normal price.

Sonar Stealth Suit: Using a special sound absorbing fabric, the sonar stealth suit renders a Dolphin almost invisible to sonar (DM+4 to Stealth checks made against sonar only).

Travel Suit: Travel suits combine gravitic technology with a hostile environment suit and contains a super-
humid atmosphere for the health and comfort of its Dolphin wearer.

The travel suit provides its wearer with complete protection from temperatures ranging from -100^0 C to
+100^0 C^ and pressures of up to 56 atmospheres. They include a fully enclosed helmet including a visor with a heads up display that is tied to an on-board computer/
communications array equal to a Computer/2 with a 500km audio/visual transceiver capability.

Travel suits can be fitted with a waldo for the manipulation of objects built for human hands. The cost and mass for such modification is simply added to that of the travel suit itself.

At TL12, a travel suit has life support for 12 hours of use and weighs 12kg when the grav units are inactive. The travel suit is able to take to the air at up to Slow speed with an Agility equal to the Dolphin's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 25km. By TL15, the suit provides life support for 48 hours and weighs 7kg. The travel suit is able to take to the air at up to Medium speed with an Agility equal to the Dolphin's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 50km.

**Type D Battle Dress:** This battle dress includes all the facilities of the travel suit. However, it is extremely well armored and adds waldos, the full electronics suite for battle dress from page 30 of the _Central Supply Catalogue_ and a sonar-based system with a range of one kilometer which grants DM+2 to Electronic (sensors) checks.

Dolphin battle dress is equipped with waldos at the same TL. Any STR enhancements provided by the battle dress is also afforded to the waldos.

Walker Suit: Walker Suits – also known simply as 'Walkers' – are earlier versions of Travel Suits, providing the same advantages and features as a Travel Suit excluding the gravitic propulsion. Instead, Walkers utilise two pairs of mechanical legs, allowing a Dolphin to move at an equivalent speed to a human
(six meters) outside of water. Like Travel Suits, the interior of the Walker is padded with a cushioning gel that protects the Dolphin from the effects of up to 2-Gs. Walker Suits come with a helmet, visor, heads up display and can be fitted with waldos if desired. The computer/communications array are equal to a computer at the same TL as the Walker, with a 500km range audio/visual transceiver capability. At TL9, a Walker provides life support for up to nine hours of use. At TL11 life support extends to 18 hours of use. At TL14 a Walker provides life support to 36 hours of use.

### SURVIVAL GEAR

The use of survival gear is common among Dolphins who spend a lot of their time out of water. Most other types of survival gear in the Traveller Core Ruleboo k or Central Supply Catalogue are available to Dolphins but cost 150% the normal price.

Grav Belt: A standard issue TL12 grav belt resembles a parachute harness with support, which runs down the back and a series of artificial gravity modules around the waist. The grav belt masses 10 kilograms but once activated this weight is eliminated. A grav belt is able to take to the air at up to Slow speed with an Agility equal to the Dolphin's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 25 kilometers.

Item TL Kg Cost Grav Belt 12 10 Cr100000

Grav Couch: A grav couch is a contoured gravitic sled with padded gel lining providing a comfortable experience for a single Dolphin user. The couch provides no other protection to the Dolphin. Simple controls within flipper reach allow the Dolphin to steer the couch easily and a safety harness ensures the passenger does not come off the device. A grav couch weighs 10 kilograms when the grav units are inactive. It can take to the air at up to Slow speed with an Agility equal to the Dolphin's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 25 kilometers.

Item TL Kg Cost Grav Couch 10 15 Cr50000

Humidity Sleeve: A skin tight body suit with an opening for the head and vent, the humidity sleeve keeps moisture trapped between the skin of the Dolphin and the material of the sleeve, allowing them to operate safely out of water without the fear of dehydration. The suit has built in filters, which help purify the moisture between the suit and the skin, so it can potentially protect the Dolphin indefinitely, although most Dolphin would prefer to remove the suit for cleaning and the introduction of fresh moisture. Care must be taken that the head and vent do not dehydrate and most Humidity sleeves come complete with a soft helmet, which can be used to protect the head if the Dolphin is out of an aquatic environment for extended periods of time.

Item TL Kg Cost Humidity Sleeve 6 1 Cr250

### ELECTRONICS

Dolphins, like many other races with mid to high Tech Level societies love their electronics and a well-
equipped Dolphin Traveller is no exception.

Mouth Finger: This device is a simple mouthpiece clamped between the teeth. A probe extends out of the mouth and can be used to press buttons, type on a keyboard and so forth. Using a mouth finger will slow down a task however, moving the time required down one level on the time chart without granting any bonus to the check.

Item TL Cost Mouth Finger 2 Cr10

Water Proofing: Due to the wet environments that Dolphins live in, all of their electronics (including computers and other equipment) require waterproofing to protect them from water damage if they wish to use them while submerged. By TL10 all electronics are routinely waterproofed as part of their construction.

Item TL Kg Cost Waterproofing 6 +200% of weight +250% of cost Waterproofing 7 +100% of weight +100% of cost Waterproofing 8 +25% of weight +50 % of cost Waterproofing 9 +10% of weight +25% of cost

### MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Most medicines in the Traveller Core Rulebook or the Central Supply Catalogue can be modified specifically for Dolphin use. Such medicines have the same price but cannot be used by other races.

Hydranoraquine: When Dolphins are out of water in a dry environment, their skin quickly dries out, becoming cracked and painful. Hydranoraquine makes a slight alteration to the structure of the skin, protecting the Dolphin from dehydration for up to 12 hours.

Item TL Cost Hydranoraquine 10 Cr500

Oxyplex: This drug artificially increases oxygen absorption in muscle cells and stored in the pancreas, enabling a Dolphin to hold its breath for up to 60 minutes.

Item TL Cost Oxyplex 10 Cr550

CSC: Dolphins

### ROBOTS

Dolphins love robots, which they see as both useful tools and sophisticated toys. It is not uncommon to find a variety in the use of pods involved in business ventures. The only type of robots Dolphins find distasteful are warbots. Heavily armed robots of any sort are generally shunned by Dolphins and if such a robot must be used the weapons are replaced with non-lethal tools such as stunners.

Personal Services Bot: A common robot found among Dolphins, the personal services bot is used to help Dolphins perform tasks they are unable to perform on their own, such as donning a travel suit or a waldo. This egg-shaped robot has four arms articulated at four points, which end in claws with three equally opposable digits.

Sea Shepherd: The sea shepherd is a dolphinoid robot that Dolphins use to assist them in herding and guarding schools of marine life. Several sea shepherds will work with a single Dolphin, responding to commands much like a Terran sheepdog to a farmer. Sea shepherds are also capable of guarding schools of marine life and fighting off predators. These robots are quite capable at the tasks they were designed for, and able to respond to quite complex commands, but are easily confused if placed in situations they are not programmed for.

### PERSONAL AUGMENTATION

Dolphins generally do not favor personal augmentation unless required to overcome a handicap. Even so, some augmentations have been created that assist Dolphins in their careers – such as waldos – and they tend to look upon those devices more favorably.

**Deep Dive Augmentation:** Dolphins who have undergone this procedure have had their airways reinforced, lungs modified to collapse to prevent rupture, air cavities lined with additional blood vessels, which expand under pressure and obliterate airspace, and nanites added which store additional oxygen. With this extensive modification, a Dolphin is able to dive up to 1,000 meters and able to hold its breath for an hour.

Item TL Cost Deep Dive Augmentation 12 Cr500000

**Oxygen Reserve:** An oxygen reserve is an implant which diverts some of the oxygen a Dolphin breathes into an internal tank, allowing them to dive for 30 minutes longer. At TL12, the modification no longer uses a tank but introduces the use of oxygen storing nanites and allows them to dive for up to an hour longer.

Item TL Cost Oxygen Reserve 10 Cr10000 Oxygen Reserve 12 Cr25000

**Prosthetic Arms:** Arms are a permanent artificial prosthetic, which are attached in front of and just below the flippers of a Dolphin. Even when held against the body when swimming to improve streamlining, prosthetic arms produce some drag, reducing a Dolphin's movement to 10 meters and their sprint to 60

- twice their Effect meters with every check.

At TL12 this prosthetic inflicts DM-2 to all checks involving their use. At TL13 this prosthetic inflicts a DM-1 to all checks involving their use and increasing STR +2. At TL15 there is no penalty involved in their use and STR is increased by +4.

This augmentation is not affected by electromagnetic pulse attacks.

Item TL Cost Prosthetic Arms 12 Cr300000 Prosthetic Arms 13 Cr285000 Prosthetic Arms 15 Cr270000

Prosthetic Flukes: Artificial flukes replace those lost to accident or birth defect. This augmentation is not affected by electromagnetic pulse attack.

Item TL Cost Prosthetic Fluke 7 Cr250

Sonar Enhancement: This modification reinforces the larynx, airways and melon, allowing the Dolphin to emit powerful ultrasonic clicks, doubling the range of its sonar.

Item TL Cost Sonar Enhancement 9 Cr500

Swift Fluke Augmentation: This modification reinforces the spine, musculature and nervous system in a Dolphin's tail, increasing swimming speed significantly. The augmentation adds three meters to a Dolphin's speed and increases sprinting to 90 + twice their Effect of an Athletics (dexterity) check in meters.

At TL12, this augment is made from superior materials designed to maximise efficiency. This augment adds six meters to a Dolphin's speed and increases sprinting to 108 + twice their Effect of an Athletics (dexterity) check

Item TL Cost Swift Fluke Augmentation 10 Cr20000 Swift Fluke Augmentation 12 Cr35000

CSC: Dolphins

### UNDERWATER COMBAT

Weapons work quite differently under water. The following adjustments should be noted when using any weapons in an aquatic or fluidic environment.

Melee Weapons: Only stabbing and thrust weapons work underwater.

Ranged Weapons: Firearms that use gunpowder or similar propellants do not work unless otherwise specified in the weapon's description.

Laser Weapons: These weapons have 10% of their normal range underwater. Blue/green lasers are an exception. They cost 120% of the listed price and have 50% normal range under water and normal range in atmosphere. All laser weapons generate a cloud of steam bubbles, which makes the user easier to detect, giving DM+4 to anybody trying to spot the weapon's user.

Gauss Weapons: Do not work underwater unless specified in their description.

Non-laser Energy Weapons: Do not operate underwater. Plasma and fusion weapons explode at the barrel with the effect of a plasma grenade.

Sonic Weapons: More effective underwater than they are in atmosphere. Sonic weapons gain +1 damage per dice.

NEW WEAPON TRAIT: SONIC (-X)
Anyone hit by a Sonic weapon must make an END check with a DM equal to the Sonic score;
if successful, the target is unaffected. However, if the target fails, for the next 1D rounds they will suffer a DM equal to the Effect of the END check to all actions.

Sonic weapons can only work in atmosphere or underwater. Races with acute hearing are particularly vulnerable to Sonic weapons – the effect lasts an additional two rounds for them.

Waldo: A waldo is a mechanical manipulation device used by Dolphins as substitute hands and arms. They are typically worn as a harness but can be built into a travel suit. They consist of two robotic arms with three fingers and a thumb, worn as a harness just forward of the dorsal fin. Waldos first appear at TL9 and are controlled physically by the dolphin's rudimentary thumb and forefinger. They are clumsy and lack strength (DM-2 to all checks involving their use).

At TL12, a surgically implanted neural control plug is used, reducing the penalty in their use to DM-1 and increasing STR+2. At TL15 waldos inflict no penalty in their use and STR is increased by +4.

### WEAPONS

Dolphins have a small collection of weapons that have been designed specifically for use without waldos. A Dolphin with waldos is able to use any ranged weapon a human can.

**Battering Ram:** This weapon functions almost like brass knuckles. The Dolphin variety is held in the mouth, clenched between the teeth.

**Sonic Amplifier:** The sonic amplifier increases the decibels of a Dolphin's ultrasonic click, turning it into a ranged sonic weapon that can render targets unconscious. The weapon is normally strapped to the front of the melon, with the amplifier magnifying the sound and focusing it into a tight beam.

**Sonic Booster:** The sonic booster is similar to the shorter ranged sonic amplifier, increasing the decibels of the clicks a Dolphin makes for echolocation. With a longer range and a greater effective radius, this weapon sees common usage in Dolphin military units.

# VEHICLES OF THE DOLPHINS

Dolphins have a number of vehicles which have been designed with their particular needs in mind. Their vehicles tend to be streamlined for improved speeds underwater, with an internal environment that is super humid to prevent dehydration.

**Crew and Passengers**
Dolphin vehicles must allocate three times as many Spaces to passengers and crew as an equivalent human-operated vehicle would have (so, a Dolphin will require a minimum of 3 Spaces on a vehicle). This includes supports to provide comfort and emergency restraints used in the event of a crash.

### GRAV SLED

Grav sleds are simple, couch-like vehicles Dolphins use for extended travel. Upholstered with gel-filled padding for the comfort of the Dolphin, these vehicles are a common commodity in clans that do not have access to travel suits but frequently deal with surface-dwellers, or for Dolphins who wish to travel further than their travel suit can accommodate. Young Dolphins sometimes modify grav sleds to improve their performance and use them for racing or joy riding.

### HIGH GUARD: DOLPHINS

Only the largest Dolphin clans have the resources required to own their own ships. Despite this limitation, several space worthy vessels have been designed specifically for their use.

Dolphin ships differ from human ships in a number of ways.

**Hulls**
Dolphins prefer standard or streamlined hulls, which can be easily and safely submersed in water.

**Barracks**
Dolphins require twice as much room in their barracks as humans. Barracks are not separated from the rest of the ship and are designed with an open plan in mind, giving free access to other areas of the ship. These barracks consume four tons per passenger and cost Cr100000 per ton. Life support costs remain Cr250 per ton.

**Life Support**
Dolphin ships normally set grav plates at 0-G for comfort, simulating life in an aquatic environment. Grips placed on walls, floors and ceilings facilitate movement throughout the vessel. The atmosphere

within Dolphin ships is maintained at an extremely high level of humidity to prevent their skin from dehydrating. Other races may find this level of humidity somewhat uncomfortable but this will not normally be harmful.

Open Spaces Dolphins do not enjoy being confined in small spaces. This has led to Dolphin ships to be designed as openly as possible with very few doors or even corridors breaking up the interior of the vessel. Only areas such as airlocks and cargo bays, which need to be isolated for safety reasons, are separated from the open design.

Staterooms Dolphins require more room than humans, both to move around and to relax. Dolphins require double-
sized staterooms which consume eight tons and cost MCr1. Dolphins do not require the same level of privacy as humans, so their staterooms are not walled off or isolated but designed to be open to the ship's common areas. Dolphins also have no need for bunks. Dolphins understand some races require more privacy and will occasionally add staterooms with walls and hatches for their use.

# THE ORCA

Orca ( _Orcinus orca sapientus_ ) are a rare race found on only a few worlds within Charted Space, primarily within the Solomani Sphere but a few worlds in the Domain of Gateway also host a population. Orca are commonly thought of as whales but are actually a species of dolphin. The modern Orca is an uplifted race, not to be confused with their non-sophont relatives, which still reside on their native world of Terra.

The Imperium views Orca as an autonomous Minor Race. Solomani humans view Orca as junior Solomani partners; less than human Solomani but higher than other non-Solomani races.

### NATURAL EVOLUTION

The natural evolution of the Orca is still largely unknown. The earliest fossil found on Terra is from the Pliocene Epoch, roughly 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, this ancestor was four meters long and had 14 teeth, which is similar to the number of teeth possessed by dolphins. This implies the ancestors of the present-
day Orca diverged from other cetaceans during the Miocene Epoch (23 million to 5.3 million years ago), corresponding with most other dolphin evolution, which took place near the beginning of the epoch.

**GENASSIST**
GenAssist, a Solomani corporation responsible for the uplifting of many Terran species, was responsible for the modern Orca, a program designed to produce companions suitable to assist the Solomani in the colonization of alien worlds. An offshoot of the same project that eventually resulted in the sophont Dolphin, the Orca project was begun on Terra but cancelled only eight years later. Officially, the cancellation of the project was due to the cost of the program and size of the animal, which would cause problems when transporting them off planet. Rumors persist however, that fear of such a large creature capable of independent thought and action was the real reason for the cancellation.

The project's lead scientist, Rene Hodge, successfully convinced a number of dedicated followers on Sufren (Diaspora sector) to fund the relocation of the project to that planet's unusually (and some say Ancients-manufactured) Terran-like biosphere. There, the project not only thrived but proved to be highly successful and its progeny became a distinctive part of Sufren's culture and heritage.

### PHYSIOLOGY

Orca share much of the same anatomy and physiology as Dolphins. Orca are carbon-based aquatic mammals, warm blooded, breathe oxygen, bear live young and produce milk. They are identified as bilaterally symmetrical tripeds, with two limbs (flippers) used for swimming locomotion assisted by a single tail (fluke). The triped designation is erroneous however, as Orca have a quadruped, land-based, ancestry.

Orca have a single blowhole and powerful upper and lower jaws lined on each side with sharp teeth. Their teeth are curved slightly inward to allow them to capture live marine prey, are very strong and the jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place, while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements.

Orca exhibit dramatic colouring, with glossy black upper surfaces and brilliant white patches on the belly and above and behind the eyes. Behind the dorsal fin, they have a dark grey 'saddle patch'
across the back, although some Orca have pale grey to nearly white backs. By appearing lighter from

below and darker from above this colouring allows the Orca to blend into the ocean environment and camouflage itself from prey.

Several anatomical modifications were made by GeneAssist during the Orca uplift program. The brain has increased folds on the surface, while their larynx were manipulated in an attempt to allow them to simulate human speech.

Orca gestate their young, known as calves, internally, for a period of 17 months. Births normally occur underwater and always consist of single young. Calves are born relatively dependent, able to swim for themselves shortly after birth and can vocalise a few days later. They need assistance to be taken to the surface of the water for their first breath of air.

Calves are born tail first, are about 2.8 meter long and 120–160 kilograms in weight. For the first few days after birth, the dorsal fin and flukes are flexible and pliable but gradually stiffen. The light areas of the young Orca tend to be creamy white to pale yellow or tan rather than white. This usually turns completely white by the end of the first year, although it is not rare for some Orca to retain the yellowing colour into adulthood.

The mother nurses the young and the calf feeds frequently through day and night. Calves continue to suckle for three to four years and will remain with the mother for a few more years after being weaned. Orca are considered adults at the age of 20 and the rearing and educating of young is performed exclusively by females.

Orca generally take four short breaths, called 'blows', 10 to 30 seconds apart and then dive for 15 minutes. They normally dive to a depth of 100 meters but are capable of diving down as deep as 260 meters without ill effect. Unlike humans, Orca do not breathe automatically and must have conscious control or risk drowning. While resting, all members of a pod take approximately the same number of breaths before diving. The blows of mother and young are tightly linked and continue in respiratory synchrony throughout their lives.

Eyesight is equally effective in or out of water. In fact, Orca use their eyesight when 'spyhopping', a technique used when the Orca bobs its head above the surface of the water to spot boats, navigate by shoreline objects and locate terrestrial prey. However, underwater visibility is often less than 50

meters and at night is negligible. Orca have evolved to take advantage of the superiority of sound, which travels four times faster in water than in air and is equally effective day or night.

Orca possess sophisticated underwater sonar, which enables them to perceive their surroundings. Their nasal passages produce a series of extremely fast, high frequency sounds, which bounce off objects and give important clues about their distance, speed, shape, texture and composition. Orca are even able to 'zoom in' on objects by varying the pitch, loudness, duration, angle and breadth of this sonar and then use this information to navigate or locate and chase prey. In addition, Orca use sound to communicate with each other and keep pods together. Different individuals and pods produce distinctively different acoustic signals.

The circulatory system utilises many arteries and veins in the flippers, flukes and dorsal fin, which allow it to transfer heat from the body in warm conditions or conserve heat as they swim in icy seas. Its sheer size also helps conserve heat as its surface area to volume ratio is lower than other mammals. A high metabolic rate increases heat production while a coating of blubber reduces heat loss, streamlines its body to conserve energy and serves as food storage.

An Orca's skin is extremely sensitive to touch and plays an important role in maintaining social connectivity. Orca are extremely sensual creatures and often engage in touching behaviour. Mothers and calves frolic and caress each other regularly from birth and adult males wrestle and roll with each other.

Male Orca typically weigh five or six tons and measure six to eight meters in length. Females tend to be somewhat smaller, weighing three or four tons and measuring between five and seven meters in length. Orca also display a measure of sexual dimorphism, with the dorsal fin of males being significantly larger than those of females, growing up to 1.8 meters and resembling tall elongated isosceles triangles in appearance. Female dorsal fins reach a height of one meter at most and are more curved than those of the male.

### LIFESPAN

Orca with access to modern medicine and living conditions can expect to live for 65 to 95 years, with females generally living longer than males; both

can increase their life expectancy with the use of anagathics. Those living in more primitive areas have a shorter lifespan due to poor living or environmental conditions and lack of medical advances.

### DIET

Orca are exclusively carnivore, derived from chaser/
carnivore apex predator stock. They favor fish as their primary source of nutrition but also enjoy seals, whales and even dolphins, and happily adapt to consume food native to the planet they live on, if compatible. Orca typically require 1% to 3.5% of their body weight in food daily but growing calves eat much more – up to 10% of the body weight during growing periods. Orca eat their food raw and will not entertain the idea of eating cooked food. They also prefer their food alive at point of consumption, something most humans and other sophonts find highly disturbing.

### SOCIETY

Orca are a highly social race with complex and intricate societies. They enjoy the company of their own race very much but tend to hold themselves aloof from others. It is unusual to find an Orca who lives apart from their own people and much more common to find an individual of a differing race working within Orca society.

Such societies tend towards charismatic dictatorships. The most common form of Orca social structure exists on several tiers, from a large grouping down to small collections of individuals.

The smallest social structure is the family group. This consists of the eldest female – known as a Matriarch

- and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters. As females can reach an age of 95, family groups can have many generations living together and number up to 40 individuals, although average 5–10 individuals. Family groups are highly stable with individuals separating only for a few hours at a time to hunt or mate.

When the Matriarch of a family group dies, her eldest daughter assumes her mantle. Any other daughters split away and become Matriarchs of their own family groups, along with their sons, daughters and daughters'
offspring. The sons of the deceased Matriarch will form a bachelor family group with their brothers.

Those Orca who do not have any living direct relatives will often form a close bond with humans or another sophont. While this is not ideal, it does relieve some of the loneliness felt by an isolated individual.

The next largest social structure is the pod, consisting of two to five family groups closely related along the maternal line. Unlike family groups, pods may separate from each other for weeks or months at a time. When family groups come together in their pod, the eldest Matriarch from the component family groups is recognized as the Pod Matriarch.

As a matter of propriety and tradition, male Orca will not mate with any female from their own pod.

Clans, the next largest social structure, are composed of pods which speak the same dialect of Delphenese and possess common but older maternal heritage. Clan territories overlap, mingling pods from different clans. Like pods, clans are led by the eldest Matriarch amongst all the pods.

The next largest social structure is the community, a group of clans which regularly co-mingle. Unlike clans however, communities do not necessarily share the same Delphenese dialect. A community is led by the eldest Matriarch from among its clans, referred to as the Philosopher-elder of her community.

Philosopher-elders have great responsibilities. They hold unquestioned authority within their community and are expected to think of the community as a

whole before the needs of herself or those of her own family group. Philosopher-elders are required to know the familial relationships held among the clans and also expected to attend to matters that effect the entire community and act accordingly in the community's best interest. In matters of dispute which cannot be satisfactorily resolved by clan Matriarchs, they are expected to make a final ruling on the matter.

The Great Pod is the last and largest Orca social structure, though in reality is just a term used as a catch-all for all the Orca on a planet. The Great Pod is led by a council of the Philosopher-elders of each community; traditionally work together for the benefit of every Orca on the planet but just like any other political structure, rivalries and enmities can grow and factions develop, putting Philosopher-elders at odds with each other.

### FAMILY

Orca have no concept of marriage or monogamy. Males openly approach females they are attracted to and interested in mating with. Permission is neither needed nor sought from a Matriarch but is considered good form if the male makes his intentions known. In cases of unwanted attention, a female Orca will seek the assistance of her immediate family or ask for her Matriarch to intercede on her behalf.

Once copulation has concluded the male will leave and return to his own family group. Male Orca show a small amount of interest in their offspring but never become involved in their raising or education.

Orca form the strongest relationships with the other Orca in their own family group and most especially towards their mother. Unlike many sophonts, an Orca will always remain with their mother with whom they the strongest relationships.

Within the family group, all education is provided by females, normally mother to calf but sometimes another close female relative will provide education in areas the mother cannot. When education is sought that cannot be provided by the females in a family group, it will be provided by members of the larger pod. On the occasion when an Orca seeks education from an outside facility, such as a university or college, the entire family will remain within close range of the Orca undertaking instruction. Many education facilities on planets with large Orca populations will have a submersed campus facility where Orca undergo training.

### ORCA MATRIARCHS

Orca are highly social and suffer deep depression when isolated from their own kind. For this reason, Orca have a very strong concept of family. As Orca trace their heritage through the matrilineal line, their society is always matriarchal.

The oldest female in any group of Orca takes up the role of Matriarch, considered the final authority in the group. It is she who will make judgements on what is best for the group, impart punishments when necessary and make rulings in areas of dispute among those under her care. When groups come together, Matriarchs will naturally accede leadership to the oldest female in the larger group who is related to her.

### TOUCH

Touch is extremely important for Orca. Mother and calf will touch each other frequently with a brush of the flipper or trunk, strengthening their bond. This preference for frequent physical contact does not diminish as the calf ages and continues throughout adulthood.

When seeing each other after a period of separation, Orca perform a complex greeting ceremony by swimming closely together and rubbing their bodies against each other. Each family group's ceremony differs slightly from those of other families, serving to help Orca identify from which group another comes from and how closely or distantly related they are. The length and complexity of this ceremony depends on how long the Orca have been apart, lasting from a few minutes to many hours after a long separation.

Orca also enjoy wrestling each other. While it is normally a male activity, females are not actively discouraged from the sport. Wrestling among clans is performed for fun and bonding, and can continue on into adulthood. It has been developed into a sport, enjoyed not only by Orca but by many other sophonts as well. A match between well-known wrestlers will draw Orca from across a world's oceans and be televised to surface dwellers. On planets where Orca have a significant population, wrestling matches are a huge tourist attraction with arenas built to accommodate non-aquatic spectators comfortably.

### ZEN

Orca psychology lends itself to seeing things as they are in the here and now. Many have acquainted this outlook as being very similar to the ancient Terran philosophy of Zen Buddhism, although for Orca it is not a philosophy but their psychology. Orca focus on the present, dealing with situations and problems as they arise.

Given a problem, they will focus on studying it from various angles, putting aside their own preconceptions and prejudices to find the true cause or specificity of the issue. They tend to see everything as interconnected into a single whole

- the parts and the whole are in an inseparable relationship with everything else with no priority over the visible or invisible, or the explicit over the implicit.

This psychology governs how Orca act and react. They will focus on the present, dealing with issues as they arise and experience the world as it is presented to them with no presupposition or expectations on what will occur or transpire. Orca will act when action is necessary and not act when it is not necessary. They view a problem as not being a problem until it becomes a problem.

This leads others to view Orca as at best single minded and at worst frustratingly stubborn, which is both accurate and inaccurate at the same time. Orca will focus on the task at hand and not be dissuaded until the task is complete, be that greeting another, hunting for food, studying a subject or dispatching an enemy. What is certain is an Orca will do what it perceives they need to be doing at a particular time and stop when it no longer needs to be done.

### ALOOFNESS

While Orca are extremely friendly towards each other –
they not only desire but require each other's company

- the same cannot be said of their relationship towards other sophonts. Orca are less friendly than Dolphins and prefer to live apart from humans and other sophonts. They hold no special awe or gratitude to humans for uplifting them, stating solemnly their uplifting occurred when and how it should.

They are not unwilling to cooperate with land dwelling creatures but neither do they have any great interest in developing relations with other beings. They get along with other aquatic sophonts as well as with any other; in other words, they are distantly courteous but have no natural antipathy either. Their relationship with Luriani and Gurungan are the same as that of Dolphins.

Orca who do work closely with other beings treat the relationship in a professional manner, keeping non-Orca at 'arms' length', so to speak. This is not to say their professional relationship suffers due to their standoffish nature, only that Orca will condescend to operate as closely with another sophont as their task or occupation requires and no closer.

Despite their aloofness, Orca see themselves as Solomani, although the majority of them do not hold to the Solomani schema of supremacy. Orca view of their Solomani heritage purely as the origin of their species and a planet of origin in no way indicates an individuals' worth or ability.

**HOMEBODIES**
Orca have not spread far beyond the seas of Sufren, primarily due to their size and the expense of transporting them. Generally, this does not bother most Orca as they rarely seem interested in going anywhere else. There are two major exceptions to this mind frame.

Occasionally the Philosopher-elders of the community will decide that the population on a planet has reached its limit and it is time for a Grand Migration. The clans are asked for volunteers who are prepared to colonize a new world. This is a huge undertaking often requiring millions of Credits for the necessary transport to be chartered. The migrating clan will often be required to borrow money from financial institutions to meet their needs so potential colony sites are closely evaluated for valuable resources to pay back the debt before a destination is chosen.

The other exception is Orca who have lost their mother and have no other maternal ancestor or descendant to attach themselves to. With nothing to hold them back, these Orca will often attempt to leave their home planet to 'see the galaxy', adopting a career that allows them to travel in the company of other sophonts.

### SUCCOURING

Orca have a natural instinctive reflex to go to the aid of injured or endangered Orca. Known as 'rescue fever' or 'succour syndrome', this natural reaction to distress calls of another Orca can be wholly overpowering. Although an Orca may be able to wilfully escape the effects of a distress call, it is not easy. When an Orca succumbs to this syndrome, they effectively revert to a pre-sentient state and race to the side of the Orca in need.

If an Orca manages to avoid the syndrome, they may act in a normal manner and take whatever steps they wish to secure the rescue of their endangered peer (or abandon them, if it seems the best thing to do).

### BELIEFS

Like Dolphins, the concept of money and trade is completely foreign to Orca. They just do not understand the point of giving or taking something completely useless (such as money) in exchange for a desired item or service. Trade with Orca can be exceedingly frustrating, for both trader and Orca alike. For this reason, many Orca who trade with other races use a third party to represent them, usually a company or organization that conducts trade on the Orca's behalf and manages their financial affairs.

Much like their smaller cousins, Orca are also strong advocates for environmental preservation. They believe all things have a natural cycle, which should be interfered with as little as possible. For example, it is perfectly normal and acceptable for a kelp field to die back due to shift in water temperature, overgrazing of herbivores or through natural accident. On the other hand, if the death of the kelp field is due to outside interference, such as pollution or artificial climate change, all measures should be taken to prevent it. For this reason, Orca are careful not to overtax hunting grounds by overuse, moving from one to another regularly and changing what they prey on to allow the environment to achieve balance.

### ORCA WORLDS

Apart from Sufren, there are only a few other worlds that have significant Orca populations. New Challenge (the Glimmerdrift Reaches) has a population of Orca numbering in the many thousands – the exact number is unknown and Orca are somewhat reluctant to make any attempt at a census easy.

Orcana (Gateway sector) also has a significant population of Orca.

Terra (the Solomani Rim), the home of the pre-
sophont orca has seen a return of uplifted Orca. Modern Orca see their pre-sophont cousins only as animals, a link to their past. They find they have a kinship with them, similar to the kinship Terran humans have with domesticated canines. Orca even train pre-sophont orca to assist in aquafarming. Their close visual similarity does, however, confuse others somewhat, which perturb modern Orca, feeling the differences between the two species is patently obvious.

Some other worlds have small Orca populations but not significant enough to mention here.

Orca believe very strongly in chaos theory – that everything in the environment is connected to everything else and even the smallest change in some far flung corner of the world could result in an overwhelming outcome elsewhere in the biosphere. Some Orca have taken this belief and made it their career, becoming well respected chaos theorists within academic circles.

On worlds where Orca have a significant population, they are strong advocates for sustainable living, using resources wisely and not putting overwhelming stress on any environment. They support and, where they have the ability, demand that ecological, environment and climatic studies be made before any disturbance to the natural environment is commenced. Unlike Dolphins, who may well form very vocal protests and demonstrations, Orca work more subtly. Where they have access to or influence on politics, they will quietly make their opinions known, use manipulation to achieve their goals and make it very clear that they are not pleased with the lack of care being shown to the environment.

As apex predators, Orca enjoy hunting for both food and sport. When hunting for food, Orca hunt as a team, constantly communicating with each other with updates of their location and position. Quarry is harried and herded until a telling blow can be made and the Orca begin to feast. Eating for Orca is neither delicate nor fancy – they will tear into their prey with gusto, often while it is still alive, in search of the tastiest morsels, before consuming lesser favored portions. Watching Orca feed is not for the faint of heart.

If hunting for sport, the hunt is a competition to prove bravery, skill and quick thinking. The Orca will pursue their quarry in a group but instead of acting cooperatively they actively compete with each other to be the first to reach the target. Quarry in sport hunting is not killed. Instead the object is to touch the target with the front of the mouth. While Orca prefer using a live animal for sport hunting, they will use a robotic lure if they must. Sport hunting is an exciting exercise and has developed a significant following on worlds that have Orca populations.

Orca hold great reverence for their ancestors, in particular female ancestors. They use a number of rituals to venerate ancestors, the number of which and how and when they are performed depending on the particular beliefs of the pod, clan and community the

Orca belongs to. Most commonly, Orca will enter a mourning period on the death of a female – normally lasting one year, which represents the period an Orca calf is completely reliant on the care of their mother. During this time, an Orca will eat sparingly, spend time in quiet contemplation of their departed love one and sing mournful songs espousing the sadness they feel at their relative's loss.

Orca have no burial rituals as such. When one of their number dies, the corpse is protected from scavengers for a period of time to give surviving descendants a chance to offer their final farewells. Once this period has passed, the body is pushed into the deepest part of the ocean within the community's territory and then allowed to sink and disappear into the depths where it will provide food for scavengers and return to the environment.

The name of the deceased Orca is added to the family group's mourning song, forever commemorating the family line and venerating each ancestor when the song is sung.

After the body has been disposed of, families will honor the deceased by dedicating hunts to them. Once a kill is made, the tastiest and desired portion, like the liver, is not eaten but allowed to sink to the ocean floor as an offering for the ancestor.

The death of a Matriarch or Philosopher-elder will bring mourners from far and wide to pay their respects.

In contrast, Orca do not mourn the death of a male in any significant manner. A mother will mourn the loss of her son or grandson but his name is not added to the mourning songs. It is the responsibility of a deceased male Orca's female relatives to dispose of the body.

Orca follow no one single religious belief. Some Orca follow religions naturally developed from the veneration of their ancestors into a fully realised system of worship. This religion's name is impossible for non-cetaceans to pronounce but it is most closely translated as 'the Way'. Orca believe that after death, the spirit or soul of female Orca continue to watch over their descendants and bring fortune or misfortune to the family based on how they are honored.

Other Orca have found Terran religions of Asian origin, such as Daoism and Buddhism, to fit with their particular worldview and psychology.

**The Way:** Traditionally, Orca do not keep physical records of their history or culture but commit it to memory and pass it on through song to younger generations. The Way, therefore, has developed regional variations as it has been passed on down the generations, the differences becoming more pronounced among Orca populations, which live on different planets. The exact details of the Way may vary from Orca-to-Orca, and community-to-
community, but differing denominations share many common beliefs.

The Way teaches that Orca did not develop a spirit until the race had achieved true sophoncy, which they call the Great Awakening. The Great Awakening not only provided self-consciousness to Orca but the ability to live on in spirit form after death. For Orca, an immortal spirit is something only sophonts possess and is what sets them apart from animals. They believe the spirits of their dead join the spirits of all other sophonts in a spirit world that is both contiguous yet slightly apart from the world of the living. Spirits are able to affect the world of the living but only those among the living who know the correct rituals can have a direct effect on the spirit world and its denizens. As this belief grew, Orca developed rituals to ease the spirits of the ancestors into the spirit world and appease those who become displeased with the living.

The spirits of happy female Orca watch over their descendants and bring good fortune, while male Orca spirits merge with the spirit world. Some denominations believe male Orca eventually reincarnate into a new body and others believe all Orca can enjoy the benefits of reincarnation. Some denominations do not believe in reincarnation at all and that sophonts only have one chance at life in the world of the living.

Displeased spirits can cause misfortune in various ways, the vast majority of which involves misfortune of one sort or another. Specific events can also lead to restless spirits who must be appeased before they stop inflicting misfortune on the living.

Orca not able to receive final observances from their decedents and loved ones are believed to become vengeful spirits. Males haunt the area of their death, unable to disperse into the spiritual life force of the planet, bringing poor hunting and a pall upon the area. Females plague their family groups, instilling bad luck, ill health and poor fertility until the proper observances are made.

The rituals required by the Way are overseen by an Orca known as a Spirit Singer. A Spirit Singer has been taught rituals by another, appeasing restless spirits, guiding spirits who have not passed on to the spirit world and placating angry ancestors. The majority of the rituals consist of song and stylised movement, which may need to be performed multiple times to appease particularly mad spirits.

The role of the Spirit Singer is traditionally taken on by female Orca beyond the age of calf bearing or otherwise infertile. In some communities, however, restrictions are relaxed and both male and female Orca of varying fertility and ageundertake the role.

### DRESS, ART AND ARCHITECTURE

Orca have no taboos regarding nudity and therefore are quite happy to be unclothed. Indeed, considering their aquatic environment, clothing of any sort could prove to be at best an inconvenience and at worst a danger if caught on something and becoming a drowning hazard. When necessary, Orca wear a harness to which tools and equipment can be easily attached if necessary. Unlike Dolphins, Orca harnesses are just another utilitarian tool to be used and find the Dolphin predilection of decorating harnesses puzzling.

Ritual scarification among Orca has become part of their cultural identity. Both males and females are equally likely to be scarred, although not all Orca are scarred. Among some Orca, scarring holds spiritual significance, granting to them the abilities of the animal or concept the scar represents. To bear a scar, an Orca must prove themselves a valuable member of the family group, pod and clan. Those who have shown bravery in the face of danger, led great hunts or solved problems that affect a great proportion of the clan can be granted the honor of bearing a scar.

Scarring is often performed by Spirit Singers in clans which have them and in those which do not by an Orca who has undergone years of training and study for the task. Scar design and patterns can represent an animal, event or abstract concept varying according to region, clan or pod. Designs are traditionally geometric in nature, incorporating swirls curves and waves, with in-fill designs consisting of solid blocks or patterns consisting of lines of varying thickness. Scar placement also has significant meaning for the Orca, with the traditional locations for tattoos being the dorsal fin, flippers, fluke, brow and chin.

Scars are made with the use of a sharpened tool normally made from whale or dolphin bone. In religious clans, the Spirit Singer will bless the scarring tool, invite the spirits of the ancestors to ritual and then hold the tool in their mouth to cut deeply into the skin of the recipient. The process is slow and often painful but enduring the ordeal of receiving a tattoo is seen as a rite of passage. Clans which do not have Spirit Singers hold no such ceremony.

Singing and song composition is a highly developed art among Orca, used both recreationally and religiously. As their history is also oral, Orca use song to impart information. The style of songs vary from mournful funeral dirges to rousing hunting chants to solemn lessons. Orca are happy to sing alone or in groups, and songs have a habit of growing and evolving as time goes by. As education is solely in the province of female Orca, they begin singing teaching songs to their calves at a very early age, although only female calves are taught the funereal dirges in preparation for when they lead their own family group.

Orca have little need for permanent structures and therefore have no architectural style. When a permanent structure is required to store belongings or act as a habitat for non-aquatic colleagues, they prefer it to be made by others, with due care being made not to disturb the environment unnecessarily. Their only caveat is for the structures to have ample room for Orca use, if necessary.

### BUSINESS

Orca do not understand the abstract concept of money but do understand the concept of performing service or providing goods for service or goods in return. In this manner, they understand their businesses generate income but they cannot quite grasp the concept of money having any worth or use. This has led to Orca, much like Dolphins, using a third-party to oversee the financial aspect of their businesses.

Orca businesses are operated by family groups and pods, with the largest businesses run by clans. The structure of the business follows Orca tradition of deferring to the oldest direct female relative. This creates an organization where employees work, live and play together. Due to their psychology, Orca see no difference between work and play, and likewise see no difference between family member and workmate.

Orca businesses are solely involved in some sort of aquatic pursuit, such as aquafarming, fishing, search and rescue, aquatic research, environmental consultation and undersea mining. There are no Orca megacorporations – indeed nearly all Orca businesses are small concerns within the interstellar scheme, operating only on one planet and usually only one location on a planet.

They prefer to work with their own kind and it is rare to find any other race, including Dolphins, working directly with Orca. If consultation must take place with another race, the eldest female in the business will normally conduct the contact, sometimes accompanied by her immediate direct descendants.

Conversely, Orca have no compunction with working with robots. They will have many robots performing functions for they find difficult or tedious to undertake themselves, including operating the financial aspects of a business. It is not unusual for Orca to send a robot to attend meetings as their proxy, knowing full well the robot will serve the needs of the business first and foremost. Orca will also use robots to perform aspects of labour, in particular for mining operations.

### THE MILITARY

Orca can be quite militant and conflict between clans and communities are not unheard of. Due to their hierarchical society, Orca find adapting to life in the military of other races to be surprisingly easy, although they can sometimes have difficulty accepting orders from male commanders.

Orca societies often form their own militaries, although unlike many other cultures, their militaries tend to be along family lines, with mothers commanding sons and daughters and their daughters' offspring. Among themselves, Orca associate rank with the position an Orca holds in its family group, pod and clan. Their rank structure has been adopted from human structures and modified to suit their needs. Orca forces of this type are extensively trained in both armed and unarmed conflict, utilising artificial limbs to aid in manipulation and weapons designed for vehicles mounted on armored harnesses. Some forces are even trained in the Orca equivalent of battle dress and have proven to be devastating opponents.

It is rare for Orca to join the forces of other races, although it is certainly not unheard of for an entire Orca family group to be enlisted into a military organization, especially on worlds with large oceans. Even more rarely does an Orca join a terrestrial or starfaring contingent but when it has happened the Orca have universally been without a family.

### LANGUAGE AND NAMING

Orca speak Dephanese – the same language as Dolphins, albeit with a differing dialect. Orca and Dolphins readily understand each other and while

Dolphins will make light of Orca accents and dialects, they never do so in their presence. Orca are a less dispersed race then Dolphins, so their dialects have not drifted as far apart as that of their cousins.

Orca are able to understand other languages as well and, thanks to modifications to their vocal apparatus, are able to learn to speak other languages as well. An Orca voice is high pitched and they are prone to over pronounce clicking and sibilant sounds, which some races can find rather amusing. Orca do not tolerate their voices or pronunciation being made light of.

They name their calves at birth, which remains with them their entire lives. Orca names are composed of a number of components. The first is their birth name, given to them by their mother. Their second name is their family name, which will be the same as all members of a family group and pod. The third component of their name is the name of their clan. This name can change as Orca move from clan-to-clan and back again. The last component of their name is that of their community. Like their clan name, an Orca's community name can change as they themselves move among communities. An Orca that is not part of a community will often take the name of the organization they work for as their community name.

Orca tend to just go by their first and second names, except on formal occasions, when they will use their full name.

To humans, Orca names sound like whistles and clicks, such as 'Squeee-k-k-kee' or 'Ki-keee-k'. The syllables can sometimes extend into the ultrasonic and subsonic, causing humans to miss the complete name. Orca who commonly deal with humans and other races will adopt a first and second name in Anglic for ease of communication. They are impressed however, when other races try to use an Orca's name in their native Delphanese and appreciate the attempt.

NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION Before sophoncy was achieved, humans communicated with Orca using a simplified combination of sign language and verbalization. This language is largely lost among humans but Orca remember tales of it. This was primarily a single-direction language, from human to Orca;
understanding would be imparted by the Orca with head movements or flipper gestures but they could impart nothing even remotely complex back to humans. Modern Orca take great offence if another race tries to use this language with them today, seeing it as an obvious affront to their sophoncy.

# THE ORCA HOMEWORLD

Orca evolved on Terra but consider Sufren to be their homeworld, as that is the planet where their Great Awakening took place. Located in the Sufren subsector of Diaspora, the planet is the subsector capital, a garden world and major industrial hub considered to be the jewel of the sector

Sufren has a day which is 23 hours and 53 minutes long. It orbits its sun, an M1 V red dwarf at a distance of 0.475 AU and has an orbital period of 365.2422 days. Sufren has an axial tilt of 23.5 degrees, causing clearly separated seasons. Sufren has no natural satellite but the proximity of the sun causes tides in the oceans ranging from zero meters at low tide to 16 meters in some locations.

The nature of Sufren has posed significant questions among scientific communities. The length of day and year on Sufren are almost identical to that of Terra, which should be impossible – when taking into account the distance of Sufren from its primary, the planet should be tidally locked.

Sufren has a temperate and hospitable climate, with average temperatures averaging 12 degrees Celsius and a sea-level air pressure of 1.59 standard atmospheres. The atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen, oxygen and water vapour with trace amounts of carbon-dioxide and other gaseous molecules. The atmosphere is breathable without assistance, although some visitors may experience some difficulties breathing at lower altitudes until they become acclimatised.

A native lifeform known locally as Marsdust has a significant impact on the planet's atmosphere. A simple airborne spore, Marsdust is a photosynthetic, oxygen producing organism, which thrives on the red spectrum of visible light and reflects orange light. It pervades the stratosphere and mesosphere of Sufren's atmosphere and not only boosts oxygen pressure by almost 0.25%
but changes the quality of light that penetrates to the surface. By removing much of the red wavelength and reflecting a significant percentage of orange, Marsdust functions as a colour filter. The resulting surface light of Sufren is more white-amber, producing the appearance of a perpetually bright dusk to eyes accustomed to Terran equivalents. The sky of the planet changes colours dramatically as morning and evening approaches, fading from bright greenish-blue to deep blues, greens and purples.

### GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY

Sufren is a rocky body with a molten core of iron, providing the planet with a magnetic belt that protects the surface from stellar radiation. The planet is slightly denser than Terra, giving it a gravity of 0.72G, with a crust divided into seven major tectonic plates, still geologically active.

The planet is dominated by two large and deep oceans covering approximately 63% of the planet. The rest of the surface is occupied by five major continents, one minor continent, several archipelagos and numerous isolated small islands. The islands exhibit a range of climates and topographies suitable for human habitation.

SUFREN SUBSECTOR

**DIASPORA**

### NATIVE LIFEFORMS

Sufren hosts a large and diverse ecosystem. Organic life consists of left-handed amino acids and possesses a biochemistry that is almost identical to biochemistry found on Terra.

Plant life exists in both aquatic and terrestrial forms, the vast majority using oxygenic photosynthesis to generate energy. Chlorophyll has evolved to utilise as much of the visible light spectrum given out by the red dwarf sun and appears to be dark purple to black on photosynthetic surfaces. A small minority of plants utilise anaerobic photosynthesis and are yellow or green on their photosynthetic surfaces.

Animal life is primarily bilaterally symmetrical consisting of two sexes that reproduce sexually. Exceptions occur, with the most common being radial symmetry that are either hermaphroditic or reproduce asexually. The base compounds of life and the manner in which they have manifested is almost identical to that found on Terra, with genetic material composed of DNA made up to the same four chemical bases and organised into pairs and arranged in double helixes. While many planets have life that resembles that of Terra, life on Sufren could have easily evolved on Terra, leading some scientists to proffer an argument of panspermia to resolve the similarities.

If taking numbers into consideration, insect analogues with external skeletons would be considered the dominant lifeforms on the planet, filling almost every ecological niche available. Animals have evolved into a vast number of clades with internal skeletons that mimic those found on Terra including piscine, amphibian, reptilian, avian and mammalian analogues. Mammal analogues dominate the land surfaces and the skies, while reptile analogues dominate the oceans. Amphibian analogues are relatively rare and seeing a decline in population while piscine are also rare, having largely died out during an anoxic period in the planet's past, which allowed reptiles to occupy their niche.

### IMPERIAL NOBILITY

Sufren hosts the estates of a number of Imperial nobles, as would be expected of a subsector capital. These include Duchess Marinda Piri von Zlata, Countess Alinessa Herais von Zlata and Baronet Ozlem Tobia Kyou.

Duchess Marinda Piri von Zlata is the duchess of the subsector of Sufren and eldest daughter of the previous duke, Justyn Tayshaun von Zlata. Marinda, the only surviving issue of the previous duke, was a sickly child and as such was pampered and spoiled. When Miranda turned 16, she was ensconced as the Countess of Navar, which was passed down from her father as was the tradition in the von Zlata dynasty, although her duties were undertaken by a staff of regents until she turned 21. On completion of her education at the University of Sufren, Marinda embarked on her Grand Tour of the sector. The tour was expected to last four years but she was called back early to assume the role of duchess at the untimely death of her father. Furious at her early recall, Marinda returned to accept her inheritance and then promptly left the duties to be overseen by her father's, and now her own, advisors while she returned to her tour. The duchess, familiar with the comfort of noble life, continues to leave her duties to be undertaken by her administration and pays little attention to it. Instead, she prefers to enjoy the advantages of her fortuitous birth, living a life of luxury while her every need and desire is seen to by others.

The duchess was courted by many suitors almost as soon as she was raised to her position but she had little interest in committing to any. It was not until she turned 35 when her heart was captured by the dashing third son of the Subsector Duke of Khavle. They undertook a whirlwind courtship and were married scarcely six months later; shortly thereafter the duchess announced her pregnancy with their first child. The happy announcement soon turned to dismay when the duchess suffered a miscarriage but 12 months later she again announced she was pregnant. This time the pregnancy was carried to term and their daughter was named Alinessa Herais von Zlata. Alinessa was followed by three other siblings – Roman Audrick and the twins Cadwanllon Hanson and Ethelred Angevin.

Duchess von Zlata stands at 5'1” but is morbidly obese, unable to stand or walk for any period of time. She spends most of her time reclining on a gravitic sedan. Marinda keeps her hair dyed at its natural black and has undergone a number of treatments in an attempt to reclaim her youthful appearance, none of which have been terribly successful. She is short-tempered and petty and her advisors and staff cater to her every whim, taking great measures not to raise her ire as her punishments can be punitive and disproportionate. The duchess rarely made public appearances in her youth and less so now she is elderly. She delegates all such duties to her son Roman. The Orca Homeworld

Countess Alinessa Herais von Zlata is the Countess of Navar, which includes under its title the worlds of Houstar and Maelstrom. Alinessa was born prematurely and thanks to the advanced medical techniques available on Sufrin, Alinessa not only survived but thrived. She was raised largely by a staff of nannies and educators, and received little of the same pampering her mother enjoyed. An excellent student, she continued her studies at the University of Sufren, majoring in political and economic sciences. It was while at university Alinessa was exposed to the Authentic Movement, which she immediately adopted.

Like her mother before her, Alinessa was granted the title of countess at 16 but unlike her mother showed an avid interest in the responsibilities that came with the title. At the conclusion of her studies, Alinessa undertook her Grand Tour and when she returned to Sufrin four years later, threw herself whole-heartedly into her duties and responsibilities.

As countess, Alinessa has a sizable fief on Sufren as well as one on Navar. Alinessa only visits her fief on Navar occasionally, as she feels she can best dispatch her duties on the subsector capital. Her duties on Navar are left in the care of her seneschal, Baronet Jory Hanover.

Countess Alinessa is a handsome woman in her early 30's, patient and thoughtful, slow to anger and prone to explore every aspect of a problem before making a decision. She maintains a constant hand in the duties of her position and is known as a hardworking and diligent noble well loved by the people of Sufren.

Baronet Ozlem Tobia Kyou, is Sufren's planetary representative at the Moot and a knight of the Order of the Emperor's Guard. Despite his responsibilities, he has only visited [[Capital]] once and only to delegate his proxy. He is rather unconcerned with the politics of his fiefdom, delegating his responsibilities to his younger brother Sir Dawid, a retired Imperial Navy commodore. Meanwhile, the baronet enjoys the hospitality of Duchess von Zlata and her palace. Ozlem is a prominent member of the Duchess's court and has manoeuvered himself into the position of the Duchess's most favored adviser. Ozlem uses his position in the subsector court to his own advantage.

### STARPORT

Sufren boasts an impressive Class B starport with both orbital and planetary infrastructure. The port is a major layover point in the Sufren Cluster and sees a significant amount of traffic from tourists, traders and researchers as well as Imperial governance traffic.

The highport sits in a geosynchronous orbit above the equator. Constructed as a pair of thick rings stacked on top of each other, each ring has a diameter of four kilometers, a height of two kilometers and a thickness of two kilometers. A central pylon with a length of six kilometers and diameter of one kilometer runs through the center, connecting to each ring by four thick struts.

The top of the pylon houses the traffic control center, while the bottom houses port facilities for domestic traffic. The domestic port has berthing facilities or craft up to 200 tons and external docking facilities for craft up to 5,000 tons, catering to local traffic only. Interstellar traffic is directed to the larger port facilities located on the top ring, with berths for starships up to 1,000 tons and external docking facilities for vessels up to 20,000 tons. Larger ships are directed to stationary orbit by traffic control and can access the port using smaller vessels. Main starport administration, included warehousing and customs are also located in the upper ring.

Along the outside of the bottom ring are construction and maintenance facilities. The starport is only able to construct spacecraft but provides maintenance and repairs for starships as well.

The rest of the orbital structure comprises support, residential, industrial and subsector administration facilities. Transport within the structure consists of fast transport vacuum tubes, which can arrive at any part of the station within minutes.

The downport is located on an island directly below the highport. The port itself is huge, measuring 100 square kilometers with landing pads and berths, along with hangers, maintenance bays and administration facilities. The downport also has construction yards capable of constructing spacecraft up to 1,000 tons. It sees almost as many ships as the highport, although most traffic is either heading to the highport itself or somewhere else within the system.

The island, named Nova Scotia, acts as a surrogate planetary capital – an independent polity apart from the three main governments of the planet and overseen by an executive council nominated by the System Congress. The startown, Nova Scotia City, is also the site of the System Congress buildings and its support infrastructure. Nova Scotia City is neutral territory and boasts a more relaxed Law Level 6. The local law is upheld by peace-keeping troops, donated by the constituent nations of the System Congress.

The Orca Homeworld

Nova Scotia City has a population of over 26 million inhabitants. Due to its nature, the city has a very cosmopolitan demographic. It also houses the workshops and factories of many industries, which make use of the starport, as well as residential and business districts that directly support the starport and the System Congress.

The Sufren shipyards have a reputation for building the best battle riders in the domain but with recent Imperial favor turning away from battle riders, the construction yards are finding contracts drying up. Local business has been petitioning the Duchess for funds to expand the starport to Class A standard, citing the economic damage the loss of naval battle rider tenders would have on the planet. The Duchess is ambivalent to

dedicating Imperial funds to the expansion of the facilities, leaving it up to local business concerns to fund the expansion if they desire it.

### TECH LEVEL

The Tech Level on Sufren is a mature TL15, verging on TL16, which is one of the highest in the subsector.

Sufren's medical technology, particularly in the fields of genetic manipulation and engineering are at an early TL16 level of sophistication due to research made available by GenAssist, which has major facilities in the system. Genetic therapy and modification for not only congenital issues but cosmetic desires, is easily and readily available and genetic engineering is available for all manner of applications. Anagathics are freely available, although remain expensive.

The Orca Homeworld

Conversely, the Tech Level for cybernetics is low, sitting at the late TL13 level of development in all areas except those which deal in providing assistance to sophonts who lack manipulative or motive capability as a normal characteristic of their species. In this case, the TL is an early TL14.

All other technologies are at a mature TL15 level of sophistication.

### GOVERNMENT

Sufren has no single government. Instead, several separate governments operate together to govern the world.

The first and largest is the Protectorate of Sufren, a representative democracy, overseen in theory by Duchess von Zlata as the nation's nominal head of state. The duchess has no direct control over the government except to act as signatory to legislation and to legitimise or dissolve government. The Protectorate of Sufren takes great pains to maintain a democratic tradition, possible by the world's relatively high technology that allows extensive electronic input from the electorate, including frequent referenda, and confidence and recall votes.

The other two governments are the United Orca Communities and the Combined Dolphin Clans, both of which are charismatic oligarchies.

Together, along with the governments of other inhabited worlds in the Sufren solar system, they form the System Congress; a non-governing organization, which oversees the maintenance of peace and diplomatic relations between the three nations, providing a neutral space where the individual governments may meet to discuss and implement measures for planetary and system-wide security. While the System Congress is a non-governing body, decisions made by representatives of the Congress hold significant weight throughout the system and the political influence of the organization is not insubstantial.

Congress meetings are held face-to-face through a glass-
sided open water pool known as the Think Tank to allow the representatives of the Orca and Dolphin communities to have a direct presence. The nature of these discourses is most often confidential but there is no small amount of public speculation that the Orca are keen social and military analysts with a zen-like concept – and approach to – the manipulation of power and politics.

The System Congress is overseen and chaired by Lady Alinessa Marinida von Zlata, the duchess's eldest daughter.

As subsector capital, Sufren also houses the infrastructure and administrative apparatus necessary for such tasks, the majority of which can be found in Clester, a city built specifically to house the machinery of subsector government and those employed by it. Duchess von Zlata has 'modest' accommodations in the clester, where she resides for half the year. Clester is an independent city state under the direct rule of Duchess von Zlata, protected by her personal huscarles, which also operate as a police force within the city's jurisdiction. When not in residence in Clester, the duchess resides in Zrosa Palace, an impressive grav-lifted ducal abode with vast and immaculately manicured gardens.

### LAW LEVEL

As a balkanised world, Sufren's Law level is by necessity an average of the combined political entities on the planet. As an average, the Law Level is relatively low at 3, making military weapons and mesh armor prohibited. Dangerous poisons are also outlawed. Personal freedoms are highly protected by the law, such as freedom of speech, the right to worship, right to travel, right to own property and right to bear children. Civil law protects the rights and freedoms of the individual over those of businesses and corporations, while criminal law against individuals is relatively relaxed. Most crimes will attract a fine if convicted, with custodial sentences only handed down for actions causing the intended death of an individual.

Environmental laws, conversely, are extremely harsh on Sufren, with convicted criminals handed down steep fines, long prison sentences and even execution. In the most severe cases, corporations have been forced to undergo forced closure with the board of directors executed and upper management serving long terms in prison. Many offworlders consider punishment for even small transgressions to be excessive – Cr10000 fines for any littering, even of biodegradable objects.

### MILITARY

As the subsector capital, Sufren boasts a large military force, both Imperial and local. Imperial forces include a large naval base in orbit around the innermost gas giant Rachlum, as well as military construction yards able to build starships up to 250,000 tons. One CruRron and one BatRon, as well as their support facilities, are permanently stationed in the naval base. The Imperial navy base is heavily patrolled up to the 100-diameter mark and can only be approached by authorized vessels. Gas giant refuelling at Rachlum is prohibited

The Orca Homeworld

and any unauthorized vessel approaching Rachlum or the naval base will be ordered to alter course. Not adhering to instructions will be met with force.

On the surface of Sufren is both an Imperial Naval Academy and an Imperial Marine Academy, both of which service the entire subsector. The Marine Academy specialises in underwater combat and joint operations between surface and ocean dwelling personnel.

Colonial forces include a significant System Defence Boat force, with vessels ranging from 200 tons to 600 tons, stationed at the highport. Adding to this compliment is a full BatRon of Gallant -class battle riders purchased from the Imperial Navy. The local force also includes a fleet of customs cutters and fighter wings, which not only add to the security of the system but aid in its defence as well. These combined forces prove to be a serious deterrent to smugglers, pirates and hostile forces alike.

Planetary forces consist of four regiments, 20 battalions in total, four of which are mobile lift infantry. Deep emplacement meson cannons aid in orbital protection and an air force and wet navy round out the planetary defences. Planetary military assets boast TL13 arms and equipment.

### ECONOMY

Sufren is a garden world with a high population. It has abundant resources that have not been fully exploited, a work force which can be counted in the hundreds of millions and a comprehensive and far reaching infrastructure. The planet is financially strong and holds a significant place in the economy of the subsector. It is more than capable of supporting its citizens at the level of comfort they have become accustomed to.

The Protectorate of Sufren supports its citizens with a basic universal income, with no obligations attached. Citizens who cannot or choose not to work are able to live at a comfortable level above the poverty line. Those who do choose to work enjoy a commensurately comfortable life provided for by the income they earn.

The citizens of the Orca and Dolphin nations do not enjoy a similar subsidy but they have no direct need for money. The majority work the vast aquafarms surrounding the land masses, drawing their economic strength from income generated by those industries.

The products of genetic engineering are a major component of the planetary economy, ranging

from pharmaceuticals developed through genetic engineering, life forms genetically adapted to particular biospheres, cloning and designer life forms for those who can afford them. Eclipsing the income from all these sources, GenAssist are also the primary producer and exporter of anagathics in the domain. GenAssist also have a number of hospitals where they provide specialized medical care and a university dedicated to the science and art of genetic manipulation that draws students and patients from across Diaspora.

The sunsets and sunrises on Sufren are a spectacular sight, known throughout the subsector, drawing millions of tourists every year.

Sufren also exports a large amount of raw materials including copper, tin, gold and iron, as well as electronics, computers and cybernetics.

### DEMOGRAPHICS

The population on Sufren is largely human of Solomani or mixed decent. A small percentage of Vilani and Minor Race humans also make their home on Sufren, many of whom live in Nova Scotia City.

Orca represent a significant minority with 10% of the total population. Dolphins enjoy a smaller minority of just 4% of the total population.

Making up less than 0.1% of the population are a variety of other races which hail from all across Charted Space but even at this small percentage they number well into the millions.

### CULTURE

As it stands, it is difficult to summarise Sufren's cultural outlook, considering its balkanised nature. Suffice to say, with the vast majority of citizens freed from the need to work, there is strong encouragement for self-improvement. This can take many forms, from improving knowledge through further education, to physical ability, to achieving excellence in a field of work. For this reason, Sufren has a disproportionate number of universities considering its population and is recognized as a center for learning and education.

This cultural pressure towards self-improvement has led to a broad acceptance of the Authentic Movement. Citizens are encouraged to look into their heritage, either as a personal project or with the aid of any number of business enterprises which assist in such searches. Local councils frequently hold festivals to celebrate

The Orca Homeworld

cultural heritage and large areas of cities and town have grown around single or related, cultures. Visitors can find entire districts which celebrate their Asian, American, European, Islander and Australian heritage, with further breakdowns of specific heritages within. For example, in the Asian district a visitor is likely to find a China Town, a Japan Town, a Korea Town and so forth, fully embracing their cultural heritage with architectural styles, language, fashion and traditional festivals.

While the planetary government strongly supports the Authentic Movement, the duchess and other nobles maintain some distance from it, holding instead to a cultural loyalty to the Imperium as a whole. Lady Alinessa is the exception. She openly and enthusiastically supports the Authentic Movement and is a sponsor for the Authentic Festival, a celebration of cultural heritage held annually across the planet. When not seeing to her responsibilities to the System Congress she is attending and/or sponsoring one of the numerous smaller Authentic cultural celebrations, which are held across the globe.

With the Protectorate's strong stance on democracy and representation, the people of Sufren are encouraged to develop strong views on subjects they find interesting or important to them. Children are taught from a young age to form an educated opinion and how to defend their opinion using facts and logic. The art of debate is greatly enjoyed by the people of Sufren, becoming something of a sport with debating teams achieving fame and recognition. Suffice to say, the tendency for strong opinions have led to the people of Sufren developing a reputation of stubbornness within the subsector.

### URBANISATION

Despite its large population, Sufren is far from overcrowded. The vast majority of the population resides within large cities surrounded by small rural settlements. The population has access to advanced fusion power generation and each building has its own fusion generator, which provides more than sufficient power for the residents with no need for an extensive energy infrastructure. Even the poorest among the Sufren's citizens live comfortably and in a manner some may consider luxurious.

Buildings are constructed tall, to minimise disruption to the environment. Green areas are common within the boundaries of cities and many buildings support vegetation both internally and externally. Decorative and food bearing trees and shrubs grow along

sidewalks, helping to cool microclimates within city environs and provide a habitat and food source for wildlife that has adapted to urban living. Buildings are designed in an almost uniform pattern with businesses located on lower floors and residences above, with those of greater wealth living on higher floors. The truly wealthy live on the rooves of skyscrapers in enclaves that have manicured gardens and domiciles, which are apart from the rest of the building proper.

On many worlds where there is stratification of wealth and living space, a culture has grown which includes an 'upper city' for the wealthy and an 'under city' for the poor. On Sufren, this has been largely avoided by not having a class that is considered poor by introduction of the universal basic income.

Ground level traffic consists of pedestrians and muscle-
powered vehicles such as bicycles, with powered vehicles and public transport consigned to traffic-ways several levels above. The majority of industrial traffic is still wheeled and utilises 'sky roads' five stories above ground level. Powered public and private transport is largely gravitic and confined to 10 to 15 stories above ground level depending on direction. All powered transport is controlled by a computerised traffic control system that has practically eliminated congestion and accidents.

A comprehensive network of underground hypertubes provides rapid public transport within cities, between cities, farming communities and nature reserves in a worldwide network. Anyone can travel almost anywhere on Sufren in less than six hours.

Rural living is rather idyllic, with the majority being farmers of one sort or another. Farming is undertaken with assistance from farming robots, which places farmers in the role of overseers and administrators, with an eye to the preservation of the environment. Any new farming endeavor must apply for government permits that are not provided without extensive environmental impact studies being undertaken first.

Much of Sufren, both terrestrial and marine, has been set aside as nature reserves, strongly protected by legislation to prevent disturbance. Access to nature reserves requires permits that can be difficult to obtain and are overseen and patrolled by rangers using drones and robots. Unauthorized presence, disturbance, interference or polluting of nature reserves carries heavy fines and prison sentences.

The Orca Homeworld

### PLACES AND EVENTS

Like many planets, Sufren has places and events of interest to tourists and as the subsector capital, Sufren receives a significant number of tourists annually.

### THE GREAT ZIGGURAT OF SUFREN

Sufren is the site of some ruins that are believed to be of Ancients origin. The site consists of ruins of a small village surrounding a ziggurat 96 meters in length, 68 meters in width and 45 meters in height. Constructed of an unknown alloy, the ziggurat sits in the exact center of the village and is perfectly aligned with the planet's north/south/east/west axes. It is impeccably preserved and shows no effects of erosion or weathering. A single entrance has been discovered leading into the massive structure, which gives access to a number of chambers, constructed at a massive scale, suggesting the builders may have been at least twice if not three times taller than humans.

One chamber in particular has raised significant interest in researchers as on its walls are highly stylised images depicting the Major Races of Charted Space, along with Orca and Dolphins, undertaking a variety of activities. The style of the images is simple and in contrast with the elegance of the ziggurat leading some researchers to hypothesise the images were added some time after the erection of the ziggurat, and perhaps by a race other than the original builders, although the manner of applying the images is under debate as researchers have found no way to mark or damage the material the ziggurat is made from. There is a significant amount of disagreement among researchers as to the meaning of the diagrams, the least of which is how the builders knew of Orca and Dolphins hundreds of thousands of years before their arrival on Sufren.

Densitometer readings of the area below the ziggurat indicate an intricate and complex tunnel system that extends a significant distance underground. Sensor readings indicate there is a power source located deep within the tunnel system but there is no indication of

The Orca Homeworld

what it is powering. Some researchers have postulated it is an Ancients power source, which is somehow maintaining Sufren's rotation and axial stability but this hypothesis is not widely accepted.

Several attempts have been made to access the tunnels. The ziggurat does not appear to have an entrance to them, nor has any forced entry into the tunnels been successful.

The village surrounding the ziggurat consists of the remains of simple mud brick igloo-style single-story dwellings constructed using local materials, suggesting the builders were an order of magnitude less advanced than those of the ziggurat. Each dwelling consists of a hemispherical edifice with a single entrance only 1.2 meters tall, indicating the inhabitants were most likely shorter than humans. The village also contains larger buildings, one with simple amphitheatres within, suggesting it may have been intended as a meeting hall, used for entertainment, or perhaps used for some religious purpose. The walls of the meeting hall also bear images of the Major Races, Orca and Dolphins in the same style as found within the ziggurat.

Surprisingly, no artefacts have been discovered in the ruins of the village or the ziggurat. Nor have any remains been found of the original builders of either the ziggurat or the village. Theories abound of what occurred at the location, who the inhabitants were and what happened to them.

The entire site is registered as a preserve by the Protectorate of Sufren. The ziggurat is open to researchers and scientists who obtain the proper permits from the government, although the University of Sufren holds a permanent permit for the site. The ruins are open to tourists but only under the supervision of a tour guide. Tours normally occur on a weekly basis but reservations must be made in advance and are limited to 10 visitors per group.

**AUTHENTIC FESTIVAL**
The Authentic Festival is held annually on Sufren between the fifth and eighth weeks of the year. The festival begins quietly in the first week with workshops on cultural heritage and genealogy, followed in the second week by traditional theatre and music performances. The third week continues with classes in traditional cooking and fashion, with the fourth week culminating in a week-long fair that encompasses and celebrates cultural heritage.

NEW TRAIT: MESMERISE (X)
The animal is able to mesmerise its victims through some sort of display. The target of this display must make an INT check at the difficulty listed in the trait. If the victim fails, they are unable to perform any actions except stare at the creature for 1D rounds or until they take damage.

The Authentic Festival has been a planetary event on Sufren for over two decades, having its origins in small local fairs. The events found greater recognition once Lady Alinessa began patronising the Authentic Movement and local events rapidly gained in popularity and attendance, until she announced and helped fund the first annual planet-wide Authentic Festival. The festival now draws tourists from across the subsector, some of whom are returning to their ancestral home on Sufren and others to join the celebrations.

### THE CLIFF OF SUNSETS

The sunrises and sunsets on Sufren have a well-
deserved reputation for beauty across the sector but even the best of those pales in comparison to the display produced at the Fire Opal Cliffs. These cliffs, located on the shoreline of the Cisalpine Sea, stand 150 meters tall and are composed entirely of solid opal. The opal catches the light from the setting sun, causing the cliffs to glow with colour. On the last local day of autumn, when the sun is at just the right angle as it sets, the light is caught by the opal cliffs and reflected and refracted to produce a shimmering rainbow display. When viewed in conjunction with the sunset, the sight is breath-taking.

Tourists flock from far afield to witness this event. The Fire Opal Cliffs are designated a national reserve and treasure and, as such, are protected from any development. As short distance from the cliffs however, a small community has developed, which caters to the tourist rush that gathers to delight at this annual display.

### ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS

Like many worlds in Charted Space, Sufren boasts diverse ecosystems that evolved over millions of years before the arrival of humans and their introduction of alien species. Many animals on Sufren can prove to be a danger to Travellers and some have been introduced to other worlds.

The Orca Homeworld

### CRESTED SNAGGLEPUSS

The crested snagglepuss is a domestic feline-like predator, one of a small number of snagglepuss species found on the planet, the largest of which approaches the size of a Terran tiger. While very feline in appearance, snagglepi are more like canines in behaviour. They enjoy each other's company and bond well with their owners. Snagglepi do not have retractable claws and capture prey primarily with their bite, gaining their name for their wide mouths, which extend back past their eyes, and by the way their needle-like teeth extend from their lips. The crested snagglepuss has a mohawk growth of hair starting from its head, extending along its back and terminating at the base of its tail. The wild crested snagglepus has a brown and black mottled short coat but the domesticated variety has been bred into a large variety of colours and patterns.

### BLACK REPTISHARK

The black reptishark is one of a large group of reptisharks native to Sufren. An apex predator, it is large enough to easily prey on Dolphins as well as prove a credible threat to a lone Orca. They use their tail for the majority of their motive force, relying on flippers to provide mobility. The black reptishark is highly territorial and hunts alone by swimming slowly until it spots potential prey. It will then dive deep, using lack of light in the depths to approach its prey from below before swimming up at incredible speeds to strike.

**STRIPED SEA DRAGON**
Striped sea dragons are the largest species of sea dragon on Sufren, with the largest confirmed length of 34.9 meters and 220 tons. Due to its size, an adult striped sea dragon has almost no natural predators, although Orca have been known to hunt them on occasion. The striped sea dragon is a filter feeder, preying on the multitude of plankton which live in the oceans. They travel in small schools of up to six related individuals. While not directly dangerous, they can use their tail to deliver a devastating blow.

### WHITELADY

The whitelady, named for its ghost-like appearance, is a sheet-like siphonophore – a colony of tiny specialized polyps working together as a colony – of translucent thinness. Hiding in shadows as a congealed white mass during the day, the whitelady unfurls with the cool of the night and the settling of the first dew. Riding on the early evening winds, it hunts prey, mesmerising intended victims with a faint play of green-white bioluminescence across its undulating surface. The creature envelops its prey, quickly paralysing the victim with glands similar to the nematocysts of Terran jellyfish. The whitelady normally targets small animals and is therefore no threat to adult humans unless handled, although attacks against very small children have been recorded.

The Orca Homeworld

# ORCA TRAVELLERS

Orca Travellers follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook._

### ORCA

Orca Travellers have the following modifiers to their characteristics: STR+8, END+4, SOC-4

**ORCA TRAITS**
Orca Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Big and Tough:** Orca are much larger than humans and can soak up a lot more damage unless a vulnerable location such as the head is struck. Whenever an Orca is subject to an effect that reduces END, whether through physical damage or exertion, END reduction is halved, dropping any fractions. For example, an Orca who is hit for seven points of damage reduces END 3 points. END is also treated as being doubled for the purposes of determining the duration (but not the effectiveness)
of physical activity. Lastly, due to their size, Orca take up 12 times as much room on spacecraft and vehicles as humans do. For example, a stateroom on a starship designed for Orca use takes up 48 tons.

**Cold Resistance:** Orca possess a thick covering of blubber that keeps them warm, providing DM+4 to all checks made to resist the effects of low temperatures.

**Deep Diver (260m):** Orca can dive deep underwater, to a depth of 260 meters without risk and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes.

**Echolocation (100m):** Orca use a highly sensitive echolocation sense to navigate their environment, effectively allowing them to 'see' underwater or in complete darkness to a range of 100 meters.

**Succour Syndrome:** When Orca hear the distress calls of other Orca they risk suffering from succour syndrome. If they fail a Very Difficult (12+) Gun Combat or Melee check
(1D seconds, INT) both their INT and EDU temporarily drop to zero and they must immediately swim as fast as possible to the side of the distressed cetacean.

Swimmer (16m): Orca are superb swimmers and can move through water at a speed of 16 meters.

### STARTING AGE

Orca mature at almost the same speed as humans. Travellers begin their careers at 18 years of age and untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career to gain new skills and experience. Orca begin aging at the end of their fourth term at 32. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years.

### TITLES

Orca use titles just as humans and many other races do. They have a strict hierarchy within their society and understand the use of position and authority which is in use in many other cultures.

### CAREERS

Orca who live closely with humans in societies at TL7+
have the same access to university and academy pre-career options. Orca always apply DM-2 when attempting to enter university but gain DM+1 when attempting to enter a Military Academy.

Orca careers, in general, are used as described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, there are exceptions:
•  Orca may attempt to qualify for the Dolphin Military career, the Spirit Singer career or the Dolphin Civilian career, except for the historian-
poet assignment. Orca may attempt to qualify for careers described in the Traveller Core Rulebook but only after first acquiring the Vacc Suit skill.
•  It is unusual for Orca to pursue careers as bureaucrats or Rogues. Orca Rogues are usually the last survivors of a family that has been wiped out or an outcast.
•  Orca cannot become Drifters. The nomad assignment for the Dolphin Civilian replaces the Drifter for any Orca Traveller. An Orca may automatically enlist in this career.
•  Orca are unable to become Merchants since the concept of trade and commerce is unfathomable to them or Nobles since they believe in the absolute equality of all.

### PSIONICS

Orca are as capable as humans in psychic potential but it is something which is rarely tested for. An Orca that does prove positive for psionic potential is able to pursue the Psion career (page 204 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ )_._

### ORCA SKILLS

Orca with a waldo set can perform just about any skill a human can. Those without are limited to skills which do not require hands or legs. A few other special considerations apply to Orca.

**Athletics:** Orca use Athletics (dexterity) only for high jumping or long jumping if it begins in the water. Sprinting means fast swimming. Use the normal rules except that a sprinting Orca can cover 96 + twice their Effect meters with every check. An Orca may not climb. Athletics (dexterity) is also used for catching things with an Orca's teeth or rostum. Use Athletics (endurance)
for long distance swimming and Athletics (strength) for tasks such as swatting with a tail or ramming with a rostrum, although actual attacks use Melee (natural).

**Vacc Suit:** This is a very common skill among Orca even if they do not serve in space. Orca may use their Vacc Suit skill to offset any negative DM inflicted by waldos but may not increase the DM above +0.

### UNAVAILABLE SKILLS

Orca Travellers have some limitations on the skills they receive during their careers and may not gain the Broker or Gambler skills. If one of these skills is rolled, roll for another. If the second result is the same, the roll is lost and the career process continues as normal.

### MUSTERING OUT

Any Benefit rolls from careers an Orca takes terms in, including Dolphin Citizen or Dolphin Military, which result in Armor or Weapon may instead be taken as a travel suit (without waldo). Additional results of the same type can be taken as a waldo or additional travel suits. If an Orca already possessing a travel suit and waldo receives an Armor or Weapon result, they may instead raise their Vacc Suit skill by one level.

When rolling on a Cash Benefits table from careers other than Philosopher-elder, Spirit Singer, Dolphin Citizen and Dolphin Military, all results are reduced to 10% of their Credit value to represent the total lack of interest in or understanding of money on the part of Orca Travellers.

Benefit rolls resulting in a Waldo or Travel Suit grant these items to a maximum of TL12.

Orca Travellers

## CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE: ORCA

Due to their anatomy, Orca are unable to use many items designed for humans without penalty.

Items which require hands or fingers cannot be used at all unless an Orca is equipped with waldos or cybernetic hands. Likewise, any equipment requiring legs or feet are impossible for Orca to use. An Orca may be able to use some equipment that requires fingers, like a keyboard, by holding a probe in its mouth or using its modified flippers, at the Referee's discretion. This causes any check to go slower without decreasing the Difficulty (see page 60 of the Traveller Core Rulebook ).

In general, other equipment designed for humans may be found or modified for Orca use. Protective equipment such as vacc suits, combat armor, rebreathers and so on, must be specifically designed for an individual race and are not interchangeable between species. Such equipment for Orca will cost 300% of the normal price.

Equipment designed specifically for Dolphins can also be modified for Orca. Such equipment will be 250% of the normal price.

Electronic equipment must be specially sealed against water when being handled by a submerged Orca to avoid detrimental effects but this is a standard feature of all electrical equipment at TL10+.

Travel Suit: Travel suits combine gravitic technology with a hostile environment suit and contains a super-
humid atmosphere for the health and comfort of its Orca wearer. While very similar to Dolphin Travel Suits, those designed for Orca are more heavily armored.

The travel suit provides its wearer with complete protection from temperatures ranging from -100^0 C to
+100^0 C and pressures of up to 56 atmospheres. They include a fully enclosed helmet including a visor with a heads up display that is tied to an on-board computer/
communications array equal to a Computer/2 with a 500 kilometer audio/visual transceiver capability.

Travel suits can be fitted with a waldo for the manipulation of objects built for human hands. The cost and mass for such modification is simply added to that of the travel suit itself.

At TL12, a travel suit has life support for 12 hours of use and weighs 150 kilograms when the grav units are inactive. The travel suit is able to take to the air at up to Medium speed and an Agility equal to the Orca's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 25 kilometers. By TL15, the suit provides life support for 48 hours and weighs 100 kilograms. The travel suit is able to take to the air at up to Medium speed and an Agility equal to the Orca's DEX DM. It has a maximum range of 50 kilometers.

### PERSONAL PROTECTION

Orca use personal protection for a number or reasons, the most obvious being the ability to move and function safely out of water. Other types of protection in the Traveller Core Ruleboo k or Central Supply Catalogue are available to Orca but cost 300% the normal price.

**Type O Battle Dress:** This battle dress includes all the facilities of the travel suit. However, it is extremely well armored and adds waldos, the full electronics suite for battle dress found on page 30 of the _Central Supply Catalogue,_ and a sonar-based system with a range of 1 kilometer which grants DM+2 to Electronic (sensors) checks.

Orca battle dress can be equipped with vehicle weapons using the integrated weapon mount (page 37 of the _Central Supply Catalogue_ ) consuming a number of slots equal to 10 plus the tonnage of the weapon. For example, if an Orca wanted to mount a screamer cannon on their battle dress, it would take up 10+1 or 11 slots.

Orca battle dress is equipped with waldos at the same TL. Any STR enhancements provided by the battle dress is also afforded to the waldos.

### WEAPONS

Orca are big enough to use heavy and vehicle weapons without difficulty or incurring any penalties and they ignore the Bulky trait. Several weapons have been designed specifically for Orca with this advantage in mind and, unlike Dolphins, Orca have no compulsion against carrying a heavy weapon on a harness mount.

Utility Harness: The utility harness is used by Orca to carry tools, equipment and ammunition. It fits snugly against the body and is supported by the fins. An Orca with waldos can easily add or remove items from a worn harness and can just as easily don or remove it as necessary.

Ite m TL Kg Cost Utility Harness 7 25 Cr500

Weapon Harness: A weapon harness is similar to the utility harness in fit but has special mounts for weapons to be attached. In early versions of the weapon harness, sensor pads are placed against the Orca's skin to detect minute muscle twitches to fire the weapons but at higher TL these may be replaced with a neural jack. Weapon harnesses are able to mount heavy weaponry; two heavy weapons or up to four rifle-
sized weapons are able to be attached to the harness with a combined weight of no more than 100 kilograms. All weapons of the same type fitted to a weapon harness may be fired simultaneously.

Ite m TL Kg Cost Weapon Harness 7 40 Cr1000

Sonic Screamer: The sonic screamer is a large and devastating weapon that has been designed specifically for underwater use. The screamer generates a tightly focused powerful sonic pulse, using an enormous amount of power and requiring frequent magazine changes.

# THE BWAPS

The Bwaps, (derived from their full name, the Bawapakerwa-a-a-awapawab), also known as wabs or newts, are a race of intelligent sophonts. Having seen no need to independently develop their own jump drive, they purchased the technology from the Vilani during the First Imperium. While they never discovered the secrets of the jump drive through their own research like the Major Races, they are one the most successful of the Minor Races. Bwaps successfully integrated themselves into spacefaring society even before they were capable of their own space travel and once they obtained the jump drive they spread out into space, colonising worlds of their own. They can be found throughout Charted Space and have made themselves indispensable within not only the bureaucracy and government of the Third Imperium but also within those of individual worlds, a multiplicity of pocket empires and other interstellar polities.

### PHYSIOLOGY

Proto-Bwaps were semi amphibious and lived in densely wooded, mangrove-like swamps. They burrowed under and among the root systems of large trees to form dens for the communal protection of themselves and their young. A shift in their home world's weather patterns saw swamps shrink to half their size. Increased population pressures and competition with other animals forced the newts into a semi-arboreal lifestyle. The increased challenges of the alteration of their normal environment and increased competition led to sophoncy, tool use and agriculture, permitting them a tremendous advantage over the competition.

Bwaps are an upright, bipedal, semi-humanoid species that are endothermic, possess an internal skeleton, closed circulatory system and consist of two sexes:
male and female. They range in height from 1.2 to 1.5 meters and weigh between 34 and 68 kilograms with no discernible differences between males and females. Bwaps are a carbon-based lifeform with a copper-
based circulatory system. The blue coloured blood of the Bwaps gives unpigmented areas of their body, like the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet and the abdomen, a slight blue-green tint.

Their biochemistry utilises right-handed amino acids
(Humaniti uses left-handed amino acids) and left-handed carbohydrates, the same as Humaniti. This may cause Bwaps some difficulties when they do not have access to the correct proteins in their diet but can be rectified with easily accessible dietary supplementation.

Bwap hands have three digits and an opposable thumb. They have no nails but possess webbing that extends to the first knuckle of the fingers. Some Bwaps are born with webbing that extends to the tips of the fingers but this is surgically removed shortly after birth because it causes the Bwap difficulty when handling objects.

On their feet, Bwaps have three toes with no nails. The toes are webbed to the first joint and if born with extended webbing it is also removed. Bwaps also have a long thick flattened tail, which was once the primary means of locomotion of aquatic proto-Bwaps, although it no longer serves this purpose.

Bwaps possess the same senses as humans although hearing is slightly inferior to humans; their stereo perception is somewhat limited due to having no external ear structure. Eyesight, smell and taste is comparable to humans.

Skin bears a distinctive pattern and colouring, which is unique to individuals but similar on those who belong to the same crèche; each crèche bears different patterns and colours. The pattern is determined by genetic factors but colours are influenced in part by genetics and partly by careful manipulation of the mother's diet during the development of the egg before it is laid. Bwap skin is significantly more porous than that of many other sophonts, allowing them to absorb some of the oxygen they require through their skin but also makes them susceptible to losing moisture quickly and must be kept constantly damp. Bwaps feel uncomfortable in humidity less than 98%. With special clothing they can exist comfortably indefinitely in humidity as low as 25% as long as they have adequate drinking water. In conditions of less than 25% humidity, Bwaps must rely on sealed environment suits or spray their skin with water every few minutes. If these conditions are not met, the Bwap's skin will quickly dry out leading to inflexibility, painful lesions, dehydration and ultimately, death.

Bwaps have the ability to regenerate their limbs and tails repeatedly. This is an evolutionary advantage that Bwap ancestors used as a defence mechanism to escape predators. When in danger, Bwap ancestors were able to drop their tail to confuse predators. In the

case that they were captured by a limb, the ancient Bwap could also drop the limb, leaving the predator occupied with the twitching limb while the Bwap escaped. The skin, muscles, blood supply, nerves and bones separate safely, leaving a sealed stump in its place. While the loss of a tail or limb was natural, it was not without cost to the ancestral Bwaps, requiring additional calories and energy resources to regrow the lost limb. Modern Bwaps have lost the ability to voluntarily discard their limbs or tail but retain the ability to regenerate lost extremities given time.

Certain types of injury can prevent regeneration from occurring, such as damage from fire or acid. Additionally, on rare occasions, some Bwaps are born with the inability to regenerate. In such cases, injured Bwaps have had to resort to artificial augments or cloned replacements to replace their amputated extremities. Bwaps not able to regenerate, regardless of the cause, are seen as handicapped by others of their race.

Sex in Bwaps is determined by the combination of ZW chromosomes; males possess two W chromosomes while females possess both a Z and W chromosome. Additionally, temperature can affect the sex of a Bwap while it is still developing in the egg. Lower temperatures will produce males while higher temperatures produce females. When eggs are allowed to develop naturally at the body temperature of the mother, the chance of female offspring developing is only 30%. Bwaps never manipulate the temperature of eggs intentionally to produce a specific sex but outside conditions such as humidity, heat, stress, exercise and health can have an effect on a female's body which can affect the sex of her young.

The reproductive organs of the Bwaps are internal in both the male and female, sharing a single vent (known as a cloaca) with the digestive tract. Fertilization occurs internally and the female lays a single soft shelled non-
amniotic egg. Multiple eggs are not unheard of, with two eggs being uncommon and three eggs rarely laid. The eggs are incubated by the female in her pouch until they hatch. The young are practically helpless when they first hatched, being blind with limbs not completely developed. The mother does not produce milk but excretes a nutritious mucus from pores in the pouch that the young is able to ingest easily. At four weeks of age the young Bwap has developed sufficiently to leave the pouch intermittently for short periods of time. At this point, the mother stops producing the nutritious mucus and instead provides food to the young that has been chewed into an easily swallowed paste and passed directly mouth-to-mouth.

### LIFESPAN

Bwaps have a shorter life expectancy than humans, with most living to approximately 65 or 75 years of age. There is no appreciable difference between the lifespans of males or females. Bwaps are able to take anagathics but most find them to be distasteful and going against the principle of the Wapawab philosophy.

### DIET

Bwaps enjoy an omnivorous diet consisting primarily of vegetable matter with small amounts of protein such as fish, insects and amphibians. With the advent of agriculture, Bwaps discovered that preparation improved the taste of food and aided in the absorption of nutrients. Before the use of fire, Bwaps relied on brining or soaking foods in mild acidic solutions as a means of preparation, while salt was used to preserve meat. With the discovery of fire, Bwaps utilised it somewhat in cooking but preferred to maintain their more traditional food preparation techniques. Exposure to an interstellar community and trade brought new types of alien food as well, many of which were introduced into Bwap diet, although Bwaps do not enjoy alcoholic beverages of any sort. Sauces were brought to the Bwaps by the Vilani and were enthusiastically adopted into their cuisine. Terran foods such as lobster, caviar, kale, bok-choy, wom-bok and asparagus are widely enjoyed by Bwaps.

### BWAP FOOD

As new foods were introduced to Bwap culture, Bwap cuisine was introduced to the stellar community.

Examples of Bwap delicacies that are often enjoyed by other sophonts include:
Appepa-tep: A fat purple worm with bright pink mottling and sharp mandibles that make eating this delicacy live slightly hazardous. Traditionally served live but can be cooked in a variety of ways. Bapawa-a-a-bap: A large purple fruit with thick skin, pink sweet flesh and a bitter, jelly-like stone served with a savory sauce. Dawa-daw Shoots: Brined shoots of the naw-
naw tree with crunchy outside bark and soft undeveloped leaves within that have the texture of cheese and the flavor of candied anchovies. Kabapa-kapa-wapapab Grub: Fat spherical grubs with three tentacles served live. Kekepabweke-a: Thick brown vegetable pod served pickled and jellied in the bitter juice of the wak-a-wekapak fruit. Pawbawa-a-pawa: An astringent marsh grass served pickled in kappa-bawabaw mucus and accompanied by raw reepa-reep eggs. Reepa-reep Eggs: The eggs of the reepa-reep, eaten raw or pickled. Wak-a-wekapak: Pulpy red fruit with many large seeds and bitter juice, eaten raw or the juice used as a pickling agent.

### SOCIETY

Bwap society is centered on the crèche, or Atta-
wapawab, which can be considered analogous to a nursery and boarding school where young Bwaps are sheltered, fed and trained in the customs and traditions of their clans. They are also provided with the technical skills and education necessary to be a productive member of an interstellar community. Bwaps are considered mature at 14 years and at that point enter a four year period of intense testing and training to determine how they properly fit into their place in the universe. At 18 years of age a Bwap is considered fully mature and may enter into an occupation or pursue further education depending on the results of their earlier training and testing.

Bwaps who have become too old or infirm to pursue their former career or have chosen to retire, normally between the ages of 55 and 65 standard years, are also sent to the crèches where they act as teaching assistants, baby-
sitters and spiritual advisors to juvenile Bwaps.

Crèches can come in many sizes ranging from a small affair supporting only a few dozen Bwaps to enormous organizations serving hundreds of thousands of Bwaps. The crèche is where the Satha-a-atta-wabapawab
(Elders of the Crèche) sit. The Satha-a-atta-
wabapawab serve their crèche by combining aspects of mentors, seekers, diplomats and philosophical leaders. One of their primary duties is to teach young Bwaps about the Wepawab philosophy, which governs a Bwap's existence. Additionally, Satha-a-atta-
wapawab provide mediation and guidance for crèches and explore nearby worlds to gather information and experience that will aid their people and the pursuit of the Wapawab. To make matters more confusing, Satha-a-atta-wapawab is the same term given to informal groups of elder Bwaps that serve as leaders, high government officials and the repository of 'law' (the traditional way of doing things).

Females in Bwap society are held in high regard. The natural reproductive processes of Bwaps will only result in a female 30% of the time, making the population heavily-biased towards the male. This has resulted in females being protected and rarely seen in public. Nearly all females reside in the crèches where they assist in the raising and educating of the young, act as record keepers, assistants to the Elders and similar tasks. Only females that are, for whatever reason, unable to reproduce tend to be found outside the crèche.

Crèches form the center of a Bwap's identity and they never leave their crèche voluntarily; to even consider leaving a crèche is believed to be a sign of profound insanity. In rare cases, a Bwap is forcibly expelled from their crèche but this is always as the result of extreme criminal behaviour. When this does occur, the records of the Bwap's existence in the crèche are wiped clean, essentially removing the individual from existence. Those who suffer such an ejection are viewed as 'unclean', outcasts and no longer a member of the Bwap race.

### FAMILY

Bwaps do not hold family relationships in any high regard, feeling their position in the clan and crèche has greater importance. They consider their ties to occupation, duty and crèche to be of overwhelming importance while viewing the relationship of parent and sibling to be relatively insignificant. It is not that they do not care about their family relationships; they have been taught from early childhood that the crèche and clan is of far greater importance and the thought of parents or siblings rarely, if ever, crosses their minds.

Bwaps have no concept of marriage and no social convention that resembles pair-bonding. Several adult Bwaps may come together in what other races would comprehend as a familial group, known as a 'wapawab'
or just 'wab'. To Bwaps, this form of wapawab is a grouping of convenience and not of love or reproduction. It is a network of individuals that live in the same abode, support each other emotionally and share in financial expenses. Like a marriage, the wab is a legally binding institution and contracts are signed on the commencement of such a grouping. Individuals may join a wab with the consent of a majority of the existing members or leave in accordance with their contract, taking what possessions they entered into the grouping and a share of assets and debts accrued as a group.

### THE WAPAWAB

Originally the Wapawab referred to a collection of loosely-connected creches, forming a clan or tribal group, which approximated the city state in other cultures. To make matters more confusing, there appears to be an infinite number of lesser
'trees', also called wapawabs (lowercase w). Wapawabs can consist of only a few individuals or many and ultimately billions in the case of the ultimate Tree of Life. Even non-Bwaps may belong to some wapawabs.

Reproduction, on the other hand, is a function of the crèche. Every year, the crèche elders (Satha-a-atta-wapawab) come together to decide on breeding pairs for that mating season. This process requires the meticulous examination of genealogical records, medical records, previous breeding partners and resultant offspring to ensure that the best possible genetic outcome is obtained and close relatives are not inadvertently paired. When the matched pair are ready, mating occurs in a private mud bath within the crèche. Once mating has been successful, the pair separate and the father generally has nothing more to do with the mother or offspring in a paternal role.

### BELIEFS

Bwap society is based on the Wapawab philosophy that dominates their lives. While not a religion in the normal sense, it governs almost every aspect of the Bwaps' lives and is followed with an intensity normally reserved for religious beliefs in other cultures. The philosophy holds that each individual has a place in the clan or pawab (tree).

The literal tree is an important part of the ecology, intimately connected to the planet and providing food and shelter for hundreds of different species, providing the Bwaps with materials, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, converting sunlight and minerals to sustain itself and so on. The figurative tree, called the Wapawab or Tree of Life, is harder to describe. The term has its origins in the Bwaps' primordial habitat but has been expanded to include a place of work or duty, native country, planet and bloodlines. Loosely translated, the Wapawab details the Bwap's place and occupation within the crèche, which identifies their place and part in the planetary society and ecosystem, and then interstellar society, and finally the cosmos. Everything Bwaps do reflects this complex wheel-within-wheels, patterns-within-patterns point of view. Each individual is raised and educated to value and take great pride in being a small cog in the greater, ever-changing, growing and expanding universe of interlocking cogs and patterns.

Bwaps have no concept of a spiritual soul. They believe that after death the energy and matter they are composed of is absorbed by the Tree of Life and redistributed among Bwaps yet to be born. There are no particular funerary customs except for those specific to each clans' tradition. The clan members ensure the body is buried as soon as is practical after death. Some clans practice cremation with ashes scattered in the nearest undeveloped area, usually a jungle or swamp.

Those born with full webbing between their fingers are believed to be marked for some special purpose despite the webbing being removed as soon as possible. It is up to the individual Bwap to discover and determine what that future will be, perhaps with assistance from instructors and elders.

Like most intelligent species, each Bwap is an individual and interprets the Wabapwab differently but even the most independent of Bwaps reveres the philosophy and their place in the universe.

Considering the subtleties of Wapawab philosophy and the mysterious workings of Bwap bureaucracy, Mahaban and other Bwap dominated worlds are difficult places for inexperienced humans to operate in or do business with. Regulations, traditions, policies and philosophy all blend together in every day Marhaban life and Bwap predilection for doing things the proper way means that the perceived level of legal coverage and administrative oversight seem greater and more confusing on Bwap worlds than in any other Imperial system.

### RITUAL

Bwaps are highly focused on, and some would say obsessed with, minutiae, ritual and proper conduct. Driven by this desire to ensure that everything is in its proper place, Bwaps make excellent bureaucrats, officials, mathematicians and scientists. This fixation is what makes them such highly prized employees in corporations and governments throughout Charted Space. Bwaps seek this perfection in the organization of everything they do and to do otherwise would disrupt the efficient functioning of their part of the universe. All Bwaps are motivated to ensure that nothing in their lives, be that public, private or personal is out of place or disorganised. Furthermore, Bwaps believe that it is only through their direct action that they can bring order to the universe and it is their priority to see universal order achieved.

Their obsession with ritual and proper conduct make Bwaps difficult to deal with. The way they greet each other is viewed as overly chatty and long-winded by non-Bwaps but essentially imparts ' I am in this place and doing this job to keep the Cosmos operating properly. Where are you and what do you do to keep the Cosmos operating properly? ' Those who go against the 'proper way of doing things' will often find themselves lectured at great length on the importance and proprieties of doing things in the correct and proper fashion. Dealing with Bwaps can be time consuming but trying to hurry a Bwap will only cause both parties aggravation and frustration, taking up even more time.

Mud bathing is an important Bwap ritual, playing a major part in their culture and society. Mud bathing is one of the most common daily activities in Bwap lives and practiced across the entire strata of Bwap society be they cleaners, businessmen, bureaucrats, officials or elders. Mud baths range the gamut of small rooms intended for the use of just wapawab members and their guests, to large public buildings open to all. While many sophonts think of bathing as a private affair, Bwaps see the mud bath as a meeting point, a place of discussion, business and politics. Elders will gather in the mud baths to deliberate over issues at hand, form alliances and debate mating pairs. Merchants will haggle and seal deals in mud baths while others will relax and unwind from a long day's work. Rumor, knowledge and power are all valuable currencies and complex ritual revolves around mud bath interactions. It is rare for those who are not knowledgeable in Bwap interaction to be invited to the baths.

**CONSERVATISM**
Bwaps are a conservative race. Innovation is not something they seek and they are not known for inspiration or leaps of intuition. This conservative nature can be seen throughout the Bwap race. Even Bwap communities that have been isolated for hundreds of years, as occurred during the Long Night, were discovered to have hardly changed their social structure, language or philosophy, even if they had fallen back into barbarism. This has led some researchers to consider that Bwap conservatism is in at least some part genetic.

**GOVERNMENT**
Bwaps have no official over-arching governing body. Each Bwap planet governs itself without recourse to other worlds apart from the sense that they all follow the same set of general principles. Planets that are completely controlled by Bwaps are designated with either Government code 11 (non-charismatic dictatorship) or 13
(religious dictatorship) because the Bwap world view and philosophy is pursued with such vigour. Law Levels are also equally high, typically Law Level 10+, with high levels of official harassment of citizenry reflecting the Bwaps obsession with 'proper' behaviour.

The Atapas-atta-wapabab (the Great Council of Crèches) presides over the formation and continued existence of Bwap crèches. Imperial authorities view the Atapas-atta-wapawab more as an administrative

department within Bwap culture than an actual political entity and therefore have allowed it to exist without outside interference. A popular misconception is that the Great Council only rules Marhaban and the nearest colonies but has jurisdiction over all Bwap crèches no matter how near or far they are.

All public officials, judges, bureaucrats, inspectors and so on are appointed by the Great Council of Crèches with no terms of office, no elections, no checks or balances, in fact no limits on power at all except for the Bwap adherence to clan and tradition. This may seem a chaotic way of doing things to outsiders but the sense of tradition among Bwaps holds the weight of law and it is almost unheard of for officials to take advantage of their positions. A Bwap who feels they are no longer able to 'fulfil their part to keep the cosmos operating properly' will resign their position and retire.

Another wide-ranging Bwap organization is the Wewaka-
atapas or Council of Seemly Order. In the distant past of Marhaban, the Council of Seemly Order would be best described by other races as a religious order, serving as the overseers of ethics and right thinking. Over the centuries since contact with the Vilani, the Council of Seemly Order evolved due to the influence of Vilani bureaucracy and business structures. The Council gradually took on the responsibilities of managing the bureaucratic and accounting practices as observed by the Bwaps. Since the Bwaps became heavily involved in Vilani bureaucracy, the Council of Seemly Order expanded its portfolio to include the overseeing of generally accepted accounting practices within the Ziru Sirka, the Rule of Man and eventually the Third Imperium.

### JUSTICE

Criminal behaviour is rare among Bwaps. They consider it the worst form of mental illness, primarily because it disrupts the proper order of things. Their definition of crime however can differ somewhat to the Imperial norm. The elimination of disruptive criminal behaviour is seen as a good thing, even if that means the death of the culprit. Fortunately, Bwaps are often satisfied with exiling non-Bwap criminals, be that offworld, out of the system or even beyond the subsector. Bwap criminals are subjected to severe mental conditioning to cure the mental illness and return them to their proper place in society as a responsible and contributing member.

### DRESS, ART AND ARCHITECTURE

Bwaps have no taboos concerning nudity and only require clothing as a way to keep their skin moist, a means of identification and a source of pockets to store necessary equipment. Bwaps normally wear a comfortable loose-fitting kaftan-like garment covering most of the body and a hood or covering for the head, a garment consisting of three layers; an internal layer permeated with a network of fine tubes through which water flows to keep the skin moist, an intermediate water-proof layer that prevents moisture from evaporating and keeping the outer flowing layer dry and an outer layer coloured with a stylised representation of the individual's body markings as the recognition of body patterns is an important aspect of the greeting ritual. In occupations where the Bwap must handle objects that can be damaged by moisture they wear long thin waterproof gloves covering their arms and hands. In extremely dry conditions Bwaps carry a mist sprayer with which to moisten their face.

Like the kaftan, all additional clothing, vacc suits, hostile environment suits and other body coverings are coloured in the stylised pattern of the Bwap's body markings. The only exception to this is military combat uniforms that maintain the need for camouflage and concealment. This makes Bwaps' clothing highly individual and Bwap vacc suits, hostile environment suits and other outfits are slightly more expensive as a result. Full dress military uniforms are permitted to have some individual markings to help identify crèche and clan.

Art and architecture, like everything associated with Bwaps, follows a traditional and socially accepted style that has remained essentially unchanged for thousands of years. Painting, drawing, sculpture and architecture all have standard protocols that are followed precisely by Bwap artists.

Sculpture and other three dimensional art forms are quite formal and aim to reproduce the real world, although they do convey an idealised version of their subject. Paintings and drawings attempt to provide the most representative aspects of each element in scenes rather than attempting to create vistas that replicate the real world. The use of colour is also conservative, with specific rules on how and when it is to be used, which colours may appear in the same composition, which media can be used together and even the method in which pigments are obtained and manufactured.

Bwap artwork is easily identifiable to even the least dedicated student of interstellar arts. Other cultures often view it unfavorably, finding it to be static, formal, strangely abstract and lacking in perspective. Despite this, Bwap art has developed a dedicated following, especially among the Vilani who appreciate the conservative nature of the depictions. There are plenty of collectors who will pay top Credit for original Bwap artworks.

Architecture follows two schools of thought. The first, and most popular, is an organic style that blends with the environment, being part of and not apart from nature. This style is found on planets most suited to Bwaps. Building shapes are those that are found in nature, organiform, with the dome being the most common form. Externally, buildings are most often covered in a scaffold-type pattern similar to the structure found inside the hollow bones of birds. Additionally, the exterior of buildings are designed to support plant-life growing on them. Internally, structures are designed to emulate in function if not necessarily in style the ancient burrows that Bwaps originally inhabited. Convoluted, winding passageways leading to various rooms for both shared and private use. Larger rooms are supported by columns made to resemble root-like structures. Sharp corners are never encountered either internally or externally.

The second architectural school of thought is one found on worlds or habitats not ideal for Bwaps. This style is clearly artificial with no attempts made to blend into the environment. The style is still organic in nature but the form is less strict, allowing the appearance of sharp angles and corners where necessary. Internally, this style still utilises winding burrow-like designs of the first school.

### CITIES

There are no Bwap cities outside of those planets that are totally controlled by them. These cities can be found in two distinct styles. Those located on worlds suitable to Bwap requirements are carefully designed to impact the environment as little as possible. Populations are kept relatively small, pollution maintained at a minimum level and heavy industry located offworld. Conservation of the environment is of high importance and cities appear to be part of the natural landscape as opposed to artificial constructs.

With the advent of suitable gravitic technology, sky-
cities became common in an attempt to reduce any negative effect on native ecologies further.

On worlds that do not meet the Bwaps' environmental needs, cities can be large and sprawling affairs, with little attention paid to the effect it may have on the environment. Artificial means are used to increase heat and humidity, and often the cities are enclosed or sealed in some way. In these environments, archologies are a favored housing system.

Bwap archologies and sealed cities often have amazingly complex environments of their own. Nearly all have artificial swamps complete with animals and plants imported from Marhaban to allow Bwaps to reconnect with their natural habitat, as a reminder of where they have come from. In some cases, just like on Marhaban, it can be difficult to ascertain exactly where the artificial swamp ends and the city begins.

In larger starports and major planets, particularly along the x-boat routes, there will be a 'Bwap Quarter' where Bwap employees make their homes either temporarily or permanently. These quarters are normally the province of a single crèche and will have its own elders, nursery, artificial swamp and whatever else Bwaps

require for a 'proper' home environment. They require little in the way of unusual habitations other than high humidity and occasional fungal treatments.

### BUSINESS

Bwaps will come together on business ventures, forming corporations and organizations, but these normally remain small and local. There are no Bwap megacorporations, primarily because no Bwap has ever concluded that the cosmos requires one. Bwap entrepreneurs throw themselves whole-heartedly –
some would say obsessively – into their business ventures to the exclusion of all other activities, except where their place in the universe requires that they do otherwise for a time. The concept of a vacation is almost totally foreign to Bwaps. This is not to say that they do not rest, as they need to sleep and relax like other races, although their form of relaxation may seem surprising; doing something like bookkeeping is relaxing to a Bwap. Their entrepreneurs are seen as driven and single-minded by almost everyone else.

### THE MILITARY

The Tap-a-wewaka-atapas (Guardians of Order) serve as the observational and enforcement arm of the Grand Council of Crèches and holds great power over crèches and worlds despite having no official Imperial sanction. The Guardians of Order are the protectors and wardens of Bwap-dominated planets, acting first and foremost as a military defence force. When the Atapas-
atta-wapawab requires information or enforcement of a decision, it is the Tap-a-wewaka-atapas that takes that direction and transforms it into reality.

The Guardians of Order are not broken up into separate services, although they are given individual training. So, the Guardians of Order contain navy, army, marine, police and emergency forces in a unified arm.

### LANGUAGE AND NUMBERS

The Bwap language, Wawa-pakekeke-wawa (literally
'sounds of knowledge'), has been described as thick and melodic, the words sounding like the plops of bursting mud bubbles. It is not unpleasant to listen to but proves to be rather difficult for other races to master. Conversely, Bwaps have little trouble learning the languages of others, although their accent can be thick and a little hard to understand.

The language has only two vowels and 12 consonants as well as a click represented by '-' in Anglic. Wawa-pakekeke-
wawa is the only living Bwap language, although there are several minor dialects of interest only to scholars. Several languages were in existence prior to Vilani contact but their use was quickly superseded or absorbed into Wawa-
pakekeke-wawa and died out in the Long Night.

Verbs are always placed at the end of a sentence, making a running translation of the Bwap language difficult; the entire sentence needs to be heard or read completely before the full meaning can be ascertained. The difference between ' Your cargo manifest correct ' and ' Your cargo manifest correct not ' illustrates this problem perfectly. Mechanical translations of the Bwap language tend to be slower than others as a result, further exasperating the difficulty of dealing with Bwap bureaucrats.

Bwap modules for electronic translators are available wherever Bwaps are common.

Names tend to be long, reflecting the Bwap desire to specify exactly where everything goes and how it relates to everything else. Other races tend to shorten names
(much to the Bwaps displeasure) to make them easier to pronounce and deal with during normal conversation.

### BWAP SCRIPT

The Bwap language uses two different alphabets. The first is called Fathpebwewa-bwapawepa; a highly ornate and decorative alphabet with over 4,000 characters, which represent individual letters, words, emotions and concepts. The alphabet is used exclusively for formal occasions or official documents. Fathpebwewa-bwapawepa is extremely difficult for non-Bwaps to learn and only a handful of distinguished linguists grasp it in its entirety.

The second alphabet is call Bawewa-bawap. It has a far more utilitarian form and contains only 15 letters. This alphabet is used on a day-to-day basis and is easily learnt by other races.

### BWAP MATHEMATICS

Bwaps have four digits on each hand and on each foot, leading to the development of a base-16 or hexadecimal numbering system (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12, and so on). In the decimal system, each decimal place is a factor of 10, whereas in the Bwap method, each hexadecimal place is a factor of 16.

Hexadecimal is an elegant mathematical method where units are evenly divided with no need for fractions. The Bwap hexadecimal system rapidly became the standard method used for accounting and record keeping within Imperium government departments.

### HISTORY

Bwaps are renowned for their record keeping. Before the advent of the Long Night, their historical record stretched unbroken to the earliest days of their civilization. Unfortunately, the collapse of the Rule of Man brought with it a commensurate collapse of technology and many historical records were lost. This was a devastating blow to Bwap culture and they struggled to regain what they had lost. Much of what they have reconstructed, particularly from their early history, has been recovered from archaeological digs and they continue to this day to regain records they once had of their past. The Third Imperium is at the forefront of this research and a number of educational institutes and prestigious universities assist in this endeavor.

### PREHISTORY

Bwaps evolved from aquatic omnivore amphibianoid ancestors that made their homes in burrows between the roots of mangrove-like trees in the prehistoric swampy jungles of Marhaban. The evolution of the pouch and the soft-shelled egg removed the need for water to raise their young and enabled Bwaps to move

into trees to find food. They continued to return to their communal burrows to rear their young. The development of simple communication and co-operation led to the beginnings of culture. Climate change saw the shrinking of the swamps and forced Bwaps into increased competition with other animals in the region, leading to the evolution of sentience. The discovery of simple stone tools, agriculture and animal husbandry gave them a significant competitive advantage and led to the formation of the first crèche groups.

### EARLY CIVILISATION

As crèches grew larger and Bwaps ventured further afield, it was inevitable that they would come into contact with each other. Bwap psychology naturally lends itself to cooperation and negotiation rather than aggression, leading to the joining of individual crèches to form the first tribes for mutual protection and the nurturing of young. Armed conflict between tribes was almost unheard of, preferring that each went their own way if an understanding could not be reached.

Fire, considered a crucial discovery for the growth towards civilization, was absent in the early period of Bwap progress due to their environment and was not discovered until quite late. Without fire, Bwaps had to rely on cold-worked metal such as gold and copper to create tools and weapons. Iron was not known to the Bwaps except from random exposed deposits and in the form of red pigment derived from iron oxide. Despite this, Bwaps successfully formed several early civilizations and the first cities grew as clans banded together for mutual benefit. The ruins from this era show that despite the introduction of modern materials, Bwap culture and art has changed little over the length of their civilization. Statuary and art from this era, for example, are almost identical in style to modern examples and for this reason are considered highly important by archaeologists of the Third Imperium.

With the discovery of fire came the working of metal, the realization that cooked food tasted better and the beginnings of chemistry that allowed early settlements to expand and develop rapidly into cities-states. City-states soon came into contact with each other but with other races this would often lead to war, the Bwaps discovered they shared many ideals despite never having been in contact.

Bwap psychology naturally lends itself to cooperation and negotiation rather than aggression, leading to the joining of individual city-states to form nations. This led to further co-operation and the sharing of knowledge and technology between nations. Armed conflict was a rare occurrence.

Bwap civilization formed a world government as it advanced to TL7 where it stabilized and remained for hundreds of years until first contact with the Vilani.

### VILANI CONTACT

The Vilani discovered the Bwap homeworld early during their exploration of the Empty Quarter. The Bwaps were quickly assimilated and their world given the Vilani name of Lentuli. Exposure to the Vilani brought a technological renaissance to the Bwaps and within only 75 years had advanced into, and stabilized, at a TL10 society. With their conservative outlook and traditional attitude, the Vilani found kindred spirits and useful allies in the Bwaps. Their attention to detail and desire to follow protocol led to Bwaps being employed within the retinues of senior Vilani nobles where they quickly made themselves indispensable. Over the next millennium this policy was extended to mid-level nobles and administration of the Vilani bureau. The heartless Vilani bureaucracy that ground other races into dust lifted the Bwaps into a golden age and they filled every position available to them, making them one of the most wide-spread Minor Races in Charted Space.

The Consolidation Wars and formation of the Ziru Sirka
(Grand Empire of the Stars, historically known as the First Imperium) saw no resistance from Bwaps who viewed the empire as a natural ordering of the universe. Considering the Bwap's place within Vilani society, their part in the administration of the Ziru Sirka was a perfectly natural development for their race. They moved further out into space, aiding the Vilani in their exploration and governance of new territories and species.

As they grew in position and power, Bwaps were able to find loopholes and exceptions to the restrictions of jump technology imposed on other Minor Races and were able to obtain permission to build their own fleet of jump-
1 vessels. The secret of the jump drive allowed Bwaps to explore the stars under their own power. Colonists first settled the world of Wesawek and then established footholds on other new worlds. Merchants plied their wares along the mains, finding new opportunities and returning wealth to Lentuli. In less than 300 years Bwaps were granted a license to build jump-2 vessels by the Ishimkarun (Shadow Emperor), a privilege bestowed on a Minor Race completely unheard of in the past and never repeated again by the Vilani.

Co-operation between Bwaps and the Ziru Sirka would continue until the discovery of a race of humans from the planet Terra who resisted Vilani control and instigated the Interstellar Wars, a series of nine conflicts that lasted more than 200 years and eventually saw the demise of the Great Empire of the Stars.

**THE LONG NIGHT**
With the culmination of the Interstellar Wars and the fall of the Ziru Sirka, a power vacuum was left that the Terrans, now known as the Solomani, immediately stepped into. This new era, the Rule of Man (historically referred to as the Second Imperium or, less graciously, the Ramshackle Empire), had practically no effect on the Bwaps, who saw it as just the 'proper' unfolding of events. The Solomani had no experience in running an empire the size of the Ziru Sirka and relied on Bwaps to assist in the administration of what they had conquered. Even so, the Gushgus sector remained ungoverned for nine years and interstellar commerce dwindled to almost nothing. A new regional government was established with the arrival of a Terran frigate but the results were generally poor, primarily because the new government had little experience. Only Bwap worlds managed to regain their former positions but this had less to do with the new governance and more to do with Bwap obsession with order.

Terran settlers eventually arrived in the area, the first wave consisting of Solomani primarily of Arab descent. It was during this time that Lentuli was renamed Marhaban, the Arabic word for 'hello'. These settlers became the nobles of the area. Duke Mus'ad eventually renamed the Gushgus sector the Empty Quarter after a barren region from his native Arabia.

Bwap worlds were becoming increasingly subject to Vargr pillaging during this period. The Solomani government created more and more money to fight off the incursions, which in turn caused inflation to skyrocket and plunged many worlds into financial ruin. Bwap worlds, used to strong Vilani economic policy,

### JUMP TECHNOLOGY

The exact method that Bwaps used to obtain jump-
2 technology remains a mystery to this day. The fact that the Shadow Emperor granted the race a licence to build jump-2 drives was completely unheard of and rumor prevails as to how it was achieved. Some believe that Bwaps used bureaucratic trickery to obtain the licence, where others believe the Shadow Emperor provided the technology as a reward for Bwap services to the Imperium. Whatever the truth is, or even if the truth is still known, is up for contention and if the Bwaps know, they are keeping it to themselves.

failed to adapt to this new reality and suffered badly. However, through concentrated effort, the Guardians of Order had grown strong enough to shield four worlds from Vargr aggression while Bwap communities established a stable 'hard-money' currency regime that would outlast the Rule of Man.

Human worlds were not as lucky. In addition to suffering runaway inflation and economic hardship, the abolishment of the Vilani caste system proved to be too much. Rebellion became almost as common as Vargr incursions and with the conflict between the Central Bank at Hub and the Bank of Antares, the Rule of Man collapsed and the Long Night fell, seeing the withdrawal of the Second Imperium and an increase of Vargr corsair incursions.

Interstellar trade faded quickly during the Long Night as travel between worlds became more difficult and eventually stopped. Bwaps tried to hold onto the advanced technology they had but as trade dwindled and finally ceased, the materials they required to maintain technology become impossible to source. Many of the technological advancements Bwaps had gained from the Vilani were lost. Marhaban was never completely cut off from interstellar trade, with infrequent visits by Bwap leaders, scouts and traders from within the Vargr Extents. The majority of Bwap worlds however, were isolated from each other for hundreds of years. Most struggled just to survive in hostile environments without the advantage of interstellar trade to supply what their planets could not provide. Technology on Marhaban finally stabilized at TL7 but other Bwap worlds slipped further; some into barbarism and a few to extinction.

On many worlds, Bwaps suffered greatly from racism and xenophobia. Crèches on human-majority worlds were wiped out as they were seen as symbols of the oppressive Vilani governmental structure. As the Imperial governance fell, so did Bwaps as a symbol of that power. On other, dryer worlds, crèches faded and died due to a lack of technology needed to maintain the humid environment they needed. This forced serious competition with humans over water and led to a series of savage wars and the destruction of those crèches that remained.

Once the Vargr Pillages had ended, the Bwaps of Marhaban focused on regaining lost technology. Through sheer stubbornness and determination, they managed to claw their way back to TL10 and again returned to the stars. Anticipating a warm welcome from other worlds, the Bwaps were horrified to discover that not only was their arrival on human worlds greeted with hatred and xenophobia but also that the crèches they expected to find had been eradicated. This forced the Grand Council to turn their focus from continued technological

advancement to first the protection and then the evacuation of all surviving crèches on human-dominated worlds. Unfortunately, the Tap-a-wewaka-atapas could, at best, only act as a stop-gap measure, protecting crèches long enough to evacuate the females and young but dooming those left to fend for themselves.

This stance came to a head when the Tap-awewaka-
atapas sought permission from the Grand Council of Crèches to use orbital bombardment on those human cities that threatened crèches. The Council feared such a posture would lead only to further human aggression and potentially the extinction of the Bwap race. Despite strong opposition from the Tapa-awewaka-atapas, their request was denied.

Through concerted effort, those crèches that could be evacuated were saved and Bwaps returned to advancing their technology. After considerable effort, Marhaban slowly regained TL11 and jump-2 technology. The Grand Council of Crèches decided to seek out all lost Bwap colonies to ensure they were safe and that they continued to follow the tenants of Wapawab philosophy.

Brave and intrepid Bwap scouts faced barbarism and xenophobia to discover their lost brethren, some making journeys of legendary proportions. One Bwap Traveller named Watwapebpepaeb crossed an amazing 140 parsecs in a 200-ton, jump-2 starship to bring the Bwaps of the Old Expanses up-to-date on the last millennia of Atapasatta-wapawab rulings.

As Marhaban and Wesawek expanded further into space, new trade routes were developed, bringing with it renewed wealth and allowing Bwaps to regain a level of technology on par to that of the last days of the Second Imperium. This allowed the (re)founding of new colonies on several planets. Other Bwaps migrated to wealthy human worlds where their love of bureaucracy and order was warmly welcomed. Each of these colonies maintained a contingent of Tap-
awewaka-atapas; the lessons of previous centuries not forgotten. Despite this, Bwap-dominated worlds never created an interstellar government. The Grand Council was only interested in the maintenance of crèches and the adherence to the Wesawek philosophy, not interstellar domination or control.

The arrival of Bwap scouts at Marhaban from the Sylean Federation was seen as a cause of great celebration. When the scouts arrived, they found a functional starport, a thin but steady stream of interstellar trade and a beacon of order. Sylean Bwap scouts found that Bwap society was essentially unchanged. Despite the collapse and return of

advanced technology and vast interstellar distances, there was virtually no cultural or linguistic drift. Visits from the Sylean Federation continued and in time the Absaba-waketh-we-bapaaes Charter – a joint trading venture between Marhaban and the Sylean Government – was established, further weakening the grip of the Long Night on the area and acting as a shining beacon of hope and advanced culture.

### THIRD IMPERIUM

With the declaration of Imperial Rule the Slylean Federation became the Third Imperium, Marhaban had become a minor trade nexus with the Sylean, Vargr and Vilani. The Menderes Corporation traders routinely made annual and semi-annual visits although most trade was with Bwaps from the Vargr Extents. Satha-a-atta-
wapawab ('Elders of the crèche') from every Bwap colony with sufficient resources visited Marhaban to consult with the Atapas-atta-wapawab for legal rulings and counsel on matters of protocol and policy. The Tap-a-wewaka-atapas protected Marhaban and a few nearby systems from the now rare but still dangerous Vargr pirate bands.

Marhaban soon received an invitation to join the third Imperium and accepted eagerly, followed by every other Bwap dominated world. Quickly they made themselves as indispensable to the new stellar government as they were to the Ziru Sirka, stepping into the same roles they once held.

Bwap presence in the Imperium was elevated when A-estaka-sespa of the Sathwawafa Clan was selected by the Emperor to govern as subsector duke. A-estaka-
sespa was the first Bwap to be raised to ducal status and one of only a few non-human dukes in the Imperium. He used his position to petition the Emperor to rename the subsector Lentuli in honor of Marhaban's Vilani designation and for the further glory of the Lentuli family's dynasty. The request was granted and the subsector has been known as Lentuli ever since.

The advent of the Imperial Civil War saw chaos again descend on the Bwaps and the dissolution of Imperial governance in the sector saw the return of Vargr pirates. For almost two decades, the Tep-awewaka-atapas held the line and defended the subsector from the worst of Vargr incursions. The conclusion of the war saw the restoration of Imperial rule to the sector as well as the edict that only Bwaps were to sit as subsector dukes of Lentuli as a reward for their perseverance in maintaining order throughout the absence of Imperial oversight.

The ducal seat of the Empty Quarter became vacant in the last decade of the Third Imperium's first millennium. Upon the death of the heirless aging sector duke, the

senior nobility could not agree on whom to select as a successor. Eventually, it became obvious that none of the human dukes or duchesses would allow any other to rise to the sector throne. To prevent the interference of the archduke, a meeting of senior nobility was called to decide on a nomination for the sector seat. This became an exercise of finding the least hated noble to nominate, as opposed to the most popular or qualified. With no other options available to them, the sector peerage nominated Subsector Duke Dethwab-
takebwebwakawa of the Bebewebboekebseb clan to become the first Bwap sector duke of Empty Quarter, on the proviso that he would name as his heir a human of Solomani descent. The Emperor was delighted with the suggestion and after weeks of discussions with the Grand Council of Crèches and deep introspection, Duke Dethwab-takebwebwakawa accepted the position offered. While many human nobles of the sector outwardly embraced the new duke, secretly they were less than satisfied. Under the rule of the new duke, Imperial law became increasingly inflexible and enforced to the last subclause regardless of facts on the ground. This strict adherence became to be seen as arbitrary, untrustworthy and essentially tyrannical, especially by the Solomani population.

Duke Dethwab-takebwebwakawa proved to be an efficient leader, known for sticking strictly to the letter of the law. During his reign, he was responsible for reducing piracy in the Empty Quarter considerably, not through overwhelming forces but his race's natural ability to see patterns within the order of things. On the duke's death, the sector throne fell to the heir of his choice, one of Solomani decent as was stipulated.

Bwaps have spread to every corner of the Third Imperium but are most common in the Empty Quarter. The Bwap core worlds are places of intense, if not maddening, bureaucracy but it cannot be denied that without their expertise and desire for order, the Third Imperium would be much worse for wear. Besides Humaniti in all its diversity, Bwaps are one of the most common races encountered within the Imperium and can be found well beyond its borders. Corporations are eager to add Bwaps to their payroll and governments find them indispensable administrators. They have become synonymous with excessive bureaucracy, adherence to rules and a devotion to formalities.

# THE BWAP HOMEWORLD

Bwaps evolved on Marhaban (A5697AB-D), in the Lentuli subsector of the Empty Quarter. The homeworld of the Bwaps is occasionally confused with another world of the same name located in the Lishun sector which is a desert world completely devoid of moisture. This has been a source of some puzzlement to casual astrographic chart readers.

Marhaban was the name given to the system by the Solomani but the word has its roots in the Arabic language. The Bwap have several names for their world including Wa-bawapakerwa-a-a-a-awa-
pawabawabawaba, loosely meaning 'small branch of the large and great tree that floats in the endlessly vast ocean', Peka-wapawab, loosely meaning 'beloved, small branch of the great tree', and TaswaBwapeaspa, loosely meaning 'fruitful branch of the great tree'.

Bwaps use each of the three names for their planet under very particular circumstances. Wa-bawapakerwa-
a-a-a-awa-pawabawabawaba is only used on formal occasions whereas Peka-wapawab is used only in an informal manner. TaswaBwapeaspa is used primarily in a professional manner when the Bwaps refer to their world in a business sense.

### MAINWORLD DATA

Marhaban has a 21 hour day and a 358 day year, which is remarkably close to the Terran standard. Marhaban's axial tilt is very small but its orbit is slightly erratic leading to frequent (in geological terms) climate shifts that have had a major impact on Bwaps and their development. The planet has no moon but the suns generate tides of 30–60 centimeters.

Marhaban has a warm and hospitable climate with temperatures averaging 32oC and a sea-level air pressure of 1.05 standard atmospheres. The atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen, oxygen and water vapour, with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules making it breathable with humidity averaging 98%. There are no major pollutants or other oddities. Due to the high humidity, weather patterns include a heavy amount of precipitation, with rain occurring on most days throughout the year depending on topographical and seasonal variations.

### GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY

Marhaban is a rocky body with a molten core of iron, providing the planet with a magnetic belt that protects the surface from stellar radiation. The planet is remarkably dense due to large quantities of metals deep within the crust, producing a gravity of 0.78G. While Marhaban is wealthy in metals, the majority are difficult to access due to the depth at which they lie. The crust is divided into four major tectonic plates and while still geologically active, volcanic activity is not a common occurrence.

The surface is dominated by a vast shallow ocean with a single significant continent, named Toawa-wap, several archipelagos and a myriad of isolated small islands. Both the islands and main continent tend to be wet and swampy, with dryer hills or mountains further inland. The area between swamps and mountains tends to be swampy tropical jungles. The Bwaps evolved on the main continent where most of the population still dwell, although smaller settlements can be found on some of the islands and in a few undersea archologies.

LENTULI SUBSECTOR

**EMPTY QUARTER**

**NATIVE LIFEFORMS**
Marhaban hosts a large and diverse ecosystem. Organic life consist of right-handed amino acids, which make them indigestible to most sophonts. This can be remedied with easily obtained drugs available on Marhaban and other Bwap dominated worlds. Animal life is largely bilaterally symmetrical, consists of two sexes and reproduce sexually. Exceptions occur, as in every biosphere. Life is diverse and complex, showing a long timeline of evolutionary development.

Not including pseudo-insects, the dominant lifeforms on the planet are amphibianoids, which fill almost every ecological niche. Amphibianoids have evolved into two major branches: modern amphibianoids that possess a pouch and lay a soft-shelled egg and primitive amphibianoids that possess no pouch and require water to lay their jelly enshrouded shell-less eggs. Some primitive amphibianoids have made adaptions to living in areas where water may be less abundant, such as in hills and mountains. One such example is the mouth-brooding amphibianoids, which swallow their eggs as they are laid and raise young in pseudo-
stomachs, ejecting them when they are large enough to fend for themselves.

Scaled egg-laying reptilianoids are significantly fewer in number than the amphibianoids and restricted to the same ecological niches as birds on Terra, although that niche is broad. Reptilianoids can be found all over Marhaban, including the arctic. Mammalianoids are rare and primarily occupy the niche of vermin. The ocean contains a vast array of life including amphibianoids, reptilianoids, piscinoids (fish), medusoids (jellyfish), molluscoids, crustaceanoids and echinoids (sea urchins).

**IMPERIAL NOBILITY**
Marhaban boasts several Imperial nobles. Marhaban is the fief of Subsector Duke Wakate-takewaaka-paswa of the Bebewebboekebseb clan. Duke Wakate has only held his position for a few years since his father, Duke Bwatatha-pathkavepaswa, retired and so still relies somewhat on his father and the Grand Council of Crèches for advice. The duke is highly respected by Bwaps but not so much amongst some of the peerage, who see him as just a token noble to appease the Bwaps. He spends equal time on Marhaban and at the court of the sector duke of Empty Quarter.

Baron Darius hault Nanjani-Shiidakii holds a fief in the southern area of continent on Marhaban. He is rarely found on Marhaban however, preferring to remain at the court of the sector duke of Empty Quarter where he serves in the Imperial Administration.

Dame Jinda Sachdev was awarded her fiefdom for services to the Imperial Marines. Although retired, she still serves in the capacity of chief of security on Marhaban Highport.

### STARPORT

The Marhaban starport is one of the largest Class A ports in the Lentuli subsector, second only to the massive starport at Wesaswek. The port is a major trade center and a crossroad on the x-boat communication route. As such, it is visited by millions of sophonts every year.

The highport orbits Marhaban in a geosynchronous position above the equator of the main continent. Constructed as a huge squat cylinder with a diameter of four kilometers and four kilometers tall, it has four large spheres, bisecting the cylinder in quarters, attached to the outer rim. Each sphere is a kilometer in diameter, making the whole structure six kilometers in diameter. The 'bottom' of the port faces the planet while the top faces the stars. From the center of the top of the cylinder juts the administration and traffic control towers.

From the center of the bottom of the port extends the space elevator with cars suitable for personnel and cargo transport. Elevator cars arrive and depart at 10 minute intervals throughout the day and night.

Each sphere is used for docking purposes and local administration. There is one sphere each for local
(in-system) traffic, interstellar traffic, a colonial navy base and construction. All four have adequate room to berth numerous ships up to 20,000 tons, with external docking arms and clamps for larger vessels.

Internally, the highport is divided into individual, self-sufficient districts such as public, commercial and military docking, with multiple administrative, residential, commercial, entertainment and industrial zones as redundancy measures. Each zone has its own life support, power and infrastructure, enabling it to continue on its own in the case of isolation or damage to other sections of the port.

Accommodation is available for transient populations, ranging from cheap 'capsule' hotels to large and luxurious hotels that boast the very best of amenities. The highport also boasts a busy Travellers' Aid Society facility and hostel.

Life support in the highport is set with Bwap comfort in mind, so most other sophonts are likely to find the temperature somewhat warmer than is comfortable and the humidity to be almost suffocatingly high. Enclaves have been set aside for the comfort of other races, with the human enclave being the largest.

The Bwap Homeworld

Floating outside the construction sphere, also in geosynchronous orbits, are a large number of ship construction yards. These open-frame structures are brightly lit and used as secure platforms to construct spaceships in orbit, with the largest able to construct vessels up to 200,000 tons. Each structure also hosts an administration station from which construction is coordinated. Smaller vessels, from 1,000 to 5,000 tons are built within the construction sphere of the highport.

The downport is located at the base of the space elevator in the Westateawaekath mountain range on the continent of Toawa-wap. The landing pads are built on tall pylons that jut up around the base of the base of the elevator, providing flat and stable landing platforms. Cargo and personnel lifts provide access to downport buildings from the landing pads. While only half as extensive as the highport, the downport still boasts many of the same facilities. Ship construction at the downport is limited to vessels of 1,000 tons or less.

The downport is surrounded by an expansive startown which has a Law Level 10, somewhat less restrictive than the rest of the world but still extreme. Visitors are advised to remain within the confines of the startown unless absolutely necessary and accompanied with a local guide. Even within the startown, a local guide is advisable to assist in navigating the maze-like bureaucracy and legal structure that the Bwaps favor.

Compared to other startowns, Marhaban startown is not terribly exciting; there are no legal casinos or gambling of any sort, bars and restaurants do not serve alcohol and recreational drugs of any sort are almost impossible to find. Streets are actively patrolled by Bwap police forces and criminal activity is uncommon.

The starport and startown are connected to other cities by an extensive maglev system that delivers both goods and people. Gravcar traffic is constant and busy but controlled and closely monitored by the extensive traffic control system. All gravcars are automated and tied into the traffic control system, making accidents practically unheard of. Offworlders are not permitted to use their own vehicles.

Several cities and businesses boast their own spaceports. These are generally off limits to Travellers and require complicated permits that are difficult for offworlders to obtain.

### TECHNOLOGY LEVEL

Marharban has a mature TL13, with some areas of technology sitting at TL14, making it one of the most technologically advanced worlds in the Lentuli subsector.

Weather control technology is at a TL14 level of sophistication. The technology is able to reliably modify weather patterns, control precipitation and temperature, and mitigate risks such as cyclones and hurricanes. On Marhaban, weather control is used to circumvent climate change and prevent desertification. Other worlds have used this technology to successfully aid terraforming into more agreeable environments.

Computer technology is at an early TL15. Data storage techniques, utilising holocrystals and data wafers, are in high demand across the Domain and beyond. True artificial intelligence and downloadable brain supplementation is showing promising results.

Conversely, medical technology lags at a mature TL12, primarily due to their ability to regrow lost limbs and, to some extent, organs. Bwaps have made pioneering research into growth quickening and nerve re-fusion technologies for other races based on their own abilities with great success.

All other technologies are at a mature TL13 level of sophistication.

### GOVERNMENT

Marhaban is listed as a non-charismatic dictatorship but the truth of the matter is somewhat more complicated. Technically, Subsector Duke Wakate-takewaaka-paswa is the sole authority on the planet. In reality, Duke Wakate is only an advisor on the Grand Council of Crèches and while his opinions hold considerable weight amongst the elders of the council due to his position, he is only one member with an equal voice when it comes to decision making.

The Grand Council of Crèches can be seen as the representative authority, acting on behalf of all crèches not only on Marhaban but across the entire Imperium, although this is a gross simplification of the role that the Council takes. Membership is in no way voted on or influenced by the public in any manner. The Council itself nominates all new members into its fraternity and membership lasts until the individual feels that they can no longer perform the duties required and retires back to their home crèche.

To confuse matters further, governmental authority on Marhaban is divided among the Grand Council of Crèches, the Council of Seemly Order and the Guardians of Order, with each having control of their own areas of expertise. There is no overarching authority, to provide a set of rules and balances, which outsiders view as extremely confusing but Bwaps have no problems in understanding. The bureaucratic processes on the planet are complex, intricate and difficult to navigate without a Bwap guide to provide assistance.

The Bwap Homeworld

As the subsector capital, Marhaban also houses all infrastructure and administrative apparatus necessary for that task. The Ducal Palace is a sprawling affair built on the island of Eakeebapebte in the southern hemisphere. The walled palace maintains a Bebewebboekebseb clan crèche, a spaceport for government officials and visitors, living chambers for the duke, clan members and employees. The duke has a personal force of huscarles drawn from the Guardians of Order. The remainder of the island contains other Imperial government offices and buildings, embassies and support facilities.

**LAW LEVEL**
The legal structure on Marhaban is notably convoluted
(for outsiders) and inextricably intertwined with ritual and the Wapawab philosophy. Weapons and armor of any description are highly regulated on the planet and only permitted to authorized forces. All drugs are restricted and recreational drugs such as nicotine, cannabis, alcohol and so on are prohibited. Live animal and plant imports are completely prohibited. Entertainment is closely scrutinised for its suitability to be introduced to the community. Adult entertainment of any type is prohibited.

Starships not of Marhaban origin are not permitted to land on planet except at the starport. Before docking, visitors must present a bill of clean health; papers of starship registration, crew and cargo manifests, and astrogation data from the last four jumps. Customs inspections are conducted electronically as ships emerge from jump and approach the planet, physical inspections through customs patrols before docking and then again physical inspection by port officials on docking. Finally, before being permitted to leave the ship or unload cargo, the crew and ship must be subjected to vermin eradicating procedures to ensure that no foreign species are introduced to Marhaban's ecosystem.

Due to the intricacies of the law and internal bureaucracy, Marhaban is rated as an Amber Zone, with visitors highly advised to remain within the confines of the starport. It is recommended that any Travellers intending to venture beyond the starport seek a local guide to ensure they do not inadvertently run afoul of any laws.

**MILITARY**
Marhaban boasts a significant military force operated by the Guardians of Order. Planetary forces consist of three regiments, 15 battalions in total, two of which are mobile lift infantry. Equipment for planetary forces is cutting edge TL14, with elite forces being equipped with TL15 weapons and armor, including battle dress.

Naval forces are surprisingly large for a colonial force, a holdover from the Long Night and the harassment the Bwaps suffered at the hands of raiders and pirates. The forces consist mainly of light cruisers, with backup provided by several BatRons of heavy cruisers. A single BatRon of Sasabease-wa-a class battleships act as a heavy hitting force when needed. The colonial forces are also supported by innumerable system defence boats, patrol corvettes, couriers and tenders. Ships are a combination of excess Imperial Navy vessels and ships of Bwap design and manufacture. The naval forces range from TL10 to TL13.

A large force of system defence boats perform the majority of custom inspections, assisted by a small number of patrol corvettes. Inspections are performed on both incoming and outgoing vessels. System defence boats range in size from 200 to 800 tons with an average TL12. System defence boat bases have been built on several of the other worlds in the Marhaban system and a medium sized base is in orbit around the gas giant Ebda to police against wild refuelling.

### ECONOMY

Marhaban is a rich world and also the subsector capital. It has abundant resources, a labour force that can be counted in the millions and a comprehensive infrastructure. The planet is financially strong and holds an important place in the economics of the subsector. Exports range from raw materials to high technology.

The Bank of Marhaban is a powerful force throughout the Lentuli subsector and stretching out into the Empty Quarter. The bank provides finance for contracting starships, large loans to businesses and monitors the amount of money within the subsector.

Marhaban is best known for its export of TL14 weather control technology, used across the sector and beyond to make less than viable worlds habitable. Weather control stations are not purchased but leased, the massive systems shipped as parts and constructed on site. Weather stations can only be crewed by Bwaps and knowledge of weather control technology also restricted to Bwaps. A lucrative spare parts and repair industry also exists to support the maintenance of purchased stations.

Another major export of Marhaban is economic and administrative expertise. Large personnel companies have grown up around the Bwaps' natural abilities in these areas, which act as intermediaries in finding skilled prospective employees or hiring temporary staff for short term contracts.

Other major exports include copper, tin, iron, electronics and software.

The Bwap Homeworld

### DEMOGRAPHICS

As their homeworld, Marhaban's population is almost exclusively Bwap. There is a small human population concentrated in the capital city with a few other human populations located in the far north near the small arctic zone. They are the descendants of Vilani corporate personnel stranded on the planet after the collapse of the Rule of Man, as well as some Solomani settlers and colonial supervisors. These have been largely subsumed into Bwap culture and society but do not display all of the psychological and cultural values.

Within the startown can be found a more cosmopolitan population but it is still predominately Bwap. Most permanent inhabitants of other species prefer to live within enclaves where they can pursue their own culture. Within the startown, many species of sophont can be found but most common beside Bwaps are humans and Vargr, with the occasional Lutini and even Sydite.

### CULTURE

The Bwaps of Marhaban are deeply traditional, more so than any other Bwap dominated world. They see themselves as the center of Bwap civilization, culture and education. They are rightfully proud of their world's history and heritage, and how they had struggled and endured during the Long Night to bring civilization and peace back to the Lentuli subsector.

### URBANISATION

The climatic shifts of Marhaban have limited the population of the world. While modern technology would enable Bwaps to modify their environment or build huge comfortable archologies, this goes against their philosophy of everything being in the right place;
hence they restrict themselves to living in the remaining swamplands, taking great effort not to disturb or damage the environment. Several large jungles have been designated as nature reserves, allowing both Bwaps and visitors to experience what the planet was like before civilization. A small number of archologies have been built under the oceans but great care has been taken to ensure they do not disturb the ecology.

### PLACES AND EVENTS OF INTEREST

There are many places and events of interest on the homeworld. A few are noted here:
•  The first would undoubtedly be the space elevator situated on the equatorial mountains of the major continent. The elevator connects the Marhaban downport with the highport in orbit. Travellers and

cargo are delivered to the planet's surface via the elevator. From the downport Travellers may remain at the extensive star town or, with the correct permit, venture further out.
•  During the last two weeks of spring, the plants in the Pesabebawa-peba Valley release their pollen into the air. Most of the pollen finds its way into the river system within the valley, colouring the water with a rainbow of hues and creating a major tourist attraction.
•  Bawapakerawa-a-aperwapa-vilani-pa is a festival held on the ninth day of the ninth month and lasts for nine days. It commemorates the first contact between Bwap and Vilani cultures. All businesses on Marhaban close during these nine days as re-enactments of the first contact play out across every city. Fairs are common and representations of the first Vilani visitors and their vessels are paraded through the streets. The festival ends with a rich feast of Vilani-inspired foods and a mock battle involving coloured dyes that represent the diversity that Vilani contact brought to Marhaban.
•  The capital city hosts a particularly vivid First Contact festival annually in the central town square where a giant monument of a Bwap and Vilani bowing to each other is located. A temporary fairground is constructed and stretch over several kilometers. Attractions include a variety of markets, entertainments, rides and re-enactments, the most popular being the landing of the first Vilani scoutship to visit Marhaban.

### ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS

As Bwaps spread across Charted Space, they took with them that which they found familiar. Wherever Bwaps are found, even moderate numbers, there will be animal and plant life from Marhaban to help them feel comfortable, provide companionship and act as a familiar food source. Animals native to Marhaban have the same environmental requirements of high humidity and relatively warm temperatures as Bwaps, which restricts the number of locations in which they can survive.

### NEW TRAIT

The following trait is new to Traveller and may be applied to animals at the Referee's discretion.

**Aquatic:** The animal is at home in the water but unable to function on land and will begin to suffocate if removed from the water. Its movement is not affected underwater but its speed is reduced to 0m on land. The Bwap Homeworld

**AWAHALLAPAH**
The awahallapah is a large marine primitive amphibianoid found in shallow waters near lightly inhabited coastlines. It resembles a prehistoric plesiosaur with an elongated neck and six large flippers; four true flippers and a pair of false flippers with a membrane that extends down to the tip of the tail and used for territorial and courtship displays. The true flippers are the awahallapah's main form of locomotion, using them in an alternating flapping motion and giving the appearance of the creature flying through the water. The tail is primarily a rudder but can also be used defensively if needed. Short feathery gills extend from the sides of the awahallapah's head, giving it the ability to breathe water.

Awahallapah are carnivorous, feeding on numerous small creatures near the water's surface or preying on larger creatures that dwell on or near the sea floor. Its long neck allows it to also feed on aerial lifeforms, snatching prey mid-flight and swallowing it whole. An adult awahallapah is able to easily take prey the size of a Bwap or human and caution is advised to those visiting known hunting grounds. The awahallapah is highly protected and anyone harming or killing a specimen faces extreme penalties.

### DEPWETHAWA

Depwethawa (known as 'marsh lions' to humans) are primitive amphibianoid predators found in swamps and shallow waterways. They have a large heavily armored head, long razor-sharp teeth, a low slung furless feline-like body and long thick tail. Depwethawa use their tails as their main locomotive force when swimming, their limbs kept close to their sides and occasionally used as rudders. The creature is an ambush hunter, lying in wait just below the surface for unsuspecting prey to approach before it launches itself explosively at its target and then drags it below the surface to drown and be consumed at its leisure. Depwethawa have no fear and have been known to aggressively attack prey many times their size. They can be found even in heavily populated areas where they can prove to be a significant risk. Areas known to possess a population of depwethawa are cordoned off and signs are liberally displayed to warn passers-by of the danger. Depwethawa that become a serial menace are relocated unharmed in less inhabited regions.

The Bwap Homeworld

KAPA-BAWABAW The kapa-bawabaw is a large semiaquatic molluscoid the size of a Terran cow that lives in the swamps of Marhaban. They have a thick yellow hide speckled with orange markings and six eyes; two large eyes and four smaller ones. Inside its wide shell-like mouth are three rows of hardened ridges that the kapa-bawabaw uses to chew the vegetation it lives on. Along its underside it has multiple pairs of flipper-like pseudopods that it uses to propel itself through water. In the water the kapa-bawabaw is a graceful swimmer but on land it moves with an awkward humping motion. The kapa-bawabaw was domesticated early in Bwap history and are in general docile. The only exception to this is when the hermaphroditic kapa-bawabaw come into rut and become aggressive and territorial.

Bwaps have a number of uses for kapa-bawabaw. They use the mucus from the kapa-bawbaw's hide as both pickling agent and preservative in cooking, the fertilised eggs are considered a delicacy and the hide, when tanned and prepared correctly, is used as material for clothing. Collecting the eggs is a risky endeavor, as brooding kapa-bawabaw are extremely protective. Primitive Bwaps would use the collection of kapa-
bawabaw eggs as a rite of passage for young males entering adulthood and the rite is still practiced today in a less dangerous, figurative fashion.

### PAWBAWEPKA

The pawbawepka (known as a 'salamander pug' by humans) is a medium-sized modern amphibianoid carnivore that has become a companion animal to Bwaps, although several related species remain in the wild. Domesticated late in Bwap prehistory, pawbawepka serve the same role for Bwaps that dogs do for humans. They are the height of a medium dog with a brown hide covered with blue markings, four short legs and a long flattened tail that is used for motive force when swimming. Their face is rather flattened, much like a Terran bulldog or pug, but possess no external ears. They feed through the use of a long sticky tongue that captures prey and draws it into their mouth where it is chewed with several rows of sharp teeth before being swallowed. Female pawbawepka lay up to four eggs annually which she keeps in her pouch. When the young hatch they remain in the pouch being fed by their mother until they reach a month old, at which point they leave the pouch. The pups may be removed from the mother at this point but in the wild the young remain with the mother for six months, learning how to hunt and fend for themselves before they are chased away to live a solitary life.

Pawbawepka are covered with a thick layer of fat, which makes them look somewhat plump. Coupled with their tendency to enjoy sleeping most of the day, they are often mistaken as slothful creatures. In reality, while a pawbawepka can sleep upwards of 18 hours a day, they are capable of sudden bursts of speed that belies their short legs and rotund appearance. Domesticated pawbawepka are exceptionally affectionate with their owner but tend to be aloof towards others.

**REEPA-REEP**
The reepa-reep is a small winged carnivorous reptilianoid that has become popular in the wider stellar community. Their scaled bodies exhibit a variety of shimmering colours, with males more brilliant than the female. They have two large eyes and a short snout filled with needle-sharp teeth. Their two front limbs are prehensile, which they use to assist with perching or manipulating food, while the back legs have evolved into long narrow wings much like those of a prehistoric pterodactyl. A thin membrane of skin between their forelimbs and ribcage act as stabilizers during flight along with a long rudder tail and brightly coloured head crest. Reepa-reep do not have the same stringent humidity requirements that Bwaps do, allowing them to live in drier climates.

Reepa-reep are gifted mimics and known for their boisterous and mischievous personalities. They bond easily with their owner, especially if hand-reared, and are inquisitive intelligent creatures easily-trained to perform a number of tricks. Keeping a reepa-reep entertained can be a challenge however, and when bored they can become quite destructive. When startled or threatened, Reepa-reep give a raucous alarm call heard for a significant distance.

### PARAWBA

The parawba (known as a 'swamp-donkey' by humans) is a primitive amphibianoid used as a riding animal and beast of burden. It has a long three meter body with a four meter tail. The head is boomerang shaped with its eyes located at the sides of the head, giving it excellent peripheral vision but poor forward vision. The head sports two frills starting at the top of the nostrils at the front of the head and progressing down to the thick neck where they join and then end just over the shoulder blades. The tail is also broadly frilled on both the dorsal and ventral sides. Males have an additional frill that begins just after the shoulder blades and extends to the end of the tail. Males have larger frills than females, which are brightly coloured to attract mates and act as threat displays and also possess a throat pouch, which they can expand to produce calls to attract mates and for courtship displays. The legs are slightly splayed out from the body and end in broad, webbed, three-toed feet. The skin is smooth and soft. Female parawba are drably coloured with a splotched pattern to aid in camouflage in the swamps on Marhaban, while males are brightly coloured in reds, blues and yellows.

The parawba is a strong swimmer, equally capable on land and water. They are most comfortable living along the fringes of swamps where they feed on copious amounts of vegetation. Parawba will flee into deeper water when frightened and can remain submerged for extended periods of time until danger has passed. If they are unable to flee, Parawba will kick their attackers or use their tail to deliver a surprisingly accurate and damaging swipe.

Parawba were first domesticated as riding and draft animals in Bwap prehistory, becoming an important form of transport until the development of the internal combustion engine. The Bwap military, primarily a defensive force that evolved from warriors protecting their clans from predators, still ride parawba during important ritual events. These parawba are richly adorned and ridden by equally adorned soldiers in elaborate parades.

The Bwap Homeworld

WABWE-EBTA-PASEB The wabwe-ebta-paseb is a large predatory molluscoid that dwells in the shallow waters found around the mangrove-like trees that grow in the swamps of Marhaban. The creature is sessile as an adult, unable to move once it has grown out of its motile juvenile stage.

To the casual observer, a wabwe-ebta-paseb resembles nothing more than the roots of a rotted wabwebaba tree, jutting out of the water. In reality, the roots are the camouflaged extension of the wabwe-
ebta-paseb's shell, composed of calcium carbonate and silicates. The majority of the creature resides below the surface of the water with only its open mouth exposed but hidden within the root-like structures of its shell. The heavily toothed maw is surrounded by a dozen eyes. The rest of its body is held secure in the mud by deeply entrenched tentacles.

The wabwe-ebta-paseb is an ambush hunter, waiting for prey to enter the confines of its disguised shell before snapping shut its jaws and most often swallowing prey whole. Once a wabwe-ebta-paseb has bitten prey it will not let go, requiring the creature to be killed to release its grip. Wabwe-ebta-paseb show no fear and will attack anything that stumbles within reach.

# BWAP TRAVELLERS

Bwap Travellers follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers, as detailed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook._

### BWAPS

Bwap Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-4, END-4

**TRAITS**
Bwap Travellers all possess the following traits.

**Regeneration:** Bwaps are able to regenerate amputated extremities. If a Bwap loses a limb or a tail, it will slowly grow back, taking six months. The limb or tail will be useless for this time as it develops into a fully functional extremity. Amputated hands and feet will only take three months to regrow back and amputated digits take six weeks.

**Social Norms:** Bwaps have a very specific way of thinking that can make certain actions more difficult for them. They suffer DM-1 on the following skills:
Deception, Gambler, Persuade and Streetwise.

**Structured Mind:** Bwaps have very structured minds, making some skills easier to learn than others. Whenever a Bwap acquires Admin, Advocate and Broker at level 0, it automatically becomes level 1
(making it impossible for a Bwap to have Admin 0 for example, only Admin 1 or more). Any further levels in these skills accumulate normally.

**STARTING AGE**
Bwap Travellers begin their careers at 18 years of age. Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career to gain new skills and experience. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years. Bwaps age slightly faster than humans and suffer an additional DM-1 on the Aging table.

### TITLES

Bwaps do not have titles of nobility as humans of high SOC do, nor do they have hereditary titles in their own culture. A high SOC only represents the respect they receive in their own society. Bwaps may be awarded Imperial titles but they mean nothing to other Bwaps.

### CAREERS

Bwaps may enter any career apart from Agent (except for law enforcement) or Rogue. Most Bwaps become bureaucrats, accountants or administrators, and can enlist in the Citizen (corporate) career automatically with no Qualification roll. When rolling for career enlistment other than Citizen the following DMs apply in addition to any others: DM-3 for Marines, DM-1 for Army, DM+1 for Scouts and DM+2 for Merchants.

AGENT (LAW ENFORCEMENT)
While Bwap criminals are rare and are considered to be mentally unwell, making law enforcers almost unnecessary in Bwap dominated areas, the same cannot be said of other sophonts. Bwaps make excellent investigators, both in the field and the laboratory. They are patient, dedicated, honest and, most of all, perseverant. No matter the task at hand, be it locating a single fingerprint in an entire parking lot or interviewing every worker in an officer block, a Bwap will go ahead with their task optimiztically and professionally, and they will get the job done.

### ARMY, MARINE, MERCENARY AND NAVY

The majority of Bwaps in the military serve as a defensive force on Bwap controlled planets or large Bwap enclaves. Those that serve in other militaries, especially in the massive bureaucracy that controls each of the Imperium's services, tend to have administrative roles, operate as medical personnel or military researchers. Those Bwaps that do serve in active units often serve in the Imperial Navy and more rarely the Imperial Army, Marines or mercenary units. They are seen as unusual by other Bwaps and as reliable, if not tediously by-the-book, servicemen by their comrades in arms.

### SCOUT

Bwaps are no less curious than humans. They are far more cautious, sometimes infuriatingly so, but also focused and persistent. While the IISS bureaucracy has a large number of Bwap administrators, there are a surprising number of Bwaps in the field as well. Scout teams consider themselves fortunate to have a Bwap counted among their crew as they will add a level of thoroughness occasionally missing from all-human crews. While just as adventurous as their human crewmates, Bwaps tend to lack the creativity to make good field commanders.

### MERCHANT

Bwap merchants have plied the stars for centuries and are seen across Charted Space from the Solomani Confederation and Hiver Federation to the Spinward Marches and Zhodani Consulate. Bwaps normally command ships crewed by their own race as their personality precludes them from acting as captain to other, less disciplined races. Those found on mixed vessels often assume the position of ship's purser or broker, although sometimes as administrative assistant or legal adviser. Those ships that have a Bwap as a first officer ensure their ship will effortlessly find its way through the myriad of rules and regulations found on each world it visits.

### SCHOLAR

Bwap scientists are the next most common human stereotype of a Bwap next to the Bwap bureaucrat and for good reason. They contribute large numbers of observers, researchers, lab assistants and scientists to the Imperium, its member worlds and corporations. Bwap scientists are known for their thoroughness and the rigour with which they pursue new theories and observations. Intuitive leaps are rare but they are very good at compiling resource material, cross-checking separate observations and assembling them into promising areas of investigation. Bwap scientists are common in medical and biological studies but can be found in almost every field.

### PSIONICS

Bwaps are not particularly prone to psionic expression but it does occur rarely. If a Bwap needs to determine its PSI, roll 2D-3 and subtract the number of terms served by the Bwap in all careers thus far. Psionics are suppressed in Bwap society as it is throughout the Imperium. They have no psionic institutes of their own but can train at Psi Institutes alongside other races.

### ROLEPLAYING A BWAP

Bwaps are compulsive organisers. Anything they do is deliberate and painstakingly methodical. Ritual is exceedingly important to them and attempts to hurry or avoid established ritual will aggravate and annoy them.

There are certain activities that Bwaps will not partake in. Bwaps will not lie, although they will withhold the truth if protocol or necessity requires it. Bwaps will not break the law except to restore what they see as the established order of the universe. Bwaps will not obey directives that, in their view, cause disruption. Disorder and disarray make them nervous and they will have a hard time not trying to bring order and organization to their surroundings.

Travellers who have had no experience with Bwaps will find the encounter difficult and time consuming, suffering DM-3 to all interpersonal exchanges and taking additional time (moving one increment down the Time Frames table on page 60 of the Traveller Core Rulebook without reducing the difficulty of any check). Travellers who wish to reduce the aggravation of interacting with Bwaps (and the negative modifier) may gain knowledge of their ways through study in a library, being instructed by a mentor or by association with Bwaps. Learning Bwap rituals can be quite tedious, especially understanding the nuances of advanced rituals. To learn the proper greeting ritual may take several weeks, to be able to deal with a Bwap official quickly will be a month or two, or learn the procedure of contract negotiation several months to a year.

Bwap Travellers

### CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE: BWAPS

Bwaps are able to use the majority of items designed for humans without penalty due to their similar morphology. This includes computer keyboards, kitchen implements, tools and thousands of other items. Those that require a more ergonomic fit to a particular race, such as drone waldoes, filter masks, pistol grips and the like impose DM-1 unless they are specifically designed for the Bwap anatomy. Likewise, another race attempting to use an item designed specifically for a Bwap will suffer the same DM-1. Bwap specific items are more difficult to find but cost the same as human-
specific items. Protective equipment such as vacc suits, combat armor, rebreathers, and so on, must be specifically designed for an individual race and are not interchangeable between species. Such equipment for Bwaps costs 110% of the normal price.

Electronic equipment must be specially sealed against moisture and high humidity when being handled by a Bwap to avoid detrimental effects but this is a standard feature of all electrical equipment at TL10+.

### PERSONAL PROTECTION

Armor is not as common in Bwap society as on human worlds. This is not to say that Bwaps do not wear armor, only that they wear it when the situation warrants it. Wearing armor openly is often seen as boorish, the bearer obviously looking for trouble.

All suits of Bwap armor are decorated to resemble their colouration and patterning, identifying at the very least the crèche the wearer belongs to.

Armored Kaftan: A heavy-duty kaftan-like garment and head covering tailored from ballistic cloth, suffused with small tubes to circulate water around the skin of a Bwap to keep them moist. Like cloth armor, the fabric absorbs impact energy and disperses the blow over the body of the target. The fabric is obviously armored but at TL12 it becomes light enough to require a Routine (6+) Investigate or Recon check to recognize it as such.

Bwap Powered Plate: A large and bulky suit of insulated powered armor made up of metallic plates forming a complete body shell designed specifically for Bwaps that is both tough and inflexible. As long as the suit's 80-hour power cell (Cr200 to replace)
has energy, the suit grants STR+2 but inflicts DEX-

2. Additionally, enhanced actuators along the spine allow the Bwap to articulate their tail and use it a striking weapon in combat, inflicting the same damage as an unarmed strike. The TL14 version has a 160-hour power supply, is made of ceramic composites and adds STR+3 but only inflicts DEX-1.

Ceremonial Armor: Bwap ceremonial armor
(wepasab) is made from cured leather of ancient design and consists of a tunic, leggings, grieves and head covering. It is worn by Tap-a-wewaka-atapas during formal occasions. The construction method for wepasab has not changed and in almost all crèches is created by hand. The cost below is for the simplest form of armor with minimal decoration. More flamboyant armor costs more, significantly more for the most ostentatious.

### MODIFICATIONS

All standard modifications listed on page 96 of the in the Traveller Core Rulebook or page 27 of the Central Supply Catalogue may be used with Bwap armor. In addition, some are unique to the Bwaps as noted here.

Swimming Fins: These fins are webbing that extend from the hands and feet, with a fin on the tail, increasing a Bwaps swimming speed by +2m. At TL8 they are a permanent part of the armor and impart DM-2 to all checks that require the use of hands or fingers. From TL10 the fins can be retracted or extended, removing the penalty.

Modification TL Kg Cost Tail Mount 10 2 Cr50 Tail Mount 14 1 Cr75

### SURVIVAL GEAR

Bwaps have a requirement to keep their skin moist in dry environments. This has driven the development of several devices that are nothing short of life-saving for Bwaps living away from their required level of humidity.

**Equipment Webbing:** In environments where Bwaps do not have to worry about humidity, they don equipment webbing instead of the familiar kaftan. The webbing comes in a variety of different styles and materials but is always comfortable with ample attachment points to attach equipment.

Item TL Kg Cost Equipment Webbing 2 — Cr50

**Hydrosuit:** A hydrosuit is a full body suit including a covering for the head that maintains the correct humidity for Bwap comfort. The suit is designed to recycle all the body's fluids, which can then be reused in maintaining humidity and is able to maintain a suitable environment for a Bwap for up to 30 days without being replenished and having the internal scrubbers replaced.

Item TL Kg Cost Hydrosuit 11 4 Cr12500

**Kaftan:** A loose-fitting garment, including head covering that is suffused with narrow tubing that delivers moisture directly to the skin of the wearer, keeping them moist in dry environments. Kaftans are patterned in the identifiable markings of the wearer's crèche.

At TL9 the kaftan is composed of two layers; an inner water absorbent layer and an outer water repellent layer. This keeps the outer surface of the garment dry, unlike earlier models.

Item TL Kg Cost Kaftan 6 1 Cr75 Kaftan 9 1 Cr250

Polymer Gloves: These long, clear plastic gloves are worn by Bwaps to prevent the moisture that permeates their clothing and skin to damage electronic equipment or paper without interfering with the sense of touch. The gloves extend up past the elbow and are skin tight.

Item TL Kg Cost Polymer Gloves 6 1 Cr50

### ELECTRONICS

Like fire, electronics came late to Bwap society due to the dampness of their environment but once discovered it was rapidly utilised. Electronics, particularly in higher Tech Level society, are ubiquitous with modern life.

Water Proofing: Due to the damp environments that Bwaps are forced to live in, all of their electronics
(which includes computers and other equipment)
require waterproofing to protect them from water damage. This technology was developed early in Bwap advancement and by TL10 all electronics are routinely waterproofed as part of their construction.

### ROBOTS AND DRONES

Bwaps rarely have a use for robots and drones, seeing them as usurping their place in the universe. They do however, frequently design and build robots for other races. Like their computing technology, Bwap robot design is advanced and they lead other Imperial races in robotic research.

Interaction Bot: These Bwapoid robots were designed specifically to ease the interaction between human and Bwap. Similar to the protocol droid in nature, they are programmed with advanced administration data as well as the relevant aspects of the Wapawab philosophy and Bwap ritual to ensure that misunderstandings are kept to a minimum. Bwaps do not enjoy interacting with these robots but grudgingly understand the need for them.

### MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Bwap medical supplies run the gamut from herbal remedies to advanced bio-chemical and genetic modification. Medical supplies are used to augment short fallings in Bwap physiology or assist survival in extreme circumstances.

Amino Acid Supplements: Bwaps can find it difficult obtaining all the amino acids they require when consuming food not native to Marhaban. These amino acid supplement pills are designed to be taken once daily to circumvent malnutrition acquired from consuming a diet not completely suited to their nutritional needs. Cr20 will buy enough pills to last a Bwap for one month.

Item TL Kg Cost Amino Acid Supplements 8 — Cr20

Hydronol 9: Hydronol 9 pills are a drug designed to limit the amount of moisture a Bwap loses in a dry environment. The drug seals pores in the skin, keeping the Bwap hydrated for 24 hours as long as normal fluid intake is maintained. Hydronol 9 does not come without risks however. Continued usage in excess of a week can cause permanent damage to the skin and kidneys, causing the loss of END-1 permanently. If a Bwap is reduced to END 0 through the use of Hydronol 9, they have suffered kidney failure and will require immediate medical attention. Cr100 will buy enough pills to last a Bwap a week.

**Regenerax:** Advances in genetic sequencing has led the development of a drug that enhances the Bwap ability to regenerate. Regenerax is neither cheap nor easy to obtain but reduces the time it takes to regenerate Bwap extremities by half, although the Bwap must consume twice as many calories to fuel the accelerated cell growth required for such speedy regrowth.

Item TL Kg Cost Regenerax 12 — Cr10000

### PERSONAL AUGMENTATION

As a whole, Bwaps do not embrace personal augmentation as a matter of principle. The Wapawab philosophy is quite clear that Bwaps are as they should be and any personal alterations are not the 'way of things'. This does not include cybernetics to replace body functions or organs that have been lost but does include adding functionality that was not part of the Bwap physiology to begin with.

**Tail:** This augmentation is used to replace the tails of Bwaps that have not been able to regenerate on their own. The modification is largely cosmetic, although it is fully functional.

Item TL Cost Tail 11 Cr125000

### HOME COMFORTS

Like other races, Bwaps enjoy comfort, although they rarely surround themselves with it. Their racial philosophy frowns on the use of excessive creature comforts, seeing them as distractions to fulfilling their role in the universe. Bwaps will tend to use those comforts that assist them in relaxing or creating an efficient workplace.

**Wapawab Guide:** The Wapawab philosophy is an extensive document and few are able to remember every detail of this way of life. Bwaps have documented the Wapawab from the moment they developed written language. Originally, the document was recorded on hundreds of scrolls made from cured hides. At TL4 the Wapawab guide was constructed of plastic sheets and collected into 1,528 volumes, which improved the lifespan of the documents. At TL9 computing technology become powerful enough to store the entire Wapawab guide in a hand-held device. The Wapawab guide can be found in every Bwap home, office and starship.

CSC: Bwaps

### CLOSE AND PERSONAL

Bwaps can use the same weapons as most other humanoid races in the Imperium but they have a few that are specific to themselves.

Blade Tail: A blade tail is a sharp blade that can be attached to a tail mount, allowing an armored Bwap to use their tail as a weapon.

Ceremonial Dagger: A decorated blade made from the razor-sharp tooth of a depwethawa, the ceremonial blade is an item that all tap-a-wewaka-atapas carry with them.

Ceremonial Staff: The ceremonial staff (fewab-a-wewaka) is a weapon carried by all tap-a-wewaka-atapas, a polearm topped by a heavy weight. The fewab-a-wewaka is an effective weapon in skilled hands. The heavy weight at the end of the shaft has several openings that create a trilling whistle when swung. The span of the shaft is engraved with a passage from the Wapawab that has some significance to the wielder. Traditionally constructed from the wood of the bapawa-a-a-bap tree, modern fewab-a-wewaka are manufactured from metal.

Club Tail: A club tail is a heavy bludgeoning weapon attached to a tail mount on powered armor, allowing a Bwap to deal greater damage with a tail swing. Normally constructed from metallic alloys, the club can either be smooth or spiked.

Whip-Sword: A whip-sword, or tapapath-a-a-pawatapas, has a long flexible blade made from paper-thin metal. The weapon is swung around the wielder and used like a whip. It is a difficult weapon to wield, inflicting DM-2 penalty on attack rolls. Some whip-swords have multiple blades, making them more difficult to wield, with a DM-4 penalty. Whip-swords are difficult to block, as the blades are able to whip around intervening obstacles and cannot be parried. When used correctly, the whip-sword creates a whirling barrier around the wielder, preventing aggressors from getting close enough to use their own weapons.

# VEHICLES OF THE BWAPS

Most Bwap vehicles are much like their human counterparts in ability and function but the aesthetics of the Bwap lead to much more round and organic-like form. Features like wings, fins or other types of decoration are rare, unless they serve a functional use

A-AWAB AIR TRAM Air trams are ubiquitous on Imperial worlds of TL9 and above, providing fast, cheap and comfortable public transport for billions of passengers annually. The sturdy air tram seats 40 passengers. The majority of air trams are controlled by robot brains (making them essentially drones) and monitored by a central traffic control system but provision for a pilot is made. Routes are pre-programmed into the air tram's robot brain and pilot or remote intervention is required to alter routes.

DA-WE-PA WAR WALKER War walkers are a popular vehicle among the Guardians of Order, used in both warfare and policing. The relatively light frame causes less damage to the environment than larger vehicles. War walkers are armed appropriately for the task they are assigned. Those used in combat have a heavier loadout, with an example fitout below. Those which are used for policing duties will have lighter armament, with most armed with non-lethal weapons.

Off-road engines do not use tracks like ordinary trains and therefore have greater versatility. They have found a use on new colonies as well as established worlds and are able to be modified for almost any environment and circumstance, having enough space within to install airlocks, life support systems and even weapons.

Off-roader engines are able to pull seven carriages in total. Carriages can be outfitted for a variety of tasks from cargo hauling to passenger transport, mobile laboratories to mobile living quarters.

### PESWAB MARSH HOPPER

Marsh hoppers are submersible vehicles that can also take to the air with grav lifters. Among Bwaps they are a common vehicle, especially for those who live in under-
sea archologies. These vehicles have also gained some popularity with sophonts living on water worlds.

Tracked scooters look like a hybrid of a scooter, skateboard and small tank. They can handle difficult terrain with little difficulty. The tap-a-wewaka-atapas have a great fondness for them and they have gained popularity among human youths who seek a somewhat unusual sports vehicle. Tracked scooters are ridden like a skateboard using shifting body weight to steer and handlebars to provide support and stability.

### HIGH GUARD OF THE BWAPS

Bwaps first developed their own fleet of ships during the Ziru Sirka to facilitate trade and colonization, and continued during the fall of the Ramshackle Empire and into the Long Night as a measure to protect their worlds. At first they used ships provided by the Vilani but as these began to reach the end of their life, Bwaps began building their own vessels based on their own design principles, making them highly recognizable. Vowing never to forget the atrocities and injustices visited upon them by the Solomani and Vargr during the Long Night, Bwaps have continued to maintain their own fleets, recognized by the Third Imperium as colonial fleets. Bwap vessels are found primarily in Bwap controlled systems
(especially military ships) in the Empty Quarter, although merchant and trader vessels can be found throughout the Third Imperium, particularly in core and trailing sectors.

These ships are very much like human vessels and use the same technology, as would be expected from a race that gained spaceflight technology largely from humans. Both races can readily use vessels of the other with no difficulty.

Their vessels tend to have no external sharp edges, favoring ovoids, spheres and other organic shapes. They also tend to paint hulls in blues and greens. Ships that belong to a particular crèche will often have the hull painted in the same colours and patterns that members of the crèche exhibit, identifying ownership of the vessel clearly to other Bwaps.

Bwaps favor a modular design for their ships, a holdover from the original Vilani ships they first obtained and copied. Each ship system is installed as a module and, if damaged, is removed and replaced as a module. This is not to say that Bwaps will not repair their ships but the repaired module will be removed and replaced with a new module at the earliest convenience.

This has no effect on the ship construction system as detailed in _High Guard_ , nor does it affect the cost of Bwap ships. It does mean that the cost required for repairing a Bwap ship is inflated by +20% as entire modules must be replaced.

Internally, Bwaps favor their vessels to emulate, where practical, the function if not necessarily the style of the ancient burrows that Bwaps originally inhabited. This is far more likely to be found in larger ships that have the space to accommodate Bwap aesthetics. Convoluted, winding passageways will lead to various rooms for both shared and private use. While this is seen by many other races as needlessly confusing and unnecessary, Bwaps find comfort in familiar surroundings.

### MUD BATHS

Given the Bwap predilection to socialising in a mud bath, they have incorporated this ritual into life on board space faring vessels.

A Bwap ship of 100 tons or more must have at least one area dedicated to mud bathing. Small ships tend to have a mud bath that can comfortably accommodate four Bwaps but larger vessels have mud baths that accommodate 40 or 50 Bwaps at a time. A mud bath is treated as a stateroom (consumes four tons and costs MCr0.5) and can handle four Bwaps comfortably. It cannot be used for accommodation and does not incur life support costs. Multiple mud baths can be combined to create a larger facility.

The Apa-pakwa is a common sight around Bwap dominated worlds. A fast fighter with 7G of thrust makes this ship agile and swift. The fighter is normally crewed by two; a pilot/gunner and a sensor operator. Heavily armored, the fighter also provides significant protection for its crew, although realistically it is no threat to larger military starships or monitors. The dual cockpit can also double as a re-entry pod, allowing the crew to escape from a damaged vessel and either land safely on a planet's surface if combat occurs in the atmosphere or orbit, or await rescue if in deep space.

The fighter is normally operated in squads of six vessels, which patrol Bwap holdings and protect space lanes from the 100-diameter jump point up to docking at a highport or landing on the surface of a planet. The ship operates very well in an atmosphere, serving as both a COACC asset and space superiority fighter.

While the ship has enough fuel for four weeks of operation, creature comforts are at a minimum with no stateroom or other facilities. Most missions on the Apa-pakwa would be no longer than four to six hours at most.

The Efaweape uses a 100 ton hull and is intended primarily to explore and identify trade routes. Its secondary role is the survey of Bwap dominated worlds and Bwap enclaves on other worlds. It has three crew; a pilot/astrogator, engineer and a

merchant/broker. The ship has a large enough cargo hold to make it a profitable venture for Travellers. Normally it is unarmed but it has a single hardpoint on which a turret may be mounted.

A popular design among Bwap traders, the Koteak-
wo trader is functionally a far trader adapted for Bwap use. Armed purely for the sake of self-defence, the vessel is able to stand up well against pirates

and other minor threats. The cargo hold is large enough to provide a profitable living for the ship owners and versatile enough to be used in a variety of differing roles.

Utilising a 500 ton hull, the Beseke patrol corvette is a military vessel used to police established trade routes and provide protection to trading vessels. They are normally found escorting trading missions beyond Imperial borders, patrolling in-system space

for pirate activity or performing customs duties. Two plasma barbettes are supported by two triple missile racks, providing decent offence while a single triple sandcaster turret grants adequate defence.

The Tabewarke defence boat is an example of a lower tech combat vessel that proves to be an effective asset. Its low Tech Level makes it easy to maintain and its larger size helps it carry an

The Pese-teko-we class destroyer is based on the Kargash Class light cruiser used by the Vilani during the Interstellar War period against the Solomani. The 2,000 ton hull is armed with two small missile bays, two fusion barbettes and four double plasma turrets. Point defence is provided by five triple

sandcaster turrets. A marine contingent supports boarding actions as well as piloting the ship's boat and acting as backup gunners. This well-armed and well defended destroyer normally acts in squadrons of up to 10 vessels, which have been given the deceptively comical name of Bwap Packs.

The Eaaetatka-ka class monitor is the mainstay of Bwap in-system defence and are frequently seen patrolling busy spacelanes around populated worlds. Built around a 5,000 ton hull, the heavily armored vessel bristles with weapons, making it an intimidating sight. Boasting four large missile bays, four fusion barbettes and 16 triple laser turrets, the Eaaetatka-ka is an equal to any starship its size and poses a serious threat to starships twice or even three times its size.

The Sasabease-wa-a Class Battleship is the pride of the Bwap Colonial Fleet with only one having been built. The ship is permanently stationed at the Bwap homeworld of Marhaban but occasionally tours other Bwap dominated worlds.

Built on a 150,000 ton hull, the Sasabease-wa-a boasts a large meson spinal mount, which is backed up with four large particle beam bays and four medium torpedo bays. Secondary weaponry includes 10 fusion barbettes and 30 triple pulse laser turrets.

**SASABEASE-WA-A CLASS BATTLESHIP**

Defences feature significant armor, meson screens, nuclear dampers and a point defence system.

Three ship's boats and a troop transport provides mobility for marine units and a gig is also available for the use of officers.

The class does have some shortcomings, such as the extended time it takes to process fuel, taking in excess of 48 hours to process full tanks. Furthermore, the vessel only carries enough fuel for four weeks of operation, somewhat restricting its use.
