Dagudashaag (dah-guh-dah-shag) is a corruption and contraction of the Old High Vilani term for the region - Dakhukuga Gulike Dushaage, which means _Rimward Galactic Province._ This term refers to the sector's astrographical position, relative to [[Vland Sector]].

Systems in this sector bear the traces of many waves of settlement and occupation over the life of the Galaxy. Several indigenous species originated in the sector and it was further colonized by outside sophonts. The [[Vilani]] moved in and dominated the astrographic region until they were, in turn, dominated by the Second Imperium. The [[Second Imperium]] later fell, creating the [[Long Night]], which eventually led to the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]].

The sector today is known as a core sector of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]], an important transportation hub, and an industrial powerhouse of technology incubation and high-tech manufacturing prowess. It is also known for a number of competing power blocks, a dense population, and relatively large number of native sophonts. The picture many newcomers have of the sector is of a grey, featureless expanse of factory systems filled with grey, humourless [[Vilani]]. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Dagudashaag is a sector of contrasts, from the soaring, fusion-carved mountains and glittering city-warrens of [[Medurma]], to the floating dreamworlds of [[Ushra]] (Dagudashaag 1016), to the sulphur volcanoes of [[Lenashuuk]] (Dagudashaag 1640), the macroengineering of the beanstalk on [[Gateway]] (Dagudashaag 1331), and the unspoilt plains of [[Kaurga]] (Dagudashaag 1118).

The social structure of Dagudashaag is equally varied. Arrive at any starport, and you will encounter the sibilant speech of [[S'mrii]], the strangely striped visages of [[Ziadd]], small bureaucratic [[Bwap]], enigmatic [[Droyne]], the penetrating gazes of [[Scanians]], and the towering, richly-robed figures of [[Aslan]] merchants amongst others.
