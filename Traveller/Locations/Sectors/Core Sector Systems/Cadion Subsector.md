![[TImp-Cadion.jpg]][[TImp-Cadion.jpg|Cadion]]
Cadion has multiple clusters of worlds that are divided by gaps of two or three parsecs, preventing the bulk of them from forming cohesive political and commercial communities. There are three or four distinct clusters of stars – depending on how they are grouped – and one outlier in the Night system. Imperial astrocartographers refer to subsectors like Cadion as ‘assistive’, meaning that their disparate clusters seem less associated with one another and more with those f outlying subsectors. While gaps of three parsecs are by no means insurmountable, most trading ships and freighters have jump ratings of 1 or 2. However, communications are carried by the x-boat network, which is standardised at jump-4, so the worlds of Cadion do remain in communication with one another.

The cluster to spinward-coreward, which includes the Cadion system itself, contains the rimward spur of the Sylean Main. Not all traders who ply the main come all the way to Cadion  efore turning back to Capital but those who do have the option of continuing onward to the densely populated Shardi Cluster in neighboring Dagudashaag. Naasirka has recently  ade Reel a regional R&D and manufacturing hub, which has made the long journey to the spur worthwhile for merchants who want to obtain the megacorporation’s popular high- tech products.

The spinward-rimward (lower left) corner of Cadion also contains worlds that are linked to the Shardi Cluster but these are not considered part of the Sylean Main due to the fact that to reach them by jump-1 transit, one must first delve into Dagudashaag. This cluster also contains Reference, the central repository of Imperial knowledge and administrative headquarters of the IISS. Reference is heavily defended by Imperial Navy and Scout Service spacecraft but civilian traffic is strictly limited there for security reasons.

Located in the central chasm of Cadion, the Lia and Double Star Clusters are seldom visited by traders and only one system among them, L’rotuu, has planetoid belts and is therefore the only system to attract belters. Sharurshid has sponsored subsidised merchant routes in each cluster to explore their economic potential and has even installed a deep space refuelling depot in the empty space between Double Star, Lia and Patu for those merchants who want to explore both regions. The jury is still out on whether there are enough Credits to be made on these underserved worlds. The majority of them are in rapid technological and population decline and resemble frontier colonies more than they do worlds of the Core.  n addition, some have developed decidedly isolationist cultures and would rather be left alone. Nevertheless, these worlds are of strategic importance to the Imperium whose 210th Fleet is charged with defending the subsector. Stellar chasms pose a security concern and the squadrons of the fleet monitor the empty space between worlds as best they can. The navy bases at Double Star and Markun share the bulk of this duty. The remainder of Cadion’s  squadrons are based on its periphery and are tasked with defending its holdings from the troubled worlds of neighboring sectors. In the galactic scheme of things, it was not all that long ago that the Imperium dealt with the Ilelish Revolt. The navy bases in this region were a major jumping-off point for the successful quashing of that separatist movement. The Emperor is leery of festering unrest in the other sectors and has instructed the navy to keep a watchful eye on events as they transpire.

By and large, the worlds of Cadion make up a free-wheeling, laissez-faire society. In comparison with other subsectors, there are few authoritarian governments present and most of its worlds have low Law Levels. Unlike most of Core, Cadion has the look and feel of the Imperial frontier.
