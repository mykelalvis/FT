Personnel are the most important asset a mercenary unit
can field but hardware also plays its part. As a general
rule the law of diminishing returns applies to most types
of equipment; any rifle is vastly better than no rifle but an
improved rifle only offers a relatively small improvement
on the basic model. Still, an advantage is an advantage.
Smart mercenaries train and formulate plans to maximise
the advantages they possess and minimise those of the
opposition. An accurate appraisal of the mercenaries'
own capabilities and those of the enemy can be the
foundation of a plan that turns a potentially tough fight
into a walkover.

The rules presented in this book can be used in standard
Traveller campaigns, if this seems desirable. It is not only
mercenaries who may have to quickly locate the source
of a shot, or who may want to strike by surprise against
a well-guarded target. All rules can be implemented or
disregarded at the Referee's discretion; much of the time
the level of detail presented in these rules is not really
necessary. However, in military campaigns the slightest
advantage can be highly significant.

Most additional rules cover specific circumstances and
are self-contained; if the situation does not occur the
rules for it need not be recalled. However, there are two
slight conceptual changes within the weapon design
rules: Quickdraw and Penetration. Quickdraw refers to
any situation in which getting a round on target a split
second before an opponent is important. This could be
resolved with the normal initiative rules but sometimes
more detail is required. Why would anyone use a pistol
when more potent weapons are available? In a mercenary
campaign the ability to get that first shot into the target
before their weapon comes to bear, or they can reach the
detonator, can be all-important and some weapons have
an advantage in these situations. Combined with the
Knockdown rule, a sharp-shooting Traveller has a chance
to stop an enemy in their tracks and reverse a potentially
lethal situation.

The amended Penetration rules are in some ways the
opposite side of that coin. The Travellers' point soldier
likes to keep a short shotgun handy for close encounters
and can get it on target faster than an enemy soldier who
brings a rifle to bear... but the rifle will punch through
body armor. Shotguns are excellent for a one-shot-stop
on lightly protected targets but cannot penetrate even

modest levels of armor. If you are the sort of Traveller
or Referee who cares about such distinctions, the rules
in this book are the tools you need. Even if you are not,
there is a ton of must-have (and some so-not-want) gear
in the later chapters.

Design worksheets are presented for most weapons. This
makes it easy to recalculate a weapon's characteristics
if a Traveller wants to modify it or if a different type of
ammunition is in use. The same basic principle applies
to all weapon designs – the receiver and its features will
dictate what furniture, barrel and accessories can be
used, and what their cost and weight will be. In many
cases a specific model and manufacturer are described.
There are usually copies, licensed versions and cheap
knock-offs of such weapons available. At the Referee's
discretion a cheaper copy can be found but it will usually
be inferior. The Low Quality trait allows the Referee to
assign disadvantages to such weapons.

The additional rules in this book are all optional,
including weapon characteristics such as low penetration
or incendiary effects. The rules are intended to give those
who want more detail additional factors to juggle – do
you want a more powerful weapon or one you can get on
target quicker? – but for those who do not want this detail
it is entirely possible to use the values found only in the
Traveller Core Rulebook. Some of the differences between
weapons are lost if low penetration, speed on target and
so forth are ignored but the decision is up to the Referee.
Even ignoring these new factors, the weapon design
system still imposes changes in range and sometimes
damage output.

The introduction of a Recoil score (see page 32)
to conventional firearms has implications for some
Travellers. A 9mm submachinegun with Auto 3 has
Recoil 2, which means a Traveller with Gun Combat 2 or
better can fully control it under autofire. Less well-trained
Travellers will suffer a penalty to attack rolls, which is
not unrealistic – it is hard to shoot accurately with an
automatic weapon. Low-recoil weapons are best suited to
poorly trained personnel and those who insist on carrying
large-calibre handguns converted to fully-automatic fire
may be a danger to themselves and others. This imposes
more choices on Travellers – controllability or stopping
power? Penetration or knockdown? There are no simple
answers and that is the way it should be.

CHAPTER-ONE

**SOLDIER LOADOUTS**

The Traveller Core Rulebook states that Travellers be
allowed to carry a 'reasonable' load without tracking
it. Unfortunately, many Travellers have a rather
curious idea of what is reasonable. Three different
rifles, a flamethrower, an anti-aircraft missile
launcher, six handguns and dozens of magazines for
each weapon is most definitely not reasonable.

If a quick rule of thumb is required, it can be
assumed that a soldier can fight effectively wearing
body armor and carrying a single long gun, a
sidearm, one or two grenades and a few tools such as
wire cutters, plus no more than six spare magazines
for the main weapon. Additional equipment can be
carried in a pack, and shed once combat starts, but
there is a limit to how much can be carried without
becoming excessively tired. If the Travellers want to
push the limits of what they can carry and still move
or fight, stricter rules are necessary. These are based
on page 92 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , modified
for the mercenaries' circumstances.

Note that powered armor does not contribute to
encumbrance when powered up and that the weight
of worn armor is distributed so as to reduce its
effective weight by 75%.

Revised Encumbrance
These rules are intended to supersede those
presented in the Traveller Core Rulebook ,
making the assignation of Banes the sole
preserve of the Referee.

Combat Light: All levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END
Combat light represents the maximum load a Traveller
can carry and still act without penalty. The load must
still be carried in a plausible manner. For a fit and
properly trained mercenary, a combat light loadout
will typically be around 16–18kg of equipment.

Combat Load: 2x (all levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END)
A soldier's combat load is up to twice their 'combat
light' load, so around 32–36kg for a fit and well-
trained soldier. At this level all physical actions that
require significant movement are one difficulty level
harder. A soldier doing something that requires only
slight movement, such as shooting from cover, does
not suffer this penalty but as a rule of thumb anything
requiring more than a step or turn in place qualifies
as 'significant movement'. A soldier carrying combat
load is considered to be performing heavy labour as
per page 76 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Field Load: 3x (all levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END)
Soldiers are often overburdened with equipment
they might or might not actually need. In addition
to combat equipment, body armor and necessary
personal kit, the soldier will usually also be carrying
additional food and water, some kind of field shelter,
and ammunition for support weapons or electronic
equipment. Much of this additional equipment will be
in or attached to a pack that can be quickly ditched
in a fight, enabling the soldier to move down from
field load to combat load or even combat light. Of
course, this equipment might be lost if the unit is
pushed back and cannot retrieve its packs. Field load
is up to three times the soldier's combat light load.
At this level all physical tasks are considered one
difficulty level harder whether they require significant
movement or not. For a typical fit and well trained
soldier, field load is a maximum of 48–54kg.

**Overburdened:** Beyond 3x (all levels in Athletics
(strength and endurance) plus STR + END)
It is physically possible to carry more than a standard
field load and indeed some militaries have fitness
requirements based on carrying a very large load for
a certain distance. However, soldier performance is
greatly degraded when lurching along under a gigantic
pack. In addition to the penalty mentioned for field
load the soldier suffers DM-1 on all tasks (of any
kind) for every amount of weight equal to their STR in
kilograms, or fraction thereof, carried above maximum
field load.

For example, a mercenary has STR and END of 8, and
one skill level in Athletics. Their combat light load is
17kg, combat load is 34kg and maximum field load
is 51kg. If this soldier is carrying 50kg all tasks are
one difficulty level harder and they are considered
to be carrying out heavy labour for the purposes of
fatigue. If carrying 52–59kg they also suffer DM-
on all checks. At 60kg this increases to DM-2, and
continues to increase until the soldier is no longer
capable of moving or even lifting their pack.

The Referee must also keep in mind the bulk of some
items. A Traveller might figure out they can carry 80
assault rifle magazines and remain within their field
load but it is highly unlikely they would be physically
able to carry these objects unless their standard-issue
equipment includes a wheelbarrow.

This book requires only the Traveller Core Rulebook to
use. A number of weapon traits are described in that
book and apply unchanged unless otherwise noted. In
addition, some new weapon traits are introduced in the
Field Catalogue, as detailed below. Other traits can be
found in the Central Supply Catalogue if it is in use and
apply to the weapons found there. In some cases these
may be similar to traits described in this book. At the
Referee's discretion similar traits can be swapped, such
as Fire and Burn or Hazardous and Dangerous.

Burn X: A Burn weapon delivers half its initial damage
for a number of rounds equal to its Burn score.

Corrosion-Resistant (+X): An item or device that has
Corrosion-Resistant (+X) is degraded by corrosion to a
lesser degree.

Corrosive: A Corrosive weapon does damage over time
and can destroy armor. See page 24 for details.

Emissions Signature (level): The Emissions Signature
trait is possessed by all weapons with a power source
or which generate heat, since these weapons show
up readily on sensors. Examples include, but are not
limited to, lasers, gauss weapons, flame or cryogenic
weapons, plus plasma and fusion guns. When sensors
are being used to detect and locate a weapon its
Emissions Signature DM is applied. If a weapon does
not have the Emissions Signature trait it will only be

CHAPTER-TWO

**WEAPON TRAITS**

detected by specialist devices using the same cues
as a human or other living being would. For example,
acoustic location devices use the sound of a weapon
to locate it, just like a person turning to look in the
direction the sound seemed to be coming from. Such
devices use the weapon's Physical Signature trait
rather than Emissions Signature.

Hazardous -X: Some weapons use hazardous materials
such as generated plasma or highly flammable gels. This
does not necessarily make them dangerous to use but
does increase the severity of a malfunction. A well-made
and properly cared-for weapon should never suffer a
significant malfunction in the field and if this is the case
the user need not worry about the nuclear fusion reaction
going on in the weapon's powerpack. If the weapon does
suffer a malfunction or is penetrated by enemy fire, use
the Malfunction table on page 8 to determine the severity
of the problem. The weapon's Hazardous score is applied
as a negative DM on this table.

Most weapons pose some hazard if damaged or
mishandled but typical propellants and batteries are
considered to be a zero-DM hazard and do not give the
weapon the Hazardous trait.

The effects of an incident with a Hazardous weapon
can vary. A truly bad conventional firearm might have a
Hazardous DM greater than -3 but a breach explosion is
less serious than a grenade going off in its launcher.

Weapon Hazard Levels
Hazard DM Example
-1 Poorly made conventional firearms prone to stoppages and ammunition mishaps.
-2 Stable explosives such as typical launched grenades, high-discharge energy systems such
as laser or gauss weapon powerpacks.
-3 Very poor conventional firearms likely to injure the user at some point.
-4 Possibly unstable explosives, such as ageing dynamite or high-yield explosives.
-6 Flammable materials such as those used in a flamethrower or cryogenic fluids.
-8 Well-protected plasma generation chamber, such as used on a well-made plasma gun.
-10 Well-protected plasma fusion chamber, such as used on a well-made fusion gun or poorly
engineered plasma generation.
-12 Poorly engineered plasma fusion chamber, such as those found on improvised
fusion weapons.

**Inaccurate -X:** A weapon with Inaccurate suffers a
negative DM to hit when shooting at a target more than
10m distant. This is normally -1 or -2 but could be more
in the case of a very ill-made weapon. Smoothbores
almost all suffer from Inaccurate, although it is not
usually much of a problem at the range where a shotgun
might be used.

**Incendiary X:** An Incendiary weapon will set materials
alight on a successful check determined by the nature
of the materials. A sufficiently hot incendiary can even
ignite materials that would not normally be considered
flammable, such as metals. The weapon's Incendiary
score is used as a positive modifier to this check; if not
specified this value is +0.

**Flammability**

Material Type Example Difficulty
Highly Flammable Liquid fuel Simple (2+)
Flammable Straw, some
clothing

Routine (6+)

Non-Flammable Skin, military
uniform

Average (8+)

Fire Resistant Vacc suit Difficult (10+)
Highly Fire
Resistant

Metals Formidable
(14+)

**Lo-Pen X:** Some weapons perform very poorly against
armor or fail to penetrate hard surfaces. This can be
desirable, such as when ammunition is intended for
use on a small indoor firing range or inside spacecraft.
A low-penetration round is unlikely to punch a hole in
a cabling conduit and wreck the ship's control systems.
Weapons with Lo-Pen have a score, typically 2 or 3.
This is a multiple to be applied to the target's armor,
if any. Thus a Lo-Pen (3) weapon striking a flak jacket
with Protection +5 would treat it as Protection +15;
penetration is highly unlikely. Low-velocity firearms and
pellet-firing weapons typically have this trait.

**Physical Signature (level):** The Physical Signature of
a weapon is based on the amount of noise, flash and
disturbance of small objects caused by its propulsion
mechanism or passage of its beam, bolt or projectile.
All firearms and energy weapons have at least some
Physical Signature and in many cases this is about the
same as that of a typical handgun or rifle. In this case
it is not really necessary to note down the signature of
the weapon as attempts to detect and locate the user
are as normal.

Ramshackle -X: Ramshackle weapons are typically
thrown together out of whatever parts were available,
or are poorly engineered. Examples include crude
zip guns made in backstreet workshops, home-made
flamethrowers and improvised fusion guns. Ramshackle
scores usually range from -1 to -4 depending on the
severity of the weapon's deficiencies but can be even
more. Typically, attempts to repair or build a weapon at
lower than its Tech Level will impose a Ramshackle trait
equal to the difference in Tech Levels. Poor manufacture
or parts, long periods without maintenance and bad
design can all impose a Ramshackle trait on a weapon.
The DM is applied to attack rolls and the results of
weapon malfunctions. At the Referee's discretion it can
be reduced by the Effect of a Mechanics check made
when fixing a damaged weapon in the field. Note that
being Ramshackle does not necessarily make a weapon
Unreliable. A cobbled-together weapon can be safe and
reliable, just not very good.

For example, a party of Travellers finds a TL14 fusion
gun that someone has abandoned. With no tools
available, the team's mechanical genius decides to
have a go at fixing it up. Using nothing more than her
boot and a nearby rock, she performs a mechanical
miracle with Effect +7. The fusion gun is restored to
useable condition... sort of. The Referee rules that rocks
and vigorous stomping of components constitutes TL
repair work, so the weapon would have an incredible
Ramshackle (-14) score. This is partially offset by
particularly skilled bashing with a rock, so it ends
up with Ramshackle (-7). This applies to all attack
rolls, making the weapon useful only for spraying the
countryside with fusing plasma. If the makeshift fusion
gun is damaged and suffers a Mishap, this DM-7 is also
applied to the results... which will be rather bad for
everyone nearby.

Slow Loader X: Some weapons are just plain fiddly
to load. This includes advanced but badly designed
weapons whose magazine is difficult to seat properly as
well as those that require multiple actions to prepare
them to fire. A black powder rifle, for example, requires
a powder charge to be poured down the barrel and
rammed, then the projectile to be rammed home, then
possibly a wad to be also rammed down the barrel.
The lock is then prepared, either with more powder or
a separate percussion cap, before the weapon can be
cocked and readied. This is going to take much longer
than the usual one minor action to reload a weapon.

Slow Loader is followed by a score that determines how
many minor actions are required to load the weapon.
For a fiddly magazine-fed submachinegun the score
might be 2–4, whereas a black powder rifle could have
Slow Loader (10) or more. Taking three minor actions
per combat round, this could mean the weapon is out of
commission for three or more rounds between shots.

A Traveller can elect to make an Average (8+) Gun
Combat check to reduce the loading time. The Effect
of this check is deducted from the Slow Loader score,
to a minimum of one minor action. A skilled user might
be able to slap that awkward magazine in first time or
change a belt faster than normal but a very slow weapon
will still take time to load.

Spread X: A Spread weapon fires multiple projectiles
either at once or in very rapid succession. Shotguns
are the most common examples but there are weapons
that fire mini-grenades that burst into a hail of small
submunitions in flight. A very fast-firing automatic
weapon might also possess the Spread trait when used
to spray a target. A Spread weapon has an associated
score, usually in the range of 1–4. When the weapon is
used within its base range, the firer may add the Spread
value to all attack rolls.

Unreliable X: An Unreliable weapon is prone to
malfunctions and breakdowns. This is typically seen
with primitive weaponry such as black powder muskets

but could be imposed by poor-quality ammunition. A
weapon's degree of Unreliable is indicated by a score in
the range 1–5. When this weapon is used, an additional
1D of a different colour is thrown along with the usual
2D check. If this dice comes up equal to or less than
the unreliability value for the weapon it suffers a
malfunction. This might be a simple misfire but could
be a full jam or even a breach explosion.

If a weapon malfunction occurs, roll 2D on the
Malfunction table. The weapon's user receives a positive
DM equal to their relevant combat skill. Negative DMs
also apply.

Weapon Power: DM-1 for every 1D of damage done by
the weapon.
Hazardous Weapon: Apply the weapon's Hazardous score
as a negative DM.

Malfunction
2D+DMs Result
0- Breech explosion or similar disaster. The weapon is ruined and the user receives its normal damage.
1–3 A critical component breaks. The weapon is out of action until repaired in a workshop.
4–6 A component breaks or ammunition jams in the mechanism. The weapon is out of action but can be
fixed in a few minutes without the need for a workshop.
7–9 An ammunition misfeed or similar minor technical issue occurs. One significant action is required to
clear it or ready the weapon.
10+ A minor technical fault wastes this shot but does not put the weapon out of commission. For
example, a grenade launches but fails to detonate, or a bit of dirt on the end of the emitter tunnel
blocks a laser pulse but is vapourised by it clearing the weapon to shoot normally.

Combining Spread and Inaccurate
Some weapons have both Spread and
Inaccurate, such as shotguns. Inaccurate does
not apply within 10m so at this range the user
benefits from the Spread value. Between 10m
and the weapon's base range, both apply. Thus
a shotgun with Spread (2) and Inaccurate (-1)
affords the user a net DM+1 to attack rolls.

Sometimes a Traveller may be in a situation where a
specific capability – such as locating the origin of a shot
or getting a weapon on target – can mean the difference
between life and death. The procedures presented here
are modified by some weapon features and Traveller
skills. They require the addition of new concepts to the
_Traveller_ rules, although some of the concepts outlined
here are already implicit.

RANGE CONDITIONS
The precise distance from combatant to target is
sometimes very important, such as when calculating a
firing solution for artillery. However, most of the time
the general range conditions are more important as
they impose tactical limitations. There are five 'range
conditions' that can apply to a military force or some of
its members.

**Close Quarters** (sometimes called Close Assault) is a
situation where hand-to-hand combat may occur. The
most effective weapons tend to be handguns, assault
weapons, shotguns, light assault rifles and melee
weapons. Like all range conditions, Close Quarters is
loosely defined; in this case it is a situation where at
least some combatants are capable of rushing into their
opponents to attack with bayonets or similar personal
weaponry. Personnel who are engaged at close quarters
are unlikely to be able to keep track of the 'big picture'

- they are too busy trying to stay alive! As a result DM-
applies on checks other than those pertaining to the
immediate close-combat situation. This DM may also
be applied to almost any combat or non-combat task
a Traveller is trying to carry out – directing the fire of
an orbital battery, giving orders to another unit or even
just responding to a radio message becomes a lot more
difficult when engaged at Close Quarters.

**Combat** range includes Close Quarters and extends out to
a loosely-defined point beyond which careful aimed fire
or area attacks with large amounts of ammunition are
the only realistic way to harm the enemy. Most combat
seen by typical Travellers takes place under these range
conditions, and is characterised by snapshots taken at

fleeting targets. The outer limit of Combat range can
be taken as around 50m. Combat at this range makes
it difficult to keep track of the big picture, imposing
DM-2 on checks other than those pertaining to the
immediate situation. Although less chaotic than a close-
assault situation, a force engaged at Combat range will
be distracted from anything but the situation at hand.
This of course assumes the enemy is active. If they are
hiding or have been suppressed to the point where they
are no longer making much effort to attack, the unit is
considered not to be engaged in Combat and can go
about its business as normal.

Battlefield range conditions extend to the point where
direct-fire weapons are highly unlikely to be effective.
This is typically 3–5 kilometers, but can vary according
to the local situation. Essentially, if an enemy force
is close enough to be engaged by the main armament
of a tank operating at ground or low level, battlefield
conditions exist. This has various tactical implications,
mainly a need to protect non-combat assets such as
headquarters and logistics formations from direct
attack. Personnel are in danger from long-range
harassing fire and snipers, or support weapons such as
mortars, but are not closely engaged with the enemy.
Combat at Battlefield range tends to be impersonal for
the most part, with vehicles or area targets engaged
rather than specific personnel. Snipers and some
precision weapons can target individuals but survival
is for the most part a matter of good habits regarding
positioning and use of cover, rather than eliminating
specific threats.

Standoff range conditions exist beyond the immediate
battlefield and extend out to the maximum effective
range of locally available weapons. On a TL4 battlefield
this might be just a few kilometers beyond the
immediate combat area and few commonly available
standoff weapons are useful beyond 50–100km. A
force at Standoff range is not in danger from direct-
fire weapons such as lasers, tank guns or firearms but
might be targeted by missiles, rockets, artillery shells
and the like. Standoff warfare is handled differently to
personal combat.

**CONCEPTS AND SPECIAL**

**CIRCUMSTANCES**

CHAPTER-THREE

Theatre range conditions exist when a unit is out of
reach of all but the longest-range weapons. Infiltration is
always possible so security cannot be completely relaxed
but theatre-grade weaponry is geared to large area
targets or vehicles and starships. Defence against such
weapons is on a similar scale. Theatre-level combat is
a matter of long-range air strikes, missile bombardment
and orbital laser fire. It is beyond the scope of most
Traveller-owned mercenary units, although they may
become involved – perhaps leading a commando
mission to take out a missile launch site or defending a
communications center against infiltrators.

VACUUM AND
LOW-GRAVITY

CONDITIONS
These rules generally assume the Travellers are
operating in some kind of atmosphere and that there
is a modest gravitational field. Vacuum and low-gravity
conditions cause additional problems for personnel
engaged in combat – and for their equipment. Most
items without moving parts function well enough in a
vacuum but conventional lubricants tend to evaporate
off, potentially causing a weapon to malfunction. Any
weapon not adapted for vacuum, other than energy
weapons, temporarily gains the Unreliable (1) trait.

Low gravity increases the distance projectiles will
travel but not the ability of personnel to aim. Bullets
do not 'drop' as a shooter experienced in higher
gravity would expect. There is no effect out to 100
meters, after which DM-2 applies to shots made out
to 1,000 meters. DM-4 applies to shots made out to
10 kilometers and DM-6 to shots beyond this. This
DM is reduced by one for every level of the Vacc Suit
skill the shooter has, reflecting an ability to predict
the effects of low or zero gravity and does not apply to
lasers or similar energy weapons.

Extreme range can be considered doubled in minimal
or zero gravity. Weapons that rely on firing in a ballistic
arc become difficult to aim, although incredible
'trick shots' are possible to those with sufficient
mathematical ability to calculate trajectory. Likewise,
trace atmosphere or vacuum does not slow projectiles.
This does not greatly affect the ability of the average
mercenary to point-and-shoot but extreme range is
doubled – and this can be combined with the effects of
low gravity. Thus it is possible to engage targets across
very great distances, although the time taken for a
projectile to get there and the difference in conditions
from that the shooter may be used to, makes hitting a
person with a rifle from 5 kilometers rather difficult no
matter how good the sighting system.

Indirect Fire
Indirect fire in this context refers to any projectile
that does not follow a straight path to the target and
will typically be carried out with grenade launchers
and light artillery weapons. Arguably a hand grenade
'pinballed' off two walls to get it around a corner is
an example of indirect fire, although more commonly
one will be lobbed over an enemy's cover or into their
foxhole. Energy weapons cannot conduct indirect
fire and it cannot be conducted without a physical
mechanism. Thus would normally be gravity but an
extreme magnetic field might be a possibility or the
aforementioned walls in a zero-g environment.

The following indirect fire rule is based on the
Artillery trait found on P7 of Central Supply
Catalogue. It should be used for indirect attacks at
Combat ranges or less. When firing at Battlefield or
greater distances the bombardment and standoff
rules, below, should be used.

When using indirect fire to attack a target that cannot
be directly observed, DM-2 applies to the attempt
to hit. In addition, all indirect attacks – even if the
target is visible to sensors or a handoff targeting point
is available – are imprecise. The attack will land 1D
meters from the target point, plus 1D for every full
100 meters the weapon must travel. Each point of
negative Effect adds one meter to the distance; each
point of positive Effect reduces it by one meter.

Indirect fire is for the most part useful only with
area-effect weapons such as grenades. However, if
the attack roll is good enough to indicate zero meters
then the target has received a direct hit. Area-effect
weapons will do their normal damage and impact
damage may be added at the Referee's discretion.
For most projectiles likely to be used in this manner
impact damage will be 1D for those that have
bounced off something and 2D for direct impact.

This rule can be used to resolve unusual indirect-
fire situations. For example, a Traveller is in a tricky
hostage situation and cannot get a clean shot at an
enemy. Their solution is to yell 'grenade' and throw an
actual grenade but without pulling the pin, bouncing
it off a wall to strike the hostage-taker from behind. A
particularly good attack roll results in a 0m deviation,
so the Referee rules the hostage-taker has been it for
1D damage.

The Traveller asserts that the hostage-taker will assume
the object that beaned them is a live grenade and panic.
The Referee allows a Deception check and it is passed.
The hostage-taker pushes the hostage onto what they

think is a live grenade, clearing the line for another
Traveller to take the shot. Whilst a questionable
solution to the situation, this is a valid use of the
indirect fire rule.

When an area effect weapon is used for indirect fire, it
imposes an Area Fire attack (see page 14) on everyone
within its Burst value in meters.

Firing Over Open Sights
Some artillery weapons can engage targets
directly in line of sight. This is generally referred
to as 'firing over open sights'. High-trajectory
weapons such as mortars cannot do this and
very heavy weapons may not be able to traverse
fast enough or depress far enough to hit targets
at close range. Those that can are treated like
any other weapon conducting direct fire. Light
artillery (guns and howitzers of up to 120mm
calibre) suffers no penalty when conducting
direct fire. Medium artillery (in the 120-180mm
range) suffers DM-2 to hit when firing over open
sights. Heavy artillery of over 180mm calibre
suffers DM-4.

Light rocket and missile systems are intended for
short-range engagements and suffer no penalty.
Medium systems, intended for use at Standoff
ranges, suffer DM-2 when firing at anything
closer than this, and heavy systems such as long-
range aerospace defence missiles suffer DM-
when firing at Standoff range or less. This does
not preclude launching a large aerospace missile
at an approaching tank, but it does make a direct
hit rather unlikely.

Bombardment and Standoff Combat
For the typical Traveller, large weapons such as artillery
guns are either an impersonal hazard or will be used in
direct-fire mode. Those involved with military operations
are more likely to encounter these weapons being used –
or use them – in their bombardment role. A bombardment
can be abstracted using the rules in Book 1 but as the
focus closes in on the Travellers it may be necessary to
resolve an indirect or standoff attack.

Whether an attack is considered bombardment or
standoff combat depends on the degree of guidance.
Bombardment is almost always carried out with indirect
fire weapons and in the context of these rules uses
weapons without terminal or direct guidance. The
same artillery piece could fire an unguided shell in
bombardment mode or deliver a guided shell to the target
area at which point it would home in – this would be
considered standoff combat.

Standoff attacks, in this context, are made with
long-range weapons from a position beyond effective
retaliation. Typically this is the province of artillery and
missile systems, both of whose projectiles follow an
indirect path but a standoff attack can be made by some
specialized direct-fire weapons. The latter include meson
guns and long-range lasers firing from orbit or similarly
high elevation. What differentiates a standoff attack from
bombardment is whether there is some form of terminal
guidance. In the case of long-range lasers and meson
guns the gunner tries for a direct hit at the moment of
firing. With missiles and guided shells the weapon is sent
to the general target area then either self-guides or is
directly controlled from a remote position.

When conducting bombardment the intent is to put
payloads into a general area. With very precise weapons
this area may be smaller than the warhead's danger
radius but more commonly bombardment is something
of a lottery. For this reason weapons with a large area
of effect are preferred. Putting artillery shells into the
general target area requires an Average (8+) Heavy
Weapons (artillery) check. This assumes the weapon is
firing at less than a quarter of its maximum range. At
greater ranges, the difficulty increases, as shown on the
Artillery Accuracy table.

Artillery Accuracy
Range Difficulty
¼ Maximum or less Average (8+)
½ Maximum or less Difficult (10+)
¾ Maximum or less Very Difficult (12+)
¾ to Maximum Formidable (14+)

Success puts the payload in the general area of the
target, sufficiently close to make an Area Fire attack.
Failure indicates the warhead arrived sufficiently far
away as not to threaten the target, although in the case
of some truly enormous weapons there may be other
effects. These are discussed in the Specialists book. If
it is necessary to determine how far away the weapon
landed, deviation can be taken as 2D% of the range it
was fired from. This is a minimum of 100 meters for
weapons fired at 5 kilometers and possibly as much as
6 kilometers for a weapon 50 kilometers away. Direction
must be determined randomly.

A 'hit' on the Heavy Weapons check does not mean a
direct hit has been scored on the target with indirect
fire. Instead it means that the warhead has arrived close
enough to the target to have some effect. Most artillery
weapons have a radius of effect and deliver damage
within that area. Once a hit on the general target area
has been determined with artillery, it is necessary to find
out how serious it will be.

Roll 2D if a 'hit' is scored. On a straight double-6 the
target may have suffered a direct hit and damage is
doubled. On 8+, the round comes close enough to do
full damage. On a roll of 7–, the round buries itself in
the ground or detonates far enough away from the target
that damage is halved. On a straight double-1, the round
is a dud or otherwise fails to have effect due to some
(un)lucky circumstance.

Hits and Near Misses
2D Effect
12+ Doubled Damage; direct hit!
8+ Normal Damage; close hit (primary radius)
7- Halved damage; nearby hit (secondary radius)
2 No Damage

Standoff Attacks, Midcourse Guidance
and Forward Observers
An unguided weapon is handled as above but if some
form of terminal guidance is available the attempt is
considered a standoff attack and is far more likely to
score a direct hit. The positive Effect of the attack check
is added to the 2D check to determine the nature of the
hit. In addition, weapons guided by an operator may
add the operator's Heavy Weapons (artillery) skill level
to the 2D check. Automatically guided weapons use
the projectile's own guidance DM and some advanced
weapons may use both an operator DM and one from the
weapon's own systems.

If a forward observer or some form of midcourse
guidance is available, the chances of a good hit are
further enhanced. To increase the chance of a first-
shot hit a forward observer may make an Electronics
(comms) check subject to additional modifiers as if
making an attack roll. The Effect of this check is added
to (or subtracted from) the weapon's check to reach
the general target area, which in turn will improve
the chances of a direct hit by increasing the level of
success. This process is no different to that on page 7 of
the Central Supply Catalogue.

A forward observer can use their own Heavy Weapons
(artillery) skill to apply corrections to each salvo
after the first, including those made with unguided
bombardment weapons. To do this, the observer must
be able to both see the target area and communicate
with the gunners. After the first salvo, the forward
observer can make a Heavy Weapons (artillery) check.
If successful, the gunners' next shots gain a cumulative
DM+1 to hit, up to a maximum of the observer's skill
level. However, if the gunner fails an attack roll at any
point, the process of walking the artillery onto the target
must begin once again.

_For example, the Travellers have equipped themselves
with a mid-tech field artillery piece and some more
advanced ammunition for it including guided shells. Two
of their number are daringly close to the target acting
as forward observers whilst the rest ready the gun.
The forward observers set up the shot, getting a mildly
disappointing Effect +1 on their Electronics check.
Their comrades fire the gun into the general target area,
gaining this +1 along with their own DM+2 for a solid
Heavy Weapons (artillery) check. The shell will arrive
in the target area and gains DM+3 on the 2D check to
see of a direct hit has been achieved. This DM is for
the forward observers' efforts and that of the crew. In
addition, the weapon's own guidance DM+2 is added.
A score of 8 on 2D is modified to 13 – more than the
12 needed for a direct hit. The observers are satisfied
to see the shell arrive on a good trajectory then adjust it
slightly to come down directly on the target. Without the
shell's terminal guidance it would have been very close
to the target and done normal damage._

SUSTAINED FIRE

AND WEAPON

OVERHEATING
Conventional firearms and most energy weapons
generate a lot of heat when operating and can
malfunction if not permitted to cool. In short or
intermittent combat there is no real need to keep track
of weapon overheating but sometimes it can become
very important. Conventional weapons firing single shots
or even short bursts will not overheat but one that makes
sustained autofire attacks will generate excess heat,
which will begin to cause problems.

A weapon making autofire attacks or one that produces
a great deal of thermal energy such as a plasma or
fusion gun, generates an amount of Heat equal to
its damage dice each round, plus its Auto score. It
dissipates Heat at a rate determined by its construction
during each round it is not fired. If the weapon
exceeds its safe Heat level, a malfunction may occur
on any occasion it is fired – even a single shot. The
malfunction chance is based on the weapon's Heat
level before the attack was made.

Every attack made after the safe Heat threshold is
crossed may cause a malfunction. Single shots and
bursts from conventional firearms do not increase
the Heat DM but they do not reduce it either, so it

is possible to keep popping off single rounds from
a glowing-hot weapon whilst staying just below the
disaster threshold. The chance of a malfunction
depends on the weapon's condition. If a malfunction
occurs, consult the Malfunction table on page 8.

Changing the barrel on weapons equipped for this is
assumed to remove all accumulated heat. Alternatively,
the weapon may be permitted to cool. Weapons dissipate
heat at a rate depending on their construction and any
accessories they may have. Cooling systems can be
added as receiver accessories.

Rapid-Fire (RF) and Very Rapid-Fire (VRF) weapons
produce a great deal of heat and are generally combined
with a cooling system or use multiple barrels to allow
heat to dissipate more quickly.

The chance of a malfunction is given in the Weapon
Heating Effects table. A straight 2D check will indicate
if a problem occurs and the level of DM to be applied on
the Malfunction table on page 8. The Traveller receives
a positive DM equal to their relevant gun combat skill on
this table.

For example, a Traveller in a close-quarters fight makes
autofire attacks from a drum-fed assault rifle for 6
consecutive rounds. This generates 3 points of Heat
for each attack, because the weapon does 3D damage,
and 3 more per round because it is Auto 3. The weapon
currently has 36 Heat points. Up to this point the
Referee has not implemented the overheating rule
because the Traveller was firing intermittently and the
weapon had a chance to cool but a malfunction at this
critical moment could be significant as well as dramatic
and exciting. The Traveller fires again, increasing the
weapon's Heat to 39 at the end of the round but the
chance of a malfunction is based on the 36 points of
Heat at the time the shot was fired. The weapon is past
its danger threshold, so the chance if a malfunction
is 9+ on a straight 2D roll. One occurs, and a check,
with DM-2 for being past the threshold, is made on
the Malfunction table. This is subject to an additional
DM-3 for the weapon's damage dice and DM+2 for the
Traveller's Gun Combat skill, for a total of DM-3. This
comes out a 3 – a critical component of the weapon
has failed and the weapon needs workshop time. The
Referee decides a round has expanded in the breach
and jammed the ejection system. The Traveller's attack
that round is aborted. She switches to her backup
weapon and the situation becomes a bit more desperate.

Using the Overheating Rule
If the Travellers are roleplaying the situation and
allowing their weapons to cool to a reasonable
degree, this rule need not be brought into play.
It is not intended to deprive Travellers of their
firepower after a couple of shots but should be
applied to significant situations. For example, if
the Travellers are using a damaged plasma cannon
to fend off a horde of enemies they will have to
consider whether to allow the weapon to cool or to
keep firing and hope for the best. As with all rules
in Mercenary , the sustained fire and overheating
rule is intended to give the Travellers problems to
solve or opportunities whilst the enemy's heavy
weapon is out of action. Likewise, if the Travellers
decide to tool up with the most extreme rapid-fire
weaponry money can buy, their weapons should
come with some disadvantages. In this case, a
tendency to stop working or even explode is a
reasonable trade-off for having more firepower
than a TL7 infantry battalion.

AREA FIRE
Area fire is typically conducted by artillery and
automatic weapons, although in different ways. Whether
spraying an area with bullets or shell fragments, what
the attacker is doing is creating a situation where
anyone in that area will be endangered, without any
direct control over who is harmed and who is not. Area
fire with automatic weapons is common at Battlefield
range and typically conducted with artillery at Standoff
range. Lighter artillery weapons such as mortars may be
useful at Battlefield range.

When area fire is used, there is a threat to everyone in
the target zone. A 2D check is required to avoid coming
to harm, at a difficultly level determined by the amount
of cover the individual has. For simplicity it is assumed
that anyone staying under hard cover is safe but of
course they are effectively out of action. Anyone trying
to move around, shoot or take other actions requiring
exposure to the incoming fire must make the check to
avoid harm each round. The intensity of the incoming
fire provides a DM to this check.

**Avoiding Damage From Area Fire**

Activity/Protection Level Difficulty
No activity, under hard cover. No check required
Good cover, such as firing from a bunker. Simple (2+)
Adequate cover, such as firing or observing from a trench. Easy (4+)
Scanty cover, such as a firing position among some big rocks. Routine (6+)
In the open but acting defensively, such as dashing between positions of cover or
staying down.

Average (8+)

Little or no use of cover, such as moving around in the open or operating an unprotected
support weapon.

Difficult (10+)

The check is modified by the intensity of the attack.

**Intensity of Area Attacks**

Type Example DM
Feeble A scattering of small artillery shells over a wide area at Standoff range or a few
automatic weapons at Battlefield range.

Weak Low-intensity artillery bombardment at Standoff range or a few support weapons
(mortars and machineguns perhaps) at Battlefield range.

Typical A typical artillery attack at Standoff range or a well-supported unit laying down
suppressing fire at Battlefield range.

Intense Intense artillery fire or an aera swept by Rapid-Fire weapons. -
Highly
Intense

The most intense artillery strike possible, such as a time-on-target salvo from several
batteries or an area swept by VRF weapons.

If the check is passed, the individual suffers no harm,
although someone next to them might be shredded.
Failure indicates the individual has been hit. This is
resolved using the Hits and Near Misses table on page

12. It is possible to be right on the fringe of an attack or
to suffer a direct hit from an artillery shell. This process
is used for direct-fire weapons as well – someone in the
area of effect might take multiple hits. Damage is based
upon the weapon in use.

SUPPRESSING FIRE
Suppressing fire uses up a lot of ammunition but can
provide tactical advantages. Units with automatic
weapons, or a weapon with similar effects such as
airbursting grenades, can lay down suppressing fire at
Combat range. If large numbers of support weapons
are available it is possible to suppress enemy forces
over a wide area but more commonly suppressing fire
is directed at an enemy position, or somewhere an
enemy is suspected of using. It can also be used to deny

an area to the enemy by endangering anyone passing
through it. For example, a mercenary unit might lay
down suppressing fire on a window suspected of being
a sniper's position or across a corridor intersection to
prevent enemies from moving through. Anyone entering
the suppressed area, trying to move through or out of it
or doing anything except staying under cover is subject
to an Area Fire attack.

The Referee must decide whether the volume of fire
is sufficient to constitute suppressing fire and how
intense it is. At Combat ranges, a full magazine from
an assault rifle is generally sufficient to deliver Typical
suppressing fire on a personnel target for one round.
Such a target might be a machinegun nest, doorway or
similar sized area. Anyone in the target area, such as the
enemy machinegunner and loaders, or a brave enemy
trying to rush across the intersection, receives an Area
Fire attack and must check to avoid being harmed. A
machinegunner firing from a sandbagged position will
probably not be wounded since the check is Simple

(2+) but crossing an open corridor intersection whilst
someone sprays it with automatic fire requires a Difficult
(10+) check. If the attack is successful, it is necessary
to determine whether extra or halved damage is applied,
as with all area attacks.

The primary purpose of suppressing fire is not to cause
harm to the enemy but impede their actions. This might
happen due to tactical choices such as the decision
to stop firing and hunker down or to abort the planned
dash across the intersection to the armory. Commonly,
suppressing fire interferes with what the enemy is doing
rather than preventing it entirely. If this is the case, the
suppressing unit may make a Tactics (military) check.
Gun Combat or Heavy Weapons can be used instead if
this is an individual attempt. The Effect of this check
is applied as a negative DM on the actions of the target
during their next actions in a round.

MANUALLY GUIDED

WEAPONS
Most guided weapons are of a fire-and-forget type. That
is, once launched they are self-guiding and require no
further input from the user. However, some weapons are
manually guided. This may require flying the weapon
remotely using a joystick or similar control device, or
keeping a laser designator on target whilst the weapon is

in flight. Manually guided weapons can be thrown off by
causing the operator to lose control, such as by forcing
a missile controller to duck under cover or causing
a designator spot to slide off the target. This can be
achieved by making the operator flinch, moving the
target, interposing an object or obscuring it with smoke.

Normally, keeping a designated or controlled weapon
on target requires an Average (8+) check using the
operator's skill; typically the skill associated with the
weapon used but a mercenary with a rifle-mounted
designator could use Gun Combat to paint the target. If
the check is made and no adverse situation occurs, such
as a cloud of smoke obscuring the target, the weapon
will automatically hit.

It is possible to perform 'trick shots' with a designator.
For example, a concealed launcher might put four
missiles into the air at short intervals, causing them to
pop up from behind a forest or hill close to the target.
A concealed designator operator can then paint the first
target, causing all the weapons to go for it. As the first
missile strikes home, the designator is moved to the
next target. If the missiles can react quickly enough this
target will be attacked, then the next if the sequence is
followed. A cumulative DM-1 applies to this sort of quick-
targeting for every target after the first and as soon as any
shot misses the rest of the remaining salvo is lost.

AREA AND POINT

DEFENCE
Some weapons are capable of providing defence against
missiles, rockets and even artillery shells. Area defence
is typically the preserve of missile systems or powerful
laser weapons, whilst point defence weaponry is more
varied. Examples include small missiles, rapid-fire lasers
or cannon, and weapons similar to a large shotgun. As a
general rule direct-fire projectiles such as rounds from a
tank gun travel too fast to be intercepted in this manner.

An area defence system can attack any suitable target,
which also includes grav and air vehicles, within its
area of effect. A point defence system can only protect
a single target (the one it is mounted on or next to)
under most circumstances. It is possible to position
point defence weapons so that incoming attacks have
to go right over them, however this is not usually
possible on a battlefield. Some point defence weapons
can attack vehicles and personnel in addition to their
missile defence role but this makes them unavailable for
defensive fire.

Each round an area defence system can attack a number
of targets equal to its Area Defence rating. A point
defence weapon can attack a number of targets equal to
its Point Defence rating. Area defence is conducted first,
with point defences attacking any 'leakers' that come
through the first defensive layer.

Area and point defences use attack rolls like any other
weapons. Those guided by operators may use their
skill level as a DM, although engagement times are so
short with these weapons that actual aiming and firing
is almost always controlled by a dedicated electronic
system. The operator's input is limited to direction and
target selection, essentially providing tactical indications
to the automated systems.

Incoming missiles, rockets and shells are assumed
to be destroyed by any hit, though weapons that can
attack other targets have damage scores as normal. The
difficulty of hitting any given target type is given in the
Defence Targets table. Some advanced weapon systems
are capable of behaving in a manner designed to evade
area and point defence fire, such as following a low,
evasive course, using terrain for cover or intermittently
varying levels of thrust. This may impose a DM on
the ability of a defensive weapon to hit the incoming
warhead. If this capability exists for a given weapon it
will be noted in its description.

Defence Targets
Target Difficulty
Artillery Shell Formidable (14+)
Fast or Small Missile Very Difficult (12+)
Typical Missile Difficult (10+)
Personnel or Vehicles As normal combat

ATTACKING

VEHICLES
Direct-fire weapons such as conventional firearms,
unguided rocket weapons and lasers can only attack
the part of a vehicle facing them. Typically a side and
the front or rear will be available as targets, but one will
be at an oblique angle that will spread out an energy
attack or make a projectile likely to glance off. HEAP
and similar munitions need a clean, near-perpendicular
impact to properly form their plasma jet.

Attacking the surface closest to perpendicular to the
incoming weapon is done at no penalty, but if the
Travellers want to aim somewhere else the referee may
impose additional difficulties. An oblique angle will
impose an additional targeting DM-1 to -6 depending
on the awkwardness of the angle, making it generally a
better idea to aim for the best aligned surface.

Travellers might come up with a clever idea, such as
trying to hit the underside of a tank as it crests an
obstacle or aiming for a 'shell trap' where the shape
of the vehicle makes penetration more likely. If this
is plausible and well roleplayed the referee should
usually allow it. Top and bottom armor is typically
thinner on ground vehicles than the sides or front, but
weak points are a matter for referee discretion. This
might be a plot element when attacking an enemy
super-tank, or a clever tactic from a resourceful
Traveller. Shell traps and weak points are typically
rather small, but a miss by a small margin will usually
still strike the vehicle. In this case an attack that
succeeds with Effect +6 or greater will hit a weak
point at the referee's discretion. Armor can be
considered to be halved in this case, and the vehicle
gains no advantage from reactive armor. Of course,
this also applies to vehicles operated by the Travellers

- they may find their expensive grav tanks are less
invulnerable than they thought!

Some weapons are designed to attack the top or
bottom of vehicles. Mines are usually positioned
to direct a blast upwards and will strike underside
armor, whilst some guided munitions are designed
to attack the top of a vehicle rather than its front.
Artillery-delivered weaponry is also likely to hit the top
of a vehicle. In such cases, the top or bottom armor
of the vehicle is used. Unless additional armor has
been added, the top and bottom of a vehicle will have
half the protection value of the sides.

HIGH AND LOW

PENETRATION
When calculating the effects of some ammunition and
weapon types, it may be necessary to consider more
than one factor affecting how well a weapon punches
through armor. As a general rule, pointed projectiles
travelling at great speed penetrate better than those
travelling more slowly or which are blunt, even if the
projectile is heavier. Energy weapons in general do not
penetrate well as they tend to dump all their energy
into the first surface they encounter, though high-
energy weapons such as plasma guns are so powerful
that this does not really matter.

Drilling Armor
In theory, a laser or other energy weapon burning
through an obstruction or a projectile weapon
could punch holes by repeatedly striking the same
place. However, the chances of remaining on
exactly the same target point long enough to do
so amid combat are rather small, especially with
a hand-held weapon. Playable game mechanics
require a degree of abstraction, so the ability of
any weapon to get through armor is represented
by damage, AP or Lo-Pen score and Effect of the
attack roll, among other factors. If circumstances
allow what amounts to drilling through armor,
the only real question is how long it will take.

When calculating performance against armor, the
weapon designer must keep track of positive and
negative factors, which will produce a Penetration.
This is applied on the Final Penetration table to
determine if any traits or special effects are to be
added. Most weapons begin with Penetration 0.
There is no Lo-Pen 1 trait since this would mean no
modification to the armor's Protection.

Final Penetration
Penetration Effect Traits and Damage Modification
-4 Extremely Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 5
-3 Highly Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 4
-2 Very Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 3
-1 Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 2
0 Standard Performance —
+1 Semi-Armor-Piercing AP 1 per full dice of damage
+2 Armor-Piercing AP 1 plus 1 per full dice of damage, -1 damage per 2 full dice
of damage
+3 High Armor-Piercing AP 3 plus 3 per 2 full dice of damage, -2 damage per 3 full
dice of damage.
+4 Extreme Armor-Piercing AP 5 plus 2 per full dice of damage, -1 damage per dice of
damage.

The weapon's performance against armor is
determined by a running total of positive and negative
factors, with the end result translated into traits.
Thus a gauss rifle using armor-piercing ammunition,
with a final Penetration 3, is a 'high armor piercing
weapon', which modifies its damage from 4D to
4D-3 but adds AP 9. A low-velocity shotgun with
Penetration -2 is 'very poor against armor', which
gives it the Lo-Pen 3 trait. This weapon would treat
a Protection +5 flak jacket as having Protection +15,
but just might get some damage through.

SIGNATURE
All firearms and similar weapons have a signature,
which is mostly created by the means of propulsion
or generation of energy. Chemical propellant weapons
produce a great deal of noise and often muzzle flash;
they can throw dust and loose objects around if they are
powerful enough. Lasers produce no muzzle blast but
do make some noise as they ionise atmosphere as they
pass – a laser in vacuum has no such signature. Gauss
weapons produce an audible crack in atmosphere, but
have no visual or audible signature in vacuum and cause
minimal disturbance to dust. Gauss and laser weapons
do produce significant electromagnetic emissions that
can be picked up by appropriate instruments.

The signature of a weapon is modelled using new
weapon traits and a modifier for accessories used on
the weapon. There are two types of signature, one
based on emissions such as electromagnetic spikes
when firing or heat, and one based on physical effects
that can be detected with eyes and ears. Both kinds
of signature have varying levels ranging from slight to
extreme, which impose DMs to detect the weapon and
locate its firing position.

DMs are based on the difficulty of detecting and locating
a typical weapon of the type, such as a laser carbine or
semi-automatic pistol, and are further modified by some
weapon accessories.

Physical and Emissions Signature traits are detailed on
pages 6 and 7.

DETECTING AND

LOCATING
It is often not obvious where a shot came from, either
because the shooter is concealed or the weapon is not
visible. For example, a Traveller might have a group
of people under observation when a shot is fired. The
Traveller must decide if the shot came from the crowd
or somewhere else and do so quickly enough to stop
a colleague from firing into the group by mistake – or
to present a second attack if the gunman is indeed
within the group. Alternatively Travellers might come
under fire from an unknown direction and need to take
cover. Mistaking the source of the shot might result in
hunkering down on the wrong side of a vehicle. Upon
occasion, targets do not even realise they are being
fired upon.

Detecting a gunshot typically means hearing it but also
realising what the sound was. Not all weapons sound
like firearms – lasers make some sound as they ionise
atmosphere between muzzle and target but it may not
be recognized as a weapon firing. If there is a lot of
noise, such as when travelling in a vehicle on rough
ground, the sound may not be heard at all or may be
misidentified. A rock thrown up by the vehicle's wheels
and slamming into its underside might be interpreted as
a gunshot or vice versa. In some cases a Traveller might
be unable to determine if the sound was or was not a
weapon and may be reluctant to dive into cover at every
sudden noise – or be ridiculed for it.

Just being aware that a shot was fired can be useful
but often the Travellers will need to know where it
originated. Detecting and locating a shot requires a
Routine (6+) Recon check if using normal senses or
an Easy (4+) Electronics (sensors) check if sensors
are being used. Note that only specialist sensors can
pick up a weapon's physical signature whereas almost
anything that can detect magnetic fields, heat and the
like will pick up its emissions signature. If the Traveller
succeeds, they know a shot has been fired and its
general type – conventional firearm, gauss weapon and
so forth. Success with Effect +2 or better gives the
Traveller the general location of the shooter.

Success does not mean the Traveller knows exactly
where the shooter is. If the shooter is standing in the
open surrounded by a big pall of smoke the Traveller
will probably gain an exact location but a camouflaged
sniper or someone hiding in a dark upper-floor room
may not be directly spotted. In this case the Traveller
will have a general location such as 'upper floors of that
building' or 'those trees, ground level' but will have to
make an additional Recon check to spot the shooter.
A general area could be sprayed with automatic fire
or blasted with artillery even if all the Travellers know
is that the shot came from 'somewhere in there' but
directly engaging a target requires spotting it first.

In the event the Traveller succeeds with Effect +6 or
more, they will be able to identify the weapon in use.
Not to the degree of stating with certainty 'that was
a twin-trigger Steyr-Mannlicher SSG assembled on a
Tuesday by a left-handed armorer' but in terms of 'large
calibre rifle', 'smallbore rifle', 'shotgun', 'gauss pistol'
and so forth. They will also know the shooter's precise
location, down to which window they fired from or the
equivalent, even if they cannot see the shooter directly.

The Recon check is subject to further situational DMs,
as noted on the Situational Modifiers table.

Once the general location of a shooter is known it
becomes possible to try to spot them directly. This is
necessary in order to engage with any sort of precision,
but hosepiping the general area is always an option.

Situational Modifiers
Circumstance DM
Physical Signature DM for weapon As applicable
Emissions Signature DM for weapon As applicable

Noisy Conditions (vehicle on rough ground) -2
Extremely Noisy Conditions (friendly gunfire nearby or artillery in the vicinity) -4
Cluttered Terrain (forest, jumbled boulders) -2
Bad location Conditions (sound echoing from buildings or cliffs) -4

CAMOUFLAGE AND

STEALTH
There may be occasions where the Travellers want to
sneak past guards or get into a firing position without
being detected – or someone else might want to do
that to them. The basic procedure for spotting someone
or avoiding detection is to use an opposed Stealth
versus Recon check. This is modified by aids such as
camouflage and sensors.

Some sensors make it effectively impossible to hide
from attentive observers. A well-camouflaged soldier
might be difficult to spot in the foliage but will stand
out on thermal imaging to a level where nobody looking
at the readout could fail to spot them. Yet it is still
possible to be stealthy with the right equipment or
techniques. One option is to distract the observers or
make them doubt the sensor or even to turn it off. This
might be achieved by triggering so many false alerts that
they lose faith in their system.

Alternatively, thermal camouflage can be used. Some
advanced camouflage uses shielded heat sinks that
allow the user to be effectively invisible to thermal
sensors for a time but which will eventually be
overloaded and begin to leak so much heat they cannot
be missed. Less technological solutions either conceal
the user's heat signature to some extent or radiate it
in a shape that does not resemble a person. Observers
will still see a thermal image but may assume it is
something harmless rather than a person with a weapon.

The battle between sensors and camouflage systems is
modelled by modifiers applied to the opposed Stealth
versus Recon check, with the Referee's common sense
overruling bizarre situations. As a general rule of
thumb, if someone trying to be stealthy has no counter
to a sensor then unless the operators are extremely lax
they will automatically be spotted. The Referee might
grant an outside chance nobody was watching the
readout or the auto-alarm somehow glitched but this
is extremely unlikely unless the operators have been
distracted in some manner.

Camouflage and sensors are both rated in terms of
the DM they grant to a Stealth or Recon check. This
all supposes the individual is moving slowly and not
drawing attention. Once they open fire, observers will
have a chance to spot the weapon discharge, although
they will still have to win the Stealth versus Recon
check to get eyes on the target rather than their
general location. Once the shooter ceases fire and
changes position, the Stealth versus Recon opposed
check applies once more.

QUICKDRAW
Most combat is governed by the initiative rules.
However, there are moments where all that matters is
whether a Traveller or their enemy gets their weapon
on line first. In such situations the wider picture does
not matter; the contest is between two individuals
or sometimes members of two small groups. This is
termed a 'quickdraw' whether or not a weapon has to
be drawn.

To resolve this, each participant rolls 2D and adds their
DEX modifier and level of Gun Combat. The relative
handiness of the weapon is the other critical factor.
The Weapon Effects on Quickdraw table indicates
typical Quickdraw scores of various weapon types,
although this can vary depending on barrel length and
accessories. The precise Quickdraw score of a weapon
is determined in the design process.

If a weapon has to be drawn or unslung, DM-2 applies.
If it has to be readied, for example by chambering a
round, an additional DM-2 applies. A weapon already
pointed in the general direction of the target gains
DM+4, whilst one that is precisely laid on target – such
as a sniper holding ready to shoot at any instant –
gains DM+8.

The Weapon Effects on Quickdraw table gives a
quick-and-dirty guide to the Quickdraw scores of
different weapons. Specific values are calculated
when designing a weapon but these can be used if the
referee is in a hurry.

Weapon Effects on Quickdraw
Weapon Type Quickdraw
Handgun +8
Submachinegun +4
Short Shotgun +2
Lightweight Assault Rifle +0
Battle Rifle -2
Light Machinegun -4
Anti-Materiel Rifle -8

The Traveller with the highest Quickdraw score shoots
first. It is not usually possible to aim under these
conditions; snapshots and bursts of automatic fire are
the only viable options. In the case where the weapon is
already on target, such as a sniper waiting for clearance
to shoot, the shot is assumed to be aimed with DM+2.
It is not permissible to claim huge aiming bonuses for
holding a weapon on target for a long period. If the target
is hit but not downed, they suffer a negative DM to their
own attempt to attack. This DM is -2, with an additional
-1 for every full three points of damage suffered.

For example, a Traveller acting as point for a patrol turns
a corner and finds herself facing a hostile militiaman
going the other way. The Traveller has a short stockless
shotgun ready for just such a close encounter, but rolls a
disastrous 2 on 2D. Even with her DEX modifier and Gun
Combat skill she has a total of Quickdraw 5, increased
to 9 because her weapon is ideal for such situations.
The gunman is armed with a submachinegun, but it is
slung. He rolls a rather better 6, modified to 8 by his
DEX and Gun Combat skill. The submachinegun grants
DM+2, raising the total to Quickdraw 10, which would
normally be sufficient to outdraw the Traveller. However,
the gunman has to unsling his weapon (DM-2) and
chamber a round (DM-2) before firing. He is on a total
of Quickdraw 6 and is still readying his weapon when
he is hit. His body armor stops some of the blast but
he takes 10 damage. The gunman then looses a burst,
but suffers DM-5 (-2 for being hit, -3 more for three full
sets of 3 points of damage). Hopefully this is enough to
throw off his aim.

KNOCKDOWN
In general it is more desirable to 'stop' the target than
ensure a kill. A shot that delivers a mortal wound, but
leaves the victim able to act for a few seconds, may have
worse overall results than a non-fatal shot that knocks
the target down and stops them acting. In theory any
shot can achieve a 'knockdown' – a situation in which
the target is immediately stopped in what they are doing
and quite possibly sent to the ground. If a knockdown is
achieved, the target cannot act for the rest of that round
and all of the next.

To have any chance of achieving a knockdown on a
typical bipedal creature it is necessary to deliver more
damage than the maximum END value for a member of
that species – 15 for humans and similar creatures –
with a kinetic-energy or high-energy weapon; lasers and
flame weapons cannot achieve a knockdown. It does not
matter whether this damage gets through armor or not;
all that matters is that enough energy is delivered to
knock the target down or disorient them.

If damage exceeds species maximum, a knockdown
occurs unless the victim resists it. Note that
'knockdown' is a general term for 'hit hard and
temporarily unable to act'. Many times this will involve
being knocked down or against something, or falling, but
the exact effects depend on the circumstances. To avoid
a knockdown, the target must make a Simple (2+) STR
check, with negative DM equal to the amount of damage
over their species maximum. Weapons that deliver a
lot of force tend to do so by being poor penetrators – a
weapon's Lo-Pen value is applied as a negative DM
to the STR check. Conversely, weapons using armor-
piercing ammunition tend not to dump their energy into
the target as they often overpenetrate. A weapon's AP
rating is used as a positive DM to the STR check.

For example, a human Traveller is hit by a pellet-firing
shotgun. Their flak jacket is treated as Protection
+15 against this weapon, which has the Lo-Pen 3
trait. Damage rolled is 16 points, of which only 1 gets

through the armor. However, the impact is sufficient
to potentially cause a knockdown. To avoid this the
Traveller must make a Routine (6+) STR check. Their
STR DM is +1, but they suffer DM-1 for the one
point of damage over their knockdown threshold and
DM-3 for the shotgun's Lo-Pen rating. The Traveller
rolls 8 on the dice, with a total DM-3. The Effect
of the check is -1, which is insufficient to avoid a
knockdown. A rifle bullet doing the same amount of
damage would have penetrated the armor and done
more actual harm to the Traveller, but probably not
applied a knockdown.

BREAKING

WEAPONS
It is quite difficult to completely destroy a typical
firearm, but putting one out of action is not so hard.
For example, it is not uncommon for snipers to shoot
the breach block of machineguns or other support
weapons. An intact weapon can be taken over by
another soldier, whereas one that needs workshop
time is out of action for much longer. It would still be
substantially intact, however.

A weapon struck by a projectile, energy burst or some
other means of dealing damage will suffer a Mishap
if the damage inflicted exceeds its Mishap Threshold.
Once the effects of the Mishap are determined there is
no further effect. A weapon will be put out of action if
it receives three times its Mishap Threshold in a single
strike, and will require major repair. Ten times the
Mishap Threshold should be enough to reduce a weapon
to what is left of its components.

Mishap Thresholds are based on weapon type, and
do not vary all that much between similar items. For
example, damaging a handgun is about as difficult
as damaging a rifle of the same construction. The
materials used in the weapon's manufacture are
significant in determining its Mishap Threshold, along
with its general type.

Mishap Threshold
Weapon Type Mishap Threshold
Flamethrowers and similar weapons containing hazardous substances Tech Level/2
Lasers and similarly complex weapons that require precise alignment Tech Level
Gauss, plasma, fusion and similar complex but robust weapons Tech Level +4
Conventional firearms and similar strongly built mechanical devices Tech Level +8
Hand weapons and similar strongly built items with few or no moving parts Tech Level +12

The Mishap Threshold has nothing to do with how
dangerous a weapon would be if a Mishap occurred – that
is dealt with using the Hazardous trait on page 6. It is
possible to make a weapon safer or even to armor it
against damage. There is generally no need to track the
Mishap Threshold of a weapon – attacks against them
are uncommon. However, if the Travellers insist on using
ramshackle home-made flamethrowers it may be worth
keeping a note of the value required to cause a Mishap.
Someone will take a shot sooner or later.

Weapons can be deliberately targeted but are difficult
to hit even if the user is standing still. Targeting a part
of a typical weapon that will potentially put it out of
action imposes DM-6 on an attack roll. This is the case
even if the weapon is quite large – a heavy machinegun
may be a big object but most of it is composed of items
that will not cause it to malfunction if hit. If the critical
component is relatively large, such as the tanks of a flame
weapon, the penalty is reduced to DM-4 and may be
further modified at the referee's discretion.

DISTRACTIONS
Some weapons are intended to distract or debilitate
opponents, instead of or in addition to harming them.
Examples include concussion or flash grenades and
munitions intended to throw out a series of bright sparks
to interfere with night vision equipment. Anyone exposed
to such a distraction must make an END check or be
unable to take their next set of actions. This might be
due to flinching from blinding light or simply turning
to see what the sudden noise was. The difficulty of this
check is determined by the distraction device, which in
turn depends largely upon its size and power. Note that
these are 'distraction' rather than 'stun' weapons. Those
intended to put someone out of action for more than a
combat round are considered elsewhere.

**Distraction Devices**

Type Example Difficulty
Small Pistol or Rifle-Fired Distraction Round Easy (4+)
Minor Shotgun-Fired Distraction Round Routine (6+)
Typical Flashbang Grenade Average (8+)
Potent Enhanced Distraction Grenade Difficult (10+)
Overwhelming Extreme Noise, Flashing Lights; not typically attainable from a grenade or
smaller device

Very Difficult (12+)

Victims can gain positive DMs to resist the effects of a
distraction weapon. Sufficient warning to cover eyes or
look away grants DM+2 against light-based weapons.
Ear protection does the same for concussion or noise
distractions. Some helmet and vision systems have
automatic protection built in, granting these DMs or
possibly higher ones without the user needing to take
any action.

GAS AND CHEMICAL

WEAPONS
Gas weapons are typically delivered from grenades but
small arms ammunition can be converted to deliver a
low quantity of gas. The concentration of gas, along
with its composition, determines how likely targets are
to be affected. All gas weapons are rated according to
their capability to fill a 3x3x3m volume. Each additional
volume this size that the gas must expand into reduces
the potency of the weapon by one level. The final
potency of the gas attack determines the difficulty of an
END check to resist it. Those with respiratory protection
may be entirely immune or gain a positive DM to resist
the attack.

A single handgun or rifle round will typically deliver
a Feeble potency attack. A shotgun cartridge or
similar large smallarm projectile typically delivers
a Weak attack, and a mini-grenade delivers a Low
potency attack. Grenades, rifle grenades and small
warheads produce an Average potency attack. These
base potencies can be increased by the use of more
advanced or concentrated gases. The effects of gases
are described on page 55.

Chemical weapons that rely on skin contact are treated
the same way.

Gas Weapon Potency
Potency Difficulty
Feeble Simple (2+)
Weak Easy (4+)
Low Routine (6+)
Standard Average (8+)
High Difficult (10+)
Potent Very Difficult (12+)
Overwhelming Formidable (14+)

INCENDIARY AND

FLAME WEAPONS
Incendiary and flame weapons are designed to set
fire to a target and/or inflict damage over a prolonged
period. All incendiary and flame weapons have the
Incendiary trait (see page 7), which indicates their
propensity to set objects on fire. Most military flame
weapons rely on coating the target with a sticky,
flammable liquid which is then ignited, whereas
incendiaries are more commonly a solid material which
burns inside the target after penetration. The effects
are similar in most cases, but flame weapons do not
have a Penetration associated with them – they always
coat the outside of a target and defeat armor by heat
conduction rather than physical penetration.

In both cases, the initial damage done by the weapon
may be followed by more. An incendiary or flame weapon
that has the Burn trait does half damage for a number of
rounds equal to its Burn score. Armor protects against
this damage each round. If the target is hit by another
flame or incendiary weapon during this time, only the
highest damage is applied.

CORROSIVE

WEAPONS
Corrosive weapons are rare but may be encountered
either as improvised equipment or in use with unusual
societies. Improvised corrosive weapons usually take the
form of chemical sprayers or fragile containers filled with
corrosive substances. Occasionally projectile weapons
firing either a soft round intended to flatten and stick
to the target, or a hollow projectile intended to deliver
the corrosive agent into the target, are encountered.
The most common of these are breaching devices which
stick a wad of corrosive material onto the target in the
hope it will eat through or at least weaken the structure.

Corrosive weapons have a damage rating like any
other, but deliver their damage in a different way.
Each round, corrosive damage drops by 1D until it
reaches zero. Any modifiers to damage expire with the
last 1D.

Armor protects as normal. However, a corrosive
weapon will destroy armor it is in contact with, at
the rate of 1 point of armor per dice of damage.

For example, a Traveller wearing a Protection +5 flak
jacket is hit by a corrosive weapon doing 2D damage.
Damage rolled is 8 points, so the Traveller takes
3 points of damage through armor. His armor is
degraded by 2 points that round because it was in
contact with a 2D corrosive weapon. The following
round the corrosive damage drops to 1D. Damage
rolled is 4 points, and since the Traveller's armor is
down to Protection +3, 1 point gets through. The flak
jacket is degraded an additional point. The Traveller
takes no damage the following round, but the flak
jacket is now Protection +2.

Some armor is treated to be corrosion-resistant. This
is indicated by the Corrosion-Resistant (+X) trait. The
value counteracts the reduction of Protection by the
corrosive attack. If the Traveller in the above example
was wearing a Corrosion-Resistant (+1) flak jacket the
armor would have been degraded by only 1 point in
the first round and not at all after that.

MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
ELECTRONICS

SYSTEMS
In general, military electronics tend to be based on
civilian systems and are often behind the technology
curve, except where a project has been undertaken
to produce a specialist capability. Reliability is
prized above capability in most functions. The
actual components, programs and systems in use
are often exactly the same as civilian electronics,
allowing repairs and replacements to be made with
commercially available components. However, military
systems tend to have extra capabilities, often provided
by additional components rather than integrating
everything by designing whole new circuit boards.
Thus the interior of a military computer often contains
familiar civilian components or boards with specialist
military components squeezed in wherever they will
fit. This is particularly the case in items intended for
the cheaper end of the mercenary market.

Military electronic systems are more robust than their
civilian counterparts, though usually this is achieved
simply by mounting them in tougher cases. They also
have the capability to interface with other military
systems, which civilian equivalents lack. At its simplest,
this is a matter of having the right ports and a small
additional drive containing the protocols required to talk
to other milspec electronics. In cheaper machines the
actual internal workings of the system are identical to
civilian systems, with the interface unit acting as a filter.
If it can be bypassed, a civilian system could interface
directly. Dedicated military computers 'think in military'
and are not compatible with civilian models even if
security is bypassed. This eliminates most possibilities
of hacking by a passing kid with an illegal haxxorx app
downloaded to their comm.

Typically the computer systems of major powers are
unique and require the right interface protocols. Many of
these are available as packages on the mercenary market

- legally and otherwise. Some powers want properly
accredited mercenaries to be able to interface with their
equipment. Others insist that all electronic transfers
go through a single secure access point. Equipment
produced for the mercenary marketplace is always
compatible with what might be called the commercial-
military end of the market. A unit that buys equipment
will configure it to fit with its own secure electronic
environment using built-in protocols. These are less
of a barrier to hacking than a dedicated computer and
electronics system, but far cheaper.

It is still possible to hack a mercenary unit's electronics
using civilian computer systems but an interface must
be established. The typical Traveller's personal comm
simply cannot talk to a military system, except by way of
a firewalled 'outside unsecured comms' protocol which
does not allow access to the operating system. Interface
devices are supposedly controlled and restricted to
sale to accredited mercenary unit, but there are always
examples on the black market.

As a general rule, electronic equipment for use by
mercenaries is designed to be interoperable with
other items on the market, creating a 'plug and fight'
capability which still excludes non-military systems.
Any attempt to hack a military electronic system using
civilian systems is subject to DM-2 even if an interface
is available, and will probably be impossible if not.
Similarly, attempts to hack a dedicated military system
from a mercenary-market system suffers DM-2, and
civilian equipment increases this to DM-4. Additional
security measures may increase the difficulty further.

Electromagnetic Field and Pulse Effects
Electronic systems can be badly affected by a rapidly
changing electromagnetic field, especially when this
takes the form of a high-intensity pulse produced by a
weapon. Naturally occurring pulses are usually caused
by solar activity, and electromagnetic leakage from
poorly constructed machinery can have similar effects.
Pulses can also be produced by nuclear explosions and
certain weapons.

The basic principle behind producing an
electromagnetic pulse is simple, meaning it can be
accomplished by any society capable of generating
electricity. Making a device small enough to use as
a grenade or similar weapon requires more advanced
technology; electromagnetic pulse (EMP) grenades
become possible at TL9, though crude generators can
be built earlier. A weaponised EMP generator such as
a grenade produces a pulse with an intensity equal
to its Tech Level. A pulse will destroy all unshielded
electronics of more than two Tech Levels below its
intensity level, and will cause all unshielded systems
within two Tech Levels of its intensity to shut down for
1D minutes.

It is possible to shield electronic devices from the
effects of a pulse, though this is rare in the case of
civilian electronics other than scientific or specialist
equipment. Advanced civilian equipment is generally
more resilient, so whilst not shielded as such a TL12
civilian system would not be shut down by a TL9 EMP
grenade. It might still be disrupted, however.

Shielded systems, which includes all military electronic
systems, civilian systems noted as being hardened
against EMP effects and civilian systems more than 2
Tech Levels higher than the intensity of the pulse, may
or may not be disrupted. Roll 2D on the EMP Disruption
table, with DM+1 for every TL above the intensity of the
pulse, and an additional DM+2 if the system is designed
for military use.

Electromagnetic fields can impose similar effects,
such as when Travellers try to use communications
equipment during a solar flare, or when unshielded
electronic devices are used near a badly shielded piece
of machinery. Typically a field will have an intensity
ranging from 1 to 6, but spikes and flares are possible
with a much higher intensity.

EMP Disruption
2D+DMs Result
2-4 System shuts down for 1D minutes and must reboot
5-7 Severe disruption/whiteout imposes DM-6 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
8-10 Disruption imposes DM-4 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
11-13 Disruption imposes DM-2 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
14+ No Effect

DEMOLITIONS
Much of the time in a mercenary campaign, destruction
of an object is a plot point rather than something the
Travellers need to be directly concerned with. It is often
quite acceptable to assume a commando unit is carrying
suitable explosives to deal with a target, and build a
storyline about getting them into place and preventing
the enemy from disarming the charges. Sometimes
it is necessary to determine whether a wall has been
breached, a statue destroyed, or whatever else the
Travellers are trying to achieve – or trying to stop.

Damage can be inflicted by impact, explosions, corrosive
substances or other means. If a target is thoroughly
doused in cryogenic fluids then struck - even quite
lightly – it may shatter. Cryogenic demolition is very
destructive, inflicting twice the damage delivered by the
cryogenic weapon once the 'tap' is applied. If the target
is simply doused in cryogenic fluid and left alone, it
suffers normal damage.

The amounts of damage noted below are sufficient to
put a fist-sized hole in an object. Ten times as much
damage will shatter the object, and 25 times as much
will obliterate it. If vaporization is required and a suitable
weapon is to hand, 50 times the Structure noted in the
Demolition of Objects table will achieve this.

The weaponry found in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_
and _Central Supply Catalogue_ represents a generic
version of their type. This is entirely adequate for
most users, but there may be times where a few more
rounds in the magazine or a slight range advantage
could mean the difference between mission success
and medical repatriation.

The following design system creates game-mechanics
data for weapons, including damage, effective range
and the like. Fine details like safety devices or specific
features are a matter for referee discretion. Note that
the price for weapons created under this system is a
suggestion only. There is no reason why a manufacturer
might not price their weapons above or below the
suggested cost, but this is an in-universe detail to be
determined by the referee.

Most weapons are designed around the ammunition
they use or their method of causing injury, and it is
this that defines the basic characteristics of a weapon.
In addition to their ammunition type, weapons are
considered to consist of three main components:
the receiver, the barrel and furniture. Additional
components can be considered to be accessories,
as usually a weapon will function without them.
Ammunition type determines base damage and range
for the weapon.

**The receiver** contains the main working components
of the weapon such as feed and ejection mechanism,
firing chamber and so forth. It also incorporates some
kind of grip for the firing hand or the equivalent for
creatures without hands as such. The cost and weight of
the receiver is used as a baseline for other components,
whose characteristics are given as a percentage of the
receiver's cost or weight. The type of receiver used also
determines the weapon's base Quickdraw score.

**The barrel** determines many characteristics of a weapon
such as its effective range, and may modify damage. In
general a long barrel gives a higher muzzle velocity from
the same projectile or a tighter beam from the same
energy weapon, resulting in greater effective range and
damage. Barrel length modifies Quickdraw.

**The furniture** on a weapon is its stock, foregrip and
the like. Adding a stock improves aimed fire and
controllability, but also increases weight. Some
modifications affect Quickdraw.

**PERSONAL WEAPON DESIGN**

CHAPTER-FOUR

Accessories include scopes, laser pointers, bipods
and the like. Weapons will generally function without
them. The exception is a feed device such as a
magazine or belt, since obviously projectile weapons
need ammunition.

Feed devices can vary considerably from one weapon to
another. Some are implicit in a weapon's design, such
as a revolver's cylinder or the chamber of a single shot
breachloader. If a detachable feed device is used, its
capacity is normally determined by the base value for
the weapon type. The capacity of a feed device is a
matter for referee discretion; it can be set at any value
from 50%-150% of the weapon's base capacity. Thus
when deciding on the capacity of a standard semi-
automatic pistol the referee may set it anywhere from
5 to 15 rounds since the base capacity of a standard
handgun is 10 rounds.

Weapon Design Process
When designing a weapon, the following steps are taken in order. Sometimes it may be necessary to
return to an earlier step if the results are not satisfactory but this is generally straightforward unless the
ammunition type is to be changed.

1. Decide the weapon's general type (rifle, pistol and so forth).
2. Choose an ammunition type or power source.
3. Choose a receiver and mode of operation (breachloader, semi-automatic and so forth).
4. Assign barrel length.
5. Assign furniture.
6. Choose a feed device.
7. Add any accessories that come as standard.
8. Total the cost and weight for the weapon.

Note that when the weight or cost of a component is calculated this is usually based on the weight or cost
of the receiver once it has been modified by any receiver features. This baseline value determines what
every further modification or accessory will add to the weapon.

The referee may choose to apply modifications to cost and weight based on cosmetic factors, manufacturer
prestige or similar in-game details which do not affect the overall performance of the weapon. Weights and
prices can be rounded off to suitably 'tidy' values. Small changes such as adding or removing a point or
two of damage can be added by the referee to create more variation in weaponry available.

WEAPON DESIGN

WORKSHEET
When designing a new weapon it is useful to fill out
a worksheet, keeping track of modifications as they
are added. This is not necessary with simple weapons
but where there are multiple variations or different
ammunition types in use it is easy to lose track. Most
component costs and weights are based on the cost and
weight of the receiver once it has been configured to
the user's desires. A blank worksheet at the back of this
book can be photocopied, or downloaded for free from
our web site.

This weapon is simple, with few modifications to its
base costs. Cost and weight will likely be rounded up
when the design is finalised, whilst other features will be
determined from the values noted here. This feeds into
extended weapon characteristics with the data required
for play.

**Tweaks, Rounding and**

Special Features
Calculated values should be used on the
worksheet, and exact figures retained so that
alterations or modifications are easy to calculate.
Rounded values should be used in the weapon's
stat block. With the referee's approval values can
be rounded off to the nearest Cr10, 0.1kg or a
similar level of detail.

A weapon can be given a special feature at the
referee's discretion. A point or two of damage,
slightly amended weight, cost or ammunition
capacity are all permissible for referee-developed
weapons. The Travellers should not be allowed to
tweak their own designs in this manner without
the referee's oversight.

CONVENTIONAL

FIREARMS
Conventional firearms use a projectile made from
some heavy material, driven by the force generated by
expanding gas. This in turn comes from a propellant
which may be initiated either by mechanical or electric
means. Mechanical initiation is far more common and
requires no power. Typically a primer is inserted in the
cartridge, containing material that will explode when
struck hard, providing enough energy to initiate the
propellant. The result is noisy and produces muzzle
flash, and may stir up dust around a shooter. Thus
mechanically initiated conventional firearms possess the
Physical Signature trait. If not specified this is at the
(normal) level.

Electric initiation requires a more complex weapon
with a power source. It does not eliminate noise and
flash, and the power source gives the weapon the
Emissions Signature trait. This is normally (minimal)
as the spark is brief and contained within a metal
weapon. Electrically initiated weapons are favored by
some users as they have less moving parts – this can
be important in a very dirty environment – and can
achieve a higher rate of fire than weapons which rely on
mechanical action.

Cartridge cases are normally made from metal or
plastic, and almost always ejected from the weapon as
part of the loading-firing cycle. Caseless ammunition
is available for weapons designed to use it. It has
the advantage that the cartridge is entirely formed of
propellant so can be lighter and does not need to be
ejected from the weapon. This means less moving parts
which is usually a good thing, but caseless ammunition
is expensive to produce. It typically costs three times
as much as conventional ammunition, and can only be
used in weapons designed for it – which are also more
expensive to produce.

Some very ecologically friendly governments insist on
'green' ammunition which uses non-toxic, biodegradable
propellants and cartridge case materials. This is an
example of what might be called 'novelty' ammunition.
Costs start at twice the price of conventional
ammunition and can be much higher depending on the
stipulations of the user.

RECEIVER

CONFIGURATIONS
The configuration of a weapon is relevant to how 'handy'
it is at close quarters, how bulky, and how accurate it is
at range.

Test Range and Effective Range
The ranges for ammunition types given here are
based on the round's performance through a
test barrel equivalent to a rifle-length weapon.
This is the range to which the ammunition will
remain reasonably accurate. It will travel further,
of course, but loses velocity and consequently
performance in terms of both accuracy and
hitting power.

The barrel length selected for a weapon modifies
its muzzle velocity and therefore its effective
range. A very short barrel, for example, does
not allow the round to reach full velocity and
also reduces accuracy, all of which adds up to a
shorter effective range. It is possible to fire rifle-
calibre rounds from a handgun, but performance
will be nowhere near as good as when fired from
a proper rifle.

There are three common types of receiver for personal
projectile weapons: handgun, assault weapon and
longarm. Heavier weapons can use a light support or
support weapon receiver.

Handguns: Handguns are designed to be held in
one hand, though the weak hand is generally used
to steady the weapon in a two-handed grip. True
handguns include semi-automatic pistols and
revolvers, but some other weapons can be considered
handguns. These include weapons resembling sawed-
off shotguns and very small submachineguns that can
be fired with one hand if necessary.

Handguns can be used in close combat with no
penalty, whereas other firearms cannot. There is
no penalty for firing a handgun with one hand, but
to conduct aimed fire it is generally necessary to
use both hands or brace the weapon in some other
manner, such as resting it on a wall. Even when
aiming, handguns have a short effective range due
to air resistance causing rapid loss of velocity, short
barrels and the difficulty of precisely aiming such a
short weapon.

Handguns can be chambered for any projectile
ammunition, though pistol or snub weapon calibres
are most common. A handgun receiver has a base
Quickdraw 4.

**Assault Weapons:** The term 'assault weapon' in this
context refers to weapons designs for use at short range,
such as in urban combat or inside a space vessel.
Most assault weapons are chambered for pistol or snub
weapon cartridges, but assault weapons chambered for
more exotic ammunition types do exist. Assault weapons
normally require both hands to use effectively, but can
be fired one-handed with DM-2 on attack rolls.

Assault weapons are almost always constructed for burst
or full-automatic fire, at no additional cost. 'Civilian'
versions, capable of semi-automatic fire only, are typically
available at the same cost. It is generally possible to
convert these back to full-automatic with a few simple
adjustments, though it is illegal to do so in many locales.
An assault weapon has a base Quickdraw 2.

**Longarms:** Longarms are designed to be held in both
hands, and include rifles, light machineguns and
combat shotguns. Longarms can be fired with one hand
but are subject to DM-4 on attack rolls. A longarm can
usually be used as a decent club, doing 2D damage,
and military versions often have a bayonet mounting. A
longarm has a base Quickdraw 0.

**Light Support Weapons:** Light support weapons include
general-purpose machineguns, anti-materiel rifles and
most plasma and fusion weapons, as well as shoulder-
fired anti-aircraft and anti-armor missile launchers.
Light support weapons are heavier than longarms and
cannot usually be fired one-handed unless on a suitable
mount or gravitic support device. Light Support Weapons
have a base Quickdraw -4.

**Heavy Weapons:** Heavy weapons normally require a
mount or emplacement to use, and include heavy
machineguns, light autocannon, heavy missile
launchers, battlefield mortars, large plasma weapons
and the like. Most heavy weapons are carried by a team
of soldiers or mounted on a vehicle, but some can be
mounted on battle dress. Heavy Weapons have a base
Quickdraw -8 if mounted on battle dress or traversed on
their mounting to engage a new target. Base weight and
cost vary considerably.

MECHANISMS
The mechanism used in a weapon will normally define
most of its characteristics. The physical mechanics can
vary considerably, but the overall characteristics can be
summed up by the following nomenclature.

Single Shot: A single shot weapon can fire only once
before needing to be reloaded. Examples include black
powder muskets or breach-loading shotguns and rifles.
A double or multi-barrel firearm is still a single shot
weapon, but obviously each barrel can fire its one shot
before having to be reloaded. Single shot mechanisms
reduce the receiver cost by 75%.

Repeater: Repeater weapons carry multiple rounds of
ammunition but require either direct action from the
user (such as with a pump-action shotgun or bolt-action
rifle) or are cocked and then fired by the user's actions
(such as a double-action revolver). This makes them
relatively slow-firing. A repeater mechanism reduces
receiver cost by 50%. A weapon with a repeater action
reduces base ammunition capacity by 50%.

Semi-Automatic: Semi-automatic weapons reload
automatically using the energy generated in firing.
Examples include semi-automatic pistols (often known
as autopistols) and rifles, plus many automatic weapons
when set to semi-automatic operation. If no mechanism
is specified a weapon is assumed to be semi-automatic.

Burst-Capable: A burst-capable weapon has a device
fitted that fires a set number of rounds per pull of
the trigger. Most fully-automatic weapons can also
be used in burst fire mode. A burst-capable weapon
has an Auto rating but cannot use full-automatic fire.
It can only deliver burst fire as per the Traveller Core
Rulebook , or be set to semi-automatic operation. Burst
fire capability does not add significantly to the weight
of the weapon but increases cost by 10%. It gives the
weapon Auto 2. It can only make attacks in single or
burst mode however.

Fully-Automatic: A fully-automatic weapon can normally
be set for semi-automatic fire, and many can also
conduct burst fire. When in full-auto mode, the weapon
will cycle as long as the trigger is held, burning through
all available ammunition. Fully-automatic capability
does not add significantly to the weight of the weapon
but increases cost by 20%. It gives the weapon Auto 3.
A fully-automatic weapon can make attacks in single,
burst or full-auto modes.

Rapid-Fire: A Rapid-fire (RF) weapon is designed to
deliver a very large amount of ammunition in a short
space of time. This can be wasteful but is highly
destructive. Rapid-fire capability is denoted by the RF
code after the weapon's Auto score. A rapid-fire weapon
must have a high Auto score (at least 4) and also
delivers such intense firepower that damage is increased
relative to a 'mere' automatic weapon of the same
calibre. RF weapons do an extra dice of damage per
three full dice an automatic weapon of the same calibre
would deliver. RF capability can be created by using a
multiple mount, or simply a weapon with an extremely
high rate of fire. Rapid-fire capability multiplies base
cost by the weapon's Auto score +2. Thus a rapid-fire
weapon with Auto 4 increases base cost by 4+2 = 6.
Rapid-fire capability adds the Bulky trait and multiplies
base weight of the receiver by 2. An RF (or VRF) weapon
has an AP score equal to the base number of damage
dice, calculated before additional rapid-fire damage
is added. RF capability has implications for area and
suppressive fire (see page 15).

A weapon can be converted to RF in various ways. A
twin mount carrying identical weapons with Auto 4+
can be considered an RF weapon, doing damage based
on a single example of the type modified by its RF
capability. Alternatively, a weapon can be converted to
RF by increasing its Auto score to at least 4 and using
powered or forced feed and initiation, such as that
used in a chain gun. A powered feed system triples the
cost and weight of the weapon's receiver, and is only
feasible on longarms, light support weapons or support
weapons. An RF weapon generates Heat at a rate equal
to its Auto score plus twice its damage dice, so an Auto
4 weapon delivering 3D damage generates 4+6 = 10
Heat per round.

Very Rapid-Fire: Very Rapid-Fire (VRF) weapons are
designed to deliver extremely intense firepower. A VRF
weapon must have Auto 6+, and in addition delivers an
extra dice of damage per two full base dice indicated by
ammunition type. For example, a 5.56mm machinegun
has Auto 3 and does 3D damage. A VRF version of the
same weapon has Auto 6 and does 4D damage. VRF
capability has implications for area and suppressive fire
(see page 13). A VRF weapon generates Heat at a rate
equal to its Auto score plus three times its damage dice,

so an Auto 6 weapon delivering 4D damage generates
6+12 = 18 Heat per round. (see page 13). A VRF weapon
generates Heat at a rate equal to its Auto score plus three
times its damage dice, so an Auto 6 weapon delivering
4D damage generates 6+12 = 18 Heat per round.

VRF capability is usually achieved by using multiple
barrels in a rotary or grouped configuration, such as a
minigun. A twin-mounted RF weapon can be considered
a VRF weapon of the same type. Alternatively, a weapon
can be converted to VRF fire by increasing its Auto score
to at least 6 and using a VRF feed system. The latter
adds the Very Bulky trait and multiplies base weight and
cost of the receiver by 5.

Underwater: Some firearms and specialist weapons
are adapted for use underwater. Range is given under
normal conditions; instead of reducing their range to
1/10 as with most conventional weapons, range for
an underwater-adapted weapon is reduced to 1/5.
Underwater-adapted weapons require specialist am-
munition. This configuration multiplies the base cost of
the receiver by 2.

RECOIL
All conventional firearms produce recoil. Gauss
weapons do too, but to a much smaller extent as their
projectiles are smaller and lighter. Controlling a weapon,
particularly one using automatic fire, can be a problem
for those without proper training. The mass of a weapon
helps absorb recoil, so creating an extremely powerful
handgun or one capable of automatic fire can make
it uncontrollable. A weapon's Recoil score is equal to
its base number of damage dice plus its Auto score if
it is being used for fully-automatic or burst fire. The
following modifiers are applied to this score:

Near-zero recoil weapon such as accelerator rifle: -4
Low-velocity weapon such as snub pistol: -2
Gauss weapon: -1
Handgun: -2
Assault Weapon: -4
Longarm: -6
Light Support Weapon: -8

A user can fully control any weapon whose Recoil is
equal to or lower than their Gun Combat skill. If the
Recoil of the weapon is higher than the user's skill level,
a negative DM is imposed equal to the difference. Thus
a Traveller with Gun Combat 1 shooting a standard
handgun doing 3D damage will have no problems
handling the weapon's Recoil 3 (from its 3D of damage),
-2 for the mass of the handgun. The weapon's Recoil 1
is equal to or less than the Traveller's Gun Combat skill.
If the Traveller converted this pistol to fully-automatic

fire with Auto 3, the weapon's Recoil would be (3+3-
2) = 4, imposing DM-3 on the Traveller's attempt to
hit anything with automatic fire. This stacks with any
penalty for a Bulky weapon – there are some people who
should not be given fully automatic shotguns!

RECEIVER FEATURES
Once the general characteristics of a weapon's receiver
are known, any special features can be added. Most
features are compatible with one another – for example
it is possible to make a weapon both Rugged and Light-
weight if you are willing to pay the price for the ad-
vanced materials. Multiple versions of the same feature
cannot be applied. For example, a weapon cannot be
both Compact and Very Compact.

**Functional Features**
Functional features improve or alter a weapon's function
without adding any new capabilities.

**Advanced Projectile Weapon:** At TL9 and higher, weapon
designers can use advanced technology to improve a
weapon's overall performance without affecting weight or
bulk – effectively wringing more out of the same weight
and volume of weapon. Advanced Projectile Weapons
cost 25% more than conventional projectile weapons
but weigh 10% less. They have a Physical Signature one
level lower, and range is 25% further.

**Accurised:** A weapon that is very carefully made to the
finest tolerances increases cost by 100% but gives
DM+1 when using aimed fire at ranges beyond 25m.
This is compatible with High Quality.

**Bullpup:** A Bullpup weapon has the ammunition feed
mechanism and breach behind the trigger mechanism
rather than in the usual position in front of the primary
handgrip. This allows a weapon to be shorter without
reducing barrel length, and transfers weight rearwards
which assists when it has to be brought quickly into ac-
tion. Bullpup configuration increases cost by 25% and
increases Quickdraw by +2. However, the location of the
ejection port, if the weapon has one, means that it must
be set up for a right- or left-handed shooter and cannot
be used in the wrong hand without flinging hot cartridge
cases at the user's head. A Bullpup weapon must have a
full stock, as the feed mechanism is contained within it.

**Compact:** A Compact receiver adds 25% to the cost of
the weapon and reduces mass by 10%. Base ammuni-
tion capacity is reduced by 25%.

Cooling System, Basic: Most weapons are air-cooled; that
is, they dissipate heat into the atmosphere or by radiat-
ing it if there is no air around them. A Basic Cooling
System takes heat away from the weapon by transferring
it to another medium. At lower Tech Levels this is typi-
cally a water jacket and is very bulky and clumsy. A Ba-
sic Cooling System increases weight by 100% and cost
by 10%. It removes 2 points of Heat from the weapon
each round whether it is fired or not. If water is used, it
can absorb 25 points of Heat per kg before boiling off.

Cooling System, Advanced: An Advanced Cooling System
replaces the traditional water jacket with a much smaller
web of pipes containing liquid with a high heat capac-
ity. This removes 5 points of Heat from the weapon
per round whether it is fired or not. The heat has to go
somewhere, however, and the system itself has a capac-
ity only of 25 points of Heat. However, it can be plugged
into a heat sink such as a 'chill can' (see page 127)
which can then be discarded when its capacity is used
up. Alternatively, a support cooling system can be used,
which is not portable but has a much higher capacity.
An Advanced Cooling System adds 20% to the weight of
a weapon's receiver and 50% to its cost.

Guidance System: Guidance Systems are only available
for weapons capable of launching missiles. Without one,
a missile launcher can only use 'dumb' unguided muni-
tions. A Guidance System interacts with the missile's
onboard electronics if they are present – it cannot guide
a 'dumb' weapon but can certainly launch one. A Guid-
ance System adds 50% to the cost of the launcher.

High Capacity: A High Capacity weapon is typically wider
to allow more ammunition to be carried in a magazine
without it projecting any more than a standard one. This
makes magazines incompatible with non-High Capac-
ity weapons even if they use the same calibre of am-
munition. High Capacity adds 20% to cost and 10%
to weight, and increases base ammunition capacity by
20%. For a standard handgun this means base capacity
is now 12. Actual capacity can be set at up to 150%
of this value, permitting handguns with an ammunition
capacity of up to 18 rounds to be created. High Capacity
is not compatible with Compact or Very Compact.

High Quality: A High Quality weapon is often finely
decorated as well as being very well made. High Qual-
ity starts at a 50% increase in the receiver cost, but
there is no upper limit on how much the final design can
cost. A High Quality 'working' weapon such as a sniper
rifle may look very ordinary, but grants DM+1 on attack
at ranges beyond 100m when using a scope or similar
sighting aid.

Increased Rate of Fire: Only weapons built on a burst-
capable or fully-automatic receiver can have their Auto
score increased. A burst-capable weapon with this
modification is still not capable of full-auto fire but can
take advantage of increased damage from an improved
Auto score. Burst-capable weapons start with Auto 2;
full-auto weapons start with Auto 3. In addition to get-
ting through a lot of ammunition, the weapon's cost
and weight increases with each point of Auto added. A
weapon whose Auto score is increased enough to add RF
or VRF capability bases the cost of that modification on
its inflated cost and weight.

Lightweight: Lightweight weapons are designed to be lighter
than usual, but this comes at a cost of being less durable
unless better materials are used. Lightweight reduces
weight by 20% and either increases cost by 50% or im-
poses the Hazardous (-1) trait. This increases the severity
of the Hazardous DM if it has been gained elsewhere.

Lightweight, Extreme: A weapon can be pared right down
to essentials, but this might make it flimsy. Extreme
Lightweight reduces weight by 40% but either impose the
Hazardous (-3) Trait or increases cost by 200%.

Low Quality: Low Quality weapons are cheap, but not usu-
ally all that badly made. Finishing may have some issues
such as burrs on metal or grips that do not quite fit as they
should but a Low Quality weapon will still shoot straight
and function reliably under most conditions. It may be
frustrating and annoying to maintain however. Low Qual-
ity reduces cost and imposes negative Traits, and can be
imposed by poor materials or other conditions beyond the
maker's control rather than being a choice to make the
weapon cheaper.

A weapon that has Deficiency points must satisfy them by
applying the Inaccurate, Unreliable, Ramshackle and/or
Hazardous traits. Each point of Inaccurate or Hazardous
satisfies one Deficiency point. Ramshackle satisfies 2, and

Increased Auto Rate
Auto Increase Cost Weight
+1 +10% +5%
+2 +25% +10%
+3 +50% +20%
+4 +100% +40%
+5 +200% +60%
+6 +300% +80%

**Degrees of Low Quality**

Reduction

Deficiency
Points
Low Quality -10% 1
Very Low Quality -20% 2
Extremely Low Quality -40% 3
Appalling Quality -60% 5
Piece of Junk -80% 8

Unreliable satisfies 3. Ramshackle effectively imposes a
point each of Inaccurate and Hazardous, which stack with
any points added from one or the other.

For example, a Traveller has bought the worst-made
handgun she could possibly have found and must apply
8 Deficiency points. She chooses Ramshackle (-1), Haz-
ardous (-3), and Unreliable (1). When it works this gun
is not that awful, merely shooting a little inaccurately as
a result of the Ramshackle DM. However, there is a 1 in
6 chance that the weapon will malfunction any time it is
used in combat. If it does malfunction, it imposes DM-4
(-3 from Hazardous and -1 from Ramshackle) on the
Malfunction table.

Quickdraw: A weapon can be optimized for rapid-response
situations, often to the exact specification of the user. A
Quickdraw weapon increases cost by 20% and grants an
additional Quickdraw +2 when being brought into ac-
tion. It also grants DM+1 to attack rolls when shooting at
ranges under 25m, and DM-1 beyond this range.

Recoil Compensation: Various devices are available to
help control the recoil of powerful weapons. Many rely
on diverting some of the propellant gases in a direction
that counters recoil, though other devices are available.
All rob the projectile of a little of its energy. A weapon's
Recoil score (see page 32) can be reduced by up to 2
at the cost of imposing +10% cost and +5% weight per
point. A point of Recoil Compensation reduces damage
by -1. Two points reduce damage by -3.

Rugged: Rugged weapons are designed to deal with
harsh conditions and general maltreatment. Firearms
are, as a rule, generally quite damage-resistant but a
Rugged weapon will withstand hazards a conventional
weapon will not, at least for a time. Examples include
mildly corrosive conditions, heat, cold and particularly
insidious grit or dust, as well as more conventional
hazards such as being driven over by a truck. Ruggedi-

sation adds 30% to the cost of the receiver and 10%
to weight. Rugged weapons gain DM+2 to rolls on the
Malfunction table.

**Very Compact:** A very compact receive adds 40% to the
cost of the weapon and reduces mass by 20%. Base am-
munition capacity is reduced by 50%.

**Capability Features**
These alter the weapon's capabilities, typically adding new
ones, or otherwise changing the nature of the weapon.

**Armored:** Weapons can be armored and hardened to
protect them against damage. This adds 10% to receiver
cost and 5% to its weight for every point of Protection.
Armor protects against knocks and bashes but not
internal malfunctions such as breach explosions.

**Bulwarked:** Bulwarked weapons have additional safety
features such as a strengthened breach to contain
ammunition explosions or fireproofed tanks on a
flamethrower. Bulwarking also represents additional
user-safety features such as additional catches, locks
and other impediments to an unintentional discharge.
Every point of Bulwarked provides DM+1 to rolls on the
Malfunction table. Bulwarking costs 20% of the receiver
cost and adds 10% to its weight per point.

**Disguised:** Disguised weapons look like something
else or are concealed inside an innocent item. This is
more than merely covering a submachinegun in shirts
and closing the suitcase – that costs nothing and is
not very effective. A disguised weapon nestles in a
concealed chamber within a suitcase, or is built into
a device which still functions normally. An example of
the latter might be a one-shot laser built into a func-
tional datapad. Disguising a weapon imposes a DM
ranging from -1 to -4 on attempts to detect, notice
or recognize it. Each -1 adds 50% to the cost of the
weapon. In addition, the cost of any device used to
disguise the weapon must be paid.

**Stealth, Basic:** Basic Stealth weapons are designed to
minimise the chance of detection by scanners or observ-
ers. Physical and Emissions Signatures are both reduced
by one level, and the weapon imposes DM-2 on attempts
to detect it using scanners, observation or a physical
search. A Basic Stealth weapon still looks like a gun,
but has as many of its moving parts operating internally
as possible and a minimum of projections to snag on
clothing when being deployed. Basic Stealth adds 50%
to the weapon's cost.

Stealth, Extreme: Extreme Stealth weapons are made
from exotic materials which are hard to detect with
conventional scanners; typically polymers and cultured
bone. Ammunition must also be made from similar
materials and use propellants with a different chemical
signature to standard. For this reason Extreme Stealth
weapons increase cost by 250%. Extreme Stealth am-
munition costs 20 times standard, though many Extreme
Stealth guns can fire standard ammunition, mainly for
practice purposes. If used in the field, standard ammu-
nition reduces the stealth benefits of this configuration.
Extreme Stealth weapons reduce Physical and Emissions
Signatures by three levels (two with standard ammu-
nition) and impose DM-6 on attempts to detect the
weapon by device, search or observation (DM-4 if using
standard ammunition). Most Extreme Stealth weapons
are handguns, known colloquially as 'body pistols', but
other weaponry is possible. A disassembled Extreme
Stealth rifle could be smuggled into a secure area with
relative ease, and even carried intact such a weapon
might evade detection by scans of the user's luggage.

Vacuum: Weapons intended for use in vacuum or a very
low pressure atmosphere require specialist lubricants
and slightly altered configuration to allow them to func-
tion. They usually include features such as an enlarged
trigger guard to allow use with vacc suit gloves. Many
standard snub pistols are not configured for vacuum
work; they are designed for low-gravity security opera-
tions within a vessel – but more expensive models tend
to include Vacuum modifications. Vacuum weapons can
function equally well in space or an atmosphere. The
modification increases receiver cost by 20%.

Projectile Weapon Ammunition
One big advantage of projectile weapons is the capability
to deliver a range of ammunition types. The standard
projectile used by most weapons is referred to as 'ball',
referring to the musket balls used by archaic weapons.
Unless a weapon is specifically designed for a specialist
type of ammunition, damage is given for ball ammunition.

Projectile firearms are available in a wide variety of
calibres, most of which are not interchangeable. There
is some standardization of calibres, but manufacturers

- especially those on different worlds – may use
differing standards. This can make getting the right
ammunition for an exotic weapon quite difficult.

It is the ammunition a weapon is built around, rather
than its configuration, which most strongly defines its
capabilities. Other characteristics such as barrel length
can be important but there is a limit to how much

performance can be modified by the weapon a given
cartridge is fired through. For this reason the base
range of a weapon is determined by its ammunition
type – rifle bullets go further and remain accurate at
longer distances than handgun rounds.

Ammunition costs are given in the Traveller Core
Rulebook as the price for a fully loaded magazine
or equivalent. When bought in larger quantities
ammunition generally works out a lot cheaper. The
price for ammunition is given here as the cost for a box
of 100 rounds and sufficient additional items – such as
batteries for a gauss weapon – to fire them.

Handgun Calibres
Handgun ammunition tends to be of a higher calibre
(i.e. the bullet has a greater diameter) than rifle-type
ammunition, but uses a shorter cartridge containing
less propellant. Most handguns use a calibre ranging
from around 6mm to 12mm, though larger and smaller
weapons are possible. Most submachineguns are
chambered for a handgun calibre round. Pistol-type
cartridges penetrate armor very poorly, though they
can be highly effective against unarmored targets.

Light Handguns are typically in the 6-8mm range. Base
Damage 2D. Cr60 per 100 rounds.
Medium Handguns are typically in the 9-10mm range.
Base Damage 3D-3. Cr75 per 100 rounds.
Heavy Handguns are typically in the 11-12mm range.
Base Damage 3D-1. Cr100 per 100 rounds.

•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and reduces receiver cost by
20%. Weight is reduced by 25%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's
base capacity by 20% and increases receiver
cost by 20%. Weight is reduced by 15%.
Heavy handguns gain the Bulky trait. Larger
weapons using heavy handgun ammunition are
Bulky unless they weigh more than 2kg or are
compensated in some manner.

Shotguns
Shotguns and other smoothbore weapons generally use a
short, fat cartridge not compatible with other weapons.
The standard ammunition type for smoothbores is
pellets rather than a single bullet, but most smoothbores
can deliver a range of ammunition types. Smoothbore
weapons have a base range of 100m with solid
ammunition. Using pellet ammunition reduces base
range to 25m.

Receivers set up for large-calibre smoothbore
ammunition may be handguns, assault weapons or
longarms, but are subject to additional considerations.
Large-calibre handguns cannot use any form of
detachable magazine – this would make the weapon
too wide to hold in the hand. Repeaters – in the form of
revolvers – or single shot weapons are possible. Assault
weapons using large-calibre smoothbore ammunition
are highly unusual but possible providing ammunition
feed is not through the handgrip. The commonest form
of receiver for large-calibre smoothbore ammunition is a
longarm, though it is of course possible to pair this with
a very short barrel.

Base ammunition capacity for any large-calibre
smoothbore weapon is 10 shells for a longarm, 6 for an
assault weapon and 4 for a handgun. Limitations for
mechanisms such as a repeater are disregarded, but a
weapon can be made compact or high-capacity which
will affect maximum ammunition capacity. Longarms
with a fixed magazine under the barrel are usually
limited by the length of the weapon, with a capacity of
4-8 shells being common.

Combat shotguns are typically chambered for a calibre
around 18-20mm in diameter, though they are usually
rated by a system of 'gauges' based on the mass of a
lead ball the diameter of the weapon's bore. The lower
the gauge number, the more powerful the smoothbore
weapon. Smoothbore weapons possess the Inaccurate
trait to some degree and may perform poorly against
armor whether firing a solid slug or a charge of pellets.

**Small Smoothbores** are typically in the 10-12mm range.

**Light Smoothbores** are typically in the 14-16mm range.
Base Damage 4D-4. Cr125 per 100 rounds

•  Small ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 40% and reduces weight by 40%.
•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and reduces weight by 20%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and increases weight by 20%.

Smoothbores are relatively low-velocity weapons and
begin with Penetration -1. This can be altered by using
specialist ammunition or design choices.

Recoil tends to be a problem when using large-calibre
ammunition of this sort. This is represented by the
Bulky and Very Bulky traits alongside the recoil rules
in this book (see page 32). The Recoil Effects table
indicates what level of Bulky is imposed by various
ammunition types in different receivers. Some are
heavy enough to absorb the recoil and do not have
Bulky but remain subject to the usual recoil rules if
they are in use. Some weapons simply cannot handle
large-calibre ammunition.

Smoothbores are cheaper to produce than rifles and similar
projectile weapons, reducing receiver cost by 25%.

**Rifle Calibres**
Rifles and rifle-type weapons range considerably
in calibre. They typically use a long cartridge and
relatively small bullet to produce high muzzle velocity.
This translates into accuracy and penetration. Assault
rifles are typically chambered for an intermediate
cartridge of around 5-6mm calibre, with heavier 'battle'
rifles using a 7-8mm cartridge. Due to the trade-off
between velocity and bullet mass it is possible to
obtain similar performance with a large, slow bullet or
a small fast one, so chamberings vary. Most sniping
weapons are in the battle-rifle calibre range, but some
use a heavier cartridge of up to 10mm or so calibre.

Anti-materiel rifles, anti-tank rifles and similar
weapons designed to attack objects rather than people
may use larger calibres. Typically these are in the 12-
15mm range. Heavy anti-materiel weapons in the 18-
20mm range have a higher base damage. Conversely,
very light rifle calibres do exist, mostly for 'plinking'
or hunting small game.

Light Rifle calibres range from 4-5mm. Base Damage
2D. Cr40 per 100 rounds.
Intermediate Rifle calibres range from 5-6mm. Base
Damage 3D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Battle Rifle calibres range from 7-9mm. Base Damage
3D+3. Cr100 per 100 rounds.
Heavy Rifle calibres range from 10-11mm. Base
Damage 4D. Cr250 per 100 rounds.
Anti-Materiel Rifle calibres range from 12-15mm. Base
Damage 5D. Cr1500 per 100 rounds. Anti-materiel
weapons gain the Bulky trait.
Heavy Anti-Materiel Rifles calibres range from 18-
20mm. Base Damage 6D. Cr3000 per 100 rounds.
Heavy anti-materiel weapons gain the Very Bulky trait.

•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's
base capacity by 20% and decreases weight
by 40%.
•  Intermediate calibre ammunition decreases
receiver weight by 20%.
•  Battle calibre ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 20%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's
base capacity by 40% and increases receiver
cost by 25%. Weight is increased by 10%.
•  Anti-materiel ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 60% and increases
receiver cost by 150%. Weight is increased
by 50%. It requires a light support weapon
receiver at minimum.
•  Heavy anti-materiel ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 80% and increases
receiver cost by 250%. Weight is increased by
100%. It requires a support weapon receiver
at minimum.

OTHER PROJECTILE

WEAPONS
Other ways of sending a projectile downrange exist.
Some rely on similar mechanisms to conventional
firearms but are suited to a particular role or
environment. Others use entirely different ways to get
their projectile moving, such as magnetic acceleration,
but ultimately all these weapons rely on hurling a
relatively small object with a great deal of kinetic energy.

Archaic Weapons
Archaic weapons such as black powder muskets and
pistols are considered to be conventional firearms
even if they use a different sort of initiation such as
a flintlock or wheel-lock mechanism. Archaic firearms
shoot a large-calibre ball or bullet, propelled by loose
powder. Most such weapons are muzzle-loaders. A

typical black powder pistol uses a 14-15mm diameter
ball; a musket typically has a calibre of 17-18mm.
These weapons are smoothbores. Black powder
rifles typically use a 15-16mm bullet and achieve a
higher muzzle velocity at the price of slower loading.
However, damage is much the same due to the trade-
off between weight and velocity.

Black Powder pistols have base Damage 2D-3. Cr10
per 100 rounds.
Black Powder muskets and rifles have base Damage
3D-3. Cr25 per 100 rounds.

All black powder and similar weapons have the
Slow Loader trait, typically with a score of 8 for
smoothbore longarms and 12 for rifled weapons. All
such weapons have Physical Signature (very high),
which cannot be reduced by design or accessories.
Most have Inaccurate and Unreliable.

Archaic weapons typically have a very short effective
range as their projectiles are not aerodynamic and
start with a low muzzle velocity. Range for an archaic
weapon is based on half the range of the equivalent
conventional weapon, down to a minimum of 5m.

Archaic weapons have a very low muzzle velocity and
begin with Penetration -2.

Low-Recoil Weapons
More commonly known as 'snub' weapons, low-
recoil special-purpose weaponry is a family of large-
calibre, low-velocity weapons designed for use in
low gravity. The use of a relatively heavy but low-

velocity projectile produces reasonable stopping
power without generating heavy recoil. This gives the
weapon the Zero-G trait, along with Inaccurate (-2).

Snub Weapons are typically chambered for a short
10mm cartridge not compatible with other weapons.
Base Damage 3D-3. Cr200 per 100 rounds.

They usually perform poorly against armor and other
hard surfaces, but specialist ammunition can offset this
though may cause the weapon to lose the Zero-G trait.

Snub Weapons are relatively low-velocity weapons and
begin with Penetration -1. This can be altered by using
specialist ammunition or various design choices.

Rocket Projectiles
Some weapons use rocket projectiles rather than
conventional bullets. These have the advantage of
producing very little recoil but are ineffective at short
ranges until the projectile gains velocity. A rocket
projectile weapon does the same damage as its
conventional equivalent, but is counted as a Zero-G
weapon. Rocket projectiles do only 1D of damage
if they strike a target within 10m. They tend to be
inaccurate, but not excessively so.

Rocket projectiles cost twice as much as conventional
firearm ammunition of the same calibre. Weapons
that use them possess the Zero-G trait. The pressures
experienced by 'accelerator' weapons – those that use
rocket-propelled projectiles – are low compared to
conventional firearms. Weapons can be more lightly
built, halving receiver and barrel weight. Costs
remain unchanged.

- Values assume the smoothbore weapon is firing a solid projectile such as a musket ball or rifled slug from a combat
shotgun. Pellet ammunition changes the weapon's characteristics. Ranges are given for solid and pellet ammunition.

These projectiles can attain high velocities if they
travel far enough, and range is not limited by barrel
length. They begin with Penetration 0, which can be
altered by specialist ammunition or design choices.
Accuracy is also poorer than conventional firearms;
accelerator weapons have the Inaccurate trait, usually
with a score of -1.

Gauss Weapons
Gauss projectiles are typically smaller than conventional
bullets but achieve a higher muzzle velocity due
to electromagnetic acceleration. A standard gauss
weapon typically uses needles with a calibre of
4mm. Performance is a little better than a standard
projectile firearm in the class; a gauss pistol typically
does 3D damage and a gauss rifle does 4D damage.
Gauss weapons become available at TL12, though the
projectiles can be manufactured at lower TLs.

For simplicity, it is assumed that gauss weapons have
a battery in the magazine which supplies the power
necessary to accelerate the rounds contained within.
Acceleration takes place within the receiver, over a very
short distance, with the barrel serving mainly to guide and
stabilize the round.

Standard Gauss propulsion units suitable for use in
a longarm become available at TL12 and have base
Damage 4D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Small Gauss propulsion units suitable for a handgun
become available at TL13 have base Damage 3D. Cr50
per 100 rounds.
Enhanced Gauss propulsion units become available at
TL14 and have base Damage 5D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Gauss Shotguns hold the same amount of projectiles
as an equivalent gauss weapon, but they are packed
into bundles of 16-24 depending on the weapon type.
Ammunition capacity is effectively reduced by 75%.
Gauss shotguns use small gauss ammunition but deliver
+2 damage per dice; typically this is 3D+6.

Gauss weapons have an intrinsic armor-piercing
capability due to their high muzzle velocity. This gives
them base Penetration +2. Gauss propulsion doubles the
cost of a weapon and increases weight by 25%. Due to
the method of propulsion used in gauss weapons, damage
is not reduced by short barrels in the manner of high-
velocity projectile weaponry.

solid projectile such as a musket ball or rifled slug from
a combat shotgun. Pellet ammunition changes the
weapon's characteristics. Ranges are given for solid and
pellet ammunition.

SECONDARY

WEAPONS
A secondary weapon can be fitted, usually under the
barrel. Most commonly this is a grenade launcher or
shotgun, but other configurations are possible. A sec-
ondary weapon mounting costs and weighs 10% of the
secondary weapon's values. There is no need to provide
a stock for a secondary weapon but it must have a bar-
rel, receiver and any furniture the designer requires. A
secondary weapon is separate from the primary, and is
used independently; a Traveller can fire their assault rifle
or the shotgun mounted under it, but not both at the
same time unless a complex joint-triggering mechanism
has been contrived.

Multi-Barrel Weapons
A weapon can have multiple barrels, which can be
achieved in different ways. For this reason multi-
barrel configuration is not always considered a receiver
feature. A multi-barrel configuration can either be
complete or partial. Complete barrels include a breach,
and sometimes a firing mechanism as well. If so, all
barrels can be discharged simultaneously at the same
target or fired independently. This is commonest with
double-barrelled shotguns and similar weapons. Barrels
of a complete multi-barrel weapon do not have to be
matched – for example a hunting weapon might have
a shotgun barrel and a rifle barrel, allowing the user to
deal with whatever breaks cover. Alternatively, a combat
handgun might have a separate barrel with a one-shot
flashbang discharger underneath the main muzzle, for a
non-lethal but very authoritative warning shot.

A complete multi-barrel weapon adds 10% to the cost
and weight of the receiver per extra barrel. Each barrel is
bought for its normal cost but each barrel after the first
adds only half its normal weight. Each additional barrel
reduces Quickdraw by -1.

Partial multi-barrel weapons have a firing chamber for
each barrel but share a firing mechanism. This may
be aligned with each barrel in turn, for example with
a rotating firing pin, or the barrels may be aligned
in turn in the manner of a 'pepperbox' pistol. This
configuration is unusual but used in a few specialist
weapons. Partial multi-barrel configuration does not
add to the cost and weight of the receiver, but each
additional barrel must be purchased.

Rotary Weapons and Multi-Mounts
Rotary weapons have multiple barrels which rotate in
turn to align with the firing chamber. This allows a
high rate of fire to be maintained as each barrel has
a chance to cool whilst another is firing. Mechanical

rotary weapons, such as a gatling gun, can be used to
create a rather crude equivalent of a machinegun. A
mechanical rotary weapon begins with a nominal Auto
1, which can be increased to a maximum of half the
number of barrels on the weapon. Thus a 6-barrelled
gatling gun can deliver the equivalent of Auto 3 with
some vigorous cranking.

A multi-barrel weapon combined with a powered feed
system allows an automatic, RF or VRF weapon to
dissipate heat whilst it is firing. Each barrel after the
first removes one point of Heat from the weapon per
round, whether it is firing or not.

An alternative way to deliver increased firepower is to
create an 'organ gun' with multiple complete weapons
mounted together. At low Tech Levels these are often
slow-loading weapons, creating a powerful one-shot
effect. An 'organ gun' – as these weapons are called –
is considered to have Auto 1 for every full four barrels
firing simultaneously, so a 12-barrel organ gun made
out of primitive muskets delivers an Auto 3 attack
when fired but then requires considerable time for
reloading. More advanced weapons mounted in this
manner can make such an attack every round if they
reload quickly enough. This is bulky and inefficient,
but sometimes useful. If the weapons mounted in this
manner are capable of automatic fire, their collective
effect is to increase their Auto score by +1 for every
additional weapon; a triple-mounting of Auto 3
machineguns can be treated as a single weapon with
Auto 5.

Multi-mounted weapons with a high Auto may be
treated as RF or VRF weapons. A twin-mounted
weapon with Auto 4+ can be considered a single RF
weapon. Each additional weapon beyond two adds
+1 to the Auto score, so a quad mount of Auto 4
machineguns can be considered an RF weapon with
Auto 6. Likewise, twin-mounted weapons with Auto
6+ can be considered a VRF weapon, and adding
more weapons on the same mount adds +1 to Auto for
each weapon after the second.

**Weapon-Mounted Launchers**
Some launcher systems are essentially secondary
weapons fitted to a primary. As with other secondary
weapons the fittings cost 10% of the cost and weight
of the launcher, which must be designed separately
from the primary weapon. Design notes for grenade
launchers and similar weapons are found on page 53.

Other launchers are more basic. An under-barrel rail
can be used to launch a one-shot rocket propelled
grenade, or one can be fitted onto a muzzle
discharger. The disadvantage of the latter is that the

primary weapon cannot be used with the grenade in
position. Cup dischargers for conventional grenades
are also occasionally used, but these require the use
of a blank rifle cartridge to propel the grenade, and
again prevent the primary weapon from being fired
when a grenade is in place.

An under-barrel rail weighs 0.1kg and costs Cr100. It
does not affect Quickdraw unless a grenade is in place,
in which case it imposes a penalty of -3.

A muzzle discharger weighs 0.05kg and costs Cr75. It
does not affect Quickdraw unless a grenade is in place,
in which case it imposes a penalty of -3 and the first
shot must be made with the grenade. Rocket-propelled
grenades can be used to make a direct attack so can be
effective Quickdraw weapons.

A cup discharger weighs 0.15kg and costs Cr50. It
imposes a -2 penalty on Quickdraw, increased to -4 if
a grenade is in place, and the grenade must be used
for the initial shot. Since this is inevitably an indirect
attack, the chances of success are minimal. However,
it may matter whether or not a grenade was delivered
before the user was shot.

AMMUNITION

CAPACITY
As already noted, the base ammunition capacity for a
weapon indicates a standard magazine or feed device
size. It is determined by the ammunition type and any
features the receiver might have, such as being a High
Capacity weapon. Actual ammunition capacity for the
weapon can be set at any amount up to 150% of the
base value. There are advantages to reducing ammuni-
tion capacity, in terms of saved weight and cost, though
it is quite rare to take capacity below 50% of base.

The capacity of the weapon determines how many
rounds are carried in a standard magazine, which fits
into the weapon without sticking out to an awkward
degree. Extended magazines can be created of course,
but these tend to be clumsy. Any increase over 150%
requires such a device.

•  Each 10% increase in ammunition capacity
adds 5% to the weight of a loaded weapon and
10% to the cost of the receiver.

•  Each 10% reduction in ammunition capacity
reduces loaded weight by 5% and reduces the
receiver cost by 5%.

BARREL FEATURES
As a general rule, a longer barrel translates to higher
muzzle velocity and therefore longer range with greater
accuracy at a distance. This generally also correlates
for energy weapons such as lasers and plasma guns. A
barrel of standard length is assumed within the weight
and cost of the receiver. Performance (in terms of range
and damage) with such a barrel is as noted for the
ammunition type.

There is a limit to how long a barrel can be added to a
given weapon before it becomes ridiculous. A carbine-type
barrel could be added to a handgun receiver to create
a pistol-calibre carbine – such weapons have existed
historically – but a weapon of this sort is as awkward to
carry as an actual carbine, and less effective.

The effect a given length of barrel has on muzzle velocity
(and thus range, accuracy and damage) depends on the
ammunition type. Relatively low-velocity rounds (handgun,
snub weapon and smoothbore ammunition) require less
barrel length to reach maximum velocity and do not benefit
from a very long barrel. Conversely, high velocity rounds
lose much of their effectiveness if not fired from a barrel
of suitable length. For high-velocity ammunition – this
typically means rifle calibres – damage is reduced by
one dice for a Minimal, Short or Handgun barrel. This is
applied before other damage-based effects are considered.

Minimal: A Minimal barrel barely extends past the end
of the firing chamber. All damage dice are converted to
D3s; e.g., a standard rifle calibre weapon with a Minimal
barrel reduces damage from 3D to 3D3. A weapon with a
Minimal barrel grants the user DM+8 during a Quickdraw.
Effective range for all weapons with a Minimal barrel is
reduced to 5m, and effects that rely on high-velocity, such
as non-explosive armor-piercing effects, are annulled.
A Minimal barrel has negligible weight and cost, but
increases Physical Signature by two levels when the
weapon is fired and reduces Penetration by -2.

Short: A Short barrel is typically used on handguns
intended for concealed carry. Effective range is reduced
by 90% and non-explosive armor piercing effects are
lost. A Short barrel weighs and costs 10% of receiver
values. A weapon with a Short barrel grants the user
DM+6 during a Quickdraw. A Short barrel increases
Physical Signature by one level when the weapon is fired
and reduces Penetration by -1.

Running out of Dice
Some modifications reduce the number of dice
damage a weapon delivers. If a weapon has only
1D left and must reduce by one dice, damage
drops to D3. Another nominal 1D reduction takes
damage down to 1 point, and the next reduction
drops damage to zero.

Handgun: A standard Handgun barrel reduces range by
80% for all ammunition types except rocket projectiles. A
Handgun barrel costs 15% of receiver price and weight is
20%. High-velocity weapons such as rifles using a Hand-
gun barrel also reduce damage by one dice. A Handgun
barrel grants the user DM+4 during a Quickdraw. A Hand-
gun barrel reduces Penetration by -1.

Assault: An Assault barrel is typically found on subma-
chineguns or short combat shotguns. Cost for an Assault
barrel is 20% of base receiver cost, and the barrel is 30%
of base receiver weight. High-velocity weapons such as
rifles using an Assault barrel reduce damage by one dice.
Thus a rifle normally doing 3D+3 damage which has been
fitted with an Assault barrel, reduces damage to 2D+3.
Base range is reduced by 50%. A weapon with an Assault
barrel grants the user DM+2 during a Quickdraw.

Carbine: The definition of a carbine is rather vague, with
general connotations of a short, light longarm. A rifle-type
weapon using a Carbine barrel must reduce damage by
1 point per two full dice of base damage. Base range is
reduced by 10%. A Carbine barrel costs 25% of receiver
price and adds 40% weight.

Rifle: A standard Rifle barrel produces normal performance
for all weapons. Cost is 30% of receiver price, and the bar-
rel adds 50% of receiver weight to the weapon.

Long: A Long barrel adds 75% to receiver weight and 50%
to cost. Range for high-velocity weapons is increased by
10%. Additionally, a Long barrel reduces the negative DM
for range by one if the firer is using a scope.

Very Long: A Very Long barrel adds 100% to receiver
weight and 100% to cost. Range for high-velocity weap-
ons is increased by 25%. Additionally, a Very Long barrel
reduces the negative DM for range by two if the firer is
using a scope.

**Heavy Barrel:** A Heavy barrel dissipates heat better than a
standard one. This is important when undertaking sus-
tained fire, as heat build-up can damage a weapon or
cause a malfunction. A Heavy barrel doubles the number
of rounds in which sustained fire can be maintained before
malfunctions become possible. Any barrel length can be
specified as Heavy, doubling its weight and price. A Heavy
barrel reduces Quickdraw by -1.

FURNITURE
The term furniture refers to parts of a weapon such as
its stock, grips and the like. Typically longarms have a
fixed solid stock, assault weapons tend to have a light-
weight stock which may or may not fold, and handguns
do not have one at all. Details like whether the foregrip
on a rifle is vertical or a traditional forearm are up to the
designer and do not affect cost or weight.

**Stockless:** A weapon with no stock at all cannot be fired
from the shoulder and is difficult to steady. Aimed fire
at ranges beyond 25m is subject to DM-2. A Stockless
weapon may have a mounting for a stock, at negligible
cost and weight, in which case it is covered by a butt
cap until a stock of some kind is mounted. A Stockless
longarm or assault weapon gains +2 to Quickdraw.

**Folding Stock:** A folding or telescoping stock reduces
weight at the cost of being less effective. When de-
ployed, a Folding Stock allows aimed fire at ranges
beyond 25m with DM-1. When the stock is not deployed
the weapon counts as Stockless. A Folding Stock adds
5% to the weight and 15% to the cost of the weapon.

Full Stock: A Full Stock is standard on most longarms and
can be added to a handgun to create a carbine of sorts.
Usually such stocks are detachable. A Full Stock adds
10% to the weight and 10% of the cost of the weapon.

Modularization: Any weapon can have one component
that can be detached at no cost or weight, such as a
detachable stock on a combat shotgun. Full Modularisa-
tion allows multiple parts to be swapped around quickly
and easily with only basic tools. For example, a Traveller
expecting close combat might remove the barrel and
stock of their rifle, swapping the barrel for an assault-
length one. Modularization adds 10% to the weight and
20% to the cost of the weapon.

Bipod: Any weapon with a rifle-length or longer barrel
can be fitted with a Bipod. This takes one significant
action to deploy and position the weapon, after which
it grants DM+1 to attack rolls at ranges beyond 50m.
A Bipod reduces Quickdraw by -4 unless the weapon is
already on target. Bipods cost 10% of receiver price and
add 20% of receiver weight to the weapon. A detachable
Bipod has all these characteristics but costs 15% of
receiver price.

Support Mount: Any weapon can have a Support Mount
rather than a stock. A Support Mount usually takes the
form of a tripod but could have other configurations.
Support Mounts typically use the same attachment
system as many vehicle mountings, allowing a weapon
to be dismounted from a vehicle and set up on a tripod
if necessary. A Support Mount weighs as much as the
receiver of the weapon and costs 25% of its price.

Small weapons such as handguns and shotguns can be
placed on a Support Mount for remote-controlled firing
or as booby traps. This makes the weapon unusable in
normal combat.

Improvised Support Weapons
Most longarm-type weapons can be fitted to
a pintle mount for support work, and indeed
the majority of pintle mounts have a universal
attachment that can take almost any weapon.
An assault rifle fed from a drum magazine could
make a useful improvised support weapon, but
not for long. Sustained fire will overheat the
weapon and there is no provision for a quick
barrel change. Weaponry intended for sustained
fire requires either a cooling system or the ability
to swap barrels in a matter of moments.

ACCESSORIES
Accessories can usually be swapped around at will.
For example, a Traveller might carry their Personal
Defence Weapon with a convenient 12-round magazine
inserted, allowing it to be worn in a holster, but have
a pair of 35-round combat magazines available to be
swapped in once the weapon is deployed. Most other
accessory-swapping actions can be as convenient as
reloading, providing the item is intended for quick
release. Some accessories, such as powerful scopes,
cannot be mounted this way as they require very precise
calibration. Such accessories require a workshop to be
removed or added, though the process is usually simple.

Suppressors
It is not normally possible to make a firearm silent,
but various mechanisms are available to reduce the
signature of the weapon to the point where it might

not be noticed, or may not be recognized as a gunshot.
Whatever the specifics of their operation these
accessories are referred to as suppressors.

Suppressor, Basic: A basic suppressor reduces weapon
flash and noise a little without greatly affecting its
performance. A basic suppressor reduces Quickdraw
by -2 and Physical Signature by one level. It costs
50% of the weapon's receiver price. A basic suppressor
imposes Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective range by
25%. A basic suppressor adds 0.2kg to the weight of
the weapon.

Suppressor: A standard suppressor can be quite bulky
and heavy. It reduces Quickdraw by -3 and Physical
Signature by 2 levels. A suppressor costs 100% of the
weapon's receiver price. A standard suppressor imposes
Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective range by 50%. It
also reduces Penetration by -1. A standard suppressor
adds 0.3kg to the weight of the weapon.

Suppressor, Extreme: An extreme suppressor is a heavy
item, adding significantly to the weapon's front-end
weight and overall length. Quickdraw is reduced by
-4 and Physical Signature by 3 levels. An extreme
suppressor imposes Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective
range by 75%. Penetration is reduced by -2 as the
suppressor reduces muzzle velocity significantly. An
extreme suppressor costs 200% of the weapon's receiver
price. An extreme suppressor adds 0.5kg to the weight
of the weapon.

Ammunition Feed Devices
Ammunition is used quickly in a firefight, and there is a
limit to how much can be carried. A typical loadout for
a combat soldier is one magazine in their weapon and
six more carried in pouches. Those not carrying much
else might increase this loadout, but when combined
with all the other gear a typical infantry soldier must lug
about there is not much capacity for more. A Certain
Kind Of Traveller might write down on their sheet they
are carrying 800 magazines for their gauss rifle, but it is
not physically possible to carry much more than a dozen
ordinary magazines. Their bulk must be considered
along with weight.

A magazine-fed weapon will come with a modest amount
of feed devices; belt-fed weapons will have a supply
of links, and so forth. Mercenaries do not, as a rule,
go to the gun shop and buy a few loaded magazines.
They typically purchase ammunition in crates and
load up magazines, belts and other feed devices as
needed. Thus the 'magazine' costs found in the Traveller
Core Rulebook and Central Supply Catalogue do not

generally apply to mercenaries. Even when buying in
small quantities, military units do not procure their
ammunition like a bunch of yahoos in town waiting for
their free trader to be unloaded.

As a general rule, magazines and feed devices can be
bought individually at the prices shown, or in a pack of 6
with a 10% discount. Crates generally hold 100 or more
magazines, and typically bought at a discount of around
30% plus whatever the unit's procurement officer can
bargain for. This does not include ammunition.

**Fixed Magazines:** Fixed magazines are part of the weapon
and, by definition, cannot be detached. They make
the weapon slower to load; instead of taking one minor
action to change a magazine, the user must usually feed
ammunition in one round at a time. Each minor action
allows the user to get D3 rounds into the weapon, and
in many cases it can be fired as soon as there is any
ammunition at all. If using a reload-assistance device
such as a stripper clip, en-bloc clip or speedloader,
2 minor actions are sufficient to place the contents
of the loading device into the weapon. Such devices
typically cost 1% of the weapon's purchase price. A
fixed magazine reduces cost and weight of the receiver
by 10%.

**Standard Magazines:** A weapon is supplied with a
reasonable amount of magazines or other feed devices,
usually 2-4 for most weapons. A military unit might
need more than this, and will typically purchase
significant quantities at a time. A standard magazine
holds whatever the ammunition capacity of the weapon
has been determined to be, and does so without being
unduly clumsy. If bought singly it will typically cost 1%
of the weapon's purchase price.

**Extended Magazines:** These are available for most weap-
ons that use a detachable 'box' magazine. They may be
longer, wider or use a 'casket' configuration. An extend-
ed magazine can hold up to 50% more ammunition than
standard, but sticks out of the weapon to a considerable
degree. Extended magazines impose DM-2 during a
Quickdraw. An extended magazine costs twice the price
of a standard one.

**Drum Magazines:** Drum magazines can hold up to 2.5
times the ammunition of a standard magazine. They
are, however, bulky and often noisy when carried. Drums
make the weapon unwieldy and difficult to aim, and
even at high Tech Levels they are prone to jam, imposing
the Inaccurate (-1) and Hazardous (-1) traits. They also
impose DM-6 during a Quickdraw; a fixed drum maga-
zine, as used in some shotguns and grenade launchers,
does not suffer from this problem but must be manually

reloaded in place. Drum magazines cost five times as
much as standard ones. A fixed (or 'semi-internal') drum
costs 5% of the weapon's receiver cost.

Belts: A belt can in theory hold as much ammunition
as the user wants, and a loader can keep adding belt
segments whilst the gunner is firing. This is not much
of a problem when the weapon is emplaced or mounted,
and imposes no penalty. However, a belt-fed weapon
can be difficult to use on the move unless some kind of
belt-holder and guide is available. All belt-fed weapons
suffer from the Inaccurate (-1) trait due to the motion of
the belt. An additional DM-2 applies when firing on the
move unless a suitable belt-holder is in place. Belts also
impose DM-8 during a Quickdraw.

Clips, Speedloaders and Cassettes: A variety of devices
are available to get ammunition into a weapon with a
fixed magazine quickly. In some cases this requires
physical transfer of the ammunition either all at once
in the manner of a speedloader for a revolver or in
rapid succession in the manner of a stripper clip. Such
devices cost around Cr5 and hold enough ammunition to
reload the weapon once. Some weapons use pre-packed
ammunition in which the feed device is no more than
a lightweight container which is discarded once empty.
Such a device costs Cr10 plus the price of the ammu-
nition inside. In some cases, ammunition cassettes of
this type are shipped directly from the factory in loaded
condition and cannot be reloaded outside the supplier's
own facilities. This practice is generally disliked by mer-
cenaries as it ties them to the manufacture's prices and
can cause problems if ammunition runs short.

The weight of a loaded feed device is included in the
weight given for all weapons. Additional magazines,
speedloaders, stripper clips and the like typically
weigh around 0.15kg for handguns and 0.5kg for
intermediate-calibre rifles. A 50-round length of
ammunition belt for a support weapon firing Battle
Rifle calibre ammunition typically weighs 1.5kg. It is
not always necessary to calculate the precise weight of
ammunition carried, but if the Travellers are trying to
get away with carrying thousands of rounds they should
be required to account for it.

Sighting Devices
Weapons almost always come with built-in iron sights;
typically this a simple front blade and rear notch type,
adjustable for range. At TL6 and above, it is usual
for military weapons to have a basic optical sight as
standard. This may have low magnification to assist in
aiming and is typical of the 'red dot' reflex type. These
sights are rugged enough to survive being run over by a

truck – if the rifle still works so will its sight. A reflex or
basic combat sight comes as standard on most military
longarms, and does not add cost or weight. It provides
a flat DM+1 on aimed or snap shooting but a positive
Quickdraw is halved if the firer takes time to align
even such a simple sight. For this reason many 'point
soldier' and close-quarters weapons are not fitted with
optical sights.

Mounting any type of scope (but not a laser pointer) on
a weapon imposes an additional -2 on its Quickdraw.

Scope: A typical optical scope offers variable
magnification of 1.5x, 2.5x and 4x, allowing personnel
to engage in precision fire out to considerable ranges. A
scope of this type costs Cr50 and weighs 0.2kg. It gives
the weapon the Scope trait.

Long-Range Scope: Long-range scopes are available with
optical magnification up to 50x, though this is rare since
most personnel cannot shoot accurately at such ranges.
A long-range scope costs Cr500 and weighs 0.5kg.
It gives the weapon the Scope trait and reduces any
negative DM for range by -2.

Low-Light Scope: A low-light scope negates the effects of
near-complete darkness, though it needs at least a little
light to function and cannot see through smoke or other
obscurants. A low-light scope is normally combined
with a standard scope into one unit, though sometimes
it may be configured as a standalone unit. In either
configuration it costs Cr150 and weighs 0.4kg.

Thermal Scope: A thermal scope can detect heat, so
can function in complete darkness or pick out well
camouflaged targets. It does not provide any positive
DM to hit, but grants DM+4 to Recon checks to spot
concealed targets, locate the source of a shot, and so
forth. They do not allow Travellers to see through walls.

Thermal scopes are usually combined with a standard
scope in a switchable configuration. It costs Cr250 and
weighs 0.25kg.

Combination Scope: At the cost of some bulk a
combination scope offers the benefits of standard, low-
light and thermal scopes. This device costs Cr400 and
weights 0.5kg.

Multispectral Scope: A more advanced version of
the combination scope uses a wider segment of the
electromagnetic spectrum and offers enhanced image
processing to assist target identification. A multispectral
scope offers DM+6 to Recon checks to spot targets and
DM+1 to attack rolls at all ranges, in addition to the
Scope trait. It costs Cr600 and weighs 0.5kg.

Laser Pointer: A laser pointer grants DM+1 to attack rolls
at ranges out to 50m. Despite some slight bulk and a
typical weight of 0.1kg, it does not affect Quickdraw
when in use. A laser pointer costs Cr200.

Integrated Sighting System: An integrated sighting
system (ISS) takes information on sensors mounted
on a weapon and projects them on to goggles or a
visor. The output can be adjusted by the user to a
range of preferences, or can auto-regulate in order to
penetrate smoke, see in the dark, and filter out bright
flashes whilst operating in low-light mode. An ISS
costs Cr500 for a set of sensors on the weapon and a
display device, and offers all benefits of a multispectral
scope even when the weapon is being hip-fired. Typical
weight is 0.4kg.

Holographic Sights: A holographic sight replaces physical
optics, using a sensor on the barrel of the weapon and
displaying what is effectively a holographic scope, aim
point or other sighting device. Mode and magnification
are usually controlled by pre-set buttons, sliders or

vernier dials in a convenient location on the weapon. A
holographic sight can also take data from other sources
in the same manner as an ISS. The device costs Cr750
but is of negligible weight.

OTHER ACCESSORIES
A variety of miscellaneous accessories are available for
most weapons. Some are more useful than others.

**Bayonet Lug:** Military longarms are assumed to have a
bayonet attachment as standard, but it is possible to
convert any pistol, shotgun, carbine or rifle weapon
to carry a bayonet. Most such conversions are clumsy
and difficult to shoot or fight with, however. A bayonet
lug, whether improvised in a workshop or fitted to the
weapon, adds no weight and is of negligible cost. Once
the bayonet is fitted it imposes DM-2 to Quickdraw
unless the attack is being made with the bayonet itself.

**Bling:** Weapons can be decorated, gilded or festooned
with fairy lights if the user really wants. Some owners
may wish to impress or intimidate with their weapons;
others just like to show off. Professional mercenaries
generally prefer to camouflage any weapon they take
into the field, though there is perhaps some value in
a gold-plated autopistol used to intimidate potential
hostiles. Any amount of bling can be added, though
objects swinging about on little chains dangling from
a weapon will make accurate shooting difficult and
a shiny or brightly coloured weapon may give away a
position. The referee should let Travellers spend as
much as they like on bling, but it will cause problems
in the field – not least of which is the ridicule of more
professional soldiers.

**Flashlight:** A high-powered flashlight can be fitted under
the barrel of most weapons. Cost is typically Cr50 for a
sturdy example with good battery life. A flashlight adds
front-end weight and reduces Quickdraw by -2.

**Gravitic Support:** From TL12 upwards, gravitic support
is available. This reduces a Very Bulky weapon to Bulky
and eliminates the Bulky trait entirely. A gravitic support
unit weighs 3x the weight of the weapon's receiver when
switched off, but effectively eliminates the weapon's
weight when activated. Gravitic support costs Cr2500
per kg of the weapon.

**Gun Camera:** From TL6 upwards a small camera can be
fitted to a longarm or assault weapon, with examples
small enough to fit on almost any weapon available from
TL8. TL6-7 cameras can be a little bulky and reduce
Quickdraw by -2. TL8+ examples may be integrated with
sights or kept separate, often carried on a rail under the
barrel. These are light enough not to affect Quickdraw.
All versions cost Cr75.

Intelligent Weapon: At TL11, a small processor located
somewhere in the weapon effectively adds a Computer/0
for a cost of Cr1000. At TL13, Computer/1 is available
for Cr5000.

Secure Weapon: Available from TL10 upwards, a
secure weapon requires some form of authentication
before it will function. This may be a DNA check, radio
signal, voice command or almost any other form of
authorization. Adding a security check costs Cr100 and
does not add any weight.

Stabilization: From TL9 upward, weapons can be
gyrostabilized. A gyrostabilizer weighs 20% of
the weapon's receiver weight and costs Cr300. A
gyrostabilizer offsets an aiming DM up to -2 caused by
movement or a poorly balanced weapon. This means
it is possible to conduct aimed fire whilst moving,
though only at a steady, careful pace. If a weapon is
Bulky or Very Bulky due to recoil (not actual weight or
bulk), a gyrostabilizer reduces Very Bulky to Bulky and
eliminates the Bulky trait entirely.

Example: Personal Defence Weapon
Personal Defence Weapons (PDWs) vary in design but
are similar in function. A PDW is typically a compact
high-firepower weapon intended to give advantages
over a handgun in emergency self-defence situations.
Some are essentially overgrown handguns, some
are small submachineguns and others use entirely
different concepts. A shortened, stockless combat
shotgun can fulfil the PDW role quite well – it is
quick into action, hits hard and is easy to carry, but
suffers from a small ammunition supply. These are all
characteristics of a typical PDW no matter how the
design requirements are met.

A mercenary unit decides to create a custom-designed
PDW to be carried by its support gunners, vehicle crews
and other personnel whose role is not direct short-range
combat with the enemy. The unit chooses 7.65x21mm
ammunition, a common light-pistol calibre, to base the
weapon around. The receiver chosen is an Assault type.
These initial choices create a weapon with a mass of
1kg, modified to 0.75 kg because the weapon uses light
handgun ammunition and has a fully-automatic receiver.
Base damage is 2D. The designer decides this will be a
fully-automatic weapon, pushing the cost up from Cr200
to Cr240 and granting Auto 3.

Base ammunition capacity for an Assault weapon is
20 rounds, increased to 24 by use of light handgun
ammunition. However, when the designer begins
choosing features for the weapon this may be altered.
The Travellers decide they want a compact weapon,
which adds 25% to the cost and reduces mass by 10%.

This reduces ammunition capacity by 20% of the new
total of 24, or 4.8 rounds. Rounded to 5, ammunition
capacity is now 19 rounds.

The Travellers then decide to reduce ammunition
capacity by 30%, down from 19 to 13, since there
are commercially available light handgun magazines
available in this sizing. Each 10% reduction in
ammunition capacity reduces loaded weight by 5% and
reduces the weapon's cost by 5%. The Travellers want
a higher Auto trait for their PDW, selecting an increase
from 3 to 4. This adds 10% cost and 5% weight.

They now have a receiver for their weapon. Its raw
cost is Cr420.75 and weight is 0.6425kg. With the
referee's approval these values are rounded off to
Cr420 and 0.64kg. This is the core mechanism of
the new weapon, ready to be fitted with a barrel and
any furniture or accessories the Travellers want. They
envisage this weapon as being carried in a hip holster,
so no stock is to be fitted. It does need a barrel, and a
Handgun type is chosen. A Handgun barrel costs 15%
of the receiver price and weighs 20% as much. These
values are calculated and added into the worksheet.
Using a Handgun barrel brings effective range down
from 40m – the nominal performance of light handgun
ammunition – to 8m. On the plus side, the PDW starts
with Quickdraw 2, which is increased to 6 by the use
of a Handgun barrel.

Since the Travellers do not want to add bells and
whistles, they stop there. Cost is Cr483, rounded to
Cr485, and weight is 0.668kg, rounded to 0.67kg.

The Travellers evaluate their weapon. It is comparable
in price to a standard submachinegun but much lighter
and can be carried in a hip holster. It is quick into
action, with Quickdraw 6 for its configuration, and has a
very high rate of fire. This makes it ideal for emergency
self-defence situations, and 13-round light handgun
magazines are easily available on the open market.
The Travellers are satisfied with the weapon despite its
limitations and decide to work out its final values.

Normally a magazine would cost 1% of the weapon's
price, but since this weapon uses commercially
available magazines for small handguns the cost of
an empty magazine is based on 1% of the price of
such a weapon plus 13 rounds of small handgun
ammunition. This gives a rough cost of about Cr9 per
loaded magazine if bought over the counter, but the
mercenaries will probably buy crates of magazines
and tons of ammunition at a much lower price. The
Travellers decide they want an extended magazine just

in case it is useful. This will cost Cr9 plus the price of
its 18 rounds of ammunition, or roughly Cr20 loaded
and ready to go.

The weapon's short barrel means it has a low muzzle
velocity, which has already been considered in regard
to effective range. It also affects penetration, giving the
weapon Penetration -1. Consulting the Final Penetration
table on page 18, this indicates the weapon has the
Lo-Pen (2) trait – any armor it encounters is treated as
doubled in value.

The Travellers decide this handgun-sized weapon will be
issued with one standard magazine in place (included
in the weapon's weight) and a spare plus two extended
magazines (18 rounds each), all on a standardised rig.
The whole thing comes in at under 1.5kg and does not
get in the way when operating a vehicle, yet delivers
a lot of firepower to deter pursuit or cover a dash to a
rescue vehicle.

Full Dice of Damage
Some effects are based on the number of 'full
dice of damage' done by the weapon. This has
nothing to do with any modified applied to the
damage; it is based purely on the number of
dice. In many cases, an effect might specify
a number of full dice, such as 'for every two
full dice of damage'. In this case, a weapon
that does 3D-3 damage or one that does 3D+3
are treated the same – they both have three
full dice of damage. If this weapon gains the
AP trait at a level of one per two full dice
of damage, it would gain AP 1. A Weapon
doing 4D-2 would gain AP 2. At the referee's
discretion, a modifier of -4 or +4, or greater,
can be treated as an extra full dice of damage.

SPECIAL

AMMUNITION
As noted elsewhere, most weapons use 'ball'
ammunition; simple inert projectiles which deliver
damage to the target by means of kinetic energy. If the
projectile is altered but the cartridge dimensions are kept
the same, different types of ammunition can be created
which can fulfil specialist functions.

Armor-Piercing (TL4): Armor-piercing ammunition is
designed to penetrate hard surfaces, typically using
a more powerful cartridge and different projectile
configuration. Projectiles are made from harder
materials and shaped to penetrate, at the cost of
reducing damage. This is largely because an AP round
causes a narrower wound track and is likely to over-
penetrate – a standard round may stop in the target,
delivering all its kinetic energy, whilst a round that
over-penetrates takes some of its energy away with it.
Armor-piercing ammunition increases Penetration by
+1. It costs twice the price of ball.

Armor-Piercing, Advanced (TL7): Advanced armor-
piercing ammunition typically uses a subcalibre
projectile mounted in a sabot which is discarded early
in flight. Other ways of achieving the same effect are
possible, but the result is a highly penetrative round
which can defeat most forms of armor. Advanced
armor-piercing ammunition increases Penetration
by +2. It costs four times as much as ball and is not
available for relatively low-velocity weapons such as
handguns and smoothbores.

Distraction (TL5): Distraction rounds use noise and light –
usually both – to startle anyone nearby, scare off animals
or draw attention to the exploding round. This can be
useful as a signal or to attract the attention of potential
rescuers, or can be used by security personnel to let
intruders know beyond any doubt they have been spotted.
If used as a distraction, such as by being fired into a
room as an entry team bursts in, a distraction round will
force everyone within to make an END check or be unable
to react. See page 23 for more information. Distraction
rounds cost four times the price of ball ammunition.

Enhanced Wounding (TL5): Enhanced wounding
ammunition is designed to mushroom, break up or
expand after striking flesh, creating a wider wound track
and ensuring the round dumps all of its energy into the
target. The trade-off for this is reduced penetration.
Enhanced wounding ammunition is banned in many
regions. It reduces Penetration by -2 and increases
Damage by +2 per dice. These rounds cost twice as
much as ball.

Explosive (TL6): This ammunition is typically intended
for anti-materiel work, though it can be highly effective
against personnel targets. Explosive ammunition for
small arms does not produce a massive blast, but can
rip apart communications equipment and similar lightly
constructed systems where a conventional bullet might
well pass right through leaving the device functional.
Explosive rounds cost six times as much as ball. They
reduce Penetration by -1 whilst adding Damage +1D plus
an additional +1D per 3 full dice. Explosive ammunition
increases Physical Signature by one level. Explosive
ammunition for small arms does not grant the Blast trait.

Flechette (TL7): Flechette ammunition uses a bundle
of small, lightweight plastic flakes instead of a single
projectile. It is intended for use against vermin, and has
a very short effective range as a result. The wide and
rapid spread of the flakes grants the Spread trait plus an
additional DM+4 on checks attack rolls out to 5m, but
the weapon's Range is reduced to 10m. All Damage dice
are reduced to D3s, and any D3s are reduced to a single
point of Damage. Flechette ammunition costs the same
as ball.

Gas (TL7): Gas rounds are used in some security weapons.
The round itself does Damage 1D, and is designed to
shatter into volatile fragments upon striking any solid
surface. One gas round from a shotgun or handgun is
sufficient to fill a 3x3x3m volume with a low concentration
of gas. Usually this is a tear gas or sedative type. Gas
rounds cost 6 times as much as ball ammunition.

**High Explosive Armor-Piercing (TL8):** High Explosive
Armor-Piercing (HEAP) rounds are used in relatively
larger-calibre weapons to create a penetration capability
even if muzzle velocity is low. HEAP rounds are not
very effective in small-calibre weapons as they require
a certain diameter to create a shaped-charge effect.
However, by using volatile squash-on-impact materials
a small plasma jet is formed which can punch a hole in
light armor. HEAP rounds are only available for weapons
of 10mm calibre and above. They cost ten times
the price of ball ammunition and increases Physical
Signature by one level. HEAP ammunition increases
Penetration by +2.

**Incendiary (TL6):** Incendiary ammunition is designed
to set targets on fire. It is primarily intended to cause
materiel damage but can have horrific effects on
personnel. Incendiary ammunition costs 6 times the
price of ball and gives the weapon the Incendiary trait.
An incendiary round that penetrates armor delivers
half as much damage as got through armor again the
following round, with the armor offering no protection.

**Low-Penetration (TL6):** Low-penetration ammunition uses
a deliberately weak propellant charge and a projectile
design that reduces the penetration of the weapon. This
is primarily useful in security weapons for use inside
installations and spacecraft, but may be used to create
a less-lethal response to low-threat situations. Low-
penetration ammunition normally reduces Penetration
by -1 but can be any value from -1 to -4. In addition
to the effects of the weapon's final Penetration, low-
penetration ammunition converts each dice of damage to
D3. D3s are converted to single points. Low-penetration
ammunition costs the same as ball.

**Pellet (TL3):** Pellet ammunition is typically used in
smoothbore weapons. Its primary advantage is the spread
of pellets, which makes a hit at close range likely. Pellet
ammunition gives the weapon the Spread trait. Damage
is the same whether using ball or pellet, but pellets
reduce Penetration by the weapon's Spread score. They
also increase the chance of a knockdown (see page 22).
Pellet ammunition costs the same as ball.

**Smart (TL10):** Although commonly called 'smart', this
ammunition is more correctly designated 'limited-
guidance'. It is only useful with a weapon mounting a
gun computer as no person can react quickly enough to
keep a bullet on target. The user can choose whether to
lock in a particular target then shoot, or to have the gun
computer assess the situation at the instant of firing and
make an assumption about what the target is to be. Either
way. once the projectile is in flight it deploys small fins

for guidance and attempts to correct he aim point using
signals from the weapon. This is of little use at ranges
under 100m as the projectile does not have time to make
meaningful course corrections, but at greater ranges
DM+1 is gained for guidance from an Intelligent weapon.
This increases to DM+2 for TL13+ intelligent weapons.
Smart ammunition costs six times as much as ball. If
the guidance capability is combined with another special
ammunition type, the two costs are added together. Thus
smart enhanced-wounding ammunition would cost 6
times the cost of ball plus 2 times the cost of ball, for a
total of 8 times the cost of conventional ammunition.

GRENADES, WARHEADS

AND EXPLOSIVES
The 'dangerous bit' of a missile or grenade is its payload,
and as a general rule payloads tend to be produced in
standard sizes. Most warheads do one of two things; either
they explode or they produce gas, smoke and similar cloud
effects. The latter is often achieved through a burning
process. How great the effect of a given warhead is
depends largely upon its size. Grenades, warheads and the
like are grouped together here for convenience.

The configuration of the weapon dictates the uses it can
be put to. However, a warhead can usually be removed
from one delivery system and converted to fit another or
to create an improvised explosive device. In other cases,
explosives are available in a form that allows them to be
tailored to the need at hand. Explosive charges can be
emplaced for a variety of purposes. This becomes possible
as soon as explosives are available, though low-tech
charges are generally inefficient in terms both of reliable
detonation and the effects of an explosion.

Hand grenades of a recognizably modern type become
available at TL4. Payloads configured as simple hand
grenades are bought at the base payload cost. At TL9,
advanced fusing becomes available, which allows the
grenade to be set for impact detonation, remote detonation
using a suitable communications device, proximity/
vibration detonation after a set arming time, or a variable
time delay. This permits a hand grenade to be set up
as a mine or booby trap without additional preparation.
Advanced fusing adds 25% to the cost of the weapon but
does not affect weight. Mini-grenades become available
two Tech Levels after the standard grenade of the type and
are usually hand-thrown. Cost for a hand grenade or mini-
hand grenade is simply that of the payload (see page 54)
unless advanced fusing or some other feature is desired.
Hand grenades can be thrown 20m, and have a Range of
100m from a cup discharger.

Rifle grenades become available at TL5. They typically use
the same warhead as a hand grenade of the type, costing
twice as much and weighing 50% more than a hand
grenade. Most rifle grenades are fitted to the muzzle of a
rifle and launched by firing it, which obviously prevents the
rifle from being used normally until the grenade is removed
or launched. Attaching or removing a grenade is a minor
action. Specialist rifle grenade launchers are available,
though uncommon. Cup-type launchers are rarely used
after TL5, but when they are they launch standard hand
grenades rather than rifle grenades. Rifle grenades have a
base Range of 100m.

At TL6 cartridge grenades, also referred to as launcher
grenades or launched grenades, become available. The
warhead can be any standard grenade or mini-grenade
type. The weapon as a whole is constructed as an all-in-
one unit much like a cartridge for a projectile weapon.
Cartridge grenades require a tube-type launcher and can be
fed from a belt or magazine. A cartridge grenade that hits
without detonating will do Damage 2D. Cartridge grenades
cost 2.5 times the payload price, plus the cost of any
additional features. Weight is the same as a hand-thrown
grenade and base Range is 200m.

Rocket-Assisted Multipurpose (RAM) grenades become
available from TL8. These are essentially an advanced
form of the cartridge grenade, with greater range and
accuracy. Some RAM grenades are configured to receive
basic guidance, typically from a laser designator. A RAM
grenade that hits without detonating will do Damage 2D.
RAM grenades cost three times the payload price, plus any
additional features. Weight is the same as a hand-thrown
grenade. RAM grenades have a base Range of 300m.

From TL5, Rocket-Propelled Grenades (RPG) become
available. These are rather basic unguided rocket weapons
which are almost always impact-fused and deliver a much
larger warhead than a hand, rifle or cartridge grenade.
An RPG requires a dedicated launch device, often a
tube but sometimes a spigot mortar. Rocket-propelled
grenades, whether configured as rifle grenades or used
with a launcher, cost five times the payload price and may
occasionally have additional features. Weight is usually
around five times that of a hand-thrown grenade. Rocket-
propelled grenades have a base Range of 500m. Unguided
RPGs have the Inaccurate trait, usually at -1 or -2.

In archaic terminology, an emplaced charge might be
known as a 'torpedo', though that term has changed
considerably in its meaning. Today, a charge placed as
a trap is normally termed a mine if of a pre-packaged
type, and an improvised explosive (or incendiary) device
if assembled using explosives and locally available
materials. Ground mines become available at TL5, and
are designed to lie more or less flat on the ground, though
some advanced variants can be stuck to a suitable non-
horizontal surface. Ground mines are usually designed
to attack vehicles from underneath or to throw a small
anti-personnel device up to a pre-set height where it
detonates. They present an all-round threat. Directional
mines, available from TL6, is designed to fling numerous
small projectiles in a cone from its 'hostile' face, with the
area behind its 'friendly' face theoretically safe. Directional
mines are usually anti-personnel devices but some
inventive ideas have been marketed at times.

Unless otherwise stated, a cartridge or rifle grenade will be
in the 35-45mm range and have a warhead equivalent to
a standard hand grenade of the type. RAM grenades are
also equivalent in effect but have additional propellant to
increase both range and accuracy. Light cartridge grenades
are typically in the 22-34mm range and equivalent in
effect to a light hand grenade.

Payloads
Aerosol, Antilaser: Aerosol grenades fill the air with a
fine mist of semi-reflective particles, scattering and
dissipating laser pulses and making visual targeting more
difficult. Laser attacks, communications or designation
into or through an aerosol cloud are impossible. Optical
targeting suffers DM-2. An aerosol cloud dissipates after
1Dx3 rounds, or D3x3 rounds for cloud produced by a
mini-grenade.

Aerosol, Corrosive: Corrosive aerosol grenades fill an area
roughly 3x3x3m with a corrosive gas cloud. This delivers
3D damage in the first round and is Corrosive. The cloud is
semi-opaque, reducing the damage done by laser weapons
fired into or through it by 1D. Corrosive warheads are not
available for mini-grenades.

Anti-Armor: Anti-armor grenades are typically impact-
fused, with a shaped-charge warhead designed to create
a jet of superheated gas which can cut through armor.
Anti-armor warheads are not available as mini-grenades,
but a hand grenade type using a streamer to ensure the
weapon strikes warhead-first is used by some low-tech
forces. It poses a modest threat to armored vehicles of
the era and can occasionally put battle dress out of action.
Hand-thrown anti-armor grenades suffer DM-2 to attack
rolls, and all grenades of this type have a small blast radius
compared to area-effect types. Damage is 4D, with AP 8.

Baton: Baton rounds, otherwise known as 'rubber bullets',
are designed to cause shock, knockdown and possibly a
stunning effect without being lethal. They are normally
available as cartridge grenades only, though in theory the
payload could be flung at someone's head. Small-calibre
baton rounds, when used as a cartridge grenade payload,
are treated as mini-grenades. Full-calibre rounds are
treated as standard grenades. At lower Tech Levels, instead
of a solid impactor a bag of lead shot is used. The effect
is similar. Small baton rounds cause 1D Stun damage;
standard baton rounds deliver 2D damage. Damage
delivered is considered to be tripled when determining if
a knockdown has occurred, but baton rounds are entirely
ineffective against rigid armor.

Battlechem: Battlechem payloads are banned by many
treaties but still see use at times. Configurations vary
but the delivery system usually takes the form of a cloud
of sticky particles sufficient to fill a 3x3x3m volume.

Battlechem is an irritant, with similar effects to an
incapacitant payload. In addition it is mildly caustic,
causing Damage 1D if it touches bare skin and Damage
3D if inhaled. These effects are repeated every round of
contact, and for D3 rounds thereafter. Battlechem also has
a tendency to clog up filters in breathing equipment. There
is no effect on a completely sealed air system like a vacc
suit but gas masks and the like will be choked, making
breathing difficult, after 1D rounds of contact with the
Battlechem cloud. A clogged respirator forces the user to
make a Difficult (10+) END check each round and imposes
any negative Effect on all actions taken until the filter is
cleaned or replaced.

Breacher: Breacher charges are not intended for use as
grenades against personnel targets, but can be harmful in
a small radius. They are designed to be slapped against a
door or wall, and use a tandem shaped-charge to crack and
shatter the area they are in contact with. Cartridge or RPG
type breachers can be fired at the target structure from a
distance. A typical internal partition wall in a starship has
Protection +6 and Structure 20; this much damage will
put a fist-sized hole through it. Materials such as concrete
will crumble if breached; generally three well-placed
breaches will be sufficient to collapse a section large
enough to duck through. Metal partitions and bulkheads
do not collapse in this way. D3+3 breaches are needed
to weaken a section so that it can be kicked out. An
accurately placed attack on a door or hatch can be used to
destroy the hinges and/or locking mechanism and allow it
to be pushed off its mounts.

Corrosive: Corrosive grenades contain a sticky gob of
corrosive material with a small bursting charge. When
the grenade detonates it flings small fragments around
within the burst radius. Each does 2D corrosive Damage
and is treated as a Weak area fire attack (see page 14).
Cartridge and RPG type corrosive grenades are more
commonly used to attack armored targets. If they hit, a
large gobbet of material is stuck to the victim, delivering
4D corrosive Damage. Corrosive payloads are not available
for mini-grenades.

Cryogenic: Cryogenic grenades are rare and difficult
to manufacture. Their effect is produced by a hugely
endothermic reaction between two chemicals, drawing
in heat from the immediate surroundings. Cryogenic
grenades are useful in firefighting but have some combat
applications. Damage against personnel is 5D. Mini-
grenades are not available.

Distraction: Distraction grenades create a loud noise and/or
a bright flash intended to confuse or disorient opponents.
A standard Distraction grenade is treated as an Average
Distraction (see page 23).

**Electromagnetic Pulse:** Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)
grenades are designed to disrupt electronics. Upon
detonation the device produces a pulse with an intensity
equal to its Tech Level. At TL12 an advanced EMP grenade
becomes available, which is more expensive but produces
a significantly more powerful pulse.

**Fire Suppression:** Fire suppression grenades are not
intended for combat, but are found in many installations
and aboard some starships. Their bursting charge is
distributed throughout their payload, and is too small to
cause any real harm. It is sufficient to count as a small
distraction device (see page 23) if used in this manner,
and will create a roughly 3x3x3m cloud of powder with a
high heat capacity. The effect of this is to smother flames
by depriving them of oxygen whilst at the same time
absorbing much of the heat that fuels the fire. The cloud
takes D3 rounds to settle, during which time it obscures
vision and interferes with weapons such as lasers, imposing
DM-2 on tasks or shots through the cloud. Anyone in
the cloud without eye and respiratory protection suffers
Damage 1D per round.

**Fragmentation:** Fragmentation grenades contain a small
bursting charge which hurls fragments of the casing and
often packing materials such as notched wire throughout
the burst radius. Performance is generally poor versus
armored targets but unprotected personnel are likely to be
severely injured. A fragmentation grenade is treated as an
Average area fire attack (see page 14). Small fragmentation
grenades deliver 3D damage with a Blast trait of 4.
Standard grenades deliver 5D damage with Blast 9.

**Gas, Incapacitant:** Incapacitant gases include various tear
and vomit gases, as well as disorienting psychoactive
substances. Incapacitant gas payloads are not available
for mini-grenades. A typical grenade will fill a 3x3x3m
area with gas, which will linger for 1Dx3 rounds or less if
there is significant wind. Anyone exposed to the gas must
make an END check each round or be unable to take
coherent action. In the case of psychoactives there may be
additional effects.

**Gas, Toxin:** Toxic gases are illegal, even for use in war, in
many systems. Most gas grenades use immediately lethal
agents such as neurotoxins. A typical grenade will fill a
3x3x3m area with gas, which will linger for 1Dx3 rounds
or less if there is significant wind. Anyone lacking a sealed
protective suit must make an immediate Very Difficult
(12+) END check or be intoxicated. Partial protection
such as a respirator reduces this check to Average (8+),
but the gas can still take effect by skin contact. The check
must be made every round the individual is exposed to the
gas. Once intoxicated, the victim suffers 1D INT damage
every 1D round. This continues for D3 seconds after the
individual is no longer exposed to the gas.

Incendiary, Antipersonnel: Antipersonnel incendiary
grenades typically use substances like white phosphorous,
which burns hotly and flings small fragments around its
area of effect. Incendiary grenades of this type produce
a cloud of white smoke equivalent to a smoke grenade
and may set secondary targets on fire. The grenade does
full damage automatically to anyone within 1m of it,
and is treated as a Weak area fire attack against anyone
within the burst radius. An incendiary antipersonnel
grenade will burn for 1D rounds, after which its smoke
cloud dissipates rapidly. Deliberate use against personnel
targets is outlawed in some systems, but intent can be
difficult to prove.

Incendiary, Demolition: Demolition grenades are not
intended for use against personnel, and not particularly
effective in this role. They contain material which burns
very hot for an extended period, and are typically used
to render equipment useless. A mini-grenade will start a
fire almost anywhere and destroy most light equipment;
a full-sized grenade can melt through a TL8 tank engine
deck and scrap the engine, or wreck the breach of an
artillery piece.

Microgrenade: Microgrenade payloads contain a
small bursting charge and a group of extremely small
fragmentation devices scattered by the explosion. These
produce the effect of a Standard area fire attack within
a 3m radius. Anyone hit suffers 2D damage, though
the fragments perform very poorly against armor.
Microgrenade warheads are not available for mini-grenades.

Multiple Projectile: Multiple projectile warheads are only
available for cartridge grenades, essentially functioning as
a giant shotgun shell. Projectiles are heavier but have a
lower velocity than shotgun pellets. Out to 10m, multiple
projectile grenades do full damage after which it is
halved to the maximum range of 25m, beyond which it is
completely ineffective.

Plasma: A plasma warhead contains chemicals which
combine to create a blast of superheated gas which will
be lethal to most personnel targets within its radius.
The blast is not directional. Creating a useful quantity
of plasma without machinery is difficult and expensive,
requiring specialist materials that must be stored safely
in the grenade yet capable of undergoing their reaction
when required. Poorly made plasma grenades are a serious
danger to all concerned.

Plasma, Anti-Armor: Anti-armor plasma warheads are
only available as cartridge or RPG weapons. The plasma
reaction is contained in a manner that focuses it – more or
less – in one direction. This makes the weapon much more
effective against armor than a standard plasma grenade,
but greatly reduces the area effect. Plasma grenades of

all types have an incendiary effect but do not burn in the
usual sense – they use their fuel instantly but may set fire
to other materials.

Smoke/Thermosmoke: Low-tech smoke grenades are
'burning' types which produce smoke slowly and can set
fire to nearby flammable objects. More advanced smoke
grenades rely on a 'cold' chemical reaction to rapidly
create a cloud of suspended particles. Either way, smoke
completely obscures vision and blocks lasers. A cloud will

thickly fill a 3x3x3m volume and will spread throughout a
wider area. It persists 1Dx3 minutes unless dissipated by
wind. At TL8, thermosmoke grenades produce a 'warm'
cloud, not hot enough to set anything on fire but entirely
sufficient to block thermal sensors.

Stun: Stun grenades use either intense light, noise or both
to incapacitate targets within the burst radius. These
weapons are more powerful than distraction devices and
are not available as mini-grenades.

LAUNCHERS AND

SUPPORT WEAPONS
Many of the support weapons used by infantry can be
constructed in the same manner as personal weaponry.
A general-purpose machinegun is typically of the same
calibre as a battle rifle. With a heavy barrel, fully-
automatic receiver and perhaps a tripod mounting, a
support weapon is created. The converse is also true;
heavier support weapons have been converted into anti-
materiel rifles by adding a stock and stripping away all
unnecessary components. Launchers for grenades or
rockets require a slightly different process, however.

Launchers are constructed one of two ways, depending
on their projectile. Those that launch a rocket-propelled
grenade or missile typically have only one primary
component, the receiver, which is normally assumed
to include the weapon's equivalent of a barrel and
a suitable shoulder stock or similar furniture. They
may have additional components; electronics and the
like can be added as accessories. Cartridge grenade
launchers are different in that they are constructed
like a conventional firearm, with a receiver, barrel and
furniture. Short barrels can be used, but the relatively
low-powered propulsion used in cartridge grenades to
keep recoil manageable makes a weapon with a handgun
length barrel or shorter pointless. The grenade would
not reach sufficient velocity to travel farther than a few
meters before falling to the ground. It may or may not
arm in that distance.

The effectiveness and effects of any kind of launcher
is entirely dependent on the weapon launched from it,
though warheads and payloads are not considered part
of the weapon itself.

Rail and Muzzle Launchers (TL5+): Rocket-propelled
grenades can be launched from a rail mounted on
a weapon. This is purchased as an accessory to the
weapon. Only the cost of the grenade need be paid – see
page 126 for possible payloads. Similarly, rifle grenades
are launched from an adapter on the weapon; only the
grenades need be purchased.

Disposable Launchers (TL6+): A disposable launcher
is typically made from lightweight but watertight
and durable materials, with a simple optical sight.
Disposable launchers use a rocket-propelled grenade
type warhead in a small missile which may or may not
have some form of guidance system. The container/
launcher has negligible cost and adds 0.25kg to the
weapon weight. It is designed to be thrown away after
use and cannot be reloaded.

Tube Launchers (TL6+): A tube launcher can discharge
any kind of cartridge grenade, and those constructed at
TL9 and above can also use RAM grenades. Light tube
launchers are typically made in calibres between 22-
34mm, firing projectiles equivalent in effect to a light
grenade. Standard launchers are typically 35-45mm
in calibre an equivalent to a standard grenade. The
majority of tube launchers are designed as a standard
receiver which can be configured for attachment to a
longarm or as a standalone weapon. Most tube launchers
are single shot weapons, though some magazine-fed
variants do exist. 'Grenade machineguns' require a
support grenade launcher receiver and a suitable mount.

A grenade launcher designed to fit under a rifle does not
require a stock and will normally use an Assault barrel.
There is no additional cost or weight for mountings when
fitting a launcher to a Modularised weapon. Otherwise
fittings for the launcher must be present on the weapon.
Standalone weapons generally use a Rifle barrel and a
Fixed Stock. Semi-automatic grenade launchers may use
a low-capacity detachable magazine but more commonly
use a fixed drum which much be reloaded one round at
a time, at the rate of one minor action per grenade.

Tube Launcher Receivers
Receiver Cost Weight Base Range Base Ammunition Capacity Traits
Single shot, Light Cr200 1.5kg 200m 1 Bulky
Single shot, Standard Cr300 2kg 300m 1 Bulky
Semi-Automatic, Light Cr400 2.5kg 200m 3 Bulky
Semi-Automatic, Standard Cr500 3.5kg 300m 3 Very Bulky
Support, Light Cr2000 10kg 200m Varies —
Support, Standard Cr2000 15kg 300m Varies —

Support grenade launchers are typically belt fed.
The bulk of cartridge grenades makes handling
magazines difficult, though some designs use them.
If a magazine is fitted to any launcher type it adds
0.5kg to the loaded weight of the weapon per grenade
for standard weapons and 0.3kg per grenade for light
grenade launchers.

**Reusable Launchers (TL6+):** Reusable launchers may
be fully reusable or utilise a container/barrel system
for each missile. 'Dumb' launchers are not uncommon
with mid-tech troops, typically in an anti-armor role. A
reusable launcher is purchased as a whole unit, which
is assumed to include furniture and whatever passes
for a barrel on the weapon. If a magazine-fed launcher
is created, each missile or rocket after the first adds its
full weight to the weapon, plus 10%.

Reusable launchers are subdivided into two categories

- light and heavy. Both generate significant 'backblast'
when firing and are dangerous to use in a confined
space. Light launchers are intended to be carried as
an additional piece of a soldier's combat load, though
they are rather weighty, whilst heavy launchers are the
primary weapon of a soldier or small team. Additional
ammunition is usually distributed among the unit.

A field launcher is not an infantry weapon but can be
deployed by a squad to provide heavy fire support. The
weapon includes a base plate and slewing mechanism.
Such weapons typically have 2 or 4 tubes, which
must be manually reloaded after launch. Costs are for
a 'dumb' launcher with basic manual controls. More
advanced missile guidance will push up the overall
cost of the unit – munitions costs and weights are not
included but the weight of a full set of missiles is.

Designing Missile Launchers
When designing most weapons, the 'loaded weight'
is calculated assuming a normal magazine or feed
device in place. This is for convenience and close
enough for small arms. When designing a missile
launcher or similar weapon using heavy munitions,
the weight of a full load of missiles must be added
to the base weight of the weapon system.

ENERGY WEAPONS
Most energy weapons have similar components to
slugthrowers; receiver, barrel, furniture and accessories.
The advanced technology required to build high-energy
weapons makes some combinations impractical, and
some energy weapons are constructed very differently to a
conventional firearm.

Projectors
Projectors are considered energy weapons for most
purposes. They damage a target by projecting a substance
which causes a change in the local energy level. In most
cases this is a flammable substance, which when ignited
damages the target by extreme heat and also consumes
available oxygen. Cryogenic projectors work the opposite
way, by coating the target in a substance that absorbs
energy. Both can be lethal against personnel but flame
weapons are more commonly used as combat assets.
Cryogenic projectors are rarely encountered, but do have
specialist uses. Some materials will become brittle when
frozen, enabling entry to a secured area, and the function
of devices and explosives may be slowed.

Projectors do not always resemble conventional firearms.
They consist of a device for guiding the projection,
containers for the substance to be projected, some
means of projecting it, and whatever frame and tubes
are required to make it all fit together. This is typically
inert gas under high compression. Projectors thus have
three key components.

Structure: The body of the weapon includes the nozzle
and some means of holding and directing it.
Propulsion: As technology advances it becomes possible
to compress propellant gases ever further, allowing more
shots for the same volume of propellant or reduced size.
Some projectors use chemicals which, when mixed in
small quantities, create a propellant gas.
Fuel: Whilst some projectors do not project a burning
fuel, all projectors use the term for convenience. In
some cases the 'fuel' may be generated by a chemical
reaction inside the fuel container, and this may
sometimes be combined with generation of propellant.

Projectors have the Hazardous trait, typically at -6.

If directly targeted a projector may be punctured and begin
to leak. See page 22 for details of the Mishap Threshold.

A projector can in theory have any amount of propellant
and fuel in its tanks. However, there are practical
limitations to how much bulk can be carried without
making the weapon unmanageable. This is given in
kilograms of payload, which is the total of fuel and
propellant combined. It is possible to use oversized
tanks, but the user suffers DM-2 on all physical tasks
for each additional multiple of the maximum load. Thus
a soldier armed with a huge flamethrower with 30kg of
fuel would suffer the penalty since the normal maximum
for a backpack-type flame weapon is 20kg.

Range is different with projectors than projectile
weapons; the effective range of a weapon is determined
by its propellant. The projected substance will travel
twice as far as this but in a distinctly random manner
suitable only for setting an area on fire or denying it to
the enemy.

Projector Combat
Projectors are not precise weapons and cannot be
used to attack just one target unless there is no-one
else nearby. Projectors have the Blast trait at a level
determined by their type. All targets within that area
are subjected to an area fire attack. At up to half the
projector's effective range this is treated as Intense. Out
to its full effective range it is a Typical area fire attack
and at up to the weapon's extreme range the area fire is
treated as Weak.

Projector Structure
There are only so many ways to build a projector, though
examples may differ somewhat depending on what
species they are made for or whether they are to be worn
as a pack or carried in hand. Projector structures come
in three general types, which determine the general
characteristics of the weapon and amount of propellant
and fuel that can be carried without making the weapon
unmanageable. When calculating the cost and weight
of a projector frame, the designer must decide what its
combined fuel/propellant capacity is to be and use these
values to calculate the equivalent of a receiver cost.

Large: A large projector is normally configured as a set
of tanks to be worn on the back or as a support weapon
to be mounted on a vehicle or trolley, and a hand-held
wand to direct the attack. A large projector can carry a
maximum of 20kg of payload without being unwieldy. Its
frame and mechanical parts weigh 30% of its payload
maximum and cost Cr50 per kilogram of the weapon's
total weight. Due to the relative lightness and mobility
of the wand a large projector has Quickdraw 2, but most
users would not want to be in a situation where that
mattered. Large projectors are Blast 3.

Compact: A compact projector is entirely hand-held, in
the manner of a rifle. A compact projector can contain
a maximum of 10kg of payload without being unwieldy
and weighs 20% of its combined payload weight,
costing Cr100 per kg of the weapon overall. Quickdraw
is 0. Compact projectors are Blast 2.

Hand: A hand projector can be very small, like the nozzle
of a hand-held fire extinguisher, but projector weapons
generally have a short tube to keep the payload away
from the user. A hand projector has a maximum payload
of 2kg and weighs 10% of the total payload weight. It
costs Cr25 per kg of the weapon overall. Hand projectors
have Quickdraw +2, halve the effective range of the
weapon, and are Blast 1.

Propellant
Propellant determines the effective range of the weapon
and sometimes certain other characteristics. Propellant
is measured in terms of the amount of attacks that can
be made using 1kg of propellant. Partial amounts are
always possible.

Compressed Gas (TL4): Compressed gas becomes
available at late TL4, making flame weapons and similar
projectors possible. Compressed gas gives 4 attacks
per kg, and imparts an effective range of 20m to the
weapon. Compressed gas costs Cr100 per kg.

**Supercompressed Gas (TL7):** Supercompressed gas
is available from TL7, giving 6 attacks per kg and
increasing effective range to 25m. Supercompressed gas
costs Cr250 per kg.

**Generated Gas (TL9):** Generated gas becomes available at
TL9. Using a rapid chemical reaction between 'tablets' of
chemicals a high-pressure gas is created almost instantly.
Generated gas gives 10 attacks per kg and increases
effective range to 30m. Generated gas machinery costs
Cr500 per kg. The reagents cost Cr200 per kg.

Combining Fuel and Propellant
In some cases propellant and fuel are the same
thing. The mechanics of creating a projector
weapon require that both capabilities be paid for
and a suitable weight assigned for both. In-game
effects may be cinematically different but the
rules are identical.

**Fuel**
The effects of a projector are determined by the nature
of its fuel. In some cases a projector can be used
for more than one purpose, such as a flamethrower
converted to spray an irritant chemical. For flame
weapons an ignition mechanism is necessary and it is
usually possible to choose whether the fuel is ignited
at the nozzle or sprayed on the target then ignited by
some other means such as an incendiary grenade.
1kg of fuel is sufficient to make one attack with any
projector weapon. It can be assumed that 'fuel' refers
to everything needed to cause fire, which may include
an oxidising agent for weapons intended to be used in
oxygen-poor atmospheres.

Liquid Fuel (TL4): Liquid fuel is technically available
at any Tech Level so long as a flammable liquid can
be produced or obtained. It becomes usable in flame
weapons at TL4 but is not very effective. Liquid fuel
does Damage 3D and costs Cr25 per kg. It is Incendiary
and Burn 1.

Jellied Fuel (TL5): Jellied fuel sticks to the target rather
than running off, causing a more intense and longer
burn. Jellied fuel does Damage 4D and costs Cr75 per
kg. It is Incendiary and Burn D3+1.

Irritant (TL6): Irritant projectors throw a liquid with
properties similar to tear gas. This may be volatile,
quickly forming a cloud of gas. The payload has the
effects of an Incapacitant (see page 55). Irritants can be
improvised from readily available chemicals and water at
no cost, or bought for Cr25 per kg. A volatile irritant that
also produces the effect of an Incapacitant gas grenade
costs Cr60 per kg.

Suppressant (TL6): Suppressant fuel has a high heat
capacity and is stored in a manner that keeps it very
cold. Liquid carbon dioxide is common. Suppressant
projectors are used in firefighting but have some
combat applications. An attack with a suppressant
projector delivers Damage 2D. Effective range is halved.
Suppressant costs Cr25 per kg.

Battlechem (TL8): A Battlechem projector flings a glob
of thoroughly unpleasant semi-liquid at a distant target,
where it scatters on impact to create a toxic cloud.
Battlechem is banned in most systems but if available
costs Cr300 per kg.

Advanced Fuel (TL9) : Advanced fuel burns hotter and
sticks better than its predecessors. Advanced fuel does
Damage 5D and costs Cr150 per kg. It is Incendiary and
Burn (D3+1).

Cryogenic Fluid (TL10): Cryogenic fluid makes objects
brittle and inflicts damage on unprotected targets.
Against sealed armor such as a vacc suit or battle dress
it may render the target immobile. The target must make
an Average (8+) STR check or be unable to move their
limbs for 1D rounds. Cryogenic fluid costs Cr100 per kg
and delivers Damage 4D to unprotected targets.

DIRECTED ENERGY

WEAPONS
Energy weapons, sometimes referred to as 'directed
energy weapons', project a beam or pulse of energy. To
be effective as a weapon this must be tightly collimated.
Even so, the beam will spread out and lose its effect.
This happens more quickly the denser the atmosphere
between firer and target, as the beam or pulse interacts
with gas molecules along the way. Energy weapons can
often be located by the trail of ionized air they create,
which may produce sound, flash or scintillations.

At close range, the primary difference between energy
and projectile weapons is the lack of recoil, which
makes them ideal for low-gravity work. Since the energy
pulse travels at lightspeed and is not affected to any
significant degree by gravity, shooting at longer ranges
requires a different aiming technique. It is not necessary
to lead a moving target or compensate for bullet drop
with a laser or other energy weapon.

By far the most common energy weapons are lasers,
which rely on a tightly focused beam or pulse to deliver
energy to the target. Lasers dump all their energy into
the first object the pulse encounters, which makes them
a poor choice for situations where there may be a need
to penetrate cover or thick foliage. On the other hand, a
laser can be used to burn through materials that would
resist multiple bullet impacts. Microwave guns are

occasionally encountered, functionally similar to lasers
but using guided electromagnetic waves rather than
intense light to deliver energy to the target.

When creating an energy weapon the same three primary
components are used as with firearms – receiver, barrel
and stock. The barrel is a collimator or wave-guide rather
than a hollow tube but its length affects the function
of the weapon in the same way as a conventional
firearm. Instead of ammunition, energy weapons require
power. This can be stored in a powerpack or generated
almost instantly by a disposable chemical cartridge.
Preferences vary; powerpacks can be heavy but allow a
lot more shots than a magazine of disposable cartridges,
and can be recharged.

Powerpacks
When designing a laser or other energy weapon, it is
necessary to specify the nature of the powerpack and
whether it is integral to the weapon or connected to
it by a cable. This should be done before the weapon
itself is designed, as powerpack types impose some
limitations. There are no 'calibres' of energy weapon as
such, since the output depends on how much power is
available and the beam or pulse generating machinery.
However, the power source has to be capable of
delivering sufficient energy and the weapon must be
able to handle it. For this reason energy weapons are
rated by their power output, which in turn determines
the amount of shots that can be fired from a weapon
using a given powerpack.

Weak energy weapons have an output of Damage 2D
or less.
Light energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 3D, plus modifiers.
Standard energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 5D, plus modifiers.
Heavy energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 8D, plus modifiers.

A shot from an energy weapon draws as many Power
points as it delivers dice of damage.

A powerpack can withstand the power draw of its own
rating or lower without being overloaded. Only enough
energy for the shot being fired is drawn – a Standard
powerpack in use with a Light weapon is drained of 2
points of energy per shot, for example. A powerpack that
suffers an excessive energy draw gains the Unreliable
trait at a level equal to the difference between its
normal maximum damage output and the damage
output of the weapon. Thus if the Travellers connect
a Light powerpack to their heavy support laser, the
weapon gains the Unreliable trait at a level determined
by the difference between the weapon's damage
output – in this case 7D – and the maximum the Light
pack can safely handle. This is 3D, so the weapon
gains Unreliable 4. Most of the time this weapon
will malfunction when fired, though most of these
malfunctions will be relatively minor in nature.

The power capacity of a weapon powerpack is determined
by its rating and Tech Level. Capacity is rated in shots per
kilogram, and a powerpack can be constructed with any
amount of capacity. The ability to jam a powerpack into a
given weapon will place practical limits on the amount of
firepower the weapon can offer. In practice most weapons
are designed to use existing power units.

Cartridges do not have a variable output. They deliver
an instant burst of energy when expended, sufficient
for one shot at the relevant power level. If a cartridge
generates more power than the weapon can handle,
it is treated as having the Unreliable trait at a level
equal to the difference between the maximum power
generated by the cartridge and the damage done
by the weapon. Thus a Standard cartridge (with a
maximum damage rating of 5D) used to power a
Light laser (with a maximum output of 3D) would
impose Unreliable 2. If an underpowered cartridge
is used the weapon will not be harmed but can only
deliver the level of damage that cartridge is capable
of producing. Attempts to use multiple cartridges at
once are rarely successful. Each additional cartridge
imposes a level of Hazardous and Unreliable.

10 500 Light

Cost for weapon powerpacks is determined by the

Cartridge systems can be manufactured either as static
holders or in the manner of a conventional magazine.
Cartridges become very hot when used, so it is standard
practice to eject them from the weapon in the manner of
a standard firearm. Those that retain cartridges require
less moving parts but are more prone to accidents; non-
ejecting cartridge energy weapons gain Hazardous -2.
A cartridge holder does not have to be in the weapon,
though it must be connected to it by a cable. Cartridge
costs and weights are based on the type of cartridge.

Cartridges are cheaper per-shot than weapon
powerpacks but a powerpack can be recharged many
times whereas cartridges must be bought anew. The
weight of a disposable magazine or holder is equal to
the weight of the cartridges within it plus 20%. Cost is
equal to the price of one cartridge. Reusable magazines
cost twice this amount.

ENERGY WEAPON

RECEIVERS
Energy weapons have four classes of receiver – Minimal,
Small, Medium and Large. A Minimal receiver is
typically nothing more than a short tube containing the
collimator and laser generation equipment, which may
or may not be fitted with a pistol-style handgrip. Small
receivers are normally configured as pistols and medium
receivers are normally longarms. Large receivers are
typically used for heavy laser rifles or support weapons.

The type of receiver dictates how powerful the laser
weapon can be and its base range. This is heavily
modified by the barrel length. The weight of an energy
weapon receiver does not include a powerpack.

When a receiver is specified, the designer can choose
how much damage the weapon is capable of, in whole
dice, up to the maximum power available. It is possible,
though a little pointless, to create a Large receiver
and set the Damage to 2D. The only advantage to this
weapon would be reduced power usage.

The function of barrels and furniture is in most ways
the same for energy weapons as conventional firearms.
Most accessories, such as scopes and bipods, are also
identical. Energy weapons do have some exclusive
modifications, however.

Light Cr8 0.01kg
Standard Cr10 0.02kg
Heavy Cr15 0.025kg

Medium Cr2500 3kg 200m Standard
Large Cr5000 8kg 500m Heavy

Laser weapons with Short barrels are limited in terms of
the damage they can deliver, as a result of early beam
dissipation. A full-length (Rifle) barrel or longer has no
upper limit on laser power, but shorter barrels waste
some of the weapon's power. A Carbine or Assault barrel
is limits power to 4D damage. Handgun and Short
barrels have a maximum Damage 3D, and a Minimal
barrel can deliver a maximum of Damage 2D. This
limit applies no matter how powerful the laser pulse
generator in the receiver may be. The weapon is not
damaged by the extra power, but it is wasted.

All energy weapon receivers gain the Zero-G trait and
base Penetration -1.

Efficient Beam Generation (TL11): Advances in laser and
other energy weapon technologies allow a more efficient
generation of beams and pulses. The new technology
is expensive, increasing costs by 50%, but the receiver
weighs 25% less and base range is increased 25%. This
modification is compatible with Lightweight, Compact
and so forth as those are modifications to the weapon as
a whole, whereas Efficient Beam Generation affects only
a few specific components.

Improved Beam Focus (TL11): Improved beam focusing
becomes available at TL11. Weapons with this
modification experience less energy wastage and thus
deliver a little more damage than standard lasers.
Improved Beam Focus adds Damage +3 to any laser
doing 2D damage or more. The improved focussing
crystals do not add any weight but push the cost of the
weapon up by 25%.

Intensified Pulse (TL12): By shortening the wavelength,
a more intense laser pulse can be created. This has the
effect of increasing Penetration by +1. Intensified Pulse
can be applied to any laser weapon, adding 10% to
receiver weight and increasing cost by 25%.

Variable Intensity (TL10): A variable-intensity
modification allows the user to set the damage dealt
by each shot, up to the weapon's normal maximum.
Powerpack weapons draw only enough power for the
shot, but cartridges are fully expended even on a low
power setting. The mechanism includes the capability
to bleed off excess cartridge energy safely. Intensity
variation adds 15% to the cost of the receiver and 10%
to its weight.

**PERSONAL AND LIGHT**

**SUPPORT WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-FIVE**

The choice of weaponry used by a mercenary formation
is often dictated by what is available. Where there is a
choice, general-purpose systems are usually favored
over highly specialized ones. Availability of ammunition
and ease of maintenance are both important factors as
well. Mercenary units would, on the whole, prefer to be
equipped with reliable weaponry of modest Tech Level
than high-end guns that cannot be replaced if they break
down in the field. There is, however, a market for specialist
and highly advanced weaponry. The TL bands noted here
are often used by mercenaries as a shorthand for what
weaponry they are likely to face or be able to obtain.

**Low Tech (TL0-4)**
There is a limit to how low-tech a unit's equipment can
be without becoming ineffective, but many items can
be obtained at low Tech Levels or fielded by opposing
forces. A musketball or even an arrow can put a high-tech
mercenary out of action if the shooter gets lucky, and
in many cases a basic weapon system does not change
function as technology advances. Although marketing
departments at arms firms try very hard to make their
version of the common field knife more desirable than
others there is a limit to how much a low-tech item can
vary from the baseline. Such equipment purchased by
mercenaries tends to be manufactured at a much higher
Tech Level but is not very different to something that
could be put together by a TL1 blacksmith.

**Mid-Tech (TL5-7)**
Mid-tech weaponry generally echoes the functions of more
advanced equipment, though less well. It allows local
armed forces to fight in much the same way as starfaring
mercenaries do – though technology will usually give the
mercenaries an advantage. Mercenaries may well equip
themselves with a few bits and pieces of mid-tech kit if it
is cheap or easy to come by, and many of the forces they
work alongside will be equipped to this level.

**Common Tech (TL8-10)**
The majority of mercenary formations use equipment
mostly from the 'common tech' band – hence its
name. This is mainly due to availability and ease of

maintenance. Beyond this point conventional firearms do
not improve much and tend to be supplanted by gauss or
energy weapons.

High Tech (TL11-12)
TL12 represents the upper end of what is commonly
available to mercenaries. This is mostly a function of
restrictions on advanced military-grade weapons and
the difficulty of maintaining them without major support
infrastructure. Those units that do rely heavily on gauss
and similarly complex weapons generally invest in a solid
support and maintenance capability in order to avoid
dependence upon outsiders.

Advanced Tech (TL13-15)
It is rare to find mercenary formations equipped to TL13+
standards unless they are very well funded indeed.
Such formations typically operate alongside or even as a
spearhead for local armed forces on high-tech worlds, or
as the elite of a larger mercenary formation.

HAND WEAPONS
Hand weapons never go out of fashion. Most are useful as tools and may never see use against another person, but
having a knife handy can mean the difference between life and death.

**FIELD KNIFE**

**FIELD BLADE**

Field knives vary from small stiletto-type knives
intended primarily for thrusting and well suited to
assassinating sentries, to large cutting knives designed
to chop through flesh and anything else that gets in the
way. The latter are better suited to use as tools than
pure combat knives. Indeed, some very fine combat
knives have a bad reputation as a result of being used
to open coffee cans and becoming bent or blunted. A
unit's preference for field knives may vary, and it is not
uncommon to find a large knife/bayonet in service as
a general tool and weapon, with a small stabbing knife
secreted somewhere about the mercenary's person.
Although the mode of use varies, performance in skilled
hands is about the same.

The term 'blade' is used in generic fashion by mercenaries for large survival or tool knives of the
Bowie type, machetes and similar heavy-bladed cutting implements, and a range of tool/fighting
weapons produced at spacefaring Tech Levels. Military field blades generally feature a stirrup
handguard and minimal crosspiece, but the whole array of hangars and not-quite swords falls
under this distinction. Blades are favored by mercenaries for their use as tools and ease of carry.
A blade can be used by a skilled fighter to counter a sword or similar hand weapon, albeit at a
slight disadvantage, and is much easier to carry.

Historically, the term cutlass referred to any heavy-bladed cutting tool/weapon used at sea,
though over time specific weapons were produced as cutlasses. In modern times the cutlass
is associated with naval boarding actions and security operations. It is a heavy-bladed
cutting weapon, usually but not always curved, with sufficient hand protection to serve as a
knuckle-duster in a close-quarters brawl.

Sabres are carried by some officers as a dress sword
which might be pressed into service in an emergency.
They can also be encountered in the hands of low to
mid-tech cavalry. Designs and weights vary, with most
having a curved blade optimized for cutting attacks.
Straight-bladed weapons of a similar design might
be referred to as sabres or by other titles such as
backswords or broadswords. Hand protection varies
from a simple stirrup hilt to an elaborate basket, with
most modern designs using a shell guard or half-shell.
Functionally, a sabre is not all that different to a cutlass
but is less well suited to extreme close-quarters combat.

**STEALTH DAGGER**

There is little distinction between a small one-handed
combat axe and a tomahawk in reality, but the term
tends to be applied to lightweight combat weapons with
secondary uses as a tool. Most military tomahawks have
attachment points for a rope or cord for use in climbing,
and a handle strong enough to be used as a prybar. A
tomahawk can be thrown using the Melee (blade) skill.

Moving dirt around by hand never gets any easier, but
it is one of the ways a mercenary can increase their
chances of survival. Entrenching tools vary only slightly
in details. They have a digging blade which may or may
not be positioned opposite a pick on a haft that can
usually be separated from the tools for ease of carry.
The haft sometimes contains holders for wire saws and
other basic tools. Entrenching tools can be used with
the Melee (blade) skill, and are sometimes sharpened
along one end of the spade for combat purposes.

**SECURITY SHIELD**

After disappearing from the low-tech battlefield, shields
begin to reappear as mid-tech security equipment. The
basic TL6 riot shield is usually round or rectangular
and made of fireproof material. It is used in the same
way as a low-tech shield but also protects the user from
small flame weapons such as Molotov cocktails and
adds +1 to the user's Protection against firearm attacks.
At TL8 an advanced version becomes available which
incorporates a single shot grenade discharger, normally
loaded with an incapacitant gas grenade but could be
used to deliver a flechette, baton or stun grenade. More
extreme situations might call for a multiple projectile
round. Advanced security shields are tougher, adding
Protection +2, and can be made from corrosion-
resistant materials for an additional Cr100.

BOARDING SHIELD
Boarding shields are known by various names.
Planetside security often call them entry shields, whilst
some are marketed under extravagant titles such as
'mobile field barricade segment'. The function of these
large, slab-fronted objects is much the same in every
case. A boarding shield is far too large and heavy to
parry with; it is a piece of mobile cover designed to
be emplaced and advanced in the face of potential or
actual hostile action.

Most boarding shields have a vision block; some also
have a firing port in the front surface. A boarding shield
completely protects anyone hiding behind it and is large
enough that two people can use it or move it forward
whilst remaining reasonably well covered. When moving
or firing from behind a boarding shield, the user(s) can
be hit, but the shield imposes DM-2 on opponents'
attack rolls. It provides Protection +12. Most boarding
shields are designed to be linked together using quick-
release fittings on their sides, enabling a protected
firing position to be thrown up almost anywhere. Ladder
shields, costing Cr50 more than a standard boarding
shield, have a series of bars across the rear enabling
them to be used as a short climbing aid.

LOW-TECH FIREARMS
Mercenaries might face an array of low-tech firearms, which will typically be unreliable smoothbore muskets
with poor accuracy and worse penetration. Better-made weapons can be surprisingly accurate in the hands of a
skilled user.

The typical civilian-owned shotgun is used, in rural
environments at least, for vermin control or to persuade
interlopers to absent themselves from property. Many
designs have twin barrels, either in an over-under or side-
by-side configuration. This allows two quick shots before
the weapon must be manually reloaded one chamber
at a time. In urban areas, those who own shotguns
for home defence are more likely to buy a combat
shotgun but relatively short double-barrelled shotguns

- usually with a carbine-length barrel – are sometimes
encountered. These weapons are not much of a threat to
armored troops, but nobody wants to be hit by one. This
representative example is a full-length 'farmer's shotgun'
firing light smoothbore ammunition. At TL3, essentially
the same weapon exists but using a flintlock mechanism,
imposing the Unreliable 1 trait.

Weapons of this sort are rarely offered for sale in
reputable gun shops but are easy enough to convert
from a 'legitimate' sporting gun. Some users produce
their own exotic ammunition for such weapons.

The 'crunch gun' is named for its distinctive sound.
The earliest models appear at late TL3, using black
powder and a flintlock mechanism. By TL4 a cartridge
version is available. These weapons are an upscaled
version of the primitive long-range sniping rifles in use
by some cultures. They are marginally effective against
heavy protection such as combat armor and may be
produced in large numbers by a society with no other
counter to high-tech invaders. They are sometimes used
for anti-materiel work such as shooting the breach block
of an enemy machinegun. This representative example
is not dissimilar to the anti-tank rifles used by infantry
on some low-tech worlds. It is fed from a 3-round
detachable box magazine and uses a manually operated
bolt-action mechanism.

The term jazail can refer to a variety of weapons, some
custom-made and others converted from more advanced
weaponry. It is not uncommon to find the barrel of a
modern assault rifle fitted to a beautifully carved home-
made stock with a single shot flintlock mechanism.
These weapons' lack of complexity make them ideal for
low-tech hunters and insurgents; ammunition is easy
to make and breakdowns simple to repair. Some jazails
are crude things but many are objects of pride, with
the ugly industrial barrel shrouded in carved wood or
decorated to suit the user's preferences.

SECURITY AND PERSONAL DEFENCE WEAPONS
Weapons intended for security work generally combine effectiveness at short ranges with a certain degree of
intimidation. The large bore of a combat shotgun is generally more likely to dissuade a potential opponent than a
rifle, even though the latter is probable more lethal. Security and self-defence weapons are generally used at close
range, where a one-shot knockdown is more important than potential lethality. Ease of carry is also a factor with
personal defence weaponry. Handguns and mini-submachineguns are favored by many users, but there are other
options on the market.

One of several unusual handguns marketed by Ailene
Armament, the Adjudicator was originally produced
as a deterrent weapon to be carried by government
or corporate officials, or others who might need a
one-shot stop in the case of a suddenly escalating
confrontation. It is chambered for a non-standard long
11mm cartridge which can be loaded with a single ball
round, potentially lethal pellets or lighter flechettes,
or a number of specialist payloads. As a large-calibre
smoothbore in a handgun frame it kicks hard and is
inaccurate at any sort of distance, but its chunky and
generally down-to-business air of authority adds weight
to any argument. Adjudicators are favored by some
personnel who venture into the wilderness, as they can
be loaded with flechettes for use as snakeshot or with
signalling rounds.

**ADJUDICATOR**

Loaded with ball ammunition the Adjudicator is an
impressive-looking weapon with modest performance and
a short effective range. It comes into its own when loaded
with pellet shells, giving DM+5 to hit at close range and
delivering significant damage for a handgun. Performance
against armor is lamentable, however. Flechette

ammunition is similarly limited, though it is hard to miss
even a small rodent or snake with this loadout. Some users
prefer explosive ammunition, which hits hard but cannot
penetrate any hard surface or body armor – and this can
make it a liability to the user. However, even a miss with
an explosive round will make most assailants retreat.

Gauss assault weapons come in two general types:
submachineguns and automatic shotguns. In the GA-
100, bundles of needle-like projectiles are embedded in a
plastic ring which disintegrates almost immediately after
the bundle leaves the muzzle. The result combines the
hitting power and penetration of a gauss weapon with the
spread and knockdown capability of a shotgun.

ANHUR INDUSTRIES GA-100
With a short barrel and bullpup configuration the GA-100
is fast on target and easy to handle in a confined space. It
is heavy for an assault weapon but compensates for this by
delivering automatic fire with far better penetration than a
conventional shotgun. Indeed, over-penetration can be a
problem in a typical urban environment or within a lightly
built structure.

Gauss weapons do not suffer reduced damage due
to a short barrel, as the projectile is accelerated in a
very short distance within the receiver. Accuracy is
affected by using an Assault barrel, but the GA-100
is a close-quarters weapon so this is rarely a problem.

Anhur Industries produces a range of gauss weapons for
military and security use, including contracts to several
governments. The GC-24 is a compact, concealable
gauss pistol with minimal external projections to snag
on clothing. Its lack of external moving parts or a need
to eject cartridges allows the weapon to be fired from
inside a pocket or bag if necessary. Users generally
accept the high price tag in return for having a highly
effective pocket pistol if they need one. The GC-24's
high rate of fire gets through ammunition quickly, and
even with a capacity of 24 rounds this is not a weapon
for a sustained firefight... but that is not what it was
designed for.

24-round compact magazines are not compatible with
full-sized gauss rifles, but a standard gauss pistol
magazine can be used in this weapon. It will protrude

**ANHUR INDUSTRIES GS-40**

Anhur Industries markets two primary variants of its
flagship GS-40 gauss sidearm, both built on the same
receiver and using the same magazines. The GS-40
'Army Model' has a conventional length barrel and is
otherwise a standard gauss pistol. The 'Navy Model'
has an extended barrel more suited to a short assault
weapon, allegedly reflecting the preferences of certain
world governments' navies. Purchasers of the Navy
Model have the option of a detachable shoulder stock

- available in high-impact polymer or gorgeously carved
wood – which allows the weapon to be used as a sort of
carbine. The stock has an internal compartment housing
a holographic sighting device, the sensor for which
is located under the pistol's barrel. How many users
would seriously consider this a combat weapon is open
to debate, but it has found favor in the competitive
shooting community.

Penetration is slightly better using the longer barrel, and
accuracy is maintained to a much greater range.

Colvery's Stowaway is marketed as a concealable
emergency weapon for self-defence, but in truth it is better
suited to assassination. Built from exotic and expensive
materials, the weapon uses caseless 'stealth' ammunition
and does not need to eject cartridges. Moving parts are
minimal, and all are internal. The Stowaway has grip and
trigger safeties but is otherwise ready to fire the instant
the trigger is pulled. There is no selector; the Stowaway
empties its 6-round magazine in a single pull of the trigger,
and the rate of fire is so high that no operator can stop
mid-burst. All autofire attacks must be directed against
the same target. The result is a near-instant dump of
small-calibre bullets into the target. The inevitable slight
movement of the muzzle creates a phenomenon called
'zippering', with multiple narrow wound tracks close
together. This makes the resulting wound difficult to treat
even though each round is not very potent.

Most users carry the Stowaway as an assassination
weapon rather than a combat tool. Whether their intent
is to take out a selected target or put an enemy down
so the Traveller can grab a more effective weapon and
escape, the majority of users consider the Stowaway
to be a one-shot weapon and do not carry spare

ammunition. Those that do must buy pre-loaded
6-round magazines. Ammunition is rarely sold in bulk.
The enormous rate of fire of this weapon results in it
emptying itself in an instant; all Auto attacks must be
directed at a single target.

**HANGUL LIBERATOR**

**MULTI-BARREL WEAPON SYSTEM**

Hangul Arms and Tactical is a division of the Hangul
Corporation, which operates in a range of sectors. Its
innovative Liberator was developed as a derringer-
like weapon for last-ditch self-defence but has since
been adapted into other forms. The derringer has four
minimal barrels – so short the tips of the bullets can
be seen – fired in turn by a rotating firing pin. There is
no manual safety, just a grip safety and heavy trigger
pull. Recoil is not excessive but the muzzle blast from
this weapon is prodigious. The minimal barrel does
not allow rounds to reach anything like their design
velocity, limiting range, penetration and stopping power.
However, as a concealed backup gun or emergency
weapon to be carried in a vehicle the Liberator is viable.

Sometime after the derringer's introduction, Hangul
began marketing a variant with a much longer barrel,
equivalent to a short submachinegun. This 'Liberator
Defender' model shares the derringer's top-break
loading mechanism and carries only four rounds, but it
hits hard and can be useful in an emergency. The ability
to manually load the four chambers with specialist
ammunition appeals to some users, though the order

in which rounds are fired cannot be altered. Liberator
Defenders can be encountered loaded with distraction
or snakeshot ammunition to deter local wildlife, or with
more lethal loads as an emergency weapon. Even in
Defender configuration the weapon is short enough to
be carried in an elongated hip holster, whilst most users
of the derringer conceal it in a pocket or under clothing.

Either variant can be loaded with a single round of
any compatible ammunition type in a minor action,
but requires four minor actions to fully reload. The
derringer's poor performance against armor can be

offset with HEAP ammunition if available. Both versions
use a standard heavy pistol calibre, making access to
non-restricted ammunition cheap and simple.

Combat shotguns can be produced at TL4 upwards, and
are ubiquitous in the field. Despite the rather grandiose
title, the 'Guard' series of shotguns are conventional
pump-action weapons with a reputation for reliability
in the field. They are produced at TL8 but other than
the laser pointer are identical in function to lower-tech
weapons. The 'Bodyguard' is the standard security

variant, with a fixed stock and full-length barrel. The
'Point Guard' version is the same weapon, greatly
shortened and lacking any form of stock. It is intended
for use by the lead soldier in a patrol, who may have to
react quickly to a changing situation, or as a 'grab gun'
for security applications. Its limited ammunition supply
is offset by good knockdown power.

The standard Bodyguard shotgun's rated performance
is based on use of ball ammunition, but pellets are
more common. This reduces penetration but improves
the chance of a first-shot hit and potential knockdown
due to the spread of a pellet charge. The shortened,

stockless Pointguard variant has increased pellet
spread due to its assault-weapon length barrel. This
adversely affects penetration but does increase the
chance of a short-range hit.

assumes the user is an idiot. In addition to a grip safety,
magazine safety and a manual safety catch, there is
also a second grip safety on the forearm. This weapon
will not fire unless it is held correctly with an approved

down to reduce the amount of fiddling-about necessary

The 'Mark 1' is not a specific weapon, but represents the
typical early semi-automatic pistol developed by most
cultures. Mercenaries encounter so many of these, with
minor variations, that they are all lumped together as
'Mk1 handguns'. As military weapons, these guns are
usually chambered in a calibre around 10-11mm which
limits ammunition supply and imposes significant recoil.

Weapons of this type are often picked up as souvenirs or
on a 'might come in handy' basis and left in a soldier's
kit rather than being locked up in the armory. The unit's
commanders and logisticians may well know there are
guns lying around but be unable to inventory or properly
secure them. Some units buy large quantities of these and
similar weapons for use as sidearms. They are cheap and
reasonably effective, and arguably sidearms are not worth
the same level of spending as primary personal weapons.

MK 1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL

The Posi-9 is one of a great many semi-automatic
pistols on the market. These range from poorly made
offerings formed from cheap stampings in a mid-
tech workshop to more upmarket weapons like those
produced by Tacload. The Posi-9 is produced at TL9,
and takes advantage of advanced manufacturing
techniques, but is otherwise similar to the other
weapons grouped as 'autopistols' in mercenary jargon.

A burst-capable version of the Posi-9 is available,
which pushes the price up to Cr435. The advantages
of this modification are debated by many potential

TACLOAD ARMAMENTS
POSI-9 9MM SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL
buyers, but there are those who long for more
firepower from their handguns. A burst-capable
Posi-9 can be converted into a true 'autopistol' by
removing the burst limiter and filing away part of the
mechanism to increase rate of fire. A gunsmith might
charge Cr200-300 to do this, though any decent
armorer can make the modifications. Messing up
this job imposes Low Quality at a level equal to the
negative Effect of a failed Mechanics check. This
is not an official variant and would not normally be
offered for sale.

The Posi-9 and similar weapons are sometimes
encountered chambered for lighter ammunition,
especially if they have been converted to automatic
fire. A converted model has Recoil 5 – 3 for its damage
and 4 for its high Auto score, -2 for the weight of the
weapon. This makes the Posi-9 uncontrollable for those
who lack the training to use it properly, and highly
inaccurate in the hands of almost any user. The same
can be said for almost any full-auto handgun.

The concept behind the Crewmate was to create a
weapon capable of delivering good firepower from a
compact and easy-to-carry package, and which could
share magazines with standard service weapons. It is
built around a handgun type receiver, though with an
internal bolt and semi-bullpup configuration. Semi-
bullpup in this context means the magazine well and
the firing chamber are behind the handgrip, but there
is no shoulder stock. Making this configuration work
requires loading from the top of the weapon, which is
not intuitive for most users.

TACTICAL SYSTEMS INCORPORATED
CREWMATE PERSONAL DEFENCE WEAPON

Despite its slightly odd nature the Crewmate has
achieved reasonable market success. Examples are
often found clipped to vehicle crewmembers' hatches,
offering a chance to deliver heavy – if rather random

- firepower whilst escaping from a disabled vehicle.
The weapon is a bit too large to be holstered like a
pistol and, with a great deal of weight at the rear and
little to the front, suffers badly from muzzle climb.
Some users fit a longer barrel, which increases muzzle
velocity of the intermediate rifle ammunition, and find
a way to create a workable stock. This essentially turns
the Crewmate back into an assault rifle, which rather
defeats its purpose.

The chief advantage of the Crewmate is its small size

ASSAULT WEAPONRY
Close-assault weapons generally come in three types; high-firepower light automatic weaponry, weapons designed for
a fast knockdown such as assault shotguns, and specialist weapons developed to deal with a specific threat. Some
straddle the line between two or even all three of these applications.

Desperado is not a commercial designation, but a
generic term used to refer to basic submachineguns
thrown together in a workshop or built up from kits
sold on the open market. Several manufacturers supply
bolt-and-chamber kits along with dies and blanks for
making other components. Barrels may or may not
be supplied, and Desperadoes have been frequently

encountered with home-made smoothbore barrels.
This imposes Inaccurate -2. Hand-carved or crudely
machined wooden furniture is common. A badly made
Desperado may have Unreliable 1 or Hazardous -2;
occasionally both. The majority are decent enough
weapons if properly looked after, and lethal in the
hands of a determined – or desperate – user.

The typical Desperado uses a 20-round stick magazine
which may be carried under the barrel or to the side
depending on how the weapon was put together. Top-
loading and bullpup types have been encountered,
among other configurations. Ultimately the Desperado
is a device for spraying medium-calibre handgun

ammunition around, and it does it well enough. A
snail drum magazine, holding 50 rounds, is available
for Cr20. It makes the weapon unwieldy and is prone
to jamming. The standard 20-round magazine is a
common pistol size and readily available for Cr4 plus
the cost of ammunition.

HANGUL LIBERATOR
MULTI-BARREL WEAPON SYSTEM

The Eliminator was designed for people who know they
should have both hands on the wheel... but really do
not care. It is in some ways a standard small-calibre
submachinegun, but optimized for combat at extreme
close quarters. The weapon is officially aimed at those
who may have to use a shield or carry out tasks with the
other hand. Official marketing vids show cautious entry
teams moving through buildings, with the lead soldier
opening doors and carrying out all manner of tasks with
the offhand, the Eliminator held ready in the other. The
inevitable ambush is defeated by dramatic one-handed
shooting, emphasising accuracy and precision despite
having to guide a scared hostage or hold a grenade
ready with one hand. If the Eliminator is bought by
those who prefer to use a hand weapon – or another gun

- in their other hand, Ailene Armament is not reluctant
to meet their requirements.

ELIMINATOR CLOSE
ASSAULT WEAPON

Layout is conventional, with the magazine in front
of the trigger assembly. Unusually for a close-
assault weapon there is no foregrip. If the weapon
is to be used in both hands the usual practice is to
cup the front of the magazine well. This is effective
with standard magazines but when using extended
versions some users grip the magazine rather than
the well and pull back, misaligning the feed system
and potentially causing stoppages. The folding stock
is rarely used in extended mode, but when folded
acts as an elbow hook, allowing the weapon to be
supported at the rear if pulled in tight. The result is a
weapon that shoots much like a long pistol, but with
a high automatic rate of fire.

The Eliminator is nothing special as assault weapons
go when used two-handed – there are better guns
available for less money. However, it is highly effective
when combined with a shield for entry work, and the

marketing vids are not entirely misleading – the lead
soldier in an entry team needs a hand free to move
objects and open doors, and the Eliminator offers more
emergency firepower than a pistol whilst doing so.

Recoil is a problem for many users of one-handed
automatic weapons. The Eliminator has a nominal
Recoil 2 when firing in fully-automatic mode,
controllable for most well-trained personnel. The
addition of an integral recoil compensator reduces this
to zero, enabling anyone with the most basic of training
to shoot full-auto without undue difficulty.

Many users prefer armor-piercing ammunition
to compensate for the Eliminator's low-powered
projectiles, whilst others use enhanced-wounding
rounds which spread on impact. This reduces
penetration but increases the chance of putting a
target down with one burst.

ELIMINATOR CLOSE ASSAULT WEAPON

The Infantry Assault Weapon, TL12, or IAW-
12, is essentially a submachinegun using
electromagnetic propulsion instead of a
conventional firearm mechanism. It is intended
for urban combat at moderate to short ranges,
and emphasises firepower over accuracy. Rate of
fire is high but the low recoil of gauss weapons
and overall layout creates a controllable and
comfortable-to-shoot weapon whose sole
purpose is to get a lot of gauss needles into a
target at close range, and do it in the shortest
possible time.

INTERSTELLAR ORDNANCE IAW-12
A conventional layout was chosen, with the magazine
well located between the front and rear pistol grips.
This gives a balanced feeling which is excellent for
hip-shooting during an assault. The only accessory
provided as standard is a laser pointer; a set of iron
sights is provided but most owners never use them.
Safety devices are limited to the usual grip and
magazine safeties, with a manual safe/semi-auto/full-
auto selector, oversized to facilitate rapid action. If an
ambush or emergency requires maximum response, the
user can yank the selector all the way and instantly let
rip, taking the time to select semi-automatic if precision
is required. This setting is rarely used, though some
owners obtain an after-market folding stock and add an
optical sight to create a carbine of sorts.

ammunition and holds 72 gauss needles plus a

weapon, so some users prefer to carry the IAW-12 with
a 40-round gauss pistol magazine in place. For intense

The Planetsider is slightly unusual in that it attempts
to bridge the gap between close-range personal defence
weapons and serious combat weaponry. It was developed
as a security weapon for starship crews, balancing
firepower and a reasonable effective range – for a light
automatic weapon – with a short length and ease of
handling. The result is a surprisingly accurate carbine-
length submachinegun.

UNIFIED SPACE
INDUSTRIES PLANETSIDER
The Planetsider is heavy for a weapon of its type, but the
weight is mostly at the rear which helps bring the muzzle
up quicky when needed. Despite its barrel length the
Planetsider is short overall, and equally suited to fast-
moving operations inside a starship or combat in the open.
The optical sight is rarely used in magnification mode but
provides fast target acquisition at moderate ranges.

The weapon's designers decided to cram in as much
ammunition capacity as possible, creating a heavy SMG
with almost as much capacity as a standard one. For
those who require more firepower a 40-round casket
magazine is available for Cr40 and a 70-round drum

and eliminates many of the weapon's quick-reaction
advantages. With any kind of magazine in place the
Planetsider's weight absorbs recoil well, removing the
Bulky trait.

COMBAT WEAPONRY
Combat weaponry includes most weapons intended to be used in battle, where it may be necessary to engage
targets across short to relatively long ranges. Preferences vary; some users like short, handy, low-recoil weapons well
suited to urban combat or frequent moves in and out of vehicles, whilst others prefer hard-hitting weapons suited
to longer ranges. It is not uncommon to encounter support versions of a battlefield rifle. Whilst these are not true
machineguns and overheat rapidly when conducing sustained fire, they offer enhanced firepower in a configuration
that can be taken over by any rifleman and usually share ammunition feed devices with the rest of the squad.

The GR-80 gauss rifle is manufactured at TL13 along
with Anhur's other gauss weapons, but is functionally
little different to TL12 gauss weapons produced by
other companies. Its bullpup design takes advantage of
gauss weaponry's lack of an ejection system, creating an
ambidextrous rifle of short overall length.

**ANHUR INDUSTRIES GR-80**

The standard-configuration weapon has a carbine-length
barrel and is equally well suited to the assault role or
combat at battlefield ranges. The multispectral scope
can be omitted, saving Cr600 and 0.5kg, though it is
often replaced with a simpler optical sighting device.

In addition to the standard GR-90, a light support
variant is offered, built on the same receiver but using
a heavy, heat-dissipating barrel. This is significantly
longer than the standard carbine barrel, but in all other
ways the support version is identical to the infantry

weapon. As a result any trooper in a squad can take over
the support weapon at need. A 150-round extension
magazine is issued to support gunners, though since the
weapon can use either it is often 'borrowed' by rifle-
armed soldiers when their own ammunition runs low.

The AIWS is manufactured on a modular basis,
enabling users to purchase either a weapon
configured to their own specifications or a collection
of parts to enable various configurations to be put
together as required. The system is built around
a commonly available intermediate calibre round,
which is normally manufactured at TL10. Near-
identical ammunition is available down to TL6,
though prolonged use with such less finely machined
munitions will increase barrel and chamber wear.

The system uses a common receiver, with the firing
chamber located in conventional manner in front of
the handgrip. In standard configuration this weapon
is set up with a rifle-length barrel and fixed stock,
with a standard 1.5/2.5/4x optical sighting device
for general combat operations. The same receiver is
used in all configurations, and it is the intermediate
rifle cartridge fired that determines the weapon's base
characteristics.

The intent from the outset was to create a high-
capacity weapon, and in this the designers
succeeded. Nominal magazine size is 43 rounds, but
42 are normally loaded to prevent misfeeds. Standard
magazines cost Cr14 unloaded, with an extended
casket magazine available for support work. These
cost Cr28 and hold 64 rounds.

•  (A)Rifle Configuration: The standard configura-
tion of this weapon is a lightweight assault
rifle of conventional layout, with an effective
range of around 300m. The variable scope/
sight permits accurate fire out to much great-
er distances, and is rarely dismounted. Barrel
and stock can be detached in a matter of
moments without the use of tools. Some users
prefer to use a folding stock, which reduces
weight a little. The primary advantage of a
folding stock is ease of handling in a confined
space; with the stock folded the weapon gains
Quickdraw +2.
•  (B)Carbine Configuration: The AIWS is often
configured as a carbine for use by troops
whose primary speciality is not direct infantry
combat. In this configuration it has a carbine
barrel and folding stock, but is otherwise the
same as the rifle variant.

**INTERSTELLAR ORDNANCE ADVANCED**

**INFANTRY WEAPON SYSTEM**

•  (C)Light Support Weapon Configuration: The
light support weapon variant can be used
by anyone trained to use the rifle. It has a
heavier barrel and normally fed from extended
(casket) magazines but can take any feed
device compatible with the AIWS family of
weapons. Drum magazines are sometimes
used, but this makes the weapon clumsy and
is favored only when the support weapon is
mounted on a pintle or similar mounting.
•  (D)Assault Variant: Some users choose to
configure the weapon with an assault barrel,
vertical foregrip and no stock for close-assault
work, removing the scope as well. This reduces
effectiveness at range but is useful in urban
combat or assault situations. Casket maga-
zines are sometimes used in this role, but their
extra bulk can detract from the weapon's main
advantage which is getting into action quickly
when hostiles are suddenly encountered.

**TACLOAD ARMAMENTS INTRUDER**

**URBAN COMBAT WEAPON SYSTEM**

'Urban Combat Weapon System' is Tacload-speak for
an integrated assault rifle and breaching shotgun.
The weapon is most definitely geared towards urban
combat, ranging from one-block firefights to desperate
scrambles on the stairwell of an office building. The
receiver is constructed in bullpup configuration, with
the 36-round magazine inserted through the underside
of the fixed stock. Function of the rifle components is
conventional, with full or semi-automatic fire available.
A laser pointer and 1.5/2.5/4x magnification optical
sight are fitted as standard.

A secondary weapon is fitted under the barrel. This
is a very short shotgun, whose handgrip is used as a
vertical foregrip when firing from an 'assault stance' –
more Tacload-speak, this time a euphemism for blazing
away from the hip. The shotgun is fired using the fore
hand, meaning both weapons can be discharged at
once – albeit with DM-2 on both attack rolls. The short

barrel of the shotgun produces a very broad spread
of shot. Whilst the shotgun is intended for breaching
internal doors during urban combat, it does offer good
knockdown capability in an unexpected close-range
encounter. The shotgun holds one shell in the breach
and two in its short tube magazine.

One common variant exists, in which the under-barrel
shotgun is replaced with a rail launcher for an adapted
rifle grenade. Grenades cost double normal price, and
have a two-stage motor. The launching charge propels
the grenade far enough away from the user that the
main stage does not cause injury, though the weapon
can still be unpleasant to use. Commonly, HEAP
grenades are used to breach heavy doors or building
walls, or attack light vehicles from ambush. Other
grenade types may be substituted as necessary. With a
grenade fitted to the rail, the weapon weighs about the
same as with the shotgun. Reloading a grenade onto the
rail is a fiddly business requiring 1D+3 Minor Actions.

Tactical Systems Incorporated markets a wide range
of mid-tech weaponry, which most people believe is
designed and built in-house. This is only partially true;
TSI generally works from common designs found on
many worlds, creating a generic all-markets version
which is then commonly built under license. Quality of
these outsourced weapons is generally of an acceptable
level, though the occasional 'gin special' is found which
appears to have been assembled by a band of drunks
after a good night out. Weapons made in-house do not
suffer from these quality-control issues but it can be
hard to spot whether a batch has been manufactured
directly or bought in.

The Squadmate is a simple and effective battle
rifle design, conventionally laid out and with few
noteworthy features. It uses commonly available

7.5mm battle rifle ammunition and shares magazine
compatibility with a great many weapons. In
comparison with the intermediate calibre assault
rifles favored by many militaries, the Squadmate hits
harder and is accurate to a greater range, but heavier
and carries less ammunition. As a semi-automatic
weapon it cannot lay down suppressing fire in the
manner of an assault rifle, but those who favor it
claim this is offset by the ability to shoot precisely
rather than hosepiping the countryside.

The Squadmate is used as the basis for a marksman
rifle. Usually this is a matter of picking the very best
examples when weapons are bench-tested, then
working through an accurising process. In addition to
using a longer barrel and adding a scope, rifles are
hand-finished to a high standard. This drives up the
cost in return for a small improvement in performance.

LOW-G WEAPONS
Specialist weapons intended for low-gravity work are commonly built around the 'snub pistol' round and designed
to minimise the positional disruption caused by firing them. Barrels are often set low compared to conventional
firearms, directing recoil into the user's center of mass rather than causing muzzle flip and rotation of an unsecured
user. The relative power of snub weapons makes them attractive in some other applications as well; snub revolvers
are used as emergency weapons in some groundside installations.

A rather unusual offering from BeraTech, the Sentinel
uses a fatter and shorter version of standard accelerator
rifle ammunition, which is not compatible with other
weapons. Spin is imparted to the projectiles by
angulated thrust rather than rifling and initiation is
electrical, with no external hammer or other moving
parts. The whole weapon is treated to remain functional
in conditions of extreme cold and vacuum.

Ammunition is carried in a revolving cylinder made of
lightweight plastic. This is sufficient to withstand the
very modest chamber pressure and not inconsiderable

heat developed by a rocket-powered projectile
beginning its acceleration. A partially expended
cylinder can be refilled with loose ammunition once
or twice, but the manufacturer recommends against
more than one reloading. Cylinders are intended to be
disposable, and reloading is accomplished with a top-
break action. If done gently this retains the cylinder in
place. A sharp jerk of the barrel downward ejects the
entire cylinder. Unwary users reloading a Sentinel in
zero-g may be hit in the face by the cylinder, though
this is unlikely to do any harm. A complete cylinder

Although only holding four rounds, the Sentinel is
light and extremely easy to use. Its rocket projectiles
continue accelerating after leaving the barrel, so
range is not affected by barrel length. Many users
prefer high-explosive ammunition, oddly enough, for

safety reasons. An explosive round will detonate upon
hitting almost anything, whereas most other types
may ricochet and continue accelerating with entirely
unpredictable results.

Most special-purpose low-recoil ('snub') weapons are
standalone designs, but Unified Space Industries
has recently begun offering a configurable weapon
system built around a common receiver. Weapons are
available singly or in batches as a whole unit, or as
a kit containing all the necessary parts to make each
variant along with a single receiver. The weapon is well
put together, and capable of withstanding extreme
conditions including vacuum and high temperatures.

As a straightforward snub pistol the Shipmate is
grossly overpriced and rather bulky, though it does
offer the advantage of burst-capability. This is
surprisingly controllable even in low gravity, largely due
to the weight of the weapon. The primary advantage of
this weapon system is the ability to purchase multiples
and set up a full security armament with personnel
able to carry a handgun and carbine or close-assault
weapon that use the same magazines, or swap out
components as the need arises.

All variants normally use the same 20-round
magazines, which cost Cr10 plus ammunition cost
if bought singly. A 30-round extended magazine is
available for Cr15. It extends beyond the base of the
magazine well and makes the weapon impossible to
holster if in handgun configuration.

**Handgun Configuration:** The default setup for this weapon
system is a heavy burst-capable handgun, typically
loaded with simple ball ammunition. This weapon is
quick on target with Quickdraw 8 and potentially more
menacing than a conventional handgun. Standard ball
ammunition is the most common loading.

**Assault Weapon Configuration:** By adding a folding stock
and assault barrel, cost is increased to Cr610 and
weight to 1.5kg. Effective range is greatly increased,
to 20m, and penetration improved as well. Assault
weapons are typically left in a very 'clean' condition,
with few or no accessories to snag during a quick
deployment. The example here is rated using ball
ammunition in a standard 14-round magazine.

Carbine Configuration: Using a fixed stock and carbine-
length barrel, the Shipmate is converted into a
weapon capable of engaging targets at a modest
range – such as aggressors storming across a starport
landing area. It is usually equipped with a basic
optical combat sight giving the Scope trait. Cost is
increased to Cr610 and weight to 1.6kg, while range
is increased to 45m. Whilst not capable of counter-
sniper wok the carbine is an effective local defence
weapon with a useful burst fire capability.

SHIPMATE ARMAMENT SYSTEM**

The Ten-Six (10mm calibre, six shots) is in most ways
a conventional snub pistol. It is a top-break revolver
designed for rapid reloading using speedloaders, even
when wearing vacc suit gloves. Its vacc suit-friendly
design also includes an enlarged trigger guard and
wrist lanyard, along with a general lack of projections
to snag on or – in a worst-case scenario – rip a suit.
The Ten-Six is produced at TL9 using advanced
projectile weapon technologies, creating a weapon
with a slightly longer accurate range than is typical of
snub handguns. Whether this is worth the extra cost
is a factor debated by many potential buyers.

Where the Ten-Six departs from conventional design
is the addition of a second barrel under the primary
one. This is a single shot smoothbore, operated by
pushing a lever to move the firing pin then triggered
with the primary mechanism. The original intent
was to allow the lower barrel to function as an
emergency line-gun, firing a self-adhesive fixing round
followed by 10m of fine wire. This version was not
very successful and the feature was subsequently
reinvented as a secondary combat capability. Many
users will carry a distraction round in the lower barrel,

either to shock intruders or permit a warning shot
that no court can claim went unnoticed. Flechette
ammunition, carried to deal with small vermin, is
also popular. More gung-ho users may prefer to load a
pellet shell. This removes the Zero-G trait when used,
and cannot be fired at the same time as the primary
barrel. The weapon's very short barrel renders pellets
ineffective beyond point-blank range but their spread
makes it difficult to miss.

Performance with ball ammunition is modest, so most
users prefer to load HEAP. This offsets the weapon's
lamentable performance against armor but cannot

make up for its low muzzle velocity. On the plus side,
the Ten-Six is a very short weapon and easy to use at
close quarters, even in conjunction with a riot shield.

LIGHT SUPPORT WEAPONS
Light support weapons are designed to be integrated at the squad level, giving a unit some measure of self-support
capability. Weapons such as light missile launchers and grenade launchers are sometimes referred to as 'problem
solvers' – whether the problem is a sniper shooting from a window or a heavily fortified machinegun nest. Some
unit commanders frown on the use of expensive guided weapons to take out an infantry position, but the cost of
recruiting and training replacement personnel might be much higher.

Direct-fire support weapons such as machineguns offer much the same options a rifle squad already has – but more
of it. Some light support weapons are built on a rifle receiver and in truth are little more than overgrown rifles, but
these weapons are limited by their ability to dissipate heat. Dedicated support weapons are generally much more
capable of sustained fire and have the capacity to change barrels, allowing one to cool whilst another is in use.

Accelerator weapons are not universally admired; lasers
and low-velocity conventional projectiles are generally
preferred. Those militaries that use the accelerator
weaponry have long lamented the lack of support versions,
prompting BeraTech to introduce the Guardian heavy
accelerator weapon. Essentially a large-calibre, fully-
automatic variant of the accelerator rifle, the Guardian
has been adopted for support work by forces that would
otherwise not even look at accelerator weapons.

Layout is conventional, with a detachable magazine
loading in front of the trigger assembly. The weapon has
a long barrel but no bipod, as it is intended to be used

on the move. The most likely combat environment is
low gravity or microgravity, fighting on moons or aboard
vessels and space installations. In standard gravity this
weapon would be heavy and unwieldy, but whilst it still
has considerable inertia a skilled user learns to make use
of the stately swing of the barrel in much the same way
a sporting shotgunner might favor a heavier gun for its
steadiness on the traverse.

One advantage of accelerator weapons is the lack of barrel
heating compared to conventional firearms. Rockets
will heat the barrel eventually but sustained fire can be
maintained as much as five times as long without causing
a malfunction.

Ball ammunition is available for the Guardian, but it
is more commonly employed with explosive or HEAP.
Nominal ammunition capacity is 30 rounds, but
Guardian gunners tend to use a 75-round drum in the

weapon and 45-round casket magazines for reloading.
Drums are large and clumsy, so it is rare to see them
carried as spare ammunition unless the unit has a
munitions robot available.

SQUADMATE BATTLE RIFLE

Like many weapons from DMS, the Solo is a 'problem-
solver' – in this case the problem being armored troops
and light vehicles. It is very finely made at TL14, to the
closest tolerances and with great attention to detail.
The designers wanted to create a powerful and accurate
weapon that retained its effectiveness even when in
the field for extended periods. Lightness was also an
important factor, as the user might have to get into
awkward spaces.

**DIVERSIFIED MILITARY SYSTEMS**

**SOLO GAUSS SNIPER RIFLE**

Unusually for a sniping weapon, the Solo is capable
of fully-automatic fire. It is rarely used in this manner,
though sometimes bursts can help in getting a round on
target when making a marginal shot. The very low recoil
and lack of internal moving parts associated with gauss
weapons makes this a viable strategy. The rugged design
allows the weapon to retain accuracy whilst being
banged around in the field, but ultimately it is battery
life that limits effectiveness. Sighting and propulsion
both draw heavily on the weapon's batteries, imposing a
limitation not faced by conventional sniping weapons.

As a primarily aerospace company, Jervaux produces
only a few firearms and most of those are intended
for the starship-security marketplace. The Reliant is
no exception, but has found its way into the arsenals
of numerous mid-tech governments seeing a solution
to the problem of penetrating the armor worn by
planetary raiders or higher-tech enemies.

The Reliant is by no means a cheap weapon but is
effective in a support or general combat role. Its
shortened barrel and folding stock are intended to

make movement in and out of vehicles – or within
starships – easier but also lend themselves to using
the weapon like a heavy assault rifle. Nominal
magazine capacity is 37 rounds, but magazines of this
size are rare. Instead, a 50-round extended magazine
is favored by almost all users. This, combined
with an increased rate of fire, makes the Reliant an
unexpectedly good close-assault weapon. It is still a
light machinegun, however, and cannot react to threats
as quickly as a rifle or assault weapon.

Users who fear attack by heavily armored raiders or
pirates typically use the Reliant with advanced armor-
piercing ammunition as standard. This gives a roughly
8% chance of penetrating TL10 combat armor on any

given hit. The weapon's high rate of fire ensures a lot of
hits which, even if not particularly damaging, are likely
to cause raiders to reconsider their lifestyle choices.

are subject to the ammunition capacity reduction (or
increase) for their calibre, whilst those that are belt-fed
can use any length of belt. Changing a belt takes longer
than swapping a magazine; typically 4 minor actions.

The typical Jimpy-G is belt-fed, with belt lengths of 40-
50 rounds typically set up prior to beginning a mission.
Disintegrating-link belts can be made in any length,
but most weapons of this type use a drum, box or bag
to prevent the belt from swinging around whilst on the

move. This limits belt sizes to what will fit in the box.
Commonly GPMG teams are made up of three soldiers,
with each of the loaders carrying lengths of belt and
a spare barrel. A standard length of belt weighs about
1.5kg, with a spare barrel at 7.5kg.

SPECIALIST WEAPONS
A variety of specialist weapons are available to mercenaries who feel a need for them. Most have a limited range of
applications and may not be considered worth the effort needed to transport them, but for other units a particular
capability might be a must-have.

The Military Flame-61 has been in service for many years
and has become an industry standard in easily portable
flame weapons. Cheap copies continue to appear, some
of which are quite good and others a hazard to everyone
involved. The Krabbine weapon looks like a chunky rifle,
which is an advantage as flame weapon gunners tend to
attract a lot of enemy fire if identified. It is fed from a
combined fuel/propellant tank loaded through the stock
in the manner of a bullpup assault rifle. If other members
of a unit carry spare tanks the flame weapon can be kept
in action almost constantly since reloading is extremely
quick and simple.

The MF-61 stands out from its rivals for having additional
safety features, which drives up the price but reassures
the soldiers selected to use it. With a Mishap Threshold
of 5, flame weapons such as this one are potentially a
danger to their users. The weapon's armor helps prevent
a penetrating shot whilst its extensive safety features
reduce the chance of a catastrophic fuel ignition.

The MF-61 carries enough fuel and propellant for four
attacks, and is reloaded using bulky 4.4kg en-bloc fuel
modules. Although heavy and blocky the weapon is
easy to handle and generally reliable. Its fuel contains
an additive that produces heat upon exposure to air,

self-igniting with no need for a flame at the nozzle. This
does mean the MF-61 cannot be used for 'hose and
ignite' applications, but it is a combat weapon rather
than one intended to destroy property.

The Cryojet was not intended to be used as a weapon,
and for the most part it is not. It is a backpack-fed
projector device developed for spacecraft emergency
crews. The projector's cryogenic fluid can be used
to extinguish fires or make doors and sections of
wreckage brittle, enabling them to be easily shattered
or punctured. Security crews occasionally found the
projector useful against intruders or hijackers, though
use on personnel targets is vaguely 'advised against'
by the manufacturer. Over time the Cryojet became a
recognized tool in the arsenal of some military forces,
though it remains primarily a breaching aid rather
than a weapon.

The combat Cryojet is a weaponised version of the
rescue/firefighting system. In addition to armored and
bulwarked tanks it mounts a large-calibre smoothbore
weapon under the cryogenic nozzle. This can be used to
deliver shotgun rounds for emergency self-defence, but
is more commonly employed with specialist 'breaker'
ammunition. It is a tremendously heavy and bulky
device, and normally employed by specialists who
breach an area then step back to allow their more agile
comrades to enter. It is a deadly implement however,
and can be a nasty surprise for those who think heavy
armor makes them invulnerable.

Breaker shells launch a pattern of small explosive
charges with an adhesive head, which detonate almost
instantly upon fixing to the target. They can be fired as
a combat round but more commonly they are used to
shatter something made brittle by the cryogenic fluid. If

a breaker round is used with the cryogenic fluid, this is
treated as a single attack. Alternatively the breaker can
be launched after the target has been given a thorough
hosing with cryogenic fluid. Either way, the end result is
to double the damage delivered by the cryogenic fluid.

LASER WEAPONS
Lasers are by far the commonest directed energy weapons on the battlefield. Their main drawback is an
inability to penetrate foliage and other minor obscurants, along with near-uselessness in heavy rain, dust or
mist. This has prevented lasers from being universally adopted, though they are popular with forces primarily
operating in a low-g environment.

Marketed by Personal Security Solutions, the BL-3 is
not intended for combat. It is a semi-covert weapon
for self-defence, favored by corporate executives who
like to pretend they are important enough to be in
danger. Those that enter the mercenary marketplace are
typically bought by personnel who must interact with
questionable clients.

The BL-3 has a short cylinder, usually of plain stainless
steel with a band around its circumference near one
end. This has a concealed section which acts as
a trigger when pushed with the thumb. Whilst not
actually disguised the BL-3 does not look like a weapon
and may not be noticed among paraphernalia on an
officer's desk or in an attaché case. It delivers three

laser shots – hence its full name of 'Bottled Lightning',
using disposable energy cartridges. These are held in a
screw-out section at the rear of the weapon and can be
replaced individually or all together. The process takes a
few minutes and is rather fiddly, however.

Although not a powerful weapon, the BL-3 has the
advantage of being almost completely silent. This may
enable the user to take additional enemies by surprise
if they do not realise what happened to the first target.
Marketing vids for this weapon depict a suave secret
agent effortlessly taking out four enemies – the last
by hurling the BL-3 at his head – but realistic users'
expectations are more modest. Nevertheless, as a silent
holdout weapon the BL-3 does have its uses.

**BL-3 EMERGENCY DEFENCE WEAPON**

The M-84 designation for this weapon was assigned
by one of the larger interstellar powers during trials,
and has become the standard identifier despite the
fact it was not adopted for service. The basic concept
was to create a battlefield laser weapon which could
be configured as a carbine, full-sized rifle or specialist
weapon. The resulting design required compromises
but has found favor with a number of low-g-trained
forces. It also serves as a personal weapon for some
forward observers, functioning as a designator as well
as combat carbine.

The weapon is supplied without a complex sighting
system, since some users choose to fit a holographic
sight rather than a physical one, and others have differing
preferences depending on the weapon's intended role.
The design is not modular in the sense that it is not
possible to remove and replace the barrel in a few
moments without tools. Mounting a different barrel in a
laser weapon is a delicate process requiring a workshop,
not difficult but requiring calibration. A badly mounted
barrel can absorb some of the laser's energy – in effect
the weapon shoots itself. This can have catastrophic
results, making modular laser weapons distinctly rare.

The M-84 has an internal power reserve good for 14
shots, but this is not sufficient for sustained combat.
Typically the weapon is used with a 3kg power pack
carried low on the user's back. This provides 2,100
Power, or 420 shots, which is likely to be more than
enough. A 1kg belt pack good for 140 shots is also
available for Cr1500.

When set up as a carbine the M-84 is limited by the
length of its barrel to 4D damage. Each shot still costs
5 Power. If configured as a rifle, usually with a full
stock, the weapon does 5D damage and has a greater
effective range. The rifle variant costs the same as the
carbine but weighs 5kg.

M-84 LASER WEAPON SYSTEM

Named after an ancient god of the first sunlight,
the Nefertem 'Personal Directed Energy Weapon'
is an entry-level laser pistol designed to be used in
conjunction with an external powerpack. Weapons of
this type are sometimes installed in spacecraft for the
defence of specific points, with power outlets located
at intervals. The concept is unpopular with most users,
since being tethered to a single location or trailing a
long power cord around can be a problem in combat.
However, as a means of saving the weapon's powerpack
for mobile use it has some advantages.

The Nefertem weapon is standard as laser pistols go,
though it has a longer than usual barrel. Range is
limited, as with all short-barrelled laser weapons, and
stopping power is at best modest. Nevertheless, the
weapon is sufficiently popular with merchant starship
security crews that it has become a household name in
the entry-level energy weapons market.

The standard powerpack for this weapon is a 1kg belt-
mounted unit with a capacity of Power 300. These
are drained at the rate of 3 per shot. The powerpack
is designed to plug into any standard power outlet for
charging. Aboard a starship or military vehicle this will
not cause any problems but civilian power systems

are not designed to support multiple lasers charging
at once. The power drain may be noticed or could trip
safety devices. Many hotels have a 'no laser charging'
rule, and signs indicating this are popular souvenirs
among Travellers who have broken this rule.

LAUNCHERS
Some launcher weapons are extremely simple, especially low-tech ones designed for use with 'dumb' projectiles, and
in some cases can be thrown together in a blacksmith's workshop. More advanced weapons incorporate electronics
or use complex materials that drive up their purchase price considerably. Ultimately, however, it is the warhead that
counts. Everything else is dedicated to getting it to the target.

The IP-2 is a disposable one-shot unguided rocket
launcher constructed from lightweight polymers. Its sole
purpose is to send a 50mm rocket-propelled grenade
on its way. The latter has a white phosphorous warhead
which creates a dense cloud of white smoke and may
pose a hazard to any personnel within the burst radius.
It is officially marketed as a 'battlefield concealment

A spigot mortar is one of the most basic methods of
launching a rocket-propelled grenade, and is typically
referred to simply as 'RPG' even though the term
properly applies to the projectile rather than the
launcher. The device itself is nothing more than a
hollow post with handles and a basic optical sighting
device. A rocket-propelled grenade is fitted to the
front of the weapon and launched in a shallow arc or
flat trajectory. Devices of this kind are typically used
for direct fire against armored vehicles or infantry

positions, but can pose a threat to grav vehicles and
aircraft. Dedicated RPG launchers of this type are
common among mid-tech forces that face a threat
from higher-tech militaries, and may be issued in
disproportionate numbers. The concept is reinvented at
TL8, when a basic guided version becomes available.
'Dumb' RPGs can still be launched from this weapon.
The standard spigot mortar costs Cr500 and weighs
10kg with a grenade in place. The guided variant costs
Cr1000 and adds the Smart trait.

The cost and weight of the weapon are calculated with
one anti-armor grenade in place, which is the usual
configuration. It is unusual, but not unknown, for users
to carry a mix of grenade types. However, the standard

role of these weapons is to engage armored vehicles
and every grenade of another type is extra weight to
carry which does not serve that purpose.

The Light Munitions Launcher is a magazine-fed semi-
automatic grenade launcher developed for riot control
and security work, but which sees action in a variety of
roles. Its short barrel and bullpup configuration are well
suited to close-quarters work, and the limited effective

three multiple projectile rounds for room clearance.

either guided antipersonnel fragmentation grenades
or multiple projectile shells. Loading is rarely mixed
as the grenades are launched in sequence, though a
squad preparing to breach a room or position might

try to set up a pre-selected sequence to maximise
their advantages. In such a situation a distraction
grenade immediately followed by gas then baton

One of the lightest TAC missile launchers available,
Xierbin's TMMS is designed to be carried by a team of
two infantry soldiers, one with the launcher and one
carrying a loaded missile magazine. Additional missiles
or magazines can be shared out among the squad. The
weapon is fed from a 2-round over-under magazine
located at the rear of the receiver. Launch takes place
directly from the magazine, which then rotates on a
pivot to present the second weapon. Once both have
been launched can be ejected and replaced with a fully
loaded magazine, or reloaded with loose missiles.

one anti-personnel and one anti-armor – and can
switch between the two by triggering the magazine
rotate function. A magazine with two missiles aboard

GRENADES AND WARHEAD DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Grenades and warhead weapons tend to fall into four categories. Those intended to directly inflict casualties are generally
of an explosive type, either as anti-personnel or anti-armor weapons, though other options are available. Those intended
to degrade the capabilities of an enemy typically use gas, flash or noise, possibly in the form of a stunning concussion
effect, and might be termed distraction grenades. The third type of grenade alters the tactical situation, usually by
obscuring vision or making laser-based devices ineffective. Smoke can also be used for signalling. Signalling grenades
typically use colours or – at higher Tech Levels – laser-reflective particles that can identify one pall of smoke from another.
Signalling grenades cost the same as a smoke grenade of the type but are little use as obscurants.

A typical light guided TAC missile, the AV-7 is
designated Tactical, Light, Multipurpose Anti-Vehicular
in most military directories. Its guidance electronics
and supporting sensors are capable of tracking fast-
moving targets at high and low altitude, though in
order to intercept fast-crossing targets the operator
must provide the missile with considerable lead. The
multimode warhead can be detonated as a fragmenting
charge to give the best chance of a hit on an aircraft,
or as a shaped-charge against armored targets. The
fragmentation effect is not intended for use against
personnel; it produces multiple large fragments rather
than a hail of smaller ones, and is likely to miss

something as small as an individual soldier. Proximity
detonation grants an additional DM+2 to hit vehicular
targets but significantly reduces damage. Missiles weigh
6kg and cost Cr12000.

A low-tech solution to the problem of armored
vehicles, the anti-armor grenade also offers marginal
capability against combat armor and battle dress. The
hand-thrown version is a weapon of utter desperation
against such opponents as it requires getting very
close and hoping the weapon hits cleanly. Even then,
the focussed plasma jet created by its shaped-charge
warhead is generally ineffective, but enough of these
weapons can make the battlefield unhealthy for
armored troops. A hand-thrown anti-armor grenade
costs Cr50 and weighs 0.5kg. The rifle grenade version,
with much better range and accuracy, costs Cr100 and
weighs 0.625kg.

**GRENADE, MINI,**

**MULTI-PURPOSE ANTI-PERSONNEL**

**GRENADE, MINE DELIVERY**

A small grenade with advanced fusing, these weapons
are often carried in threes. The advanced fuse allows
the grenade to be impact-fused or set to detonate
one to ten seconds after impact, or after a one to ten
second delay. A 'mine' setting also permits a grenade
to emplaced as a booby trap, detonating if disturbed.
Depending on the sensitivity chosen this may require
a sharp knock or something as minor as being tapped
by a door as it opens. The detonation power can also
be selected. Normally full power is chosen, creating a
blast type anti-personnel effect with small amount of
fragmentation. Damage can be selected as 1D, 2D or
3D, or the grenade can detonate in distraction mode
in which case is causes a Typical level distraction but
no damage. Multi-purpose grenades are expensive but
considered worth it by some users. A single grenade
weighs 0.3kg and costs Cr35.

Mine delivery grenades are unusual, but sometimes
used to deploy anti-personnel mines at a distance or in
inaccessible places. A mine delivery grenade is simply a
canister with a basic self-righting mechanism. Once in
place it can be remotely triggered or set to respond to a
certain level of vibration. This is a little random at times
but in theory a mine will activate when a person walks
within 2m of it. Anyone who knows what to look out for
can easily spot grenade-delivered mines in the open,
but even then their presence can impose delay. They are
commonly used as an early-warning system more than a
serious defence. The warhead can be any mini-grenade
type, though fragmentation and distraction types are
most common. Mine delivery grenades are only available
in standard cartridge and RAM grenade sizes.

Plasma grenades are rare among troops not equipped
with battle dress or combat armor, but sometimes
encountered as emergency weapons or extreme room-
clearance devices. The Smart-RAM grenade is designed
to be launched by one soldier and designated or actively
guided by another, though it can also be preprogramed
to travel to selected detonation point. The grenade
is capable of limited maneuver, so must be sent on
a trajectory that will bring it close to the intended
destination for the guidance to be effective.

The humble rifle grenade makes a resurgence once cheap
guidance kits become available. Basic guided grenades
are programmed with a location and launched in a
high arc, using inertial location or feeds from a satellite
communications network to alter their trajectory using
movable fins. A more advanced version is available for use
against armored targets. This is guided to the general
target location the same way, but then seeks the outlines
and signatures of a selected class of target. Usually this
will be lightly armored vehicles but grenades can be
programmed to seek battle dress-equipped infantry. A
top-attack profile makes these weapons useful against
lightly armored vehicles, and at least they will force
commanders to button up and stay behind armor. Basic
guidance adds Cr50 to the price of the grenade; terminal
seeking adds another Cr100 on top.

A cheap and often marginal solution to the problem
of armored vehicles and fortified positions, an RPG
typically carries a shaped-charge warhead capable
of damaging lightly armored vehicles. Grenades of
this type are cheaply made in mid-tech factories and
generally bought in large numbers. Accurate shooting
with an unguided rocket weapon is problematic,
making short-range ambush or massed fire the best
tactic. An anti-armor RPG costs Cr150 when bought
singly and weighs 5kg.

**PERSONAL EQUIPMENT**

**CHAPTER-SIX**

Personal equipment ranges from humble boots to
advanced electronic devices. The variations on offer
can be bewildering, but mercenaries typically avoid
gimmicky one-trick-pony items and extremes of high

and low price. Cost-effectiveness is usually the deciding
factor in choosing what equipment to issue to a unit,
though individuals may decide to provide themselves with
something a little more capable.

DEVICES
Many of the devices used by mercenaries are also found in specialist industries where protection or specific capabilities
are needed. Others are unique to the military marketplace. Civilians outside specialist industries may find it difficult to
obtain these devices, but they are generally available from mercenary outfitters.

Thermal regulation units are built into some advanced
armor, but more commonly available as a separate
item. Typically carried on an equipment belt and
connected to an environment suit or advanced field
dress, a thermal regulation unit acts as a heat sink
most of the time. It contains a gel with an extremely
high specific heat capacity, which can store thermal
energy taken from a suit or piece of equipment.
Devices of this kind can be used to cool suitably
adapted weapons, allowing protracted periods of rapid
fire, or can reduce the thermal signature of a soldier
wearing appropriate clothing.

If used to reduce thermal signature, a chill can
is good for around four hours, during which time
the user's thermal signature is reduced almost to
background levels. This imposes DM-4 on attempts
to detect, track or target the individual using thermal
sensors. By the end of the period the unit is saturated
and thermal suppression is lost. The gel does not
reach high temperatures; little more than the user's
body temperature, but a can could be deliberately
ruptured to create a thermal decoy. The unit can

('CHILL CAN')

protect the user against unpleasantly hot conditions
rather than reducing thermal signature, and in an
emergency a reverse reaction can be triggered which
introduces an additional chemical into the gel. This
produces a modest amount of heat which can be put
back into a suit to protect the user from cold.

If a chill can is used as a heat sink for weapons, it has a
capacity of 100 points of Heat. Each 25 points of Heat
reduces the duration of thermal signature reduction by
1 hour.

Faraday weave is a web of ultrafine metallic threads
within or under the fabric of a garment, camouflage
net or covering. The threads are too fine to provide any
protection from electromagnetic pulse; the induced
current will make them hot, possibly sufficiently so to
set fire to the garment or harm the wearer. However,
lower-intensity electromagnetic waves will be absorbed
and dissipated, concealing whatever is underneath.
The weave will also conceal low-level electromagnetic
emissions from equipment. Faraday weave is quite
expensive, costing Cr250 to install in a set of clothes or a
3x3m covering. A small belt-mounted power and control
device, costing Cr500, adds an additional capability;
whereas faraday weave normally blocks waves and
conceals what is behind it – but is itself very obvious

- the control device can be set to match the incoming
emissions, effectively rendering whatever it is covered in
invisible to radar and similar sensors. This is not perfect
but imposes DM-4 on attempts to detect the user with
radar and similar emissions.

**MATCH TARP**

A match tarp is a one-use camouflage device. Before
use it is a dull matte grey colour but when spread on
the ground its underside scans the terrain beneath and
triggers chemical changes in the upper side to match
it almost perfectly. A person or object placed under the
tarp will be almost perfectly concealed, and the tarp will

also spread out any thermal signature to make it far less
obvious. Once activated, the changes are permanent
but the tarp remains effective in the same terrain. A 3m
square tarpaulin – which is also weatherproof – costs
Cr250, whilst a smaller version large enough to cover a
prone sniper and weapon costs Cr150.

**THERMAL REGULATION COVERING**

A thermal regulation covering is supplied in a form
that can be used as a blanket or poncho, as half of a
field shelter, a groundsheet or a thermal camouflage
device. As a shelter or poncho it is normally worn
with the 'cool' side outward, keeping the wearer warm
whilst reducing their thermal signature. Turned around,
the covering will leech heat away from the user and
radiate it outside. This has a cooling effect and can
also be used as a distress or target-marking beacon. A
heat source placed under a thermal regulation covering
will create a large share of high thermal radiation
unlikely to be missed by sensors.

On its own a thermal regulation covering passively
provides thermal protection and dispersion sufficient
to provide DM+2 on all checks to resist harm from
cold or hot conditions, and DM-2 to attempts to spot
or target the user if used as camouflage. When used
with a small (pocket-sized) battery pack it can create
a warm shelter for some days, and with a chill can will
reduce the wearer's thermal signature to match the
surroundings. A standard thermal regulation covering
costs Cr50, with versions intended to fit a particular
environment or to match a sniper's camouflage costing
up to Cr150.

CLOTHING AND ARMOR
It is rare for any but the largest mercenary units to use custom-made equipment, and this applies equally to clothing and
armor. Day-to-day items like t-shirts and socks can be obtained commercially or ordered from a local supplier, whilst
uniforms tend to be selected from a range of items offered by mercenary outfitters. By selecting a combination of clothing
items, colours and configurable insignia, a unit can create a distinctive uniform without going to the expense of setting up
a bespoke outfit.

Most mercenary units have clothing for different occasions. Working dress is worn most of the time, and typically consists
of coveralls in the unit's style. Field dress is similar but more attention may be paid to camouflage. Field dress is intended
to be worn with body armor and combat equipment, and usually has attachment points for the unit's standard field
equipment. Most, but by no means all, units have a formal uniform. Mercenaries are rarely concerned with ceremony but
may need to look presentable to impress a client or when working with one under non-combat conditions. Full mess dress
uniform is very rare among mercenary units. The largest sometimes use it, as do some highly pretentious formations, but
as a rule a unit whose combat reputation does not justify frippery will attract ridicule.

Although commonly referred to as a uniform, discreet
operations clothing can be tailored in almost any style.
Operators may need to pass as ordinary civilians, or to
wear formal uniform but be ready for action. A discreet
operations uniform is tailored from light ballistic cloth
and has pockets suitable for concealing a handgun
and some small items of equipment. It is favored by
officers who have to do a lot of liaison work and cannot
be seen to be armed or mistrustful of their clients, but
also sees considerable use by covert-operations forces.

The uniform grants Protection +2 without appearing to
do so, and can be paired with what is inevitably known
as an 'indiscreet operations kit' consisting of a flak
jacket and associated supporting equipment. This is
normally black or green, but can be produced in other
colours. At a distance, someone wearing the full kit
might not attract notice but anyone taking a proper
look at the wearer will notice magazine pouches and an
obvious military styling even if the wearer does not have
a visible weapon. When paired up with the flak jacket
the kit offers Protection +6.

**DISCREET OPERATIONS UNIFORM**

An environment suit is not necessarily a piece
of military equipment. Hazardous-environment
workers use them, since they bridge the gap
between full vacuum protection and exposure
to airborne hazards. An environment suit is a
coverall-like garment with detachable boots and
gloves. It includes a hood which seals to a face
mask to give complete protection but is often
paired with a full helmet and/or chest unit.

On its own, an environment suit affords the
wearer Protection +3 against conventional
threats and an additional Protection +3 against
heat or cold attacks. Its belt unit has space
for an air bottle, rebreather unit and up to two
external thermal regulation units. With these in
place the suit can be made active, increasing
its defence against heat and cold to a total of
Protection +12. The suit can also be tuned to be
thermally neutral, or close to it, with respect to
its surroundings. This feature is rarely used in
industry but is useful to mercenaries.

A shoulder-and-helmet unit is available to pair
up with the suit. This is a full, sealed helmet
which provides better head and neck protection
than the flexible hood, and is heavier but more
comfortable than a mask. Most users have
devices mounted on the shoulder piece such
as flashlights, cameras and sensors which
display their information on the inside of the
user's faceplate. A chest piece is also available,
increasing armor to Protection +6 and housing
an array of tools or weapon pouches.

Advanced field dress is a more technologically advanced
version of enhanced field dress. It offers Protection +1
and DM+2 to resist chemical agents. Thermal protection
is increased to DM-2 for attempts to detect the user,
and if an external thermal regulation unit is in use the
suit can offer additional benefits.

Field dress bought in bulk tends to be serviceable
and hard-wearing but offers few benefits beyond
that. Enhanced field dress incorporates technological
advances to protect the user, including a technique
known as 'thermal dulling' whereby the wearer's thermal
signature is reduced and made fuzzy. This imposes
DM-1 on attempts to detect or target the wearer using
thermal systems. In addition, a suit of enhanced field
dress provides Protection +1 which stacks with other
armor worn over the top. Enhanced field dress is
not entirely impervious to airborne chemical agents
but does provide DM+1 to resist the effects of skin-
absorbed agents. The wearer needs an enclosed helmet
or breathing system to receive this protection from
airborne agents but would benefit from it when dashing
through a contaminated area without breathing, or in
case of a chemical splash.

**UNIFORM BUNDLE**

Commonly sold as a pack to individual mercenaries or

three sets of working dress, two sets of field dress and
one formal uniform to the unit's specifications. Formal
shoes and field boots are included along with headgear
and any minor accessories such as cap badges, rank
insignia and so forth. Costs can vary but typically a
bundle of this sort will cost around Cr50 depending on
the source and complexity of the outfits.

ELECTRONICS
Military electronics tends to be more robust and resistant to hazards like electromagnetic pulses than civilian
devices, though usually capabilities are about the same. Indeed, once the device is opened up it may well be exactly
the same as a civilian model, just housed in a milspec rugged case with a matte green finish. Military electronics
systems are always more expensive than their civilian counterparts, so units on a budget will often make do with
those. However, all military systems have at least some basic protection against hacking and electronic warfare – and
perhaps more importantly they have interoperability protocols which allow them to interface with other standardised
military systems.

A military portacomp can be plugged straight into an information or systems control net and used as soon as the
security protocols are satisfied. A civilian model would require additional software and possibly an external drive
containing the necessary operating system patches and interfacing software. Milspec electronics almost always has a
set of security protocols that impose a negative DM on attempts to hack or interfere with the system equal to 1 plus
1 per 2 full Tech Levels above the intruding system. This is in addition to any anti-intrusion software

**AUTOHACK**

Autohacks are palm-sized devices designed to crack
commonly available electronic security systems. They
are not creative or clever, but programmed to recognize
common security systems and automatically apply
exploits or make a targeted attack. Some systems require
all software producers to leave a backdoor for the security
services, in which case a properly authorized autohack
need do no more than input a request code. Autohacks
are useless against any system they do not know but
extremely useful in getting past mass-market security
software that would otherwise pose a significant problem.

Possession of autohacks is highly restricted, with black
market devices commanding high prices. Mercenary
units can usually obtain a license for the standard
autohack without undue difficulty, though their use will
occasionally be audited. A preprogramed autohack might
be provided for a particular mission, in which case it will
have been set up to defeat the target's security even if it
would normally be immune.

For example, a mercenary unit has been hired to
retrieve certain items from the evidence lockers of a
local police force. The cops are using a commercially
available security system – quite a good one in fact.
A standard autohack will defeat the security on most
personal devices found in the building, as these use
common systems 'known' to the unit, but it does not
have the tools to attack the specialist system at the
police station as its vulnerabilities are not widely known.
However, the client has obtained enough information
to put together a package that should be able to defeat
the system, and added it to a standard autohack. The
mercenaries now have a single autohack that can get
them through doors or into inventory systems. If it is not
available at any point they will have to use conventional
intrusion methods to get into the computer system or
parts of the building.

Autohacks require no skill to operate. They will normally
be able to interface with nearby electronic systems
without contact, but systems that do not communicate
wirelessly require access to the network. This may
require finding a suitable port, but from TL10 upwards
autohacks can use a close-contact induction system to
communicate with electronics that are not well shielded.
Military systems are generally immune to this form of
attack, but most commercially available networks are
not. A single action, such as opening a locked door or
gaining control over a camera, takes 1Dx10 seconds if it
is possible at all. Only one attempt can be made at any
one system – either the autohack can get in or it cannot.
Its chance of doing so is based on Tech Level but may be
modified for good or bad system security. If the Autohack
is of lower TL than the security system an additional
DM-1 applies for each TL below.

A comm scrambler is a small device usually fitted
inside the case of a standard personal comm or into a
port on a civilian portacomp. Normally, civilian devices
transmit and receive a standard code and style of
encryption for the network. This includes sufficient
encryption to secure comms against casual intrusion
but a comm scrambler provides much greater security
by making the signal indecipherable to the system's
own software. Another scrambler or a military device
with the correct decryption codes can read signals,
but anyone else would have to undertake a serious
decryption effort. More advanced units provide greater
security; DM-1 applies to any attempt to decrypt
scrambled comms per Tech Level the scrambler is
above the decryption system.

Interface boxes are a cheap and simple way to make
civilian electronic devices compatible with military
equipment. An interface box fits to an external port
on the device and allows physical and electronic
connection to a military network. The device contains
a small computer which translates signals going
in and out of the civilian device, essentially acting
as a translator. The interface box provides some
measure of electronic security to the device, but if it
can be bypassed the civilian device behind it is still
vulnerable to intrusion whereas a full military unit has
integrated protection.

**MILITARY PORTACOMP**

**MULTIFUNCTION ELECTRONIC DEVICE**

A military portacomp is housed in a lightly armored
case which will provide Protection +6 to the contents
or anyone hiding behind it. Cases are usually 'security
black' or 'military green' but do come in other
'tactical' colours. The case is ruggedised, as are the
internal components, and it will act as a faraday
cage when closed. If a Traveller has time to slam the
portacomp shut it will survive all but the most powerful
electromagnetic pulse attacks. A military portacomp
has interface systems for most standard equipment
so can be used to control or program a point defence
system, or undertake intelligence analysis work.
Capabilities are not dissimilar to civilian equipment of
the same Tech Level.

A Multifunction Electronic Device, or MED, is a small
wrist-mounted computer capable of being programmed
to interface with all common battlefield electronics.
Depending on the user's needs it can be set up to
control Smart-RAM grenades in flight, display sensor
data from a drone, monitor remote sensors, detonate
a charge on command, or all of those. An MED has
a modest amount of processing power and can run
guidance programs, but typically acts as an interface
rather than handling complex tasks itself.

**TACTICAL RELAY NETWORK**

It is possible to coordinate the actions of a small unit
using personal communications equipment, but as the
size of a force increases this becomes problematic.
At its most basic a tactical relay network organises
radio traffic into groups and channels. At TL6, when
the system first becomes available, this is done by
a manual operator but the role is soon taken over by
dedicated electronic systems.

A tactical relay network operates as a set of local
nodes, with members of different groups having access
to some or all available channels; members of first
section have their own internal comms, as does the
support section. Section leaders are tied in to the
platoon command net, and the platoon commander
is in the company command group. Automated
systems can devolve access if a sub-unit's command
transmitted goes offline, and most networks have
an emergency override that allows any member to
transmit right across the network if necessary. The
technological sophistication of the relay limits the
level of the Tactics skill that can be applied using it,
though a commander who can communicate directly is
not so limited. Thus the leader of a squad can always
use their full Tactics ability, but a commander two
kilometers away can only assist to the level permitted
by the network.

From TL8, visual information is shared in real time,
and in addition to radio sets the unit's members
are given body-worn or helmet cameras, and/or
gun cameras. These have provided a great deal of
evidence at inquiries over the years, and have useful
applications as training and debrief aids. TL9+ units
also project a holographic map of the battle zone with
individuals and groups marked by their transponder
codes. It takes a skilled user to make sense of all the
data but a commander can – in theory at least – see
where everyone is, how much ammunition they have
left, and whether they are injured.

A tactical relay network consists of a central relay
unit, housed in an 8kg backpack, and personal
equipment to be issued to each member of the unit.
The cost of the central unit depends on the size of
the network desired.

Platoon Network: Up to 50 users, Cr25000
Company Network: Up to 250 users: Cr100000
Battalion Network: Up to 1,000 users: Cr 250000

Increasing technological sophistication improves
performance rather than bringing cost down, and
individual-issue equipment must be purchased for
every user.

SENSORS AND TARGETING AIDS
Beyond immediate 'point and shoot' combat, one of the most decisive factors in battle is the quality of sighting aids.
Those that fit on a weapon are considered to be weapon accessories, but more sophisticated equipment is often
carried on the soldier's person, receiving input from sensors on the soldier's own weapon and possibly remote sensor
feeds too. Typically the resulting images and prompts are displayed on a helmet visor or similar physical surface but
can be projected as a hologram at a location designated by the user.

**BALLISTIC LOCATION SENSOR**

**BATTLEFIELD COORDINATION UNIT**

This detects the sound of a gunshot or similar weapon
and attempts to pinpoint its location using a map
of the surrounding area. Multiple echoes off the
walls of an urban area can complicate the process,
but the system can 'learn' the sound patterns of its
surroundings to make zeroing in on the location easier
with successive shots. Once set up the operator can
make an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check
to locate the source of a weapon discharge by using
its physical signature. The check is modified by the
weapon's signature level and any other factors such
as acoustically complex terrain. A cumulative DM+1
applies to subsequent from the same position by a
weapon of similar type.

At TL9, an improved version becomes available which
can automatically control an attached weapon. The
weapon must be on a tripod or support mount to
which the auto-aiming device is attached. It can be
set to automatically return fire with a single shot,
multiple attacks or not at all depending on the user's
preferences at the time. It does not include a weapon
or mount for one.

A battlefield coordination unit is a backpack-sized
communications and administration center. Its
holographic display can project maps and images as
well as sensor input, and the unit can undertake limited
analysis to suggest likely meanings of data. For example,
the unit can cross-reference incoming passive sensor
information on the emissions of an enemy unit with other
known data to produce an estimate of the formation's
composition and state of readiness. A battlefield
coordination unit grants DM+1 on Tactics checks and
related tasks, such as requesting artillery fire on a very
precise location. The whole unit weighs 6kg, or about
twice that if stands, folding stools and other comfort
accessories are included.

A personal HUD provides the user with data as well
as a targeting prompt. It is usually controlled from
a wrist-mounted device, with some pre-set voice
commands. The device can project any data available
to it, and if a communications net is available it can
interrogate nearby civilian databases or communicate
with them. On the battlefield its primary function is to
provide a targeting prompt in the form of an aim point
superimposed on an image of the target. Various display

devices are available, ranging from a helmet visor to a
pair of designer shades. A HUD grants DM+2 on attack
rolls at all ranges, for any weapon it is keyed to. It costs
Cr1500 and weighs 0.5kg, and comes with pickups for
one weapon. A set for an additional weapon requires an
hour or so to fit and calibrate. There is no real limit on
how many weapons can be calibrated to one HUD. At

CLOSEGUARD SEMI-AUTONOMOUS
POINT DEFENCE SYSTEM

**SUPPORT WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-SEVEN**

Support weaponry includes weapons too large and/or
heavy to be carried and operated by a single infantry
soldier without the assistance of powered armor. It

ranges from heavy machineguns and similar weapons to
light artillery and aerospace defence equipment.

The Closeguard system is designed to provide short-
range defence against ground, air and missile
threats. It is aimed at the mid-price market, and
sacrifices top-end capability for reliability and ease of
maintenance. Although constructed at TL9 the system
has the ability to use lower-tech components in most
areas if necessary. The unit is housed in a robust but
unarmored cylindrical mounting which has three
detachable legs allowing it to be emplaced in the field.
If these are removed, the unit can be installed in a
vehicle or aboard a watercraft with a minimum of hull
penetrations. This takes up 1 Space. A standardised
connector block allows power to be fed to the unit
and command signals to be received, but the internal
batteries are good for 36 hours or more of deployed
use with no external power feed. The unit can be
programmed or directly controlled with a dedicated
portacomp, either by direct cable connection or local-
area radio link. The latter has the disadvantage of being
vulnerable to electronic warfare.

The Closeguard unit has its own short-range radar and
thermal sensors mounted atop the receiver block of
the primary weapon. This is usually a rapid-fire twin-
mounted machinegun with an augmented cooling
system, but variants do exist. A pair of TES-12 laser
support weapons, usually set up to fire an instant apart
to increase the likelihood of a hit, is a popular upgrade
for those units that can afford the extra Cr40000 or so,
or a twin rapid-fire heavy machinegun can be mounted
instead. Closeguard is popular as a cheap anti-missile
unit but has a loyal following as a 'homicidal sentry that
never sleeps'. Units that employ it in this mode can set
exemptions so their own people will not be attacked
providing they carry the correct IFF transponder. The
unit may still open fire on large passing wildlife, though
its targeting parameters are generally good enough that
it can tell a deer from a human.

The Closeguard unit has Point Defence 2; it can
engage two targets of the same general type – ground,
high airborne or low airborne – in a given round. Its
automatic targeting system provides DM+2 to hit.

The origins of the term 'Ma Deuce' for a heavy
machinegun date back to old Earth, where the definitive
heavy machinegun was designated M2. More advanced
weapons fulfilling the same role ended up being referred
to by the same nickname, until eventually a whole
family of similar but more advanced weapons emerged.
These are known as the 'MDD family', from 'Ma Deuce's
Daughters'. Governments have their own designations
for specific members of the family, but to the typical
mercenary they are all the Beautiful Daughters of Old
Lady Deuce. This in turn leads to jargon that can seem
incomprehensible to the average civilian, but a mercenary
who hears 'Mike Two Delta on the field!' knows there is a
heavy automatic weapon nearby. Whether that is a good
thing depends on which side is using it.

MDD INFANTRY SUPPORT
WEAPON SYSTEM

The most common form of the MDD type is a heavy
automatic weapon in the 12-15mm range. Most users
have standardised on 15mm as the standard light
anti-vehicle/anti-materiel/heavy antipersonnel weapon.
It is just about possible for an infantry squad to lug a
dismantled MDD-15 into position, though normally they
are emplaced or mounted on vehicles. 50-round lengths
of belt are standard when setting up a weapon, but any
length can be produced by fixing sections together.

A modified version is occasionally encountered, with

The 'Porky' consists of a baseplate weighing 3kg,
with fittings for two rows of six rifle grenades. The

No grenades are supplied, but typically explosive

weapon, which can be relied upon to saturate an area
with explosives. Grenades can be launched singly or in
any combination, and will generally scatter quite badly.
As a result the Porcupine is rarely seen in use with
dumb grenades by forces with access to higher-tech
equipment. When paired with more advanced grenades
it can be very deadly.

TES-12 is an acronym for Targeted Energy Support,
TL12. This weapon is often encountered as an infantry
support/designation system and aboard vehicles for
anti-personnel work. It is long and heavy, and not well
suited to fluid actions, but hits hard for a laser weapon.
The near-instantaneous arrival of the laser bolt is useful
in some sniping situations, and the weapon can be used
as a designator whether delivering damaging fire or
purely as an artillery direction system. If used purely as
a designator the power drain is negligible.

125 shots, which is enough for a short action, but is
often used with a 3kg external power unit. This costs
Cr 7500 and has Power 3,000. It may be carried by
the weapon's user if operating solo but more commonly
the support weapon gunner is provided with a spotter/
security team of 1-2 additional personnel who carry
additional powerpacks. These may be equipped with
laser carbines, allowing 'buddy' recharging of their
weapons from the support gun's power unit.

**SUPPORT EQUIPMENT**

**CHAPTER-EIGHT**

A great variety of support equipment is available to
mercenary units. Generally multipurpose equipment is
preferred but some problems require a specific solution.
Whilst many pieces of supporting equipment are readily

carried by one person, larger items are normally either
mounted on a vehicle or carried in one and deployed to
a static position.

PERSONAL AND GENERAL EQUIPMENT
There is a limit to how much personal equipment a mercenary can carry in the field. Those who try to bring along
device for every occasion find themselves overloaded and unable to function properly. On the other hand, there are
some situations that cannot be resolved without the correct tools. Choosing the correct equipment for the task at
hand is one of the hidden skills required by successful mercenaries.

Automedics are used by some civilians in hazardous
environments and by dignitaries who may face threats
to their lives. These devices are part monitor, part
autoinjector. They monitor the user's life signs and
blood chemistry, and can provide detailed information
to a physician if needed. Under certain specific
circumstances the unit can inject painkillers, antidotes
to common toxins, stimulants, sedatives or whatever
else the user needs. Specialist drugs are often delivered
this way, such as regular doses required to keep a
chronic condition at bay or stop a medical episode early.

Military automedics take this function a stage further.
Like the civilian variant they must be tailored to a
specific individual but can carry requirements of
other members of a unit as a backup. This 'buddy
system' allows treatment of others if necessary. In
addition, the automedic can be preconfigured to react
to external stimuli, for example delivering an antidote
to tranq gas as soon as it is detected in the air rather
than waiting for it to enter the user's system. Military
automedics can also administer combat drugs either
at the command of the user or – if access has been
granted – from a remote location.

Item TL Kg Cost
Military Automedic 11 0.2 Cr17500

They are configured to dispense a single dose of Fast
drug should it ever be needed. If the wearer is seriously
injured or dying (two or three physical attributes at zero)
the automedic will automatically use the Fast drug if
available and there is no risk of overdose. The user can
manually activate the drug at any time if needed.

**SUPPORT COOLING UNIT**

Although primarily associated with support weaponry,
the 'SCU' has become a ubiquitous piece of equipment.
Some use replaceable consumables whilst others
are based on more conventional heat exchangers. A
consumable based unit weighs 5kg plus 1kg per 'chill
can' it can hold. Using a forced heat exchange, the SCU
removes heat from a weapon or an area and stores it in
the disposable cans. Removing the expended cans and
burying them – or sending them off for environmentally
friendly recycling, depending on the unit – is a simple
and not very onerous task which is nevertheless
despised by most military personnel.

Conventional SCUs use a high-capacity heat storage
fluid which can, in an emergency, be dumped and
replaced with fresh fluid. Depositing large quantities of
hot semi-liquid gel creates a large heat signature which
can be useful as a decoy if well positioned, or even as a
booby trap. More commonly, heat is dissipated through

a system of radiators, allowing the gel to return to liquid
form and be reused. A conventional SCU weighs 10kg
and can hold 50 Heat per kg of cooling fluid. This is
stored in tanks which must be purchased separately.

An SCU doubles the rate at which heat is removed from
a weapon with an advanced cooling system, providing
it is properly connected. Dissipating heat through the
system's radiators is at the rate of 1 Heat per minute
per set of radiators, but this does create a significant
thermal signature. Reducing the rate by a factor of five
allows the thermal plume to be largely concealed.

SCU units can be used to heat an area using residual
stored heat or to cool one, and heat thus obtained can
be stored for an extended period rather than dissipating.
For this reason SCUs have become a standard climate
control system for living areas and work spaces which
need a constant temperature.

**BREACHING CHARGE**

**DEMOLITION BLOCK**

EXPLOSIVES AND DEMOLITION CHARGES
Explosives come in two basic types, known as high and low explosive. High explosives detonate very quickly, creating
a cutting action when emplaced correctly. Low explosives may not explode as such, but instead deflagrate; that
is, they burn very quickly producing a pushing action. Both are useful to mercenaries who know how to emplace
charges correctly.

A breaching charge typically takes the form of a light
frame which can be unfolded and stuck to a wall
or door with self-adhesive pads. Upon command it
detonates in a manner that cuts the target, causing a
hole large enough to move quickly through. A charge
is sufficient to breach a section of domestic wall or
an internal door but will not significantly damage
heavier structures.

Item TL Kg Cost
Breaching Charge 7 2 Cr100

Explosives are typically issued in convenient
amounts, with training geared to how many blocks
are to be used for any given task rather than requiring
precise calculations. A demolition block is composed
of plastic explosive that can be moulded to any
shape needed. It is extremely stable and cannot be
detonated by impact or heat. A small explosion such
as that provided by a detonator is required. Two
blocks, applied correctly, are sufficient to sever a
30cm steel I-beam.

Item TL Kg Cost
Demolition Block 7 0.5 Cr100

If used as a grenade, a demolition block explosive
produces a small blast effect which is destructive
in a modest radius. Properly tamped or used to
project loose debris, the effect is far more deadly. An
explosive charge does Damage 1D plus 1D per two
additional demolition blocks. Blast trait is 1 plus 1
per 2 full dice of damage, or 1 plus 1 full dice of
damage if used to project debris as a booby trap or
pipe bomb.

**DEMOLITION CHARGE**

**DEMOLITION CHARGE, NUCLEAR**

A standard demolition charge consists of 12 demolition
blocks plus detonators, wires and basic electronic
timers/receivers allowing a range of charges to be put
together. It is supplied in a carrying satchel with a few
basic tools. If used as a weapon, for example thrown
into an enemy foxhole, the charge as a whole would
do 6D damage with Blast 4. If detonated in a confined
space or in contact with an object, for example thrown
onto the engine deck of a tank or under it, damage to
the target is doubled.

Demolition Charge 7 5 Cr1000

Nuclear demolition charges are not commonly available
but may be improvised by mercenaries or issued under
desperate circumstances. A nuclear demolition charge
is sometimes called a 'suitcase nuke', though it is too
big to fit in one. Yield is normally in the 0.1kt range –
equivalent to around 100 tons of conventional explosive

- which is sufficient to totally destroy most buildings or
small installations.

MINES AND MINE MODIFICATIONS
Basic anti-personnel mines become available at TL4-5, but those purchased by the typical mercenary unit are
rather more advanced. Advanced mines are more difficult to detect and more reliable both in terms of triggering and
effect. Mines can be set to detonate after a random period or instructed to do so by remote signal, making clearance
operations dangerous, or can be command detonated. More commonly they are simply left lying around for the
unwary to step on, and can usually be rendered safe by a remote encoded signal.

A variety of modifications are available for land mines. The commonest involve means of delivery and construction.
FASCAM (field artillery scattered mines) are designed to be launched from an artillery piece, and air-dropped
versions are similar. Delivery is rather random but a wide danger area can be created with multiple shells. Converting
mines for remote delivery adds 25% to their cost.

Low-observable (stealth) mines use non-magnetic materials and, in extreme cases, exotic explosives to reduce the
chance of detection by chemical sniffers. The Stealth modifications found on page 35 can be applied to mines,
imposing a negative DM to anyone trying to detect them.

**MINE, ANTIPERSONNEL**

**MINE, ANTI-VEHICLE**

Anti-personnel mines can be small, intended to injure a
foot, or a more lethal type which flings a fragmentation
charge up, detonating at a height likely to cause the
greatest injury. Variants include the cascade mine, which
flings a cluster of microgrenades up when triggered.
These detonate at random between 0.5-2.5m from the
ground, creating a lethal fragmentation zone. Micro
mines are intended to deter pursuit. They are armed
by striking a resilient surface such as the ground, and
detonate either a pre-set time later or upon contact
with the next person passing. Micro mines are not very
powerful but can seriously injure a foot. Alarm mines
do not have a lethal payload but either launch a flare
or detonate a distraction round equivalent to a small
grenade. This has the joint effect of alerting sentries that
something is amiss and startling an intruder, thus making
them slow to react to whatever the sentries decide to do.

Anti-Vehicle mines are intended to attack a vehicle
passing over them. Smaller examples are dangerous
to light vehicles and may disable a track but cannot
seriously harm a tank. Large directional mines can blast
right through the belly armor of an AFV.

Directional mines are designed to fling small projectiles

- typically ball bearings – in a cone out from the mine's
'danger' face. Blast radius in this case refers to the
area in which its explosive effect will endanger anyone
nearby. Range is the distance projectiles will travel
downrange. A directional mine is treated as a Typical
Area Fire attack.

DEFENSIVE EQUIPMENT
A variety of defensive equipment is available for the protection of troops in the field. Most are advanced versions of
concepts that have been in use for centuries, updated either for ease of deployment and use or greater effectiveness.

Fackles – a term derived from 'field obstacles' – are
tubes approximately 1m long and weighing 10kg each.
When deployed, three sets of spikes are unfolded from
the center and points 1/3 and 2/3 along the tube. This
can be done manually but in an emergency a fackle
can be flung down, causing its spring-loaded spikes to
unfold violently. This does cause the device to jump
unpredictably before settling, so is not a preferred
option. Short chains housed inside the tube allow
multiple fackles to be fixed together, creating a barrier
held in place by its own weight or fixed down with
additional spikes driven into the ground.

Fackles are primarily useful in creating a secured
area or breaking up an assault headed for a position

- essentially functioning like barbed wire or archaic
chevaux-de-frise. A determined person can bypass the
spikes by making an Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity)
check, but this requires either careful movement or
a reckless jump. Failure inflicts Damage 2D and may
leave the victim stuck. Some fackles have a small

sensor unit which serves primarily as a security alarm
to detect anyone clambering over the fence. It can also
be tied into a battlefield sighting system to indicate the
chest height of a person moving between the spikes,
granting DM+2 on attempts to shoot someone as they
cross the barrier.

SkySpotter Drone 7 2 Cr50

**SENSORFENCE**

Item TL Kg Cost
Sensorfence 9 4 Cr500

A sensorfence consists of a set of six posts that can be
driven into the ground or stood on their removable bases.
The posts mount small sensor arrays including thermal
and optical cameras, vibration sensors and magnetic
anomaly detectors. If positioned no more than 20m apart
they communicate with one another and with the control
station. Additional posts from another kit can be added to
network if necessary.

In passive mode the fence will detect and track
movement nearby and alert the user. Data can be used
to accurately target an intruder with any weapons tied
into the sensor net. This includes detonating a grenade
directly above them or perhaps bracketing them with
flashbangs. In active mode the fence has more options.
It can project an 'ultrasonic fence' between the posts
that will discourage most animals from approaching and
makes some people feel a sense of unease. Weapons
can also be set up to automatically fire on anyone in the
fence's protected zone who lacks the correct transponder.

DRONES
Drones differ from robots in that they do not have complex control mechanisms. Some drones are capable of limited
decision-making whilst others require control from a remote operator, but even the most sophisticated drones
require specific programming or the selection of pre-programmed options and cannot decide to deviate from their
instructions. Most have a 'please advise' function triggered by an unexpected situation or one in which none of
the drone's programmed options applies, but even so drones are notorious for blindly carrying on a mission despite
totally changed circumstances.

SkySpotter is one of a great many very basic
reconnaissance drones available from TL7 upwards.
It carries forward and sideways looking optical and
thermal cameras, but little else. SkySpotter takes the
form of a hand-thrown miniature aircraft powered by a
'pusher' propeller. It is quiet and fairly small but tends
to be rather obvious to anyone looking out for such craft.
The drone can be directly controlled using a selected-
waypoint system which requires no special skill beyond
a familiarization period, or can fly a pre-set course.
Its batteries are good for about 2 hours of operation.

A control station is available but a SkySpotter drone
can be controlled from any personal computer using
software that comes free with every drone.

**AERODAGGER**

**BATTLE MULE**

Aerodagger Drone 8 2.5 Cr500
Aerodagger Cluster (6) 8 12 Cr2000

Aerodagger is a ground-launched drone using rocket
propulsion to reach an altitude of up to 1km. It then
guides itself using stub wings and, like other non-
grav drones, can only function in a Thin or denser
atmosphere. The drone's sole purpose is to deliver a
warhead to a suitable target, which must be within
10km of the launch site. This can be pre-programmed,
but the user has an option to set target selection
criteria. These are fairly basic, with options such as
personnel, light vehicle, transport vehicle, artillery
weapon and electronic equipment. Aerodagger is not
very cost-effective when attacking personnel but can
be used to harass hostiles or attack otherwise hidden
enemies. It can deliver a warhead equivalent to any
standard grenade, which must be bought separately.
Targeting software is adequate, giving DM+1 to attack
any target that can be identified by its optical and
thermal outline.

Battle Mule is one of several supply-and-reloading
drones on the market. It takes the form of a low,
lightly armored box with six large balloon tyres
similar to those of an all-terrain vehicle. It can cross
calm water without preparation using its tyres for
buoyancy and is agile enough to deal with rough
terrain. Battle Mule has two internal compartments.
The larger one is purely cargo stowage and can
carry 50kg of ammunition or various supplies. The
smaller compartment can be configured for cargo by
removing the automatic reloading equipment, but is

more commonly used as a field loader when in direct
support of a unit. The auto-reloader carries 1,000-
2,000 rounds of ammunition, depending on calibre,
in its ready hopper. It can reload standard magazines
for up to three different weapons or ammunition types
at once. Actual reloading takes one combat round
but inserting an empty magazine or taking a full one
out is a minor action for the soldier. The ammunition
hopper can be reloaded using pre-packaged or loose
ammunition. A box of 1,000 rounds typically weighs
around 10kg.

Battle Mule can be used to conduct semi-autonomous
resupply operations to forward positions or even troops
on the move, or can accompany a force in the field. It is
a large target, and despite programming to use terrain
as cover Battle Mules tend to be put out of action on
a frequent basis. The drone has Protection +12 and
takes 40 hits to disable. A variant has recently reached
the maetplace which trades the cargo and reloading
areas for a very cramped operator station. The operator
kneels with their legs inside the cargo space and most

of their torso sticking out. A raised, folding shield is
fitted to the front and sides, which can be swung out to
provide mobile cover for two infantry soldiers on each
side. Some units have attempted to fit a light support
weapon for the operator to use, but this has achieved
little success. Despite looking ridiculous the shielded
variant can provide cover during an advance and has
seen success with some starport security formations.
The shield adds Protection +8 against attacks from the
side it is facing.

DesiGnator is a grav-mobile drone about the size of a
tennis ball, equipped with a laser designator/rangefinder
and a battery of thermal and optical cameras. Range
is about 15km, assuming the operator wants the drone
to be able to return to its launch point for recovery and
recharging. DesiGnator does not move much faster than
a jogging human but is a difficult target, with Small
(-4), Protection +2 and 6 hits. Its name is derived from
'gravitic propelled designation drone' but DesiGnators
are more commonly used for reconnaissance.

**GRAV MULE**

**GRAV PIONEER**

Item TL Kg Cost
Grav Mule Drone 10 220 Cr250000

Grav Mule is an enlarged and grav-mobile version
of the Battle Mule drone intended for resupply and
casualty evacuation missions. When configured for
resupply operations the unit can carry 300kg of
supplies, with one or more field reloading kits slotted
into place. Equipment bays along the sides allow quick
deployment of necessary items or can carry additional
systems such as sensor jammers, decoy launchers
and the like. Using high-speed nap-of-earth flight the
Grav Mule can get supplies to a surrounded unit under
conditions where a crewed vehicle would face too
much risk.

Alternatively, the drone can be set up for casualty
evacuation. A pair of slide-out stretchers are always
fitted, and a life-support pack for each can be quickly
installed. Once in place, two casualties can be slid into
a Grav Mule's armored box and transported – safely
but claustrophobically – to the rear for treatment. The
Grav Mule has Protection +16 and can take 50 hits
before being disabled.

Grav Pioneer is an obstacle-clearance drone taking the
form of a 1m radius disc. It uses grav propulsion which
eats up power, requiring recharging every 1-2 hours of
use. The primary function of Grav Pioneer is to clear
mines and improvised explosive devices. It carries an
array of sensors for the purpose, and can detonate mines
with a specialized weapon located in a turret on the
underside of the disc. The usual projectile is a heavy
penetrator or a small explosive charge, though a multiple
projectile round is available for certain applications.
Grav Pioneer is not programmed to fire on personnel
but can be tricked by a skilled operator or hacked and
reprogrammed. Some units use their pioneers as security
bots in this manner, but unfortunate incidents do occur
as a result of incomplete or buggy coding. If firing on
personnel the weapon is treated as a heavy smoothbore
firing pellet ammunition, which was developed for the
safe destruction of explosive devices.

Grav Pioneer has Protection +8 and can take 20 hits
before being disabled. Its grav drive is programmed
to 'make the drone light' in the event of a pressure
wave such as that caused by an exploding mine. This
means the drone is more likely to be tossed about than
damaged, and takes half damage from blast effects. A
pair of retractable arms, one ending in powerful cutters,
allows the clearance of wire and similar light obstacles.
Heavier obstructions can sometimes be reduced by
firing all the drone's explosive ammunition into them in
the hope of shaking the obstacle apart

**AC-25 AUTOMATIC CANNON**

Heavy weaponry is the province of either small,
specialist units that do nothing but serve a single big
weapon or large forces that can afford the expense
not only of obtaining and maintaining it but also
transportation. As with small arms, mercenaries

**HEAVY WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-NINE**

typically prefer general-purpose weaponry over highly
specialized equipment. The exception is units providing
very specific high-end capabilities, who can get away
with charging a premium because they have the only
battlefield meson accelerator for hire in the subsector.

DIRECT-FIRE WEAPONS
Direct-fire weapons are typically used for fire support and bunker-busting as well as engaging enemy vehicles. The
line between 'support' and 'heavy' in this context can be blurry, but as a rule weapons in this category are too large
to be operated by infantry. They are typically encountered aboard vehicles and in installations.

The AC-25 is very much the industry standard for light
autocannon in the interstellar marketplace. Numerous
variants, copies and similar weapons exist. Light
autocannon become available at TL6, but by TL8 they
have reached their peak. Ammunition feed is usually by
disintegrating-link belt carried in a box, drum or basket.
Ball ammunition is uncommon, with most weapons
combat-loaded with three high explosive rounds
followed by two armor-piercing, the pattern repeated
throughout the belt.

COMBAT LOADING
It is common practice to combat-load light
autocannon ammunition, and the practice can
be followed for some other weapons if desired.
When firing a combat-loaded weapon, the referee
should apply damage per the most destructive
type and the best AP and other features possible.
This only applies when making an autofire attack
that will use enough rounds to guarantee a mix.
Otherwise it will be necessary for the Travellers
to keep track of the order in which rounds are
fired in order to determine what comes next.

AC-25s can be encountered almost anywhere, providing
inexpensive fire support or anti-aircraft defence. A semi-
autonomous ground mount is available, which can be
slaved to a set of perimeter sensors or a manual control
system. The weapon can be switched between auto-
response mode and soldier-in-loop operations as the
need arises, allowing a single skilled operator to run an
entire permitter defence system with multiple weapons.

A standard AC-25 suitable for installing in a vehicle
or bunker costs Cr10000. The semi-autonomous
version, complete with controls and a heavy-duty tripod
mounting, costs Cr25000.

**AC-40 MEDIUM AUTOMATIC CANNON**

Like its smaller cousin, the AC-40 is an industry
standard weapon capable of fulfilling a range of roles
from air defence to light anti-vehicle work. AC-40s
typically use a short-belt feed system, with pre-prepared
lengths of belt carried in reusable container/guides
which can be 'chained' almost indefinitely if space
allows. Ammunition is typically pre-fragmented high-
explosive dual-purpose, with reasonable penetration
characteristics and a modest burst effect. Canister
ammunition is sometimes available for infantry defence
or foliage clearance. The AC-40 is very much a jack-of-
all-trades and is superseded in most roles by weapons
specifically tailored to the circumstances, but offering
good all-round capability at an affordable price.

AC-40s are rarely encountered outside a vehicle or
permanent emplacement. The basic weapon costs
Cr25000 but many users buy a package which includes
the mountings, traverse mechanism and power unit
to allow standalone operation, plus a basic track-and-
target sensor system which allows 'click and shoot'
engagement of air or ground targets. The whole package
costs Cr45000 and requires mounting on a vehicle or
building into a permanent installation.

The AC-60H is an industry standard for heavy automatic

occasionally being found in installations or protecting
the ground approaches to a starport. Firing in 3-round
bursts, the AC-60H can deliver anti-armor rounds
capable of penetrating light armored vehicles or
fragmentation warheads for anti-personnel or anti-
aerospace work. Ammunition feed is by way of a

The Blackjack weapon system is designed to permit
combat vehicles to launch guided missiles or fire
conventional shells depending on the current
requirement. The weapon is a lightweight 150mm
cannon not compatible with standard artillery
ammunition. It cannot tolerate the immense chamber
pressures generated by high-velocity ammunition so
is primarily used in an infantry support role, firing
explosive or smoke rounds. A canister round is also
available for anti-personnel work, along with a variety of
experimental ammunition types. Notable among these
is a multiple-submunition penetrator round intended
to offset the gun's low muzzle velocity by using rocket
assistance and a small HEAP warhead. It is of limited
effectiveness but has found a niche as a defence
against infantry equipped with powered armor.

The Blackjack can launch a variety of anti-tank and
anti-aerospace missiles providing they are pre-loaded
into a container designed to fit within the gun. Loading
a missile into the weapon requires swinging the breach
aside and inserting the missile container before closing
up ready to fire. A properly trained gunner can load
and ready a missile in 3 combat rounds, whilst the gun
normally uses a revolver-type autoloader. This contains 6
shells which can be selected in any order, and requires
2 combat rounds per shell to reload.

The Blackjack weapon system is normally purchased
with mountings. Its standard mount is equivalent to an
8-Space large turret, with room for a gunner, loader and
some ready ammunition. The mounting can be supplied
enclosed or open, and will normally be protected to the
same level as the vehicle it is mounted on. Armor cost
and mass are assumed to be part of the vehicle's design.

BLACKJACK GUN/MISSILE SYSTEM

A common weapon on fire support vehicles, the LC-85
is an 85mm smoothbore cannon capable of delivering
explosive, smoke or anti-armor rounds. A canister
round is also available for anti-personnel work. The
LC-85 is designed to be as compact as possible to
allow it to fit in a variety of mounts, and has relatively
low recoil for a vehicle-mounted projectile weapon. It
is fed either by manually loaded single shells or from a
rotating 6-shell magazine which can be reloaded whilst
the weapon is not firing. Each shell takes 2 rounds for
a crewmember to load but an autoloader is available –
which consumes 1 Space and costs Cr50000 – which
will load the empty chamber as it passes, effectively
allowing the cannon to fire every round until the ready
ammunition runs out.

Designated a Very Rapid Fire (VRF) weapon, the VRF-3 is
constructed on a modular mounting to permit installation
on a vehicle or in a fixed position. VRF gauss guns are
common support weapons among well-funded forces
with access to high-tech equipment, and all must deal
with the problem of heating. This is not so pronounced
as with chemical propellants but the electromagnetic
acceleration process does produce a considerable amount
of heat. A common solution is to use a jacket containing
cryogenic fluids to cool the chamber, but this has the

problem of requiring additional support in the field. The
VRF-3 instead uses a triple-barrel arrangement, each
with its own acceleration chamber. Whilst less efficient
than a cryogenic cooling unit the arrangement requires
only physical maintenance and no handling of dangerous

fluids. The end result is an extremely high rate of fire
which can be sustained for 9 consecutive combat rounds
before overheating makes a cooling cycle necessary.
Ammunition uses standard gauss rifle needles.

Marketed as a self-contained unit, the MPS-22 is a
heavier version of the standard gauss cannon found on
many vehicles. Although it is built at TL12 and requires
high-technology spare parts it is designed to be fitted
on a 'black box' basis into any standard heavy weapon
mounting so long as sufficient power is available. In the
mercenary marketplace the weapon is popular as a cost-
effective tank-killer for those forces able to afford it.

Firing 22mm penetrator darts in bursts of six, the
cannon carries sufficient ammunition internally most
engagements, and can be reloaded in a matter of
seconds from a suitably equipped support vehicle. It
is marginally effective against aircraft, since the high-
speed darts require very little aim-off, but tends to over-
penetrate without causing much harm unless a critical
component is struck. Anti-personnel use is also limited,
but light to medium armored vehicles – including grav
vehicles – are easy victims.

ARTILLERY WEAPONS
Artillery weapons fire in an indirect arc, sometimes on a very high trajectory. Some can engage directly, 'over open
sights' as the saying goes, but others are entirely useless once the enemy gets close enough.

The Aggressor is essentially a cluster of three
rifled 90mm infantry mortar tubes mounted on a
rotating base plate suitable for installation aboard
most vehicles or in an installation. Reloading is
accomplished by releasing the breach lock and
swinging the muzzles down on a pivot. A single barrel
can be loaded with a projectile, but more commonly
three are loaded at once from an autoloader. The
weapon is then returned to firing position and the
breach locked. The Aggressor can be fired manually
but is more commonly used in conjunction with
remote sensors to deliver precise fire even without
guided projectiles. One, two or three barrels can be
fired at once with the same or different payloads.

The single-barrelled version of this weapon is soldier-
portable once broken down into frame, tube and
baseplate, but the triple-barrelled version is too heavy
and bulky to be moved more than a few meters in this
manner. Both versions can be remotely traversed and
elevated, though it is traditional to train for manual
operation of such weapons.

Typical projectiles are high-explosive dual-purpose,
with both blast and fragmentation effects. Smoke and
incendiary rounds are also common. Operators willing
to pay for guided munitions usually tie their mortars
into a designator network, though a click-to-bombard
inertial guidance system is included as standard. A
homing round is also in widespread use, which can

**AGGRESSOR 90MM MULTIPLE MORTAR**

be set to seek the parameters of enemy vehicles or
a specific target installation. Once in the target area
the warhead deploys a parachute to slow its descent,
seeking a suitable target before launching a powered
submunition which will almost always strike the top
of the target.

**DOMINATOR 200MM SIEGE MORTAR**

**FA-150 GUN-HOWITZER**

Mortars are, by definition, short-barrelled and relatively
low-velocity artillery weapons. Most are simple infantry
support types, but superheavy mortars are popular
bombardment weapons. The Dominator, like many
similar designs, is a smoothbore breach-loading design
capable of firing approximately once every minute if
ready ammunition and an autoloader are available.

The Dominator is intended to be mounted on a vehicle,
and is manufactured in such a way as to make this as
easy as possible. Despite this, it is more commonly
encountered as a defensive weapon. Dominators and
similar weapons are highly effective at denying a narrow
approach or choke point such as a mountain pass to
enemy forces, and those built into installations are
always pre-sighted on critical points.

Airburst-fragmentation rounds are commonly used for
anti-personnel work, but a parachute-retarded anti-
armor shell is a common backup. This seeks a suitable
target as it falls, launching a penetrator submunition at
enemy ground vehicles. It is not particularly effective
against grav vehicles even when they are flying very
low, as their speed and agility makes a hit problematic.
However, as a relatively cheap way of getting heavy
artillery to the battle area, the Dominator has seen
considerable market success.

An autoloading unit is available for an additional
Cr100000, adding 0.5 tons to the weapon's weight.

Despite advances in technology, tube artillery remains
a cost-effective way of delivering fire support on the
battlefield. Gun-howitzers offer a balance between long-
range fire (and effectiveness at shorter ranges when
firing over open sights) and the lightness of a short-
barrelled howitzer. The FA-150 is typical of the type.
Firing a medium-calibre shell it has limited usefulness
as a direct-fire weapon against armored vehicles but is
highly effective against soft targets and light fortifications,
and can put several rounds into the air in rapid success
from its 6-round rotary magazine. This allows a time-on-
target salvo, though without an autoloader the magazine
is laborious to refill. The weapon itself costs Cr450000,
with an autoloader costing Cr75000 and taking up an
additional 2 Spaces in a vehicle.

When using indirect fire the gun-howitzer has a range
of 25km, though accuracy is not great at this distance
without guided shells. Direct engagement range is
around 3km using a modest arc. A loaded magazine
allows a theoretical rate of fire of 10 rounds per minute

in either mode, with manual reloading of one shell
taking around 6 seconds for a well-trained crew. This
gives a sustained fire rate of 5 rounds per minute until
the crew become fatigued.

MISSILE AND ROCKET WEAPONS
By convention, guided weapons are typically referred to as missiles whilst unguided ones are termed rockets. In
practice there is considerable crossover between the two since the addition of a basic guidance system can turn a
rocket into a precision weapon. Missiles and rockets fly relatively slowly and are vulnerable to interception.

**AIRSPACE DEFENCE SYSTEM**

The AirSpace system is a common fit on light vehicles.
Configured on an unarmored gun-over-hull basis it
consists of a light laser cannon and quad-mounted light
anti-aerospace missile system mounted coaxially on a
rapid-slewing base. The base is the equivalent of a large
turret in most ways, but does not carry a crewmember
and has no armor protection for the weapons. They
are unlikely to suffer a hit even if the vehicle is directly
fired upon, due to their small size relative to the hull.

**ASA-40 HEAVY AEROSPACE**

**DEFENCE MISSILE SYSTEM**

The ASA-40 is a common large aerospace defence
missile system, manufactured under license on multiple
worlds. It is designed to be operated from an installation
or a vehicle, though trailer-mounted variants are not
uncommon. The system consists of a launch rail on
a slewing/elevating base, control station and sensor/
antennae complex that can be mounted on the launch
vehicle or separately.

The ASA-40 has various designations depending on
where it is in service. Most users obtain missiles on the
open market, so typically a missile will be of standard
design and with well-known capabilities. The usual
choice is a two-stage weapon with a fast-burn main
stage to get the missile into the target vicinity or to
altitude quickly. After this is jettisoned the attack
stage can coast for some time before activating its own
engines. This stage is agile but has difficulty targeting
grav vehicles that make rapid and violent direction
changes. It is capable of intercepting most aircraft and
has no difficulty with spacecraft.

The standard missile used with this weapon system
is the HighStrike long-range aerospace missile. Its
warhead is capable of self-selecting between impact
detonation and close-pass proximity burst. If an impact
can be achieved the missile does 2DD damage with a
small blast area. A proximity burst reduces damage to
12D with a much greater radius. The missile is capable
of endangering small spacecraft with a direct hit.

The launch and control system costs Cr750000 and
weighs 3 tons with a missile in place. Missiles typically
cost Cr100000, or more depending on warhead.
Additional missiles are loaded with the assistance of
a hoist on the loader, a process that takes around 20
minutes. Each spare missile weighs approximately one
ton with its protective packaging.

WEAPON (PLASMA)

RESGAW-220 ROCKET
ARTILLERY SYSTEM

The P-12 vehicular plasma gun is a standard Plasma-C
gun mounted in a remotely controlled blister turret. This
is designed to be fitted on the top, sides or underneath
a vehicle depending on its role. The mountings are
universal, with only control and power feeds required.
It is designed to vent plasma outward if the firing
chamber is breached, rather than into the vehicle, and
considered one of the safest plasma weapons available
on the open market.

Cheaply manufactured at TL7, the Resgaw system is a
common large-calibre rocket artillery system designed
to be retrofitted to almost any vehicle. At its core is a
traversable carrier/launcher rail system which carries
eight 220mm unguided artillery rockets. These typically
deliver high explosive warheads or an airbursting
fragmentation payload for area attacks. In open
configuration the system takes up 9 Spaces and costs
Cr25000, carried outside the structure of a vehicle –
and thus unprotected by. An enclosed version, protected
by the vehicle's armor, costs Cr40000 and consumes
12 Spaces. Vehicle-mounted systems can make use of
an autoloader, which can be carried on the same vehicle
or another in support. The autoloader takes up 4 Spaces
plus 4 more for every 8 missiles carried and costs
Cr25000. Standard warheads cost Cr2500 each. Range
of this weapon is not great but it can be fitted to light
trucks or similar vehicles to create a powerful, if short,
barrage capability. At TL8, a simple guidance system
can be fitted at the cost of Cr100 per missile. This does
not home in on precise targets but does grant DM+2 to
attack rolls.

**TAC-150 MISSILE SYSTEM**

The TAC-150 missile system is named for its role and
general size. The bus, propulsion system and most of
the electronics are common to all missiles in the family,
with warheads and any specific components fitted as
a single unit. TAC-150 missiles can be launched from
a Blackjack gun/missile system or any other launcher
capable of carrying missiles in the 150mm diameter
range. If mounted on a post a pair of missiles consume
1 Space.

The commonest variants are the TAC-150AA and TAC-
150AT, intended for anti-aerospace and anti-armor
work respectively. The AA version is designed for
proximity detonation and uses a warhead surrounded
by tungsten cubes for maximum effect, whereas the AT
variant is fused for impact or close-standoff detonation.
The latter is intended to defeat reactive armor by
positioning the plasma jet formed by its shaped-charge
warhead in such a way as not to be disrupted by
exploding reactive armor. Designated TAC-150ATS,
this warhead is expensive but ignores any reactive
armor a target vehicle may have. Other mechanisms
intended to impair shaped-charges, such as mesh or
bars, are similarly ineffective.

An antiradiation weapon designated TAC-150AR, is
also available. Normally used to seek enemy radar
and similar sensor equipment, this warhead can
analyse emissions and determine the nature of sensors
and communications equipment. It can be directly

controlled or permitted to autonomously seek targets
of the correct nature. If a radar or communications
array is turned off the missile will attack its last known
location unless directed to another target. Antiradiation
weapons gain DM+4 to attack emitting sensors or
communications equipment, and if home-on-jam mode
is selected they gain DM+6 to attack active jammers
and similarly powerful emitters. An attack on a shut-
down target is made without these DMs but the missile
still gains the usual modifier for being a smart weapon.

**HEAVY EQUIPMENT**

Heavy equipment is normally carried aboard a vehicle
or installed in a facility. Small mercenary units are
unlikely to be able to afford much in the way of heavy
equipment, but if an item is considered necessary
enough the money will be found... somehow.

A field armory is a modular structure designed to
provide maintenance and secure storage for weaponry
and ammunition. Lower-tech variants are available but
the TL10 version is equipped to maintain energy weapons
and similar high-tech equipment in at least a basic
fashion. A field armory can hold sufficient small arms

which case it consumes 24 Spaces.

**FIELD BARRACKS**

**FIELD MEDICAL UNIT**

A field barracks is somewhere between a large and
well-insulated tent and a prefabricated building. Each
structure has a modular base, a framework that can
be configured various ways and sections of flexible
covering along with a rather minimal set of shower and
washing facilities. The standard setup is a six-person
sleeping area, a general-purpose working space and
a small 'field fresher' which is served by a modular
set of power and water connectors. A furniture kit
capable of being put together as six field bunks, a
table and stools is also provided, along with a heating/
air conditioning unit which makes the shelter liveable
under a wide range of conditions.

Multiple modules can be combined to create a base.
It is not uncommon to find accommodation structures
made up of most of two kits, with the left-over parts
used for mess, command or briefing facilities. Although
nothing like as good as a permanent structure, a field
barracks can be set up almost anywhere and prevents

the inevitable degradation of morale that comes with
living in inadequate facilities. The modular nature of
the kits takes some getting used to – to the point that
knowing how to erect or strike a camp of this sort is
considered an essential skill by many mercenary units.
When broken down each module takes up 6 Spaces
aboard a vehicle.

A field medical unit is designed to be carried aboard
one or more vehicles and deployed to the ground, but
can be installed inside vehicles instead. It contains two
emergency operating units and two non-surgical aid
stations along with a central sanitization and general-
stores area. If deployed to the ground, each of the
five modules is protected by a translucent 'bubble' of
light polymer on a collapsible frame. Perfectly sterile
conditions are hard to come by in the field, but a unit
of this sort comes close. If carried aboard a vehicle for
deployment groundside, the unit takes up 20 Spaces.
Installed in a manner that permits surgery to be carried
out inside a vehicle, Space requirements increase to
40, which is usually split between two or three vehicles.
The TL9 version relies on medical professionals with

some automated assistance. At TL32 a variant is
available which contains two autodocs in place of the
surgical units. A live medic can still use these but they
are typically programmed for automatic treatment of
common injuries.

**FIELD NUCLEAR DAMPER**

FIELD SURVEILLANCE
SYSTEM, MULTISPECTRAL

Although nuclear weapons are rarely used in the sort
of conflicts mercenaries get involved in, the threat
is always present. Nuclear dampers render nuclear
warheads inert, more or less, and are typically deployed
to protect major troop concentrations, headquarters
and field bases. A field nuclear damper is sufficient
to protect an area 1km in radius from tactical nuclear
weapons and to nullify radiation attacks. It will thus
provide protection from the radiation associated with
plasma, fusion and particle weapons. One can also be
used to make an irradiated area somewhat safer, but
contact with contaminated material will still pose a
severe hazard.

A field nuclear damper requires so much power that
it will normally be carried aboard a vehicle or in an
installation with its own fusion reactor. Although smaller
than the units used aboard starships, portable dampers
consume 12 Spaces in a vehicle.

A field surveillance system consists of a central operator

multispectral sensor array. This includes a passive
emissions detector, active radar, a laser mapping and
rangefinding system on a rotating platform, and thermal
and optical sensors. Additional ground sensors in the
form of small discs are included. These detect acoustic,
magnetic and seismic traces. The unit provides
monitoring and alerts over an area 1-1.5km in radius,
depending on the terrain, and can be linked into a
larger network. Its fuel cells are good for around 72
hours of operation, significantly reduced if active radar
is used. The system provides DM+2 to Recon checks
within its area of coverage.

**FIELD WORKSHOP**

**MILITARY SATELLITE LAUNCHER**

Units that have more than one or two vehicles soon find
they become a maintenance burden in the field. Repairs
and maintenance can be improvised at need, and some
units do this on a constant basis. A field workshop
allows work that could otherwise not be undertaken to
be carried out almost anywhere. The workshop includes
hoists and frames to support them, heavy tools and
some fabrication equipment which allows parts to be
adapted or wrangled back into shape. It requires a crew
of two mechanics at a minimum to make use of the
facilities, and can be used by up to six. The unit as a
whole is designed to be carried in several crates aboard
a vehicle, and takes around four hours for a 4-person
crew to deploy. One large or two small vehicles can be
worked on at once. The workshop takes up 16 Spaces
when carried as cargo in a vehicle, and can be broken
down between vehicles if necessary. The TL10 version
has provision for repair of grav vehicles.

Satellite reconnaissance is a luxury for most mercenary
units unless their clients can provide coverage. Those
forces that can afford one can buy a self-contained
launcher and control unit which can be fitted to a
vehicle or carried aboard one and emplaced in the field.
The unit contains an erector-launcher which consumes
12 Spaces aboard a vehicle either fitted or as cargo,
and a ground control and preparation station which
takes up another 4 Spaces. A single rocket takes up 24
Spaces. A satellite already mounted on the rocket takes
up no Spaces; additional satellites take up one Space
and weigh 250kg.

Rockets can be built if a decent workshop is available,
though fuel handling is hazardous. These military
satellites are capable of conducting communications
relay work, mapping and ground monitoring with a
variety of sensors. Duration in orbit is fairly short;
typically 3D days plus the Effect of an Electronics
(remote ops) check.

Using the term 'mobile' for a fusion reactor is something
of a stretch, but this unit is as close as it is possible
to get. A field reactor is derived from the units fitted to
many military vehicles, but is designed to be carried
as cargo in a vehicle rather than forming an integral
part of its structure. The reactor and its associated
control and monitoring stations consume 14 spaces if
carried in a vehicle. The unit can power a modest-sized
base including heavy laser weapons, and recharge grav
vehicles at the same time. Power draw limits recharging
to half a dozen vehicles and will be halted whilst
heavy current drain is experienced, such as when firing
aerospace defence lasers powered by the unit.

**MOBILE FUSION REACTOR**

**VEHICULAR CITADEL**

Item TL Kg Cost
Mobile Fusion Reactor 10 3500 MCr1.75

A vehicular citadel is an armored chamber within
a vehicle. Normally installed around a crew area, a
citadel could in theory protect computers and electronic
equipment or a propulsion system. A citadel consumes
one Space plus one additional Space for every four
full Spaces contained within it. It provides additional
armor protection for the occupants or contents and
can be combined with NBC protection to create a refuge
within the vehicle. A weapon that penetrates the outer

armor and would strike something protected by the
citadel must get through its armor to do so. Ideally
enough of the weapon's force is spent on breaching the
outer armor that the citadel can withstand what is left,
though the vehicle's interior will most likely be wrecked
even if the crew and critical systems survive.

Vehicular Citadel 10 1+1 per 4 Cr35000 20
Vehicular Citadel 12 1+1 per 4 Cr50000 25

A basic citadel is essentially a steel box with a door but
as technology advances it is possible to add additional
features. From TL8 upwards citadels offer additional
protection and are fitted with a cooling system which
will allow the occupants to survive a serious fire in the
vehicle. Shaped-charge warheads that detonate against

the outer hull of a vehicle will not be well positioned to
penetrate the inner citadel. Such weapons lose all AP
traits and do half damage to the citadel. The cost of a
citadel is per Space contained within it, including the
Space the citadel itself consumes.

It is possible to protect the occupants of a vehicle from
biological or chemical attack, and from radioactive
fallout, without installing a full life-support system.
Some bottled oxygen may be used but for the most part
air is drawn from outside the vehicle through filters
or is scrubbed in a rebreather unit. NBC protection
is no use in vacuum or where an atmosphere is
wholly unbreathable as it does not change the gas
composition, but filters will clean out most taints. No
airlock is provided, so unsealing the vehicle will allow
contamination to enter.

Basic NBC equipment is essentially personal
protection for use inside the vehicle. It takes the form
of masks provided with filtered air. This is bulky and
uncomfortable, since the crew have to wear protective
clothing and deal with hoses getting in the way, but it is
cheap. Contaminants can enter, so the interior must be
decontaminated before use by unprotected personnel

Standard NBC protection creates a comfortable and safe
environment within the vehicle by sealing the vehicle
and maintaining a slight overpressure inside.

**VEHICULAR PROTECTION, EXTERNAL**

Combat vehicles may be attacked in a variety of ways.
Shaped-charge warheads are designed to defeat
conventional armor and are effective even against
advanced composites. Grenades and explosives can the
thrown onto a vehicle, or flammable liquids poured onto
upper surfaces. Mines and other explosive devices can
be emplaced so as to attack from the underside of a
vehicle. External protection is designed to defeat these
attacks, and comes in three types. Any or all can be
fitted to a vehicle, paying the costs separately.

Grenade protection involves shaping the upper surfaces
so grenades roll off and fluids spill onto the ground
rather than entering the vehicle or pooling on its
surfaces. Wire mesh can be used to create a roof which
will do the same for grenades but does not affect fluids
or satchel charges. Non-magnetic coatings are used to
prevent charges from sticking to the hull.

Mine protection can be provided by shaping the
underside of a vehicle to deflect blast and adding
armor plate to vulnerable areas. It may be more
efficient to simply increase the armor weight of the

vehicle and move some of it to the underside, but mine
protection is often fitted on a temporary basis or as a
modification after bad experiences in the field. Mine
protection consumes two Spaces plus one for every full
20 Spaces of the vehicle. It adds 25% to the value of
the vehicle's underside armor. Mine protection can
only be applied once

Shaped-charge protection is normally achieved by
adding slat (or bar) armor and skirts around a vehicle
which can cause a shaped-charge warhead to detonate
short of the optimum location. Unless the weapon has
advanced fusing that compensates for this, or a standoff
probe, there is a 2 in 6 chance that any shaped-charge
warhead striking the vehicle will be impaired. Damage
is halved and all AP traits are lost. The mountings for
slat armor take very little space inside the vehicle but
can make operations awkward. Slat armor requires
one Space for every 25 Spaces of the vehicle, rounding
down, and costs Cr750 per Space of the vehicle.
Slat armor has no effect on energy weapons, kinetic
penetrators or blast.

**VEHICLES**

**CHAPTER-ELEVEN**

Most vehicles used by mercenary forces are either
bought surplus from large militaries or built in large
numbers by corporations for sale to government and
mercenary clients. A unit that can afford a small run of

custom designed vehicles is a rare thing, though often
vehicles are refurbished and upgraded once in service.
Overall, however, most vehicles in mercenary service are
variants of a few common designs.

SIDES 2

GS-3 stands for 'ground strike, 3-wheel'. This slightly unusual offering from Halversten Armaments
Incorporated was developed for the fast-response and scouting role but has developed into a general-purpose
light weapons carrier. The basic vehicle is a large three-wheel design, with roll bars around the driving
position but no significant protection from weapons fire or the elements. The area behind the driver is set
up as configurable space, and can carry a cargo box capable of holding 4 Spaces of equipment or 1,000kg
of load. In this configuration the GS-3 is occasionally encountered as a 'last mile' logistics vehicle running
ammunition and supplies at high speed to forward-positioned troops.

As standard, the vehicle is very basic. It has no sensors or electronics other than a modest driver-assistance
package and encrypted comms system. The 'cargo area' was designed from the outset to be configurable,
though most commonly all that is added is a pintle-mounted weapon for the use of a second crewmember
who stands in the vehicle's rear bed. This is the standard patrol and security configuration for the vehicle,
acting as a mobile light support platform or escort for logistics vehicles. An alternate configuration allows two
infantry personnel to ride in the bed along with a little cargo, dismounting to fight or make a foot patrol whilst
the driver covers them with a pintle-mounted weapon above the driving position. The art of dropping from a
standing 'gunner' position into the driving seat without inflicting self-injury is an important one.

Reconnaissance Variant: The GS-3 makes an effective
reconnaissance and artillery observation vehicle, providing
it can evade detection. Its small size enables it to find a
concealed position on a hillside or behind an obstruction
and relay information back to the parent force. In this
configuration the vehicle is fitted with a TL9 navigation
system providing DM+2, an extended-range communications
system and an improved, increased-range sensor system
(DM+1) which is hardened and mounted on a mast. These
modifications are expensive, bringing the vehicle cost to
Cr150350. Communications are handled by a second
crewmember who normally is provided with a pintle-
mounted weapon for self-defence.

Electronic Warfare Variant: Like the recon version, the
electronic warfare variant of the GS-3 is designed to be a
cheap way of getting an expensive piece of equipment into
the field. The EW package adds an improved, extended-
range electronic countermeasures package to the rear
bed. This adds Cr40000 to the vehicle's price for a readily

available TL8 package and is sometimes included in a
recon-variant vehicle. The resulting platform is fast and
mobile, though vulnerable if attacked. It is often used as
a mobile electronic reconnaissance asset, mapping enemy
emissions and investigating any anomalies before retiring
without making contact. An imported TL11 advanced ECM
pack can also be installed, adding Cr80000 to the cost of
the vehicle for an extended-range package.

Strike Variant: Most users retain the GS-3 in its basic role,
as a fast and mobile weapons carrier. The strike variant
can carry a range of weapons, usually on an open mounting
equivalent to a small turret with no armor protection.
The turret weapons are directly controlled by a second
crewmember. Typically a light autocannon is mounted,
increasing the vehicle's cost by Cr20000, but some GS-3s
are used as mobile anti-aerospace platforms and carry a
quad-mount light anti-air missile system which increases
vehicle cost by Cr30000.

The Field Ranger is a ubiquitous security and transport vehicle often converted into a light patrol asset for lack
of anything better. It is a 6-wheel-drive ground vehicle somewhere between a large SUV and a small truck,
with good off-road capability and endurance. The vehicle's blocky sides maximise internal space at the price of
being a good target, whilst the large rear area can be left open-topped or covered with a lightly armored body
shell. The crew area and critical components are protected by light armor plate offering modest protection
against most small arms fire from medium range or greater.

Field Ranger was designed from the outset to be customised, and indeed several standard kits are
manufactured. The basic vehicle is set up for a crew of two, with the rear cargo area open or enclosed as the
purchaser prefers. There are no weapons as standard, but the cab roof hatch has provision for a pintle mount.
The rear area can hold 2,750kg of cargo or 11 Spaces' worth of equipment and/or personnel. The bed of the
rear area is sufficiently well constructed to be able to support a light turret weapon.

Field Rangers are typically used for personnel transport, in which case they carry 8-10 personnel in the rear, or
for light logistics work.

WEAPONS

**Survivability Enhancement Package:** Survivability can be greatly
improved by fitting bolt-on armor panels and defensive
systems. The full up-armoring kit increases armor to 20 at
the front and rear, and 28 on the sides. Anti-mine protection
increases underside armor to 24, and a decoy dispenser and
smoke discharger are added on the cab sides. This enhanced
protection comes at the cost of reducing internal space;
cargo capacity drops to 2,000kg or 8 Spaces. The cost of this
upgrade is Cr 12000, slightly more than the cost of building
the vehicle in this configuration from new.

**Light Turret Weapon Package:** A 4-Space small turret is
available to fit the Field Ranger. It takes up only one internal
Space but can hold four Spaces of weapons, and costs
Cr40,000 without fitted weapons. The turret is capable of
high-angle shooting as well as engaging ground targets, and
can be controlled from either the cab or rear area according
to the user's preference. A turret will reduce cargo capacity by
250kg or equipment Space by 1.

**Large Turret Weapon Package:** If heavier combat capability is
desired, a Field Ranger can be configured as an armored
reconnaissance or fire support vehicle. This requires fitting
a larger turret as an integral part of the vehicle, taking up 5
Spaces. This will almost entirely take up the available space
in a survivability-enhanced Field Ranger, turning it into a light
combat vehicle. The cost of a large turret without weapons

is Cr150000. The turret has capacity for one crewmember
and six Spaces of weapons, though sometimes a second
crewmember is carried as a commander, artillery observer or
in some other role. This will reduce the turret capacity to 4
Spaces of weapons.

Most Field Rangers are set up as light transports, with only
minor modifications, or as security/personnel transports
using the survivability kit. These vehicles typically mount a
machinegun on a pintle mount atop the cab and carry 6-10
infantry depending on the unit's preferences. A light patrol/
logistics escort Field Ranger will typically have the survivability
package and a small turret mounting a light autocannon and a
pair of light air defence missiles on a rail launcher. The cost of
this vehicle with weapons is Cr72500.

A fire-support or armored recon vehicle will often mount a
heavy autocannon or a medium-calibre direct-fire weapon
such as an 85mm gun. These weapons are effective against
light to medium combat vehicles but incapable of taking on
battle tanks. If an LC-85 cannon is mounted, the revolving-
cylinder magazine allows six shots, one per round, before
the crewmember operating the weapon has to begin the
laborious task of reloading. A pintle-mounted machinegun
will usually be carried atop the turret, possibly with another
on the cab roof.

NEGAV TEN-WHEEL OFF-ROAD TRANSPORT VEHICLE

DESCRIPTION

FRONT 6

REAR 6

SIDES 8

UNDER 6

The Negav is an unusual design of off-road truck, with
two articulated body sections. The front, four-wheel,
section contains the cab and main driving/working area
whilst the six-wheel section at the rear can be configured
for a variety of roles. Both sections contain fuel cells, and
all wheels are driven and steerable. This gives good off-
road manoeuvrability for such a large ground vehicle.

The basic model is lightly armored for protection
against shell fragments and small arms fire. Underside
armor is improved, and shaped to deflect blast from
a mine sideways rather than upwards through the crew
compartment. Equipment is serviceable but nothing
special, with some communications and navigational
aids. Nominal crew is two, though many versions carry
additional personnel either to operate installed systems
or operate dismounted. The basic model has 9 tons (36
spaces) of cargo capacity, which can be used to install a
great variety of systems.

**Survivability Enhancement Kit:** The Negav is not intended to
function as a combat vehicle, so its survivability kit focuses
more on standoff weapons and air attack than direct fire.
Armor is increased to 10 front and rear, 12 on the sides and
12 underneath. In addition an ECM (improved) suite is added
along with a decoy dispenser and smoke discharger. A small
turret atop the crew compartment replaces the roof hatch. It
usually mounts a pair of 25mm autocannon but can take other
weapons at need. With autocannon mounted the package costs
Cr100000 and takes up 5 Spaces, reducing cargo capacity to
7.75 tons.

**Headquarters Support Vehicle Modification:** Using TL12
components, the HQ support vehicle kit is designed to
instantly provide a medium-sized mercenary unit or other
military formation with key functions. The vehicle's power
system is replaced with a TL9 fusion plant, which takes up
10 spaces in the rear compartment. Power take-offs enable
this vehicle to recharge others or run several ground-based
systems. Most of the remainder of the rear compartment is
taken up with a TL12 nuclear damper**.** A Computer/3 is also
housed in the rear compartment, which additionally mounts
a small turret containing a twin-mounted rotary autocannon
with advanced TL12 fire control at the front end of its top
side. A second small turret housing four light anti-aircraft
missiles is mounted at the rear of the cargo section. A laser
anti-missile system is mounted atop the crew compartment.
As a result of all these modifications only 8 Spaces are left for
cargo or additional personnel. This variant of the Negav is very
expensive, with the new components plus the cost of the base
vehicle bringing the price tag to MCr2.062, but it provides a
unit's headquarters with virtually unlimited power, protection
from nuclear attack and defence against aerospace and missile
threats – all in a single, mobile package.

**'Bombus' Conversion Package:** Dubbed the 'Bombus' by a
notoriously amateurish mercenary force, this conversion is still
'officially unofficial' but is requested often enough that many
consider it a standard option. The intent is to turn what was
designed as a transport vehicle into a mobile raiding platform.

Against a credible starfaring-tech opponent this vehicle would
be questionable at best, but it can smash through most
opposition put up by disorganised mid-tech opponents. Armor
is heavily upgraded, with 20 points on the top, front and rear,
28 on the sides and 22 underneath.

The crew compartment is heavily modified, with an LC-85
cannon in a limited-traverse mount pointing forwards. This
takes up most of one side of the compartment, limiting the
crew to a driver and a gunner/loader whose working space
is directly behind the driver. The gun and its associated
autoloader take up 7 Spaces within the crew compartment,
with most of the remaining area given over to tools and
ammunition. Atop the crew compartment is a small turret
mounting twin light autocannon in a high-angle turret. These
weapons are capable of air defence or engaging ground
targets but must be controlled by a crewmember from the rear
compartment if the driver and cannon gunner are both busy.

The rear compartment is divided between a crew area and a
TL9 fusion reactor, giving the vehicle more or less unlimited
range. A full turret mounting a light laser cannon sits atop
the compartment, with space inside for a single gunner.
Additionally there are small sponsons on each side of the
rear compartment, each carrying a pair of remote-controlled
machineguns. There are crew stations for three personnel,
plus one in the turret, bringing the vehicle's complement to
six. A small amount of cargo space is used by gun racks and
a wet bar.

The resulting gun-festooned monstrosity can function as
a useful fire support vehicle or tank destroyer, though it is
expensive and inefficient in either role. It has come to be
associated with reports of gangs of trigger-happy yahoos
kerb-stomping under-equipped yokels and is considered
a questionable purchase by reputable mercenaries. The
conversion brings the total cost of the vehicle to MCr1.8.
This is more than a variant designed from the outset to
follow this configuration and includes the cost of a base
vehicle and subsequent modification work.

UNDER —

Named after a venomous scuttling creature, the Marrix is one of the few tracked combat vehicles in widespread
service with interstellar mercenary formations. Most forces favor wheeled or grav vehicles, or a combination
of them, since they have better strategic mobility. Heavy tracklayers are well protected but can be vulnerable
to powerful weapons they are unable to evade, but there is a solid market for light tracked combat and support
vehicles in certain roles.

The Marrix family of vehicles is based on a common chassis and power plant, with fuel cells distributed under
the driving and crew compartments, and a front-mounted motive unit which provides the crew with a measure of
additional protection against bow hits. Armor protection is adequate to deal with light support weapons in all arcs,
and can be upgraded with applique armor packs. All variants are fitted with decoy dispensers and smoke grenade
launchers, and the majority of users add at least a pintle-mounted machinegun for self-defence.

The basic version has no turret although there is provision to fit one. All three crewmembers are housed in the front
compartment with 3 Spaces available for additional systems or 750kg of small items. The rear compartment has
16 Spaces available for systems or personnel. Typically this is used to carry an 8-10 soldier section if the Marrix is
functioning as an APC, in which case it will usually have a small turret mounting a light autocannon. This does not
come as standard and must be bought separately. A pintle-mounted machinegun is typically added atop the driving
compartment, though other weapons are possible. If the Marrix is in use as a logistics vehicle it can carry 4,000kg
of cargo in the rear compartment, which is of course reduced if systems or weapons are added.

**Infantry Support Upgrade Package:** The most basic upgrade
package available adds a small turret capable of holding
4 Spaces of weapons. This takes up one Space in the
rear compartment, costing Cr40000 for the turret alone.
Typically the turret mounts a heavy autocannon such as the
AC-60H model, for an additional cost of Cr600000. Turrets
are fitted for high-angle fire, permitting a group of vehicles
to act as an anti-aircraft battery – ideally under the central
direction of a command unit.

**Defensive Upgrade Package:** The defensive upgrade package
greatly increases armor protection using bolt-on applique
sections and adds improved reactive armor. This upgrade
costs Cr123000. Armor protection is increased to 86
on the front, 60 on the sides, 50 at the rear and 45
underneath, creating a vehicle capable of functioning as a
battle tank. This modification is usually accompanied by a
main-calibre gun or similar weapon in a full turret. It uses
up 3 Spaces.

Primary Weapon Upgrade Package: The primary weapon
upgrade package usually, but not always, includes a full
turret. The standard turret is a 2-crewmember design, which
consumes only 6 Spaces inside the vehicle but can hold 10
Spaces of weapons or systems in addition to the crew. The
turret alone costs Cr250000. This turret is commonly used
with a piece such as the FA-150 gun-howitzer to create a
mobile artillery platform. The high angle of fire on these
weapons makes them eminently suitable for direct-fire
support operations in urban terrain, enabling snipers in high
buildings to be taken out in a distinctly heavy-handed but
effective manner. Alternatively, a straight tank-killer can be
created by mounting a heavy gauss cannon. This weapon
is above the nominal TL of the vehicle but several self-
contained weapons are available.

For all its martial pretentions, the base-model Taisben is basically a ruggedised civilian air/raft. Vehicles of
this sort serve in the liaison role without conversion, and are primarily used for scouting or patrol work when
they venture onto the battlefield. Some variants are more combat-worthy and can be encountered as fire
support platforms or providing vertical mobility to urban combat formations.

The rather grandly named 'cockpit' has room for a pilot and a second crewmember, and is fully enclosed.
It is lightly armored and capable of withstanding small arms fire from all directions, with slightly better
underside protection than elsewhere. The rear bed can be configured as a flatbed, low-sided passenger or
cargo compartment, or as a fully enclosed systems compartment.

No armament is fitted as standard, but it is common to fit a pintle-mounted weapon on the cockpit roof, to
be used by a crewmember standing on the seat through the roof hatch. The rear area can carry six Spaces
or 1,500kg of cargo, or up to six people if they do not need to move around much. When in diplomacy and
liaison mode the rear area is often outfitted to create a comfortable space for two VIPs or officers. This can
cost anything from Cr2500 for some basic seats to upwards of Cr50000 for the unit that wants to impress.
Outfitting in this manner does not alter the function of the vehicle.

Enhanced Survivability Package: An additional layer of
applique armor increases protection to 16 all-round
including the underside, allowing the vehicle to survive
fire from a heavy machinegun or similar weapon in all arcs
except from above. In addition an improved electromagnetic
countermeasures suite is fitted in the rear area though it
is usually controlled from the cockpit. These measures
increase cost by Cr50000 and reduce cargo or passenger
capacity by 2 Spaces. Vehicles in this configuration are
typically used for light patrol work, often with 2-4 personnel
riding in the rear compartment.

Urban Prowler: The 'urban prowler' has an open-topped
rear area with a half-ring mount each side. These typically
mount a light autocannon on each side, operated by two
crewmembers who stand in the rear of the vehicle. If this
modification is paired with the enhanced survivability
package, all available space and lifting capacity is used up.
Fitting the autocannon, with gun shields and ring mounts,

increases cost by Cr25000. This modification's name comes
from its initial concept as a close-range fire support vehicle
for personnel operating in cities with tall buildings, but in
practice it can be encountered as a top-cover and overwatch
vehicle on open-country patrols or convoys.

Tank Destroyer: The tank destroyer variant is an attempt
to create an inexpensive fire-support and grav-strike
platform on a very limited budget. A heavy weapon, such
as the LC-85 cannon, is mounted in a front-firing limited-
traverse mount running right through the side of the
cockpit normally occupied by the second crewmember. The
gunner's position is in the rear of the vehicle, along with a
limited supply of ammunition. With no spare capacity for
improved armor, this vehicle is vulnerable but can provide
useful fire support or ambush light armored vehicles in
urban or cluttered vertical terrain. Modification to fit the
cannon costs Cr150000 including the gun, and takes up all
available space.

The Preplenn is a small avian creature native to the homeworld of Dirgess Industries, a medium-sized
constructor of military and paramilitary grav craft. Like its namesake, the Preplenn fast attack platform is
designed to strike hard and fast, often from behind the concealment of terrain. The fuselage and critical
spaces are lightly armored, making them proof against small arms fire from all likely angles. The underside
has been given enhanced protection as is common with vehicles intended for the air support and strike role.

Primary armament is a gauss cannon in a fixed mount, suitable for ground attack or air-to-air combat against
less agile or large targets. In addition the Preplenn has an internal weapons bay capable of holding two
one-Space weapons and three underside hardpoints capable of carrying three more. It is not uncommon to
encounter Preplenn class strike platforms in a swing-role configuration, equipped with light anti-air missiles on
the three external hardpoints and bombs or missiles in the internal bay.

The usual deployment for this craft – which it was designed for – is as a tankbuster and close-support
platform, enabling mercenary forces to provide their own air support without need for runways or extensive
infrastructure. Typically the main gun is operated by the pilot, with the weapons operator delivering missiles
or guided bombs using the secondary fire control system. Fire control is provided for both crew positions and
can be switched between weapons as needed. The cost of the base model includes the gauss cannon but no
missiles or bombs.

**Aerospace Supremacy Variant:** Where lightly armored flying
targets are more likely than tanks, this variant provides
maximum firepower at the expense of penetration. The
gauss cannon is replaced with a pair of rotary autocannon,
with a pair of rotary machineguns installed in the internal
weapons bay. The three underside hardpoints are normally
used for light AA missiles but any or all of them can carry
rotary machineguns in streamlined packs. This gives the
Preplenn a potential of five rotary machineguns and two
rotary autocannon, which is enough to chew any mid-tech
aircraft out of the sky. The same weapons fit can be used to
create a formidable ground-attack platform, at least against
lightly armored targets. The 2-autocannon/2-machinegun
package costs Cr80000 which actually reduces the cost
of the vehicle by Cr20000. Each rotary machinegun pack
costs Cr15000 if added to a hardpoint.

Interceptor Variant: Intended for area air defence against
large aircraft or perhaps ballistic missiles, the interceptor
variant replaces its gauss cannon with a pair of rotary
autocannon and carries light anti-air missiles in the internal
bay. The three underside pylons are merged to support a
long-range anti-air missile. In this role the interceptor's
ability to take off from a hidden forward position without
the use of a runway and to climb to altitude in a short time
are of paramount importance. The large missile is effective
against heavy bombers or transport aircraft and can even
be used to attack satellites in low orbit. This variant is
Cr50000 cheaper than the standard one before missiles are
purchased, but if an expensive missile such as HighStrike is
used the cost increases considerably.

The Chagride was developed as an inexpensive grav APC, and like many vehicles in the marketplace it has
been used as the basis for a range of variants. As a result the basic model is known by the designation 'grav
sled' rather than any role-specific term. The actual role of the vehicle is indicated by a second term, such as
Chagride Ambulance or Chagride Fire Support Vehicle. This tells personnel what they need to know – what
the vehicle does and which chassis it is based upon.

The basic Chagride grav sled has three crew positions, all up front in the driving compartment, and can be
configured with an open or closed rear structure. No weapons are fitted as standard. Armor is sufficient to
give all-round protection from infantry-portable anti-vehicle weapons and light support weaponry, and can be
upgraded with a bolt-on armor package. The rear area holds 22 Spaces or 5,500kg of cargo, sufficient to
deploy an 8-10 soldier infantry section with room for some supplies or equipment. Limited NBC protection is
available as an option, adding a hostile environment package and short-term life support. This consumes one
Space and adds Cr170000 to the price. There is no airlock with this package, which is intended to allow the
vehicle to survive NBC attack rather than operate for an extended period in a contaminated area.

**Survivability Upgrade:** Bolt-on armor plates and inserts
increase protection to 28 rear and sides and 24 top and
bottom. Frontal armor is 30. The vehicle's structure
cannot carry much more than this without a complete
rebuild. This package consumes 2 internal Spaces and
adds Cr160000 to the cost.

**Fire Support Upgrade:** Adding a full-sized turret uses 4
Spaces inside the vehicle and costs Cr125000. The turret
is self-contained and remotely controlled from the crew
compartment. Ready ammunition is stored within the
turret, with reloading possible from within the vehicle
through a pair of hatches in the crew compartment roof.
The turret cannot traverse with the reloading mechanism
in use. Standard armament is a 60mm autocannon and a
co-axial machinegun in a low-profile turret, though other
turrets will fit on the mountings. Adding a turret in this
configuration costs Cr180000, or Cr325000 if combined
with an armor refit. Cargo capacity is reduced to 18
Spaces or 16 Spaces with the armor refit, though 8-10
infantry soldiers can still be carried.

Artillery Sled Modification: The Chagride is the basis for
a variety of artillery platforms, some of which are fairly
modest. One common modification adds an enclosed
220mm rocket artillery system protected by the vehicle's
armor until raised into firing position. Eight unguided
220mm artillery rockets are carried, with no reloads.
These can be launched singly but are almost always used
in multiples. The ability of a grav platform to approach
within firing range then retreat quickly allows a suitably
equipped force to harass enemies without becoming
vulnerable to counter-battery fire. The missile system takes
up 12 Spaces and costs Cr40000. No autoloader can be
fitted due to space constraints, so typically a Chagride
will launch then retire for rearming. Autoloader-equipped
vehicles – which might be others on the Chagride chassis
or soft-skinned support platforms – can rearm the launcher
at a suitable rendezvous point. Some users carry a set
of spare missiles in the rear compartment and reload
manually, though this is heavy work for a 3-person crew.
Others carry no reloads and use the remaining space in the
vehicle for defensive weaponry.

The Saita grav tank was developed for the commercial market, though it can be encountered in service with many
governmental clients as well. Like most grav tanks it is designed for a ground-hugging mode of operation, using
terrain for cover and firing over it rather than flying above the battle area and firing down.

Armor is allocated in a classic tank style, with a heavy frontal glacis plate and lighter armor at the sides and rear.
Top and underside protection are good for a vehicle of this class, allowing highly mobile dash-and-strike maneuvers
to be undertaken with relative impunity. This is still a light tank, of course, and by no means invulnerable.

Internally, the tank is built around two interconnected compartments. The driving compartment contains the driver
and commander, with the gunner and a technical crewmember seated in the rear compartment. No personnel are
carried in the turret, which is remotely controlled and separated from the rest of the tank. Saitas have survived having
the turret blasted off by a fusion gun, through the cost of a rebuild would likely be prohibitive if the fusion reactor
were to be damaged in any significant way.

The fusion reactor is the heart of the vehicle and contributes most to its high price tag. The decision to install one
has always been controversial, but was based on an analysis of the likely market. An on-board reactor gives virtually
unlimited range and more importantly eliminates downtime for charging. A unit that wants to operate grav tanks will
need a reactor to charge them anyway so cannot avoid the cost, and whilst larger forces could get more armored
firepower for their Credits by buying a charging vehicle and non-fusion powered tanks, these would have to rotate
through states of readiness.

Primary armament is a C-type plasma cannon, which takes up the entire 16-Space turret. Smaller or more compact
weaponry can be fitted if this is desirable, depending on the intended role of the vehicle. The plasma gun has a
nominal range of 12km but this assumes a high position and downward fire over terrain undulations. Against lower-
tech foes a grav tank can get away with firing from altitude but against credible opponents it must stay low and use
cover, in which case the effective range of the weapons greatly reduced.

Non-Fusion Variant: A version powered by rechargeable
fuel cells is also available, costing MCr2 less than the
standard version. Some users purchase one fusion tank to
lead a platoon, with the others taking power from it when
necessary. The fusion reactor bay can be used for stowage

The S-series is a large grav transport developed to meet a variety of needs. The basic unit is a lightly armored
'grav truck' suitable for most logistics or personnel movement needs. Its broad oval hull form is reasonably
aerodynamic, though awkwardly shaped cargoes carried on an open frame can catch the wind alarmingly. The
driving compartment has space for two crewmembers and is separated from the configurable rear area by a
bulkhead pierced by a strongly built hatch. The rear area has drop-down sides and rear to allow loading from all
angles. These outer walls are only 1m high above the truck bed, with extendable posts to permit a soft covering to
be applied at need. A fully-enclosed model with permanent sides is available at no extra cost, used as the basis
for most variants.

The basic S-Series is armored all round against small-arms fire, including its underside. Top armor is
notoriously weak, but this was never intended to be a combat vehicle. The crew ride in an NBC-protected citadel
which has an additional 20 points of armor. No weapons are fitted as standard, but many users add a remote-
controlled machinegun or similar light support weapon on the cab roof. In its basic logistics configuration the
S-series is assigned the reporting name 'Skate' whilst when serving as a personnel transport it is referred to as
'Snake'. A Snake can easily transport an entire platoon of infantry, and some users fit pintle mounts around the
periphery of an open-topped vehicle for support weapons.

High-Survivability Variant ('Sermon'): An applique armor
package increases armor protection to 20 front, back and
sides, with 18 on the underside and 14 on top. A laser anti-
missile system is fitted atop the cab roof and an improved
ECM unit is built into the front of the cargo area. This adds
Cr750000 to the cost of the vehicle and reduces cargo
capacity to 42 Spaces (10.5 tons).

Mobile Hospital Variant ('Studio'): The mobile hospital
variant mounts a TL10 field medical unit inside the rear
compartment, carried in ready condition and able to be set
up or closed down for travel in a matter of minutes. This
variant costs MCr7.171. It has 10 Spaces (2.5 tons) for
stores, spares or additional facilities. This space is often
turned into a 'travel lounge' for the medical professionals
assigned to the vehicle.

Mobile Support Variant ('Scholar'): The mobile support variant
attempts to pack a unit headquarters into a single vehicle.
It incorporates the protection of the Sermon variant and
in addition carries a TL10 fusion plant and a field nuclear
damper. A small command center, capable of supporting six
personnel, is housed within a second citadel connected to
the driving chamber by a short tunnel. No weapons are fitted
as standard but there are 9 spaces available for weapons,
cargo or any additional facilities the user may want. Cost is
Cr7,566,575.

Direct Support Variant ('Salacious'): The direct support
variant was given the reporting name Salacious as a
convoluted reference to potential users apparently needing
to compensate for something. The basic vehicle has been
heavily up-armored, raising protection to 30 all round and

27 underneath. The cab has 15 points of top protection but
the rest of the vehicle is open-topped. The rear compartment
is crossed by two large beams, from which a pair of outriggers
are slung along the sides of the vehicle. These have open
weapon stations at the front, rear and center, with a gunner
seated directly at the weapon they control.

Armament can vary but 'showroom standard' is a Blackjack
gun/missile system in the front position on each side, with a
co-axial machinegun. The weapon station for these incudes
space for a gunner and loader, with 18 rounds for the gun
and three missiles. The central and rear stations mount AC-
40 medium automatic cannon, with a single operator and
hopper containing 200 rounds for each gun. All guns have a
co-axial machinegun.

The outriggers take up a lot of the vehicle's lifting capability,
and their supports block off much of the rear compartment.
Aft of the rear support is a mounting for an AirSpace defence
system and an operator station for it, consuming all available
space in that area. Immediately behind the cab, between it
and the forward strut, is a built-up framework supporting a
turret. This mounts an LC-85 cannon and a co-axial 25mm
autocannon, remotely controlled from the cab.

The conversion process requires some sub-optimal
arrangement of components, with the result that only 10
Spaces (2.5 tons) remain in the center of the open rear
section. Some users carry additional ammunition, whilst
others find a way to cram more weaponry into this space.
Cost without weapons is Cr650000. With the weapons fit
listed above the vehicle costs an additional Cr750000.

**CHAPTER-TWELVE**

**STARSHIPS**

The majority of mercenary units cannot afford starships of their own. Those that could will often choose to
spend the money on combat-related hardware instead. Starships are essential to the operations of two kinds
of mercenary force, however. Those that operate primarily as a starship crew – known as starmercs – typically
act as escorts for merchant traffic or protectors of vulnerable star systems and are organised differently to the
typical ground-combat unit. Some mercenary forces are geared towards ground combat but require starships as
an integral part of their equipment, such as space-mobile formations or orbital assault units. The remainder will
obtain and use starships if they seem useful and are available at an affordable price.

DIPLOMATIC SKIFF GRAVITAS-CLASS

The Gravitas- class is intended to function as a
diplomatic or headquarters vessel. Most commonly,
it is used by well-off mercenary units to transport
representatives. These may be attending conferences
or meetings with potential clients, visiting arms
fairs or negotiating with a weaponry supplier. The
ability to house emissaries in a secure and mobile
facility is also useful during delicate negotiations
with unreliable opponents. The Gravitas provides all
this, as well as the capability to bring a client close
to the combat zone and keep them informed without
placing them in danger.

Some specialist formations operate the Gravitas as
a major asset. These are not starmercs per se, since
they provide strategic or groundside services such as
electronic warfare, intelligence and strategic analysis
and the like. In this role the vessel essentially serves
as a mobile command post rather than combat
asset, though it may be armed for self-defence.

Hull form is a typical 'humped cylinder', arranged as
two primary decks. The drives and engineering spaces
are housed in a two-deck-high section right aft, with
the bridge above these on a dorsal hump. Forward
of engineering is the accommodation block. On the
upper deck are four standard staterooms and two
high-quality staterooms, with a lounge area forward
of these. On the lower deck is a block of barracks-

like accommodation with its own associated leisure/
working area. This is not required on some vessels
and often converted to other uses. Forward of the
accommodation/barracks block on the lower deck are
the medical and workshop areas, plus an oversized
armory. The forward section of the upper deck
contains a briefing/analysis/command suite whose
operation is the primary function of many vessels.

Performance is quite lively, which can be useful
when getting into and out of a combat zone
and which also allows the Gravitas to act as a
coordination platform for long-range missile strikes
or control vessel for fighters. It is not commonly
deployed in a space combat operations role,
however, and would normally host an intelligence or
cyber-warfare staff in its mission chambers. These
can also be used as a command post or to impress a
potential client.

Weaponry is defensive, and backed up by a lightly
armored hull. Both turrets are carried on the dorsal
surface, in a pronounced central hump and a smaller
forward one. Standard armament is a dual pulse
laser turret forward to engage enemy craft and a
multi-purpose turret mounted centrally. As standard
this has a beam laser and a sandcaster for defensive
work plus a missile rack which can be used to deploy
satellites or in a more conventional combat role.

GUNSHIP SHADOW-CLASS

The Shadow was developed from the outset as a
space combat vessel to be used by mercenaries or
small navies. It is not designed to fight larger vessels
unless they are very lightly armed, as its intended
space-combat role is piracy suppression and
protection of commerce. It does make an effective
commerce raider or light combat vessel, and was
designed to operate with or protect the Gravitas- class
diplomatic vessel. The Shadow can also transport
a platoon of ground troops, though long-term
occupancy is inadvisable. In this role, the gunship
can deliver troops and their personal equipment
but relies on a support vessel to transport heavy
equipment and supplies for a long-term deployment.
If troop transport capability is not desired the
barracks and its associated common area can be
converted to other uses.

Hull form is a 'cranked wedge' configuration, with a
wide 2-deck high section at the rear and a narrower
single-deck section projecting forward from it. Drives
are located aft on both decks, with the barracks
area, workshops, medical bay and armory forward

of them. The upper deck contains crew staterooms
and a small common area, forward of which lie the
bridge and command spaces.

The dual-purpose turrets are located atop the wedge
section, each with a small missile magazine. When
not launching missiles these turrets can provide
defensive fire. The two triple turrets rest atop the
main dorsal surface and are primarily used to
engage enemy vessels.

The vessel requires a crew of 9 for normal
operations, though adding a medic is advisable.
Some users dispense with the barracks and convert
the lower deck into a vehicle bay and deployment
area. Giving the ship's commander and the leader
of ground troops their own stateroom and moving
all other crew into double occupancy leaves six
staterooms which can be used by up to twelve
groundside personnel. This frees up the whole
barracks and troops' common area for spares and
supplies or vehicles and combat equipment.

ASSAULT SHIP DEYST-CLASS

The Deyst was conceived as a strike-and-retrieve
transport for a small force of heavily armed troops,
intended to be the spearhead of an assault or a
facilitator of commando missions. The hull is well
armored and performance in space or atmosphere
is generally good, enabling the Deyst to bring its
primary armament of twin fusion barbettes into
action against most targets.

Hull form is a streamlined wedge, two decks high at
the rear and tapering forwards. Drives and command
spaces are located aft on the upper deck, with the
staterooms, some common areas and utility spaces
split between the port and starboard sections of the
upper wedge. The fusion gun barbettes are mounted
at the front of the dorsal surface. Two triple laser
turrets are positioned aft and slightly outboard of
these, with the other pair on the outer edges of the
wedge to provide all-round firepower.

The lower deck is almost entirely given over to
troop operations. A platoon of infantry can be
easily accommodated in the barracks, with senior
personnel assigned cabins on the deck above.
Cargo, training and common spaces are specified
in the standard design but many users customise
their vessels by swapping functions around. The
assault capsule system is the heart of the ship for
some operators and wholly irrelevant to others, in
which case the area is usually repurposed. If it is
used, the system can put a dozen troopers on the
ground from orbit, with a second wave landing in
the ship.

Nominal crew is twelve including gunners, though
typically medics and armament technicians are
carried – especially by those rare units with
access to battle dress. Some operators do away
with the barracks and associated areas, adding
a few staterooms if necessary and creating a
large cargo space. This is useful for vessels that
undertake planetary raiding or piracy, but does
have some less nefarious applications.

TRANSPORT BORWEN-CLASS

The Borwen was developed as a small and inexpensive
troop transport for mercenary and government clients. It
is not an assault ship, though inevitably there are users
who will try to use it as one. Like many paramilitary
ships, the Borwen has a lightly armored hull and some
weaponry fitted as standard for self-defence.

General hull form is a 'flared cylinder', formed from
a primary hull with three compartmentalised sections
below. The central secondary hull is much longer and
larger than the other two, which flank it to create a
broad rear section. The primary, or 'working', hull
is dedicated to 'ship' operations, with the drives
and power plant conventionally located aft. Crew
accommodation is forward of this, with common areas
and the bridge positioned right forward. 32 staterooms
are provided, which is far more than a standard working
crew would need even with all crewmembers being
allocated a cabin of their own.

Nominal working crew is 20 including gunners and
one medic, though when troops are aboard the usual
medical complement is one medical officer and six
assistants, all of whom are familiar with emergency
low berth revival protocols. With 25 crew aboard it is
possible to jam a platoon of infantry into the remaining
staterooms, more or less, though normally cabins are
reserved for officers and senior NCOs.

Weapons fit is above average for a transport ship, with
ten dual turrets. Eight are grouped into two clusters on
the dorsal surface of the main hull, each containing
a twin pulse laser turret, two sandcaster turrets and

a missile/beam laser turret, with ammunition bays
serving each. Most vessels carry a few missiles for
combat work or even ground attack, with the rest
of their capacity available to launch satellites or
surveillance probes. The remaining dual pulse laser
turrets are mounted singly to give a wider arc of fire.

The lower deck contains three almost identical 'platoon
transport segments' arranged in parallel. The outer two
each contain 60 low berths each plus a small ready
area, cargo stowage and a medical bay. The central
one is has 40 low berths and a double-sized medical
bay that serves as a trauma center when the vessel is
supporting groundside operations. Forward of this are
training areas, a barracks capable of transporting a
platoon-sized unit and an extensive armory/workshop
for the unit's weaponry.

A company of up to 200 infantry can be transported
aboard a Borwen, with one platoon and command
personnel travelling 'awake' and the remainder in
low berths. A limited amount of supplies and support
equipment can be carried, though a unit with a lot
of vehicles may need a bigger ship. One of the key
factors in deciding what equipment to purchase is
whether it will fit aboard the unit's transport vessel.
Common variants replace the three low berth bays
with cargo space, creating a logistics ship, or with
garages for combat vehicles. An armored company
will often be able to squeeze its personnel into the
barracks and spare staterooms, raising carrying
capacity to around 200 tons depending on the nature
of modifications undertaken.

CHAPTER-ONE

**SOLDIER LOADOUTS**

The Traveller Core Rulebook states that Travellers be
allowed to carry a 'reasonable' load without tracking
it. Unfortunately, many Travellers have a rather
curious idea of what is reasonable. Three different
rifles, a flamethrower, an anti-aircraft missile
launcher, six handguns and dozens of magazines for
each weapon is most definitely not reasonable.

If a quick rule of thumb is required, it can be
assumed that a soldier can fight effectively wearing
body armor and carrying a single long gun, a
sidearm, one or two grenades and a few tools such as
wire cutters, plus no more than six spare magazines
for the main weapon. Additional equipment can be
carried in a pack, and shed once combat starts, but
there is a limit to how much can be carried without
becoming excessively tired. If the Travellers want to
push the limits of what they can carry and still move
or fight, stricter rules are necessary. These are based
on page 92 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , modified
for the mercenaries' circumstances.

Note that powered armor does not contribute to
encumbrance when powered up and that the weight
of worn armor is distributed so as to reduce its
effective weight by 75%.

Revised Encumbrance
These rules are intended to supersede those
presented in the Traveller Core Rulebook ,
making the assignation of Banes the sole
preserve of the Referee.

Combat Light: All levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END
Combat light represents the maximum load a Traveller
can carry and still act without penalty. The load must
still be carried in a plausible manner. For a fit and
properly trained mercenary, a combat light loadout
will typically be around 16–18kg of equipment.

Combat Load: 2x (all levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END)
A soldier's combat load is up to twice their 'combat
light' load, so around 32–36kg for a fit and well-
trained soldier. At this level all physical actions that
require significant movement are one difficulty level
harder. A soldier doing something that requires only
slight movement, such as shooting from cover, does
not suffer this penalty but as a rule of thumb anything
requiring more than a step or turn in place qualifies
as 'significant movement'. A soldier carrying combat
load is considered to be performing heavy labour as
per page 76 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Field Load: 3x (all levels in Athletics (strength and
endurance) plus STR + END)
Soldiers are often overburdened with equipment
they might or might not actually need. In addition
to combat equipment, body armor and necessary
personal kit, the soldier will usually also be carrying
additional food and water, some kind of field shelter,
and ammunition for support weapons or electronic
equipment. Much of this additional equipment will be
in or attached to a pack that can be quickly ditched
in a fight, enabling the soldier to move down from
field load to combat load or even combat light. Of
course, this equipment might be lost if the unit is
pushed back and cannot retrieve its packs. Field load
is up to three times the soldier's combat light load.
At this level all physical tasks are considered one
difficulty level harder whether they require significant
movement or not. For a typical fit and well trained
soldier, field load is a maximum of 48–54kg.

**Overburdened:** Beyond 3x (all levels in Athletics
(strength and endurance) plus STR + END)
It is physically possible to carry more than a standard
field load and indeed some militaries have fitness
requirements based on carrying a very large load for
a certain distance. However, soldier performance is
greatly degraded when lurching along under a gigantic
pack. In addition to the penalty mentioned for field
load the soldier suffers DM-1 on all tasks (of any
kind) for every amount of weight equal to their STR in
kilograms, or fraction thereof, carried above maximum
field load.

For example, a mercenary has STR and END of 8, and
one skill level in Athletics. Their combat light load is
17kg, combat load is 34kg and maximum field load
is 51kg. If this soldier is carrying 50kg all tasks are
one difficulty level harder and they are considered
to be carrying out heavy labour for the purposes of
fatigue. If carrying 52–59kg they also suffer DM-
on all checks. At 60kg this increases to DM-2, and
continues to increase until the soldier is no longer
capable of moving or even lifting their pack.

The Referee must also keep in mind the bulk of some
items. A Traveller might figure out they can carry 80
assault rifle magazines and remain within their field
load but it is highly unlikely they would be physically
able to carry these objects unless their standard-issue
equipment includes a wheelbarrow.

This book requires only the Traveller Core Rulebook to
use. A number of weapon traits are described in that
book and apply unchanged unless otherwise noted. In
addition, some new weapon traits are introduced in the
Field Catalogue, as detailed below. Other traits can be
found in the Central Supply Catalogue if it is in use and
apply to the weapons found there. In some cases these
may be similar to traits described in this book. At the
Referee's discretion similar traits can be swapped, such
as Fire and Burn or Hazardous and Dangerous.

Burn X: A Burn weapon delivers half its initial damage
for a number of rounds equal to its Burn score.

Corrosion-Resistant (+X): An item or device that has
Corrosion-Resistant (+X) is degraded by corrosion to a
lesser degree.

Corrosive: A Corrosive weapon does damage over time
and can destroy armor. See page 24 for details.

Emissions Signature (level): The Emissions Signature
trait is possessed by all weapons with a power source
or which generate heat, since these weapons show
up readily on sensors. Examples include, but are not
limited to, lasers, gauss weapons, flame or cryogenic
weapons, plus plasma and fusion guns. When sensors
are being used to detect and locate a weapon its
Emissions Signature DM is applied. If a weapon does
not have the Emissions Signature trait it will only be

CHAPTER-TWO

**WEAPON TRAITS**

detected by specialist devices using the same cues
as a human or other living being would. For example,
acoustic location devices use the sound of a weapon
to locate it, just like a person turning to look in the
direction the sound seemed to be coming from. Such
devices use the weapon's Physical Signature trait
rather than Emissions Signature.

Hazardous -X: Some weapons use hazardous materials
such as generated plasma or highly flammable gels. This
does not necessarily make them dangerous to use but
does increase the severity of a malfunction. A well-made
and properly cared-for weapon should never suffer a
significant malfunction in the field and if this is the case
the user need not worry about the nuclear fusion reaction
going on in the weapon's powerpack. If the weapon does
suffer a malfunction or is penetrated by enemy fire, use
the Malfunction table on page 8 to determine the severity
of the problem. The weapon's Hazardous score is applied
as a negative DM on this table.

Most weapons pose some hazard if damaged or
mishandled but typical propellants and batteries are
considered to be a zero-DM hazard and do not give the
weapon the Hazardous trait.

The effects of an incident with a Hazardous weapon
can vary. A truly bad conventional firearm might have a
Hazardous DM greater than -3 but a breach explosion is
less serious than a grenade going off in its launcher.

Weapon Hazard Levels
Hazard DM Example
-1 Poorly made conventional firearms prone to stoppages and ammunition mishaps.
-2 Stable explosives such as typical launched grenades, high-discharge energy systems such
as laser or gauss weapon powerpacks.
-3 Very poor conventional firearms likely to injure the user at some point.
-4 Possibly unstable explosives, such as ageing dynamite or high-yield explosives.
-6 Flammable materials such as those used in a flamethrower or cryogenic fluids.
-8 Well-protected plasma generation chamber, such as used on a well-made plasma gun.
-10 Well-protected plasma fusion chamber, such as used on a well-made fusion gun or poorly
engineered plasma generation.
-12 Poorly engineered plasma fusion chamber, such as those found on improvised
fusion weapons.

**Inaccurate -X:** A weapon with Inaccurate suffers a
negative DM to hit when shooting at a target more than
10m distant. This is normally -1 or -2 but could be more
in the case of a very ill-made weapon. Smoothbores
almost all suffer from Inaccurate, although it is not
usually much of a problem at the range where a shotgun
might be used.

**Incendiary X:** An Incendiary weapon will set materials
alight on a successful check determined by the nature
of the materials. A sufficiently hot incendiary can even
ignite materials that would not normally be considered
flammable, such as metals. The weapon's Incendiary
score is used as a positive modifier to this check; if not
specified this value is +0.

**Flammability**

Material Type Example Difficulty
Highly Flammable Liquid fuel Simple (2+)
Flammable Straw, some
clothing

Routine (6+)

Non-Flammable Skin, military
uniform

Average (8+)

Fire Resistant Vacc suit Difficult (10+)
Highly Fire
Resistant

Metals Formidable
(14+)

**Lo-Pen X:** Some weapons perform very poorly against
armor or fail to penetrate hard surfaces. This can be
desirable, such as when ammunition is intended for
use on a small indoor firing range or inside spacecraft.
A low-penetration round is unlikely to punch a hole in
a cabling conduit and wreck the ship's control systems.
Weapons with Lo-Pen have a score, typically 2 or 3.
This is a multiple to be applied to the target's armor,
if any. Thus a Lo-Pen (3) weapon striking a flak jacket
with Protection +5 would treat it as Protection +15;
penetration is highly unlikely. Low-velocity firearms and
pellet-firing weapons typically have this trait.

**Physical Signature (level):** The Physical Signature of
a weapon is based on the amount of noise, flash and
disturbance of small objects caused by its propulsion
mechanism or passage of its beam, bolt or projectile.
All firearms and energy weapons have at least some
Physical Signature and in many cases this is about the
same as that of a typical handgun or rifle. In this case
it is not really necessary to note down the signature of
the weapon as attempts to detect and locate the user
are as normal.

Ramshackle -X: Ramshackle weapons are typically
thrown together out of whatever parts were available,
or are poorly engineered. Examples include crude
zip guns made in backstreet workshops, home-made
flamethrowers and improvised fusion guns. Ramshackle
scores usually range from -1 to -4 depending on the
severity of the weapon's deficiencies but can be even
more. Typically, attempts to repair or build a weapon at
lower than its Tech Level will impose a Ramshackle trait
equal to the difference in Tech Levels. Poor manufacture
or parts, long periods without maintenance and bad
design can all impose a Ramshackle trait on a weapon.
The DM is applied to attack rolls and the results of
weapon malfunctions. At the Referee's discretion it can
be reduced by the Effect of a Mechanics check made
when fixing a damaged weapon in the field. Note that
being Ramshackle does not necessarily make a weapon
Unreliable. A cobbled-together weapon can be safe and
reliable, just not very good.

For example, a party of Travellers finds a TL14 fusion
gun that someone has abandoned. With no tools
available, the team's mechanical genius decides to
have a go at fixing it up. Using nothing more than her
boot and a nearby rock, she performs a mechanical
miracle with Effect +7. The fusion gun is restored to
useable condition... sort of. The Referee rules that rocks
and vigorous stomping of components constitutes TL
repair work, so the weapon would have an incredible
Ramshackle (-14) score. This is partially offset by
particularly skilled bashing with a rock, so it ends
up with Ramshackle (-7). This applies to all attack
rolls, making the weapon useful only for spraying the
countryside with fusing plasma. If the makeshift fusion
gun is damaged and suffers a Mishap, this DM-7 is also
applied to the results... which will be rather bad for
everyone nearby.

Slow Loader X: Some weapons are just plain fiddly
to load. This includes advanced but badly designed
weapons whose magazine is difficult to seat properly as
well as those that require multiple actions to prepare
them to fire. A black powder rifle, for example, requires
a powder charge to be poured down the barrel and
rammed, then the projectile to be rammed home, then
possibly a wad to be also rammed down the barrel.
The lock is then prepared, either with more powder or
a separate percussion cap, before the weapon can be
cocked and readied. This is going to take much longer
than the usual one minor action to reload a weapon.

Slow Loader is followed by a score that determines how
many minor actions are required to load the weapon.
For a fiddly magazine-fed submachinegun the score
might be 2–4, whereas a black powder rifle could have
Slow Loader (10) or more. Taking three minor actions
per combat round, this could mean the weapon is out of
commission for three or more rounds between shots.

A Traveller can elect to make an Average (8+) Gun
Combat check to reduce the loading time. The Effect
of this check is deducted from the Slow Loader score,
to a minimum of one minor action. A skilled user might
be able to slap that awkward magazine in first time or
change a belt faster than normal but a very slow weapon
will still take time to load.

Spread X: A Spread weapon fires multiple projectiles
either at once or in very rapid succession. Shotguns
are the most common examples but there are weapons
that fire mini-grenades that burst into a hail of small
submunitions in flight. A very fast-firing automatic
weapon might also possess the Spread trait when used
to spray a target. A Spread weapon has an associated
score, usually in the range of 1–4. When the weapon is
used within its base range, the firer may add the Spread
value to all attack rolls.

Unreliable X: An Unreliable weapon is prone to
malfunctions and breakdowns. This is typically seen
with primitive weaponry such as black powder muskets

but could be imposed by poor-quality ammunition. A
weapon's degree of Unreliable is indicated by a score in
the range 1–5. When this weapon is used, an additional
1D of a different colour is thrown along with the usual
2D check. If this dice comes up equal to or less than
the unreliability value for the weapon it suffers a
malfunction. This might be a simple misfire but could
be a full jam or even a breach explosion.

If a weapon malfunction occurs, roll 2D on the
Malfunction table. The weapon's user receives a positive
DM equal to their relevant combat skill. Negative DMs
also apply.

Weapon Power: DM-1 for every 1D of damage done by
the weapon.
Hazardous Weapon: Apply the weapon's Hazardous score
as a negative DM.

Malfunction
2D+DMs Result
0- Breech explosion or similar disaster. The weapon is ruined and the user receives its normal damage.
1–3 A critical component breaks. The weapon is out of action until repaired in a workshop.
4–6 A component breaks or ammunition jams in the mechanism. The weapon is out of action but can be
fixed in a few minutes without the need for a workshop.
7–9 An ammunition misfeed or similar minor technical issue occurs. One significant action is required to
clear it or ready the weapon.
10+ A minor technical fault wastes this shot but does not put the weapon out of commission. For
example, a grenade launches but fails to detonate, or a bit of dirt on the end of the emitter tunnel
blocks a laser pulse but is vapourised by it clearing the weapon to shoot normally.

Combining Spread and Inaccurate
Some weapons have both Spread and
Inaccurate, such as shotguns. Inaccurate does
not apply within 10m so at this range the user
benefits from the Spread value. Between 10m
and the weapon's base range, both apply. Thus
a shotgun with Spread (2) and Inaccurate (-1)
affords the user a net DM+1 to attack rolls.

Sometimes a Traveller may be in a situation where a
specific capability – such as locating the origin of a shot
or getting a weapon on target – can mean the difference
between life and death. The procedures presented here
are modified by some weapon features and Traveller
skills. They require the addition of new concepts to the
_Traveller_ rules, although some of the concepts outlined
here are already implicit.

RANGE CONDITIONS
The precise distance from combatant to target is
sometimes very important, such as when calculating a
firing solution for artillery. However, most of the time
the general range conditions are more important as
they impose tactical limitations. There are five 'range
conditions' that can apply to a military force or some of
its members.

**Close Quarters** (sometimes called Close Assault) is a
situation where hand-to-hand combat may occur. The
most effective weapons tend to be handguns, assault
weapons, shotguns, light assault rifles and melee
weapons. Like all range conditions, Close Quarters is
loosely defined; in this case it is a situation where at
least some combatants are capable of rushing into their
opponents to attack with bayonets or similar personal
weaponry. Personnel who are engaged at close quarters
are unlikely to be able to keep track of the 'big picture'

- they are too busy trying to stay alive! As a result DM-
applies on checks other than those pertaining to the
immediate close-combat situation. This DM may also
be applied to almost any combat or non-combat task
a Traveller is trying to carry out – directing the fire of
an orbital battery, giving orders to another unit or even
just responding to a radio message becomes a lot more
difficult when engaged at Close Quarters.

**Combat** range includes Close Quarters and extends out to
a loosely-defined point beyond which careful aimed fire
or area attacks with large amounts of ammunition are
the only realistic way to harm the enemy. Most combat
seen by typical Travellers takes place under these range
conditions, and is characterised by snapshots taken at

fleeting targets. The outer limit of Combat range can
be taken as around 50m. Combat at this range makes
it difficult to keep track of the big picture, imposing
DM-2 on checks other than those pertaining to the
immediate situation. Although less chaotic than a close-
assault situation, a force engaged at Combat range will
be distracted from anything but the situation at hand.
This of course assumes the enemy is active. If they are
hiding or have been suppressed to the point where they
are no longer making much effort to attack, the unit is
considered not to be engaged in Combat and can go
about its business as normal.

Battlefield range conditions extend to the point where
direct-fire weapons are highly unlikely to be effective.
This is typically 3–5 kilometers, but can vary according
to the local situation. Essentially, if an enemy force
is close enough to be engaged by the main armament
of a tank operating at ground or low level, battlefield
conditions exist. This has various tactical implications,
mainly a need to protect non-combat assets such as
headquarters and logistics formations from direct
attack. Personnel are in danger from long-range
harassing fire and snipers, or support weapons such as
mortars, but are not closely engaged with the enemy.
Combat at Battlefield range tends to be impersonal for
the most part, with vehicles or area targets engaged
rather than specific personnel. Snipers and some
precision weapons can target individuals but survival
is for the most part a matter of good habits regarding
positioning and use of cover, rather than eliminating
specific threats.

Standoff range conditions exist beyond the immediate
battlefield and extend out to the maximum effective
range of locally available weapons. On a TL4 battlefield
this might be just a few kilometers beyond the
immediate combat area and few commonly available
standoff weapons are useful beyond 50–100km. A
force at Standoff range is not in danger from direct-
fire weapons such as lasers, tank guns or firearms but
might be targeted by missiles, rockets, artillery shells
and the like. Standoff warfare is handled differently to
personal combat.

**CONCEPTS AND SPECIAL**

**CIRCUMSTANCES**

CHAPTER-THREE

Theatre range conditions exist when a unit is out of
reach of all but the longest-range weapons. Infiltration is
always possible so security cannot be completely relaxed
but theatre-grade weaponry is geared to large area
targets or vehicles and starships. Defence against such
weapons is on a similar scale. Theatre-level combat is
a matter of long-range air strikes, missile bombardment
and orbital laser fire. It is beyond the scope of most
Traveller-owned mercenary units, although they may
become involved – perhaps leading a commando
mission to take out a missile launch site or defending a
communications center against infiltrators.

VACUUM AND
LOW-GRAVITY

CONDITIONS
These rules generally assume the Travellers are
operating in some kind of atmosphere and that there
is a modest gravitational field. Vacuum and low-gravity
conditions cause additional problems for personnel
engaged in combat – and for their equipment. Most
items without moving parts function well enough in a
vacuum but conventional lubricants tend to evaporate
off, potentially causing a weapon to malfunction. Any
weapon not adapted for vacuum, other than energy
weapons, temporarily gains the Unreliable (1) trait.

Low gravity increases the distance projectiles will
travel but not the ability of personnel to aim. Bullets
do not 'drop' as a shooter experienced in higher
gravity would expect. There is no effect out to 100
meters, after which DM-2 applies to shots made out
to 1,000 meters. DM-4 applies to shots made out to
10 kilometers and DM-6 to shots beyond this. This
DM is reduced by one for every level of the Vacc Suit
skill the shooter has, reflecting an ability to predict
the effects of low or zero gravity and does not apply to
lasers or similar energy weapons.

Extreme range can be considered doubled in minimal
or zero gravity. Weapons that rely on firing in a ballistic
arc become difficult to aim, although incredible
'trick shots' are possible to those with sufficient
mathematical ability to calculate trajectory. Likewise,
trace atmosphere or vacuum does not slow projectiles.
This does not greatly affect the ability of the average
mercenary to point-and-shoot but extreme range is
doubled – and this can be combined with the effects of
low gravity. Thus it is possible to engage targets across
very great distances, although the time taken for a
projectile to get there and the difference in conditions
from that the shooter may be used to, makes hitting a
person with a rifle from 5 kilometers rather difficult no
matter how good the sighting system.

Indirect Fire
Indirect fire in this context refers to any projectile
that does not follow a straight path to the target and
will typically be carried out with grenade launchers
and light artillery weapons. Arguably a hand grenade
'pinballed' off two walls to get it around a corner is
an example of indirect fire, although more commonly
one will be lobbed over an enemy's cover or into their
foxhole. Energy weapons cannot conduct indirect
fire and it cannot be conducted without a physical
mechanism. Thus would normally be gravity but an
extreme magnetic field might be a possibility or the
aforementioned walls in a zero-g environment.

The following indirect fire rule is based on the
Artillery trait found on P7 of Central Supply
Catalogue. It should be used for indirect attacks at
Combat ranges or less. When firing at Battlefield or
greater distances the bombardment and standoff
rules, below, should be used.

When using indirect fire to attack a target that cannot
be directly observed, DM-2 applies to the attempt
to hit. In addition, all indirect attacks – even if the
target is visible to sensors or a handoff targeting point
is available – are imprecise. The attack will land 1D
meters from the target point, plus 1D for every full
100 meters the weapon must travel. Each point of
negative Effect adds one meter to the distance; each
point of positive Effect reduces it by one meter.

Indirect fire is for the most part useful only with
area-effect weapons such as grenades. However, if
the attack roll is good enough to indicate zero meters
then the target has received a direct hit. Area-effect
weapons will do their normal damage and impact
damage may be added at the Referee's discretion.
For most projectiles likely to be used in this manner
impact damage will be 1D for those that have
bounced off something and 2D for direct impact.

This rule can be used to resolve unusual indirect-
fire situations. For example, a Traveller is in a tricky
hostage situation and cannot get a clean shot at an
enemy. Their solution is to yell 'grenade' and throw an
actual grenade but without pulling the pin, bouncing
it off a wall to strike the hostage-taker from behind. A
particularly good attack roll results in a 0m deviation,
so the Referee rules the hostage-taker has been it for
1D damage.

The Traveller asserts that the hostage-taker will assume
the object that beaned them is a live grenade and panic.
The Referee allows a Deception check and it is passed.
The hostage-taker pushes the hostage onto what they

think is a live grenade, clearing the line for another
Traveller to take the shot. Whilst a questionable
solution to the situation, this is a valid use of the
indirect fire rule.

When an area effect weapon is used for indirect fire, it
imposes an Area Fire attack (see page 14) on everyone
within its Burst value in meters.

Firing Over Open Sights
Some artillery weapons can engage targets
directly in line of sight. This is generally referred
to as 'firing over open sights'. High-trajectory
weapons such as mortars cannot do this and
very heavy weapons may not be able to traverse
fast enough or depress far enough to hit targets
at close range. Those that can are treated like
any other weapon conducting direct fire. Light
artillery (guns and howitzers of up to 120mm
calibre) suffers no penalty when conducting
direct fire. Medium artillery (in the 120-180mm
range) suffers DM-2 to hit when firing over open
sights. Heavy artillery of over 180mm calibre
suffers DM-4.

Light rocket and missile systems are intended for
short-range engagements and suffer no penalty.
Medium systems, intended for use at Standoff
ranges, suffer DM-2 when firing at anything
closer than this, and heavy systems such as long-
range aerospace defence missiles suffer DM-
when firing at Standoff range or less. This does
not preclude launching a large aerospace missile
at an approaching tank, but it does make a direct
hit rather unlikely.

Bombardment and Standoff Combat
For the typical Traveller, large weapons such as artillery
guns are either an impersonal hazard or will be used in
direct-fire mode. Those involved with military operations
are more likely to encounter these weapons being used –
or use them – in their bombardment role. A bombardment
can be abstracted using the rules in Book 1 but as the
focus closes in on the Travellers it may be necessary to
resolve an indirect or standoff attack.

Whether an attack is considered bombardment or
standoff combat depends on the degree of guidance.
Bombardment is almost always carried out with indirect
fire weapons and in the context of these rules uses
weapons without terminal or direct guidance. The
same artillery piece could fire an unguided shell in
bombardment mode or deliver a guided shell to the target
area at which point it would home in – this would be
considered standoff combat.

Standoff attacks, in this context, are made with
long-range weapons from a position beyond effective
retaliation. Typically this is the province of artillery and
missile systems, both of whose projectiles follow an
indirect path but a standoff attack can be made by some
specialized direct-fire weapons. The latter include meson
guns and long-range lasers firing from orbit or similarly
high elevation. What differentiates a standoff attack from
bombardment is whether there is some form of terminal
guidance. In the case of long-range lasers and meson
guns the gunner tries for a direct hit at the moment of
firing. With missiles and guided shells the weapon is sent
to the general target area then either self-guides or is
directly controlled from a remote position.

When conducting bombardment the intent is to put
payloads into a general area. With very precise weapons
this area may be smaller than the warhead's danger
radius but more commonly bombardment is something
of a lottery. For this reason weapons with a large area
of effect are preferred. Putting artillery shells into the
general target area requires an Average (8+) Heavy
Weapons (artillery) check. This assumes the weapon is
firing at less than a quarter of its maximum range. At
greater ranges, the difficulty increases, as shown on the
Artillery Accuracy table.

Artillery Accuracy
Range Difficulty
¼ Maximum or less Average (8+)
½ Maximum or less Difficult (10+)
¾ Maximum or less Very Difficult (12+)
¾ to Maximum Formidable (14+)

Success puts the payload in the general area of the
target, sufficiently close to make an Area Fire attack.
Failure indicates the warhead arrived sufficiently far
away as not to threaten the target, although in the case
of some truly enormous weapons there may be other
effects. These are discussed in the Specialists book. If
it is necessary to determine how far away the weapon
landed, deviation can be taken as 2D% of the range it
was fired from. This is a minimum of 100 meters for
weapons fired at 5 kilometers and possibly as much as
6 kilometers for a weapon 50 kilometers away. Direction
must be determined randomly.

A 'hit' on the Heavy Weapons check does not mean a
direct hit has been scored on the target with indirect
fire. Instead it means that the warhead has arrived close
enough to the target to have some effect. Most artillery
weapons have a radius of effect and deliver damage
within that area. Once a hit on the general target area
has been determined with artillery, it is necessary to find
out how serious it will be.

Roll 2D if a 'hit' is scored. On a straight double-6 the
target may have suffered a direct hit and damage is
doubled. On 8+, the round comes close enough to do
full damage. On a roll of 7–, the round buries itself in
the ground or detonates far enough away from the target
that damage is halved. On a straight double-1, the round
is a dud or otherwise fails to have effect due to some
(un)lucky circumstance.

Hits and Near Misses
2D Effect
12+ Doubled Damage; direct hit!
8+ Normal Damage; close hit (primary radius)
7- Halved damage; nearby hit (secondary radius)
2 No Damage

Standoff Attacks, Midcourse Guidance
and Forward Observers
An unguided weapon is handled as above but if some
form of terminal guidance is available the attempt is
considered a standoff attack and is far more likely to
score a direct hit. The positive Effect of the attack check
is added to the 2D check to determine the nature of the
hit. In addition, weapons guided by an operator may
add the operator's Heavy Weapons (artillery) skill level
to the 2D check. Automatically guided weapons use
the projectile's own guidance DM and some advanced
weapons may use both an operator DM and one from the
weapon's own systems.

If a forward observer or some form of midcourse
guidance is available, the chances of a good hit are
further enhanced. To increase the chance of a first-
shot hit a forward observer may make an Electronics
(comms) check subject to additional modifiers as if
making an attack roll. The Effect of this check is added
to (or subtracted from) the weapon's check to reach
the general target area, which in turn will improve
the chances of a direct hit by increasing the level of
success. This process is no different to that on page 7 of
the Central Supply Catalogue.

A forward observer can use their own Heavy Weapons
(artillery) skill to apply corrections to each salvo
after the first, including those made with unguided
bombardment weapons. To do this, the observer must
be able to both see the target area and communicate
with the gunners. After the first salvo, the forward
observer can make a Heavy Weapons (artillery) check.
If successful, the gunners' next shots gain a cumulative
DM+1 to hit, up to a maximum of the observer's skill
level. However, if the gunner fails an attack roll at any
point, the process of walking the artillery onto the target
must begin once again.

_For example, the Travellers have equipped themselves
with a mid-tech field artillery piece and some more
advanced ammunition for it including guided shells. Two
of their number are daringly close to the target acting
as forward observers whilst the rest ready the gun.
The forward observers set up the shot, getting a mildly
disappointing Effect +1 on their Electronics check.
Their comrades fire the gun into the general target area,
gaining this +1 along with their own DM+2 for a solid
Heavy Weapons (artillery) check. The shell will arrive
in the target area and gains DM+3 on the 2D check to
see of a direct hit has been achieved. This DM is for
the forward observers' efforts and that of the crew. In
addition, the weapon's own guidance DM+2 is added.
A score of 8 on 2D is modified to 13 – more than the
12 needed for a direct hit. The observers are satisfied
to see the shell arrive on a good trajectory then adjust it
slightly to come down directly on the target. Without the
shell's terminal guidance it would have been very close
to the target and done normal damage._

SUSTAINED FIRE

AND WEAPON

OVERHEATING
Conventional firearms and most energy weapons
generate a lot of heat when operating and can
malfunction if not permitted to cool. In short or
intermittent combat there is no real need to keep track
of weapon overheating but sometimes it can become
very important. Conventional weapons firing single shots
or even short bursts will not overheat but one that makes
sustained autofire attacks will generate excess heat,
which will begin to cause problems.

A weapon making autofire attacks or one that produces
a great deal of thermal energy such as a plasma or
fusion gun, generates an amount of Heat equal to
its damage dice each round, plus its Auto score. It
dissipates Heat at a rate determined by its construction
during each round it is not fired. If the weapon
exceeds its safe Heat level, a malfunction may occur
on any occasion it is fired – even a single shot. The
malfunction chance is based on the weapon's Heat
level before the attack was made.

Every attack made after the safe Heat threshold is
crossed may cause a malfunction. Single shots and
bursts from conventional firearms do not increase
the Heat DM but they do not reduce it either, so it

is possible to keep popping off single rounds from
a glowing-hot weapon whilst staying just below the
disaster threshold. The chance of a malfunction
depends on the weapon's condition. If a malfunction
occurs, consult the Malfunction table on page 8.

Changing the barrel on weapons equipped for this is
assumed to remove all accumulated heat. Alternatively,
the weapon may be permitted to cool. Weapons dissipate
heat at a rate depending on their construction and any
accessories they may have. Cooling systems can be
added as receiver accessories.

Rapid-Fire (RF) and Very Rapid-Fire (VRF) weapons
produce a great deal of heat and are generally combined
with a cooling system or use multiple barrels to allow
heat to dissipate more quickly.

The chance of a malfunction is given in the Weapon
Heating Effects table. A straight 2D check will indicate
if a problem occurs and the level of DM to be applied on
the Malfunction table on page 8. The Traveller receives
a positive DM equal to their relevant gun combat skill on
this table.

For example, a Traveller in a close-quarters fight makes
autofire attacks from a drum-fed assault rifle for 6
consecutive rounds. This generates 3 points of Heat
for each attack, because the weapon does 3D damage,
and 3 more per round because it is Auto 3. The weapon
currently has 36 Heat points. Up to this point the
Referee has not implemented the overheating rule
because the Traveller was firing intermittently and the
weapon had a chance to cool but a malfunction at this
critical moment could be significant as well as dramatic
and exciting. The Traveller fires again, increasing the
weapon's Heat to 39 at the end of the round but the
chance of a malfunction is based on the 36 points of
Heat at the time the shot was fired. The weapon is past
its danger threshold, so the chance if a malfunction
is 9+ on a straight 2D roll. One occurs, and a check,
with DM-2 for being past the threshold, is made on
the Malfunction table. This is subject to an additional
DM-3 for the weapon's damage dice and DM+2 for the
Traveller's Gun Combat skill, for a total of DM-3. This
comes out a 3 – a critical component of the weapon
has failed and the weapon needs workshop time. The
Referee decides a round has expanded in the breach
and jammed the ejection system. The Traveller's attack
that round is aborted. She switches to her backup
weapon and the situation becomes a bit more desperate.

Using the Overheating Rule
If the Travellers are roleplaying the situation and
allowing their weapons to cool to a reasonable
degree, this rule need not be brought into play.
It is not intended to deprive Travellers of their
firepower after a couple of shots but should be
applied to significant situations. For example, if
the Travellers are using a damaged plasma cannon
to fend off a horde of enemies they will have to
consider whether to allow the weapon to cool or to
keep firing and hope for the best. As with all rules
in Mercenary , the sustained fire and overheating
rule is intended to give the Travellers problems to
solve or opportunities whilst the enemy's heavy
weapon is out of action. Likewise, if the Travellers
decide to tool up with the most extreme rapid-fire
weaponry money can buy, their weapons should
come with some disadvantages. In this case, a
tendency to stop working or even explode is a
reasonable trade-off for having more firepower
than a TL7 infantry battalion.

AREA FIRE
Area fire is typically conducted by artillery and
automatic weapons, although in different ways. Whether
spraying an area with bullets or shell fragments, what
the attacker is doing is creating a situation where
anyone in that area will be endangered, without any
direct control over who is harmed and who is not. Area
fire with automatic weapons is common at Battlefield
range and typically conducted with artillery at Standoff
range. Lighter artillery weapons such as mortars may be
useful at Battlefield range.

When area fire is used, there is a threat to everyone in
the target zone. A 2D check is required to avoid coming
to harm, at a difficultly level determined by the amount
of cover the individual has. For simplicity it is assumed
that anyone staying under hard cover is safe but of
course they are effectively out of action. Anyone trying
to move around, shoot or take other actions requiring
exposure to the incoming fire must make the check to
avoid harm each round. The intensity of the incoming
fire provides a DM to this check.

**Avoiding Damage From Area Fire**

Activity/Protection Level Difficulty
No activity, under hard cover. No check required
Good cover, such as firing from a bunker. Simple (2+)
Adequate cover, such as firing or observing from a trench. Easy (4+)
Scanty cover, such as a firing position among some big rocks. Routine (6+)
In the open but acting defensively, such as dashing between positions of cover or
staying down.

Average (8+)

Little or no use of cover, such as moving around in the open or operating an unprotected
support weapon.

Difficult (10+)

The check is modified by the intensity of the attack.

**Intensity of Area Attacks**

Type Example DM
Feeble A scattering of small artillery shells over a wide area at Standoff range or a few
automatic weapons at Battlefield range.

Weak Low-intensity artillery bombardment at Standoff range or a few support weapons
(mortars and machineguns perhaps) at Battlefield range.

Typical A typical artillery attack at Standoff range or a well-supported unit laying down
suppressing fire at Battlefield range.

Intense Intense artillery fire or an aera swept by Rapid-Fire weapons. -
Highly
Intense

The most intense artillery strike possible, such as a time-on-target salvo from several
batteries or an area swept by VRF weapons.

If the check is passed, the individual suffers no harm,
although someone next to them might be shredded.
Failure indicates the individual has been hit. This is
resolved using the Hits and Near Misses table on page

12. It is possible to be right on the fringe of an attack or
to suffer a direct hit from an artillery shell. This process
is used for direct-fire weapons as well – someone in the
area of effect might take multiple hits. Damage is based
upon the weapon in use.

SUPPRESSING FIRE
Suppressing fire uses up a lot of ammunition but can
provide tactical advantages. Units with automatic
weapons, or a weapon with similar effects such as
airbursting grenades, can lay down suppressing fire at
Combat range. If large numbers of support weapons
are available it is possible to suppress enemy forces
over a wide area but more commonly suppressing fire
is directed at an enemy position, or somewhere an
enemy is suspected of using. It can also be used to deny

an area to the enemy by endangering anyone passing
through it. For example, a mercenary unit might lay
down suppressing fire on a window suspected of being
a sniper's position or across a corridor intersection to
prevent enemies from moving through. Anyone entering
the suppressed area, trying to move through or out of it
or doing anything except staying under cover is subject
to an Area Fire attack.

The Referee must decide whether the volume of fire
is sufficient to constitute suppressing fire and how
intense it is. At Combat ranges, a full magazine from
an assault rifle is generally sufficient to deliver Typical
suppressing fire on a personnel target for one round.
Such a target might be a machinegun nest, doorway or
similar sized area. Anyone in the target area, such as the
enemy machinegunner and loaders, or a brave enemy
trying to rush across the intersection, receives an Area
Fire attack and must check to avoid being harmed. A
machinegunner firing from a sandbagged position will
probably not be wounded since the check is Simple

(2+) but crossing an open corridor intersection whilst
someone sprays it with automatic fire requires a Difficult
(10+) check. If the attack is successful, it is necessary
to determine whether extra or halved damage is applied,
as with all area attacks.

The primary purpose of suppressing fire is not to cause
harm to the enemy but impede their actions. This might
happen due to tactical choices such as the decision
to stop firing and hunker down or to abort the planned
dash across the intersection to the armory. Commonly,
suppressing fire interferes with what the enemy is doing
rather than preventing it entirely. If this is the case, the
suppressing unit may make a Tactics (military) check.
Gun Combat or Heavy Weapons can be used instead if
this is an individual attempt. The Effect of this check
is applied as a negative DM on the actions of the target
during their next actions in a round.

MANUALLY GUIDED

WEAPONS
Most guided weapons are of a fire-and-forget type. That
is, once launched they are self-guiding and require no
further input from the user. However, some weapons are
manually guided. This may require flying the weapon
remotely using a joystick or similar control device, or
keeping a laser designator on target whilst the weapon is

in flight. Manually guided weapons can be thrown off by
causing the operator to lose control, such as by forcing
a missile controller to duck under cover or causing
a designator spot to slide off the target. This can be
achieved by making the operator flinch, moving the
target, interposing an object or obscuring it with smoke.

Normally, keeping a designated or controlled weapon
on target requires an Average (8+) check using the
operator's skill; typically the skill associated with the
weapon used but a mercenary with a rifle-mounted
designator could use Gun Combat to paint the target. If
the check is made and no adverse situation occurs, such
as a cloud of smoke obscuring the target, the weapon
will automatically hit.

It is possible to perform 'trick shots' with a designator.
For example, a concealed launcher might put four
missiles into the air at short intervals, causing them to
pop up from behind a forest or hill close to the target.
A concealed designator operator can then paint the first
target, causing all the weapons to go for it. As the first
missile strikes home, the designator is moved to the
next target. If the missiles can react quickly enough this
target will be attacked, then the next if the sequence is
followed. A cumulative DM-1 applies to this sort of quick-
targeting for every target after the first and as soon as any
shot misses the rest of the remaining salvo is lost.

AREA AND POINT

DEFENCE
Some weapons are capable of providing defence against
missiles, rockets and even artillery shells. Area defence
is typically the preserve of missile systems or powerful
laser weapons, whilst point defence weaponry is more
varied. Examples include small missiles, rapid-fire lasers
or cannon, and weapons similar to a large shotgun. As a
general rule direct-fire projectiles such as rounds from a
tank gun travel too fast to be intercepted in this manner.

An area defence system can attack any suitable target,
which also includes grav and air vehicles, within its
area of effect. A point defence system can only protect
a single target (the one it is mounted on or next to)
under most circumstances. It is possible to position
point defence weapons so that incoming attacks have
to go right over them, however this is not usually
possible on a battlefield. Some point defence weapons
can attack vehicles and personnel in addition to their
missile defence role but this makes them unavailable for
defensive fire.

Each round an area defence system can attack a number
of targets equal to its Area Defence rating. A point
defence weapon can attack a number of targets equal to
its Point Defence rating. Area defence is conducted first,
with point defences attacking any 'leakers' that come
through the first defensive layer.

Area and point defences use attack rolls like any other
weapons. Those guided by operators may use their
skill level as a DM, although engagement times are so
short with these weapons that actual aiming and firing
is almost always controlled by a dedicated electronic
system. The operator's input is limited to direction and
target selection, essentially providing tactical indications
to the automated systems.

Incoming missiles, rockets and shells are assumed
to be destroyed by any hit, though weapons that can
attack other targets have damage scores as normal. The
difficulty of hitting any given target type is given in the
Defence Targets table. Some advanced weapon systems
are capable of behaving in a manner designed to evade
area and point defence fire, such as following a low,
evasive course, using terrain for cover or intermittently
varying levels of thrust. This may impose a DM on
the ability of a defensive weapon to hit the incoming
warhead. If this capability exists for a given weapon it
will be noted in its description.

Defence Targets
Target Difficulty
Artillery Shell Formidable (14+)
Fast or Small Missile Very Difficult (12+)
Typical Missile Difficult (10+)
Personnel or Vehicles As normal combat

ATTACKING

VEHICLES
Direct-fire weapons such as conventional firearms,
unguided rocket weapons and lasers can only attack
the part of a vehicle facing them. Typically a side and
the front or rear will be available as targets, but one will
be at an oblique angle that will spread out an energy
attack or make a projectile likely to glance off. HEAP
and similar munitions need a clean, near-perpendicular
impact to properly form their plasma jet.

Attacking the surface closest to perpendicular to the
incoming weapon is done at no penalty, but if the
Travellers want to aim somewhere else the referee may
impose additional difficulties. An oblique angle will
impose an additional targeting DM-1 to -6 depending
on the awkwardness of the angle, making it generally a
better idea to aim for the best aligned surface.

Travellers might come up with a clever idea, such as
trying to hit the underside of a tank as it crests an
obstacle or aiming for a 'shell trap' where the shape
of the vehicle makes penetration more likely. If this
is plausible and well roleplayed the referee should
usually allow it. Top and bottom armor is typically
thinner on ground vehicles than the sides or front, but
weak points are a matter for referee discretion. This
might be a plot element when attacking an enemy
super-tank, or a clever tactic from a resourceful
Traveller. Shell traps and weak points are typically
rather small, but a miss by a small margin will usually
still strike the vehicle. In this case an attack that
succeeds with Effect +6 or greater will hit a weak
point at the referee's discretion. Armor can be
considered to be halved in this case, and the vehicle
gains no advantage from reactive armor. Of course,
this also applies to vehicles operated by the Travellers

- they may find their expensive grav tanks are less
invulnerable than they thought!

Some weapons are designed to attack the top or
bottom of vehicles. Mines are usually positioned
to direct a blast upwards and will strike underside
armor, whilst some guided munitions are designed
to attack the top of a vehicle rather than its front.
Artillery-delivered weaponry is also likely to hit the top
of a vehicle. In such cases, the top or bottom armor
of the vehicle is used. Unless additional armor has
been added, the top and bottom of a vehicle will have
half the protection value of the sides.

HIGH AND LOW

PENETRATION
When calculating the effects of some ammunition and
weapon types, it may be necessary to consider more
than one factor affecting how well a weapon punches
through armor. As a general rule, pointed projectiles
travelling at great speed penetrate better than those
travelling more slowly or which are blunt, even if the
projectile is heavier. Energy weapons in general do not
penetrate well as they tend to dump all their energy
into the first surface they encounter, though high-
energy weapons such as plasma guns are so powerful
that this does not really matter.

Drilling Armor
In theory, a laser or other energy weapon burning
through an obstruction or a projectile weapon
could punch holes by repeatedly striking the same
place. However, the chances of remaining on
exactly the same target point long enough to do
so amid combat are rather small, especially with
a hand-held weapon. Playable game mechanics
require a degree of abstraction, so the ability of
any weapon to get through armor is represented
by damage, AP or Lo-Pen score and Effect of the
attack roll, among other factors. If circumstances
allow what amounts to drilling through armor,
the only real question is how long it will take.

When calculating performance against armor, the
weapon designer must keep track of positive and
negative factors, which will produce a Penetration.
This is applied on the Final Penetration table to
determine if any traits or special effects are to be
added. Most weapons begin with Penetration 0.
There is no Lo-Pen 1 trait since this would mean no
modification to the armor's Protection.

Final Penetration
Penetration Effect Traits and Damage Modification
-4 Extremely Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 5
-3 Highly Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 4
-2 Very Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 3
-1 Poor vs Armor Lo-Pen 2
0 Standard Performance —
+1 Semi-Armor-Piercing AP 1 per full dice of damage
+2 Armor-Piercing AP 1 plus 1 per full dice of damage, -1 damage per 2 full dice
of damage
+3 High Armor-Piercing AP 3 plus 3 per 2 full dice of damage, -2 damage per 3 full
dice of damage.
+4 Extreme Armor-Piercing AP 5 plus 2 per full dice of damage, -1 damage per dice of
damage.

The weapon's performance against armor is
determined by a running total of positive and negative
factors, with the end result translated into traits.
Thus a gauss rifle using armor-piercing ammunition,
with a final Penetration 3, is a 'high armor piercing
weapon', which modifies its damage from 4D to
4D-3 but adds AP 9. A low-velocity shotgun with
Penetration -2 is 'very poor against armor', which
gives it the Lo-Pen 3 trait. This weapon would treat
a Protection +5 flak jacket as having Protection +15,
but just might get some damage through.

SIGNATURE
All firearms and similar weapons have a signature,
which is mostly created by the means of propulsion
or generation of energy. Chemical propellant weapons
produce a great deal of noise and often muzzle flash;
they can throw dust and loose objects around if they are
powerful enough. Lasers produce no muzzle blast but
do make some noise as they ionise atmosphere as they
pass – a laser in vacuum has no such signature. Gauss
weapons produce an audible crack in atmosphere, but
have no visual or audible signature in vacuum and cause
minimal disturbance to dust. Gauss and laser weapons
do produce significant electromagnetic emissions that
can be picked up by appropriate instruments.

The signature of a weapon is modelled using new
weapon traits and a modifier for accessories used on
the weapon. There are two types of signature, one
based on emissions such as electromagnetic spikes
when firing or heat, and one based on physical effects
that can be detected with eyes and ears. Both kinds
of signature have varying levels ranging from slight to
extreme, which impose DMs to detect the weapon and
locate its firing position.

**Signature Effects**

Level of Signature DM
Minimal -
Small -
Low -
Normal 0
High +
Very High +
Extreme +

DMs are based on the difficulty of detecting and locating
a typical weapon of the type, such as a laser carbine or
semi-automatic pistol, and are further modified by some
weapon accessories.

Physical and Emissions Signature traits are detailed on
pages 6 and 7.

DETECTING AND

LOCATING
It is often not obvious where a shot came from, either
because the shooter is concealed or the weapon is not
visible. For example, a Traveller might have a group
of people under observation when a shot is fired. The
Traveller must decide if the shot came from the crowd
or somewhere else and do so quickly enough to stop
a colleague from firing into the group by mistake – or
to present a second attack if the gunman is indeed
within the group. Alternatively Travellers might come
under fire from an unknown direction and need to take
cover. Mistaking the source of the shot might result in
hunkering down on the wrong side of a vehicle. Upon
occasion, targets do not even realise they are being
fired upon.

Detecting a gunshot typically means hearing it but also
realising what the sound was. Not all weapons sound
like firearms – lasers make some sound as they ionise
atmosphere between muzzle and target but it may not
be recognized as a weapon firing. If there is a lot of
noise, such as when travelling in a vehicle on rough
ground, the sound may not be heard at all or may be
misidentified. A rock thrown up by the vehicle's wheels
and slamming into its underside might be interpreted as
a gunshot or vice versa. In some cases a Traveller might
be unable to determine if the sound was or was not a
weapon and may be reluctant to dive into cover at every
sudden noise – or be ridiculed for it.

Just being aware that a shot was fired can be useful
but often the Travellers will need to know where it
originated. Detecting and locating a shot requires a
Routine (6+) Recon check if using normal senses or
an Easy (4+) Electronics (sensors) check if sensors
are being used. Note that only specialist sensors can
pick up a weapon's physical signature whereas almost
anything that can detect magnetic fields, heat and the
like will pick up its emissions signature. If the Traveller
succeeds, they know a shot has been fired and its
general type – conventional firearm, gauss weapon and
so forth. Success with Effect +2 or better gives the
Traveller the general location of the shooter.

Success does not mean the Traveller knows exactly
where the shooter is. If the shooter is standing in the
open surrounded by a big pall of smoke the Traveller
will probably gain an exact location but a camouflaged
sniper or someone hiding in a dark upper-floor room
may not be directly spotted. In this case the Traveller
will have a general location such as 'upper floors of that
building' or 'those trees, ground level' but will have to
make an additional Recon check to spot the shooter.
A general area could be sprayed with automatic fire
or blasted with artillery even if all the Travellers know
is that the shot came from 'somewhere in there' but
directly engaging a target requires spotting it first.

In the event the Traveller succeeds with Effect +6 or
more, they will be able to identify the weapon in use.
Not to the degree of stating with certainty 'that was
a twin-trigger Steyr-Mannlicher SSG assembled on a
Tuesday by a left-handed armorer' but in terms of 'large
calibre rifle', 'smallbore rifle', 'shotgun', 'gauss pistol'
and so forth. They will also know the shooter's precise
location, down to which window they fired from or the
equivalent, even if they cannot see the shooter directly.

The Recon check is subject to further situational DMs,
as noted on the Situational Modifiers table.

Once the general location of a shooter is known it
becomes possible to try to spot them directly. This is
necessary in order to engage with any sort of precision,
but hosepiping the general area is always an option.

CAMOUFLAGE AND

STEALTH
There may be occasions where the Travellers want to
sneak past guards or get into a firing position without
being detected – or someone else might want to do
that to them. The basic procedure for spotting someone
or avoiding detection is to use an opposed Stealth
versus Recon check. This is modified by aids such as
camouflage and sensors.

Some sensors make it effectively impossible to hide
from attentive observers. A well-camouflaged soldier
might be difficult to spot in the foliage but will stand
out on thermal imaging to a level where nobody looking
at the readout could fail to spot them. Yet it is still
possible to be stealthy with the right equipment or
techniques. One option is to distract the observers or
make them doubt the sensor or even to turn it off. This
might be achieved by triggering so many false alerts that
they lose faith in their system.

Alternatively, thermal camouflage can be used. Some
advanced camouflage uses shielded heat sinks that
allow the user to be effectively invisible to thermal
sensors for a time but which will eventually be
overloaded and begin to leak so much heat they cannot
be missed. Less technological solutions either conceal
the user's heat signature to some extent or radiate it
in a shape that does not resemble a person. Observers
will still see a thermal image but may assume it is
something harmless rather than a person with a weapon.

The battle between sensors and camouflage systems is
modelled by modifiers applied to the opposed Stealth
versus Recon check, with the Referee's common sense
overruling bizarre situations. As a general rule of
thumb, if someone trying to be stealthy has no counter
to a sensor then unless the operators are extremely lax
they will automatically be spotted. The Referee might
grant an outside chance nobody was watching the
readout or the auto-alarm somehow glitched but this
is extremely unlikely unless the operators have been
distracted in some manner.

Camouflage and sensors are both rated in terms of
the DM they grant to a Stealth or Recon check. This
all supposes the individual is moving slowly and not
drawing attention. Once they open fire, observers will
have a chance to spot the weapon discharge, although
they will still have to win the Stealth versus Recon
check to get eyes on the target rather than their
general location. Once the shooter ceases fire and
changes position, the Stealth versus Recon opposed
check applies once more.

QUICKDRAW
Most combat is governed by the initiative rules.
However, there are moments where all that matters is
whether a Traveller or their enemy gets their weapon
on line first. In such situations the wider picture does
not matter; the contest is between two individuals
or sometimes members of two small groups. This is
termed a 'quickdraw' whether or not a weapon has to
be drawn.

To resolve this, each participant rolls 2D and adds their
DEX modifier and level of Gun Combat. The relative
handiness of the weapon is the other critical factor.
The Weapon Effects on Quickdraw table indicates
typical Quickdraw scores of various weapon types,
although this can vary depending on barrel length and
accessories. The precise Quickdraw score of a weapon
is determined in the design process.

If a weapon has to be drawn or unslung, DM-2 applies.
If it has to be readied, for example by chambering a
round, an additional DM-2 applies. A weapon already
pointed in the general direction of the target gains
DM+4, whilst one that is precisely laid on target – such
as a sniper holding ready to shoot at any instant –
gains DM+8.

The Weapon Effects on Quickdraw table gives a
quick-and-dirty guide to the Quickdraw scores of
different weapons. Specific values are calculated
when designing a weapon but these can be used if the
referee is in a hurry.

Weapon Effects on Quickdraw
Weapon Type Quickdraw
Handgun +8
Submachinegun +4
Short Shotgun +2
Lightweight Assault Rifle +0
Battle Rifle -2
Light Machinegun -4
Anti-Materiel Rifle -8

The Traveller with the highest Quickdraw score shoots
first. It is not usually possible to aim under these
conditions; snapshots and bursts of automatic fire are
the only viable options. In the case where the weapon is
already on target, such as a sniper waiting for clearance
to shoot, the shot is assumed to be aimed with DM+2.
It is not permissible to claim huge aiming bonuses for
holding a weapon on target for a long period. If the target
is hit but not downed, they suffer a negative DM to their
own attempt to attack. This DM is -2, with an additional
-1 for every full three points of damage suffered.

For example, a Traveller acting as point for a patrol turns
a corner and finds herself facing a hostile militiaman
going the other way. The Traveller has a short stockless
shotgun ready for just such a close encounter, but rolls a
disastrous 2 on 2D. Even with her DEX modifier and Gun
Combat skill she has a total of Quickdraw 5, increased
to 9 because her weapon is ideal for such situations.
The gunman is armed with a submachinegun, but it is
slung. He rolls a rather better 6, modified to 8 by his
DEX and Gun Combat skill. The submachinegun grants
DM+2, raising the total to Quickdraw 10, which would
normally be sufficient to outdraw the Traveller. However,
the gunman has to unsling his weapon (DM-2) and
chamber a round (DM-2) before firing. He is on a total
of Quickdraw 6 and is still readying his weapon when
he is hit. His body armor stops some of the blast but
he takes 10 damage. The gunman then looses a burst,
but suffers DM-5 (-2 for being hit, -3 more for three full
sets of 3 points of damage). Hopefully this is enough to
throw off his aim.

KNOCKDOWN
In general it is more desirable to 'stop' the target than
ensure a kill. A shot that delivers a mortal wound, but
leaves the victim able to act for a few seconds, may have
worse overall results than a non-fatal shot that knocks
the target down and stops them acting. In theory any
shot can achieve a 'knockdown' – a situation in which
the target is immediately stopped in what they are doing
and quite possibly sent to the ground. If a knockdown is
achieved, the target cannot act for the rest of that round
and all of the next.

To have any chance of achieving a knockdown on a
typical bipedal creature it is necessary to deliver more
damage than the maximum END value for a member of
that species – 15 for humans and similar creatures –
with a kinetic-energy or high-energy weapon; lasers and
flame weapons cannot achieve a knockdown. It does not
matter whether this damage gets through armor or not;
all that matters is that enough energy is delivered to
knock the target down or disorient them.

If damage exceeds species maximum, a knockdown
occurs unless the victim resists it. Note that
'knockdown' is a general term for 'hit hard and
temporarily unable to act'. Many times this will involve
being knocked down or against something, or falling, but
the exact effects depend on the circumstances. To avoid
a knockdown, the target must make a Simple (2+) STR
check, with negative DM equal to the amount of damage
over their species maximum. Weapons that deliver a
lot of force tend to do so by being poor penetrators – a
weapon's Lo-Pen value is applied as a negative DM
to the STR check. Conversely, weapons using armor-
piercing ammunition tend not to dump their energy into
the target as they often overpenetrate. A weapon's AP
rating is used as a positive DM to the STR check.

For example, a human Traveller is hit by a pellet-firing
shotgun. Their flak jacket is treated as Protection
+15 against this weapon, which has the Lo-Pen 3
trait. Damage rolled is 16 points, of which only 1 gets

through the armor. However, the impact is sufficient
to potentially cause a knockdown. To avoid this the
Traveller must make a Routine (6+) STR check. Their
STR DM is +1, but they suffer DM-1 for the one
point of damage over their knockdown threshold and
DM-3 for the shotgun's Lo-Pen rating. The Traveller
rolls 8 on the dice, with a total DM-3. The Effect
of the check is -1, which is insufficient to avoid a
knockdown. A rifle bullet doing the same amount of
damage would have penetrated the armor and done
more actual harm to the Traveller, but probably not
applied a knockdown.

BREAKING

WEAPONS
It is quite difficult to completely destroy a typical
firearm, but putting one out of action is not so hard.
For example, it is not uncommon for snipers to shoot
the breach block of machineguns or other support
weapons. An intact weapon can be taken over by
another soldier, whereas one that needs workshop
time is out of action for much longer. It would still be
substantially intact, however.

A weapon struck by a projectile, energy burst or some
other means of dealing damage will suffer a Mishap
if the damage inflicted exceeds its Mishap Threshold.
Once the effects of the Mishap are determined there is
no further effect. A weapon will be put out of action if
it receives three times its Mishap Threshold in a single
strike, and will require major repair. Ten times the
Mishap Threshold should be enough to reduce a weapon
to what is left of its components.

Mishap Thresholds are based on weapon type, and
do not vary all that much between similar items. For
example, damaging a handgun is about as difficult
as damaging a rifle of the same construction. The
materials used in the weapon's manufacture are
significant in determining its Mishap Threshold, along
with its general type.

Mishap Threshold
Weapon Type Mishap Threshold
Flamethrowers and similar weapons containing hazardous substances Tech Level/2
Lasers and similarly complex weapons that require precise alignment Tech Level
Gauss, plasma, fusion and similar complex but robust weapons Tech Level +4
Conventional firearms and similar strongly built mechanical devices Tech Level +8
Hand weapons and similar strongly built items with few or no moving parts Tech Level +12

The Mishap Threshold has nothing to do with how
dangerous a weapon would be if a Mishap occurred – that
is dealt with using the Hazardous trait on page 6. It is
possible to make a weapon safer or even to armor it
against damage. There is generally no need to track the
Mishap Threshold of a weapon – attacks against them
are uncommon. However, if the Travellers insist on using
ramshackle home-made flamethrowers it may be worth
keeping a note of the value required to cause a Mishap.
Someone will take a shot sooner or later.

Weapons can be deliberately targeted but are difficult
to hit even if the user is standing still. Targeting a part
of a typical weapon that will potentially put it out of
action imposes DM-6 on an attack roll. This is the case
even if the weapon is quite large – a heavy machinegun
may be a big object but most of it is composed of items
that will not cause it to malfunction if hit. If the critical
component is relatively large, such as the tanks of a flame
weapon, the penalty is reduced to DM-4 and may be
further modified at the referee's discretion.

DISTRACTIONS
Some weapons are intended to distract or debilitate
opponents, instead of or in addition to harming them.
Examples include concussion or flash grenades and
munitions intended to throw out a series of bright sparks
to interfere with night vision equipment. Anyone exposed
to such a distraction must make an END check or be
unable to take their next set of actions. This might be
due to flinching from blinding light or simply turning
to see what the sudden noise was. The difficulty of this
check is determined by the distraction device, which in
turn depends largely upon its size and power. Note that
these are 'distraction' rather than 'stun' weapons. Those
intended to put someone out of action for more than a
combat round are considered elsewhere.

**Distraction Devices**

Type Example Difficulty
Small Pistol or Rifle-Fired Distraction Round Easy (4+)
Minor Shotgun-Fired Distraction Round Routine (6+)
Typical Flashbang Grenade Average (8+)
Potent Enhanced Distraction Grenade Difficult (10+)
Overwhelming Extreme Noise, Flashing Lights; not typically attainable from a grenade or
smaller device

Very Difficult (12+)

Victims can gain positive DMs to resist the effects of a
distraction weapon. Sufficient warning to cover eyes or
look away grants DM+2 against light-based weapons.
Ear protection does the same for concussion or noise
distractions. Some helmet and vision systems have
automatic protection built in, granting these DMs or
possibly higher ones without the user needing to take
any action.

GAS AND CHEMICAL

WEAPONS
Gas weapons are typically delivered from grenades but
small arms ammunition can be converted to deliver a
low quantity of gas. The concentration of gas, along
with its composition, determines how likely targets are
to be affected. All gas weapons are rated according to
their capability to fill a 3x3x3m volume. Each additional
volume this size that the gas must expand into reduces
the potency of the weapon by one level. The final
potency of the gas attack determines the difficulty of an
END check to resist it. Those with respiratory protection
may be entirely immune or gain a positive DM to resist
the attack.

A single handgun or rifle round will typically deliver
a Feeble potency attack. A shotgun cartridge or
similar large smallarm projectile typically delivers
a Weak attack, and a mini-grenade delivers a Low
potency attack. Grenades, rifle grenades and small
warheads produce an Average potency attack. These
base potencies can be increased by the use of more
advanced or concentrated gases. The effects of gases
are described on page 55.

Chemical weapons that rely on skin contact are treated
the same way.

Gas Weapon Potency
Potency Difficulty
Feeble Simple (2+)
Weak Easy (4+)
Low Routine (6+)
Standard Average (8+)
High Difficult (10+)
Potent Very Difficult (12+)
Overwhelming Formidable (14+)

INCENDIARY AND

FLAME WEAPONS
Incendiary and flame weapons are designed to set
fire to a target and/or inflict damage over a prolonged
period. All incendiary and flame weapons have the
Incendiary trait (see page 7), which indicates their
propensity to set objects on fire. Most military flame
weapons rely on coating the target with a sticky,
flammable liquid which is then ignited, whereas
incendiaries are more commonly a solid material which
burns inside the target after penetration. The effects
are similar in most cases, but flame weapons do not
have a Penetration associated with them – they always
coat the outside of a target and defeat armor by heat
conduction rather than physical penetration.

In both cases, the initial damage done by the weapon
may be followed by more. An incendiary or flame weapon
that has the Burn trait does half damage for a number of
rounds equal to its Burn score. Armor protects against
this damage each round. If the target is hit by another
flame or incendiary weapon during this time, only the
highest damage is applied.

CORROSIVE

WEAPONS
Corrosive weapons are rare but may be encountered
either as improvised equipment or in use with unusual
societies. Improvised corrosive weapons usually take the
form of chemical sprayers or fragile containers filled with
corrosive substances. Occasionally projectile weapons
firing either a soft round intended to flatten and stick
to the target, or a hollow projectile intended to deliver
the corrosive agent into the target, are encountered.
The most common of these are breaching devices which
stick a wad of corrosive material onto the target in the
hope it will eat through or at least weaken the structure.

Corrosive weapons have a damage rating like any
other, but deliver their damage in a different way.
Each round, corrosive damage drops by 1D until it
reaches zero. Any modifiers to damage expire with the
last 1D.

Armor protects as normal. However, a corrosive
weapon will destroy armor it is in contact with, at
the rate of 1 point of armor per dice of damage.

For example, a Traveller wearing a Protection +5 flak
jacket is hit by a corrosive weapon doing 2D damage.
Damage rolled is 8 points, so the Traveller takes
3 points of damage through armor. His armor is
degraded by 2 points that round because it was in
contact with a 2D corrosive weapon. The following
round the corrosive damage drops to 1D. Damage
rolled is 4 points, and since the Traveller's armor is
down to Protection +3, 1 point gets through. The flak
jacket is degraded an additional point. The Traveller
takes no damage the following round, but the flak
jacket is now Protection +2.

Some armor is treated to be corrosion-resistant. This
is indicated by the Corrosion-Resistant (+X) trait. The
value counteracts the reduction of Protection by the
corrosive attack. If the Traveller in the above example
was wearing a Corrosion-Resistant (+1) flak jacket the
armor would have been degraded by only 1 point in
the first round and not at all after that.

MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
ELECTRONICS

SYSTEMS
In general, military electronics tend to be based on
civilian systems and are often behind the technology
curve, except where a project has been undertaken
to produce a specialist capability. Reliability is
prized above capability in most functions. The
actual components, programs and systems in use
are often exactly the same as civilian electronics,
allowing repairs and replacements to be made with
commercially available components. However, military
systems tend to have extra capabilities, often provided
by additional components rather than integrating
everything by designing whole new circuit boards.
Thus the interior of a military computer often contains
familiar civilian components or boards with specialist
military components squeezed in wherever they will
fit. This is particularly the case in items intended for
the cheaper end of the mercenary market.

Military electronic systems are more robust than their
civilian counterparts, though usually this is achieved
simply by mounting them in tougher cases. They also
have the capability to interface with other military
systems, which civilian equivalents lack. At its simplest,
this is a matter of having the right ports and a small
additional drive containing the protocols required to talk
to other milspec electronics. In cheaper machines the
actual internal workings of the system are identical to
civilian systems, with the interface unit acting as a filter.
If it can be bypassed, a civilian system could interface
directly. Dedicated military computers 'think in military'
and are not compatible with civilian models even if
security is bypassed. This eliminates most possibilities
of hacking by a passing kid with an illegal haxxorx app
downloaded to their comm.

Typically the computer systems of major powers are
unique and require the right interface protocols. Many of
these are available as packages on the mercenary market

- legally and otherwise. Some powers want properly
accredited mercenaries to be able to interface with their
equipment. Others insist that all electronic transfers
go through a single secure access point. Equipment
produced for the mercenary marketplace is always
compatible with what might be called the commercial-
military end of the market. A unit that buys equipment
will configure it to fit with its own secure electronic
environment using built-in protocols. These are less
of a barrier to hacking than a dedicated computer and
electronics system, but far cheaper.

It is still possible to hack a mercenary unit's electronics
using civilian computer systems but an interface must
be established. The typical Traveller's personal comm
simply cannot talk to a military system, except by way of
a firewalled 'outside unsecured comms' protocol which
does not allow access to the operating system. Interface
devices are supposedly controlled and restricted to
sale to accredited mercenary unit, but there are always
examples on the black market.

As a general rule, electronic equipment for use by
mercenaries is designed to be interoperable with
other items on the market, creating a 'plug and fight'
capability which still excludes non-military systems.
Any attempt to hack a military electronic system using
civilian systems is subject to DM-2 even if an interface
is available, and will probably be impossible if not.
Similarly, attempts to hack a dedicated military system
from a mercenary-market system suffers DM-2, and
civilian equipment increases this to DM-4. Additional
security measures may increase the difficulty further.

Electromagnetic Field and Pulse Effects
Electronic systems can be badly affected by a rapidly
changing electromagnetic field, especially when this
takes the form of a high-intensity pulse produced by a
weapon. Naturally occurring pulses are usually caused
by solar activity, and electromagnetic leakage from
poorly constructed machinery can have similar effects.
Pulses can also be produced by nuclear explosions and
certain weapons.

The basic principle behind producing an
electromagnetic pulse is simple, meaning it can be
accomplished by any society capable of generating
electricity. Making a device small enough to use as
a grenade or similar weapon requires more advanced
technology; electromagnetic pulse (EMP) grenades
become possible at TL9, though crude generators can
be built earlier. A weaponised EMP generator such as
a grenade produces a pulse with an intensity equal
to its Tech Level. A pulse will destroy all unshielded
electronics of more than two Tech Levels below its
intensity level, and will cause all unshielded systems
within two Tech Levels of its intensity to shut down for
1D minutes.

It is possible to shield electronic devices from the
effects of a pulse, though this is rare in the case of
civilian electronics other than scientific or specialist
equipment. Advanced civilian equipment is generally
more resilient, so whilst not shielded as such a TL12
civilian system would not be shut down by a TL9 EMP
grenade. It might still be disrupted, however.

Shielded systems, which includes all military electronic
systems, civilian systems noted as being hardened
against EMP effects and civilian systems more than 2
Tech Levels higher than the intensity of the pulse, may
or may not be disrupted. Roll 2D on the EMP Disruption
table, with DM+1 for every TL above the intensity of the
pulse, and an additional DM+2 if the system is designed
for military use.

Electromagnetic fields can impose similar effects,
such as when Travellers try to use communications
equipment during a solar flare, or when unshielded
electronic devices are used near a badly shielded piece
of machinery. Typically a field will have an intensity
ranging from 1 to 6, but spikes and flares are possible
with a much higher intensity.

EMP Disruption
2D+DMs Result
2-4 System shuts down for 1D minutes and must reboot
5-7 Severe disruption/whiteout imposes DM-6 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
8-10 Disruption imposes DM-4 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
11-13 Disruption imposes DM-2 on all tasks using the system for 1D minutes
14+ No Effect

DEMOLITIONS
Much of the time in a mercenary campaign, destruction
of an object is a plot point rather than something the
Travellers need to be directly concerned with. It is often
quite acceptable to assume a commando unit is carrying
suitable explosives to deal with a target, and build a
storyline about getting them into place and preventing
the enemy from disarming the charges. Sometimes
it is necessary to determine whether a wall has been
breached, a statue destroyed, or whatever else the
Travellers are trying to achieve – or trying to stop.

Damage can be inflicted by impact, explosions, corrosive
substances or other means. If a target is thoroughly
doused in cryogenic fluids then struck - even quite
lightly – it may shatter. Cryogenic demolition is very
destructive, inflicting twice the damage delivered by the
cryogenic weapon once the 'tap' is applied. If the target
is simply doused in cryogenic fluid and left alone, it
suffers normal damage.

The amounts of damage noted below are sufficient to
put a fist-sized hole in an object. Ten times as much
damage will shatter the object, and 25 times as much
will obliterate it. If vaporization is required and a suitable
weapon is to hand, 50 times the Structure noted in the
Demolition of Objects table will achieve this.

The weaponry found in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_
and _Central Supply Catalogue_ represents a generic
version of their type. This is entirely adequate for
most users, but there may be times where a few more
rounds in the magazine or a slight range advantage
could mean the difference between mission success
and medical repatriation.

The following design system creates game-mechanics
data for weapons, including damage, effective range
and the like. Fine details like safety devices or specific
features are a matter for referee discretion. Note that
the price for weapons created under this system is a
suggestion only. There is no reason why a manufacturer
might not price their weapons above or below the
suggested cost, but this is an in-universe detail to be
determined by the referee.

Most weapons are designed around the ammunition
they use or their method of causing injury, and it is
this that defines the basic characteristics of a weapon.
In addition to their ammunition type, weapons are
considered to consist of three main components:
the receiver, the barrel and furniture. Additional
components can be considered to be accessories,
as usually a weapon will function without them.
Ammunition type determines base damage and range
for the weapon.

**The receiver** contains the main working components
of the weapon such as feed and ejection mechanism,
firing chamber and so forth. It also incorporates some
kind of grip for the firing hand or the equivalent for
creatures without hands as such. The cost and weight of
the receiver is used as a baseline for other components,
whose characteristics are given as a percentage of the
receiver's cost or weight. The type of receiver used also
determines the weapon's base Quickdraw score.

**The barrel** determines many characteristics of a weapon
such as its effective range, and may modify damage. In
general a long barrel gives a higher muzzle velocity from
the same projectile or a tighter beam from the same
energy weapon, resulting in greater effective range and
damage. Barrel length modifies Quickdraw.

**The furniture** on a weapon is its stock, foregrip and
the like. Adding a stock improves aimed fire and
controllability, but also increases weight. Some
modifications affect Quickdraw.

**PERSONAL WEAPON DESIGN**

CHAPTER-FOUR

Accessories include scopes, laser pointers, bipods
and the like. Weapons will generally function without
them. The exception is a feed device such as a
magazine or belt, since obviously projectile weapons
need ammunition.

Feed devices can vary considerably from one weapon to
another. Some are implicit in a weapon's design, such
as a revolver's cylinder or the chamber of a single shot
breachloader. If a detachable feed device is used, its
capacity is normally determined by the base value for
the weapon type. The capacity of a feed device is a
matter for referee discretion; it can be set at any value
from 50%-150% of the weapon's base capacity. Thus
when deciding on the capacity of a standard semi-
automatic pistol the referee may set it anywhere from
5 to 15 rounds since the base capacity of a standard
handgun is 10 rounds.

Weapon Design Process
When designing a weapon, the following steps are taken in order. Sometimes it may be necessary to
return to an earlier step if the results are not satisfactory but this is generally straightforward unless the
ammunition type is to be changed.

1. Decide the weapon's general type (rifle, pistol and so forth).
2. Choose an ammunition type or power source.
3. Choose a receiver and mode of operation (breachloader, semi-automatic and so forth).
4. Assign barrel length.
5. Assign furniture.
6. Choose a feed device.
7. Add any accessories that come as standard.
8. Total the cost and weight for the weapon.

Note that when the weight or cost of a component is calculated this is usually based on the weight or cost
of the receiver once it has been modified by any receiver features. This baseline value determines what
every further modification or accessory will add to the weapon.

The referee may choose to apply modifications to cost and weight based on cosmetic factors, manufacturer
prestige or similar in-game details which do not affect the overall performance of the weapon. Weights and
prices can be rounded off to suitably 'tidy' values. Small changes such as adding or removing a point or
two of damage can be added by the referee to create more variation in weaponry available.

THE ADVANCED

WEAPON DESIGN

WORKSHEET
When designing a new weapon it is useful to fill out
a worksheet, keeping track of modifications as they
are added. This is not necessary with simple weapons
but where there are multiple variations or different
ammunition types in use it is easy to lose track. Most
component costs and weights are based on the cost and
weight of the receiver once it has been configured to
the user's desires. A blank worksheet at the back of this
book can be photocopied, or downloaded for free from
our web site.

This weapon is simple, with few modifications to its
base costs. Cost and weight will likely be rounded up
when the design is finalised, whilst other features will be
determined from the values noted here. This feeds into
extended weapon characteristics with the data required
for play.

**Tweaks, Rounding and**

Special Features
Calculated values should be used on the
worksheet, and exact figures retained so that
alterations or modifications are easy to calculate.
Rounded values should be used in the weapon's
stat block. With the referee's approval values can
be rounded off to the nearest Cr10, 0.1kg or a
similar level of detail.

A weapon can be given a special feature at the
referee's discretion. A point or two of damage,

capacity are all permissible for referee-developed
weapons. The Travellers should not be allowed to
tweak their own designs in this manner without
the referee's oversight.

CONVENTIONAL

FIREARMS
Conventional firearms use a projectile made from
some heavy material, driven by the force generated by
expanding gas. This in turn comes from a propellant
which may be initiated either by mechanical or electric
means. Mechanical initiation is far more common and
requires no power. Typically a primer is inserted in the
cartridge, containing material that will explode when
struck hard, providing enough energy to initiate the
propellant. The result is noisy and produces muzzle
flash, and may stir up dust around a shooter. Thus
mechanically initiated conventional firearms possess the
Physical Signature trait. If not specified this is at the
(normal) level.

Electric initiation requires a more complex weapon
with a power source. It does not eliminate noise and
flash, and the power source gives the weapon the
Emissions Signature trait. This is normally (minimal)
as the spark is brief and contained within a metal
weapon. Electrically initiated weapons are favored by
some users as they have less moving parts – this can
be important in a very dirty environment – and can
achieve a higher rate of fire than weapons which rely on
mechanical action.

Cartridge cases are normally made from metal or
plastic, and almost always ejected from the weapon as
part of the loading-firing cycle. Caseless ammunition
is available for weapons designed to use it. It has
the advantage that the cartridge is entirely formed of
propellant so can be lighter and does not need to be
ejected from the weapon. This means less moving parts
which is usually a good thing, but caseless ammunition
is expensive to produce. It typically costs three times
as much as conventional ammunition, and can only be
used in weapons designed for it – which are also more
expensive to produce.

Some very ecologically friendly governments insist on
'green' ammunition which uses non-toxic, biodegradable
propellants and cartridge case materials. This is an
example of what might be called 'novelty' ammunition.
Costs start at twice the price of conventional
ammunition and can be much higher depending on the
stipulations of the user.

RECEIVER

CONFIGURATIONS
The configuration of a weapon is relevant to how 'handy'
it is at close quarters, how bulky, and how accurate it is
at range.

Test Range and Effective Range
The ranges for ammunition types given here are
based on the round's performance through a
test barrel equivalent to a rifle-length weapon.
This is the range to which the ammunition will
remain reasonably accurate. It will travel further,
of course, but loses velocity and consequently
performance in terms of both accuracy and
hitting power.

The barrel length selected for a weapon modifies
its muzzle velocity and therefore its effective
range. A very short barrel, for example, does
not allow the round to reach full velocity and
also reduces accuracy, all of which adds up to a
shorter effective range. It is possible to fire rifle-
calibre rounds from a handgun, but performance
will be nowhere near as good as when fired from
a proper rifle.

There are three common types of receiver for personal
projectile weapons: handgun, assault weapon and
longarm. Heavier weapons can use a light support or
support weapon receiver.

Handguns: Handguns are designed to be held in
one hand, though the weak hand is generally used
to steady the weapon in a two-handed grip. True
handguns include semi-automatic pistols and
revolvers, but some other weapons can be considered
handguns. These include weapons resembling sawed-
off shotguns and very small submachineguns that can
be fired with one hand if necessary.

Handguns can be used in close combat with no
penalty, whereas other firearms cannot. There is
no penalty for firing a handgun with one hand, but
to conduct aimed fire it is generally necessary to
use both hands or brace the weapon in some other
manner, such as resting it on a wall. Even when
aiming, handguns have a short effective range due
to air resistance causing rapid loss of velocity, short
barrels and the difficulty of precisely aiming such a
short weapon.

Handguns can be chambered for any projectile
ammunition, though pistol or snub weapon calibres
are most common. A handgun receiver has a base
Quickdraw 4.

**Assault Weapons:** The term 'assault weapon' in this
context refers to weapons designs for use at short range,
such as in urban combat or inside a space vessel.
Most assault weapons are chambered for pistol or snub
weapon cartridges, but assault weapons chambered for
more exotic ammunition types do exist. Assault weapons
normally require both hands to use effectively, but can
be fired one-handed with DM-2 on attack rolls.

Assault weapons are almost always constructed for burst
or full-automatic fire, at no additional cost. 'Civilian'
versions, capable of semi-automatic fire only, are typically
available at the same cost. It is generally possible to
convert these back to full-automatic with a few simple
adjustments, though it is illegal to do so in many locales.
An assault weapon has a base Quickdraw 2.

**Longarms:** Longarms are designed to be held in both
hands, and include rifles, light machineguns and
combat shotguns. Longarms can be fired with one hand
but are subject to DM-4 on attack rolls. A longarm can
usually be used as a decent club, doing 2D damage,
and military versions often have a bayonet mounting. A
longarm has a base Quickdraw 0.

**Light Support Weapons:** Light support weapons include
general-purpose machineguns, anti-materiel rifles and
most plasma and fusion weapons, as well as shoulder-
fired anti-aircraft and anti-armor missile launchers.
Light support weapons are heavier than longarms and
cannot usually be fired one-handed unless on a suitable
mount or gravitic support device. Light Support Weapons
have a base Quickdraw -4.

**Heavy Weapons:** Heavy weapons normally require a
mount or emplacement to use, and include heavy
machineguns, light autocannon, heavy missile
launchers, battlefield mortars, large plasma weapons
and the like. Most heavy weapons are carried by a team
of soldiers or mounted on a vehicle, but some can be
mounted on battle dress. Heavy Weapons have a base
Quickdraw -8 if mounted on battle dress or traversed on
their mounting to engage a new target. Base weight and
cost vary considerably.

MECHANISMS
The mechanism used in a weapon will normally define
most of its characteristics. The physical mechanics can
vary considerably, but the overall characteristics can be
summed up by the following nomenclature.

Single Shot: A single shot weapon can fire only once
before needing to be reloaded. Examples include black
powder muskets or breach-loading shotguns and rifles.
A double or multi-barrel firearm is still a single shot
weapon, but obviously each barrel can fire its one shot
before having to be reloaded. Single shot mechanisms
reduce the receiver cost by 75%.

Repeater: Repeater weapons carry multiple rounds of
ammunition but require either direct action from the
user (such as with a pump-action shotgun or bolt-action
rifle) or are cocked and then fired by the user's actions
(such as a double-action revolver). This makes them
relatively slow-firing. A repeater mechanism reduces
receiver cost by 50%. A weapon with a repeater action
reduces base ammunition capacity by 50%.

Semi-Automatic: Semi-automatic weapons reload
automatically using the energy generated in firing.
Examples include semi-automatic pistols (often known
as autopistols) and rifles, plus many automatic weapons
when set to semi-automatic operation. If no mechanism
is specified a weapon is assumed to be semi-automatic.

Burst-Capable: A burst-capable weapon has a device
fitted that fires a set number of rounds per pull of
the trigger. Most fully-automatic weapons can also
be used in burst fire mode. A burst-capable weapon
has an Auto rating but cannot use full-automatic fire.
It can only deliver burst fire as per the Traveller Core
Rulebook , or be set to semi-automatic operation. Burst
fire capability does not add significantly to the weight
of the weapon but increases cost by 10%. It gives the
weapon Auto 2. It can only make attacks in single or
burst mode however.

Fully-Automatic: A fully-automatic weapon can normally
be set for semi-automatic fire, and many can also
conduct burst fire. When in full-auto mode, the weapon
will cycle as long as the trigger is held, burning through
all available ammunition. Fully-automatic capability
does not add significantly to the weight of the weapon
but increases cost by 20%. It gives the weapon Auto 3.
A fully-automatic weapon can make attacks in single,
burst or full-auto modes.

Rapid-Fire: A Rapid-fire (RF) weapon is designed to
deliver a very large amount of ammunition in a short
space of time. This can be wasteful but is highly
destructive. Rapid-fire capability is denoted by the RF
code after the weapon's Auto score. A rapid-fire weapon
must have a high Auto score (at least 4) and also
delivers such intense firepower that damage is increased
relative to a 'mere' automatic weapon of the same
calibre. RF weapons do an extra dice of damage per
three full dice an automatic weapon of the same calibre
would deliver. RF capability can be created by using a
multiple mount, or simply a weapon with an extremely
high rate of fire. Rapid-fire capability multiplies base
cost by the weapon's Auto score +2. Thus a rapid-fire
weapon with Auto 4 increases base cost by 4+2 = 6.
Rapid-fire capability adds the Bulky trait and multiplies
base weight of the receiver by 2. An RF (or VRF) weapon
has an AP score equal to the base number of damage
dice, calculated before additional rapid-fire damage
is added. RF capability has implications for area and
suppressive fire (see page 15).

A weapon can be converted to RF in various ways. A
twin mount carrying identical weapons with Auto 4+
can be considered an RF weapon, doing damage based
on a single example of the type modified by its RF
capability. Alternatively, a weapon can be converted to
RF by increasing its Auto score to at least 4 and using
powered or forced feed and initiation, such as that
used in a chain gun. A powered feed system triples the
cost and weight of the weapon's receiver, and is only
feasible on longarms, light support weapons or support
weapons. An RF weapon generates Heat at a rate equal
to its Auto score plus twice its damage dice, so an Auto
4 weapon delivering 3D damage generates 4+6 = 10
Heat per round.

Very Rapid-Fire: Very Rapid-Fire (VRF) weapons are
designed to deliver extremely intense firepower. A VRF
weapon must have Auto 6+, and in addition delivers an
extra dice of damage per two full base dice indicated by
ammunition type. For example, a 5.56mm machinegun
has Auto 3 and does 3D damage. A VRF version of the
same weapon has Auto 6 and does 4D damage. VRF
capability has implications for area and suppressive fire
(see page 13). A VRF weapon generates Heat at a rate
equal to its Auto score plus three times its damage dice,

so an Auto 6 weapon delivering 4D damage generates
6+12 = 18 Heat per round. (see page 13). A VRF weapon
generates Heat at a rate equal to its Auto score plus three
times its damage dice, so an Auto 6 weapon delivering
4D damage generates 6+12 = 18 Heat per round.

VRF capability is usually achieved by using multiple
barrels in a rotary or grouped configuration, such as a
minigun. A twin-mounted RF weapon can be considered
a VRF weapon of the same type. Alternatively, a weapon
can be converted to VRF fire by increasing its Auto score
to at least 6 and using a VRF feed system. The latter
adds the Very Bulky trait and multiplies base weight and
cost of the receiver by 5.

Underwater: Some firearms and specialist weapons
are adapted for use underwater. Range is given under
normal conditions; instead of reducing their range to
1/10 as with most conventional weapons, range for
an underwater-adapted weapon is reduced to 1/5.
Underwater-adapted weapons require specialist am-
munition. This configuration multiplies the base cost of
the receiver by 2.

RECOIL
All conventional firearms produce recoil. Gauss
weapons do too, but to a much smaller extent as their
projectiles are smaller and lighter. Controlling a weapon,
particularly one using automatic fire, can be a problem
for those without proper training. The mass of a weapon
helps absorb recoil, so creating an extremely powerful
handgun or one capable of automatic fire can make
it uncontrollable. A weapon's Recoil score is equal to
its base number of damage dice plus its Auto score if
it is being used for fully-automatic or burst fire. The
following modifiers are applied to this score:

Near-zero recoil weapon such as accelerator rifle: -4
Low-velocity weapon such as snub pistol: -2
Gauss weapon: -1
Handgun: -2
Assault Weapon: -4
Longarm: -6
Light Support Weapon: -8

A user can fully control any weapon whose Recoil is
equal to or lower than their Gun Combat skill. If the
Recoil of the weapon is higher than the user's skill level,
a negative DM is imposed equal to the difference. Thus
a Traveller with Gun Combat 1 shooting a standard
handgun doing 3D damage will have no problems
handling the weapon's Recoil 3 (from its 3D of damage),
-2 for the mass of the handgun. The weapon's Recoil 1
is equal to or less than the Traveller's Gun Combat skill.
If the Traveller converted this pistol to fully-automatic

fire with Auto 3, the weapon's Recoil would be (3+3-
2) = 4, imposing DM-3 on the Traveller's attempt to
hit anything with automatic fire. This stacks with any
penalty for a Bulky weapon – there are some people who
should not be given fully automatic shotguns!

RECEIVER FEATURES
Once the general characteristics of a weapon's receiver
are known, any special features can be added. Most
features are compatible with one another – for example
it is possible to make a weapon both Rugged and Light-
weight if you are willing to pay the price for the ad-
vanced materials. Multiple versions of the same feature
cannot be applied. For example, a weapon cannot be
both Compact and Very Compact.

**Functional Features**
Functional features improve or alter a weapon's function
without adding any new capabilities.

**Advanced Projectile Weapon:** At TL9 and higher, weapon
designers can use advanced technology to improve a
weapon's overall performance without affecting weight or
bulk – effectively wringing more out of the same weight
and volume of weapon. Advanced Projectile Weapons
cost 25% more than conventional projectile weapons
but weigh 10% less. They have a Physical Signature one
level lower, and range is 25% further.

**Accurised:** A weapon that is very carefully made to the
finest tolerances increases cost by 100% but gives
DM+1 when using aimed fire at ranges beyond 25m.
This is compatible with High Quality.

**Bullpup:** A Bullpup weapon has the ammunition feed
mechanism and breach behind the trigger mechanism
rather than in the usual position in front of the primary
handgrip. This allows a weapon to be shorter without
reducing barrel length, and transfers weight rearwards
which assists when it has to be brought quickly into ac-
tion. Bullpup configuration increases cost by 25% and
increases Quickdraw by +2. However, the location of the
ejection port, if the weapon has one, means that it must
be set up for a right- or left-handed shooter and cannot
be used in the wrong hand without flinging hot cartridge
cases at the user's head. A Bullpup weapon must have a
full stock, as the feed mechanism is contained within it.

**Compact:** A Compact receiver adds 25% to the cost of
the weapon and reduces mass by 10%. Base ammuni-
tion capacity is reduced by 25%.

Cooling System, Basic: Most weapons are air-cooled; that
is, they dissipate heat into the atmosphere or by radiat-
ing it if there is no air around them. A Basic Cooling
System takes heat away from the weapon by transferring
it to another medium. At lower Tech Levels this is typi-
cally a water jacket and is very bulky and clumsy. A Ba-
sic Cooling System increases weight by 100% and cost
by 10%. It removes 2 points of Heat from the weapon
each round whether it is fired or not. If water is used, it
can absorb 25 points of Heat per kg before boiling off.

Cooling System, Advanced: An Advanced Cooling System
replaces the traditional water jacket with a much smaller
web of pipes containing liquid with a high heat capac-
ity. This removes 5 points of Heat from the weapon
per round whether it is fired or not. The heat has to go
somewhere, however, and the system itself has a capac-
ity only of 25 points of Heat. However, it can be plugged
into a heat sink such as a 'chill can' (see page 127)
which can then be discarded when its capacity is used
up. Alternatively, a support cooling system can be used,
which is not portable but has a much higher capacity.
An Advanced Cooling System adds 20% to the weight of
a weapon's receiver and 50% to its cost.

Guidance System: Guidance Systems are only available
for weapons capable of launching missiles. Without one,
a missile launcher can only use 'dumb' unguided muni-
tions. A Guidance System interacts with the missile's
onboard electronics if they are present – it cannot guide
a 'dumb' weapon but can certainly launch one. A Guid-
ance System adds 50% to the cost of the launcher.

High Capacity: A High Capacity weapon is typically wider
to allow more ammunition to be carried in a magazine
without it projecting any more than a standard one. This
makes magazines incompatible with non-High Capac-
ity weapons even if they use the same calibre of am-
munition. High Capacity adds 20% to cost and 10%
to weight, and increases base ammunition capacity by
20%. For a standard handgun this means base capacity
is now 12. Actual capacity can be set at up to 150%
of this value, permitting handguns with an ammunition
capacity of up to 18 rounds to be created. High Capacity
is not compatible with Compact or Very Compact.

High Quality: A High Quality weapon is often finely
decorated as well as being very well made. High Qual-
ity starts at a 50% increase in the receiver cost, but
there is no upper limit on how much the final design can
cost. A High Quality 'working' weapon such as a sniper
rifle may look very ordinary, but grants DM+1 on attack
at ranges beyond 100m when using a scope or similar
sighting aid.

Increased Rate of Fire: Only weapons built on a burst-
capable or fully-automatic receiver can have their Auto
score increased. A burst-capable weapon with this
modification is still not capable of full-auto fire but can
take advantage of increased damage from an improved
Auto score. Burst-capable weapons start with Auto 2;
full-auto weapons start with Auto 3. In addition to get-
ting through a lot of ammunition, the weapon's cost
and weight increases with each point of Auto added. A
weapon whose Auto score is increased enough to add RF
or VRF capability bases the cost of that modification on
its inflated cost and weight.

Lightweight: Lightweight weapons are designed to be lighter
than usual, but this comes at a cost of being less durable
unless better materials are used. Lightweight reduces
weight by 20% and either increases cost by 50% or im-
poses the Hazardous (-1) trait. This increases the severity
of the Hazardous DM if it has been gained elsewhere.

Lightweight, Extreme: A weapon can be pared right down
to essentials, but this might make it flimsy. Extreme
Lightweight reduces weight by 40% but either impose the
Hazardous (-3) Trait or increases cost by 200%.

Low Quality: Low Quality weapons are cheap, but not usu-
ally all that badly made. Finishing may have some issues
such as burrs on metal or grips that do not quite fit as they
should but a Low Quality weapon will still shoot straight
and function reliably under most conditions. It may be
frustrating and annoying to maintain however. Low Qual-
ity reduces cost and imposes negative Traits, and can be
imposed by poor materials or other conditions beyond the
maker's control rather than being a choice to make the
weapon cheaper.

A weapon that has Deficiency points must satisfy them by
applying the Inaccurate, Unreliable, Ramshackle and/or
Hazardous traits. Each point of Inaccurate or Hazardous
satisfies one Deficiency point. Ramshackle satisfies 2, and

Increased Auto Rate
Auto Increase Cost Weight
+1 +10% +5%
+2 +25% +10%
+3 +50% +20%
+4 +100% +40%
+5 +200% +60%
+6 +300% +80%

**Degrees of Low Quality**

Degree

Receiver Cost
Reduction

Deficiency
Points
Low Quality -10% 1
Very Low Quality -20% 2
Extremely Low Quality -40% 3
Appalling Quality -60% 5
Piece of Junk -80% 8

Unreliable satisfies 3. Ramshackle effectively imposes a
point each of Inaccurate and Hazardous, which stack with
any points added from one or the other.

For example, a Traveller has bought the worst-made
handgun she could possibly have found and must apply
8 Deficiency points. She chooses Ramshackle (-1), Haz-
ardous (-3), and Unreliable (1). When it works this gun
is not that awful, merely shooting a little inaccurately as
a result of the Ramshackle DM. However, there is a 1 in
6 chance that the weapon will malfunction any time it is
used in combat. If it does malfunction, it imposes DM-4
(-3 from Hazardous and -1 from Ramshackle) on the
Malfunction table.

Quickdraw: A weapon can be optimized for rapid-response
situations, often to the exact specification of the user. A
Quickdraw weapon increases cost by 20% and grants an
additional Quickdraw +2 when being brought into ac-
tion. It also grants DM+1 to attack rolls when shooting at
ranges under 25m, and DM-1 beyond this range.

Recoil Compensation: Various devices are available to
help control the recoil of powerful weapons. Many rely
on diverting some of the propellant gases in a direction
that counters recoil, though other devices are available.
All rob the projectile of a little of its energy. A weapon's
Recoil score (see page 32) can be reduced by up to 2
at the cost of imposing +10% cost and +5% weight per
point. A point of Recoil Compensation reduces damage
by -1. Two points reduce damage by -3.

Rugged: Rugged weapons are designed to deal with
harsh conditions and general maltreatment. Firearms
are, as a rule, generally quite damage-resistant but a
Rugged weapon will withstand hazards a conventional
weapon will not, at least for a time. Examples include
mildly corrosive conditions, heat, cold and particularly
insidious grit or dust, as well as more conventional
hazards such as being driven over by a truck. Ruggedi-

sation adds 30% to the cost of the receiver and 10%
to weight. Rugged weapons gain DM+2 to rolls on the
Malfunction table.

**Very Compact:** A very compact receive adds 40% to the
cost of the weapon and reduces mass by 20%. Base am-
munition capacity is reduced by 50%.

**Capability Features**
These alter the weapon's capabilities, typically adding new
ones, or otherwise changing the nature of the weapon.

**Armored:** Weapons can be armored and hardened to
protect them against damage. This adds 10% to receiver
cost and 5% to its weight for every point of Protection.
Armor protects against knocks and bashes but not
internal malfunctions such as breach explosions.

**Bulwarked:** Bulwarked weapons have additional safety
features such as a strengthened breach to contain
ammunition explosions or fireproofed tanks on a
flamethrower. Bulwarking also represents additional
user-safety features such as additional catches, locks
and other impediments to an unintentional discharge.
Every point of Bulwarked provides DM+1 to rolls on the
Malfunction table. Bulwarking costs 20% of the receiver
cost and adds 10% to its weight per point.

**Disguised:** Disguised weapons look like something
else or are concealed inside an innocent item. This is
more than merely covering a submachinegun in shirts
and closing the suitcase – that costs nothing and is
not very effective. A disguised weapon nestles in a
concealed chamber within a suitcase, or is built into
a device which still functions normally. An example of
the latter might be a one-shot laser built into a func-
tional datapad. Disguising a weapon imposes a DM
ranging from -1 to -4 on attempts to detect, notice
or recognize it. Each -1 adds 50% to the cost of the
weapon. In addition, the cost of any device used to
disguise the weapon must be paid.

**Stealth, Basic:** Basic Stealth weapons are designed to
minimise the chance of detection by scanners or observ-
ers. Physical and Emissions Signatures are both reduced
by one level, and the weapon imposes DM-2 on attempts
to detect it using scanners, observation or a physical
search. A Basic Stealth weapon still looks like a gun,
but has as many of its moving parts operating internally
as possible and a minimum of projections to snag on
clothing when being deployed. Basic Stealth adds 50%
to the weapon's cost.

Stealth, Extreme: Extreme Stealth weapons are made
from exotic materials which are hard to detect with
conventional scanners; typically polymers and cultured
bone. Ammunition must also be made from similar
materials and use propellants with a different chemical
signature to standard. For this reason Extreme Stealth
weapons increase cost by 250%. Extreme Stealth am-
munition costs 20 times standard, though many Extreme
Stealth guns can fire standard ammunition, mainly for
practice purposes. If used in the field, standard ammu-
nition reduces the stealth benefits of this configuration.
Extreme Stealth weapons reduce Physical and Emissions
Signatures by three levels (two with standard ammu-
nition) and impose DM-6 on attempts to detect the
weapon by device, search or observation (DM-4 if using
standard ammunition). Most Extreme Stealth weapons
are handguns, known colloquially as 'body pistols', but
other weaponry is possible. A disassembled Extreme
Stealth rifle could be smuggled into a secure area with
relative ease, and even carried intact such a weapon
might evade detection by scans of the user's luggage.

Vacuum: Weapons intended for use in vacuum or a very
low pressure atmosphere require specialist lubricants
and slightly altered configuration to allow them to func-
tion. They usually include features such as an enlarged
trigger guard to allow use with vacc suit gloves. Many
standard snub pistols are not configured for vacuum
work; they are designed for low-gravity security opera-
tions within a vessel – but more expensive models tend
to include Vacuum modifications. Vacuum weapons can
function equally well in space or an atmosphere. The
modification increases receiver cost by 20%.

Projectile Weapon Ammunition
One big advantage of projectile weapons is the capability
to deliver a range of ammunition types. The standard
projectile used by most weapons is referred to as 'ball',
referring to the musket balls used by archaic weapons.
Unless a weapon is specifically designed for a specialist
type of ammunition, damage is given for ball ammunition.

Projectile firearms are available in a wide variety of
calibres, most of which are not interchangeable. There
is some standardization of calibres, but manufacturers

- especially those on different worlds – may use
differing standards. This can make getting the right
ammunition for an exotic weapon quite difficult.

It is the ammunition a weapon is built around, rather
than its configuration, which most strongly defines its
capabilities. Other characteristics such as barrel length
can be important but there is a limit to how much

performance can be modified by the weapon a given
cartridge is fired through. For this reason the base
range of a weapon is determined by its ammunition
type – rifle bullets go further and remain accurate at
longer distances than handgun rounds.

Ammunition costs are given in the Traveller Core
Rulebook as the price for a fully loaded magazine
or equivalent. When bought in larger quantities
ammunition generally works out a lot cheaper. The
price for ammunition is given here as the cost for a box
of 100 rounds and sufficient additional items – such as
batteries for a gauss weapon – to fire them.

Handgun Calibres
Handgun ammunition tends to be of a higher calibre
(i.e. the bullet has a greater diameter) than rifle-type
ammunition, but uses a shorter cartridge containing
less propellant. Most handguns use a calibre ranging
from around 6mm to 12mm, though larger and smaller
weapons are possible. Most submachineguns are
chambered for a handgun calibre round. Pistol-type
cartridges penetrate armor very poorly, though they
can be highly effective against unarmored targets.

Light Handguns are typically in the 6-8mm range. Base
Damage 2D. Cr60 per 100 rounds.
Medium Handguns are typically in the 9-10mm range.
Base Damage 3D-3. Cr75 per 100 rounds.
Heavy Handguns are typically in the 11-12mm range.
Base Damage 3D-1. Cr100 per 100 rounds.

•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and reduces receiver cost by
20%. Weight is reduced by 25%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's
base capacity by 20% and increases receiver
cost by 20%. Weight is reduced by 15%.
Heavy handguns gain the Bulky trait. Larger
weapons using heavy handgun ammunition are
Bulky unless they weigh more than 2kg or are
compensated in some manner.

Shotguns
Shotguns and other smoothbore weapons generally use a
short, fat cartridge not compatible with other weapons.
The standard ammunition type for smoothbores is
pellets rather than a single bullet, but most smoothbores
can deliver a range of ammunition types. Smoothbore
weapons have a base range of 100m with solid
ammunition. Using pellet ammunition reduces base
range to 25m.

Receivers set up for large-calibre smoothbore
ammunition may be handguns, assault weapons or
longarms, but are subject to additional considerations.
Large-calibre handguns cannot use any form of
detachable magazine – this would make the weapon
too wide to hold in the hand. Repeaters – in the form of
revolvers – or single shot weapons are possible. Assault
weapons using large-calibre smoothbore ammunition
are highly unusual but possible providing ammunition
feed is not through the handgrip. The commonest form
of receiver for large-calibre smoothbore ammunition is a
longarm, though it is of course possible to pair this with
a very short barrel.

Base ammunition capacity for any large-calibre
smoothbore weapon is 10 shells for a longarm, 6 for an
assault weapon and 4 for a handgun. Limitations for
mechanisms such as a repeater are disregarded, but a
weapon can be made compact or high-capacity which
will affect maximum ammunition capacity. Longarms
with a fixed magazine under the barrel are usually
limited by the length of the weapon, with a capacity of
4-8 shells being common.

Combat shotguns are typically chambered for a calibre
around 18-20mm in diameter, though they are usually
rated by a system of 'gauges' based on the mass of a
lead ball the diameter of the weapon's bore. The lower
the gauge number, the more powerful the smoothbore
weapon. Smoothbore weapons possess the Inaccurate
trait to some degree and may perform poorly against
armor whether firing a solid slug or a charge of pellets.

**Small Smoothbores** are typically in the 10-12mm range.

**Light Smoothbores** are typically in the 14-16mm range.
Base Damage 4D-4. Cr125 per 100 rounds

•  Small ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 40% and reduces weight by 40%.
•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and reduces weight by 20%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's base
capacity by 20% and increases weight by 20%.

Smoothbores are relatively low-velocity weapons and
begin with Penetration -1. This can be altered by using
specialist ammunition or design choices.

Recoil tends to be a problem when using large-calibre
ammunition of this sort. This is represented by the
Bulky and Very Bulky traits alongside the recoil rules
in this book (see page 32). The Recoil Effects table
indicates what level of Bulky is imposed by various
ammunition types in different receivers. Some are
heavy enough to absorb the recoil and do not have
Bulky but remain subject to the usual recoil rules if
they are in use. Some weapons simply cannot handle
large-calibre ammunition.

Smoothbores are cheaper to produce than rifles and similar
projectile weapons, reducing receiver cost by 25%.

**Rifle Calibres**
Rifles and rifle-type weapons range considerably
in calibre. They typically use a long cartridge and
relatively small bullet to produce high muzzle velocity.
This translates into accuracy and penetration. Assault
rifles are typically chambered for an intermediate
cartridge of around 5-6mm calibre, with heavier 'battle'
rifles using a 7-8mm cartridge. Due to the trade-off
between velocity and bullet mass it is possible to
obtain similar performance with a large, slow bullet or
a small fast one, so chamberings vary. Most sniping
weapons are in the battle-rifle calibre range, but some
use a heavier cartridge of up to 10mm or so calibre.

Anti-materiel rifles, anti-tank rifles and similar
weapons designed to attack objects rather than people
may use larger calibres. Typically these are in the 12-
15mm range. Heavy anti-materiel weapons in the 18-
20mm range have a higher base damage. Conversely,
very light rifle calibres do exist, mostly for 'plinking'
or hunting small game.

Light Rifle calibres range from 4-5mm. Base Damage
2D. Cr40 per 100 rounds.
Intermediate Rifle calibres range from 5-6mm. Base
Damage 3D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Battle Rifle calibres range from 7-9mm. Base Damage
3D+3. Cr100 per 100 rounds.
Heavy Rifle calibres range from 10-11mm. Base
Damage 4D. Cr250 per 100 rounds.
Anti-Materiel Rifle calibres range from 12-15mm. Base
Damage 5D. Cr1500 per 100 rounds. Anti-materiel
weapons gain the Bulky trait.
Heavy Anti-Materiel Rifles calibres range from 18-
20mm. Base Damage 6D. Cr3000 per 100 rounds.
Heavy anti-materiel weapons gain the Very Bulky trait.

•  Light ammunition increases the weapon's
base capacity by 20% and decreases weight
by 40%.
•  Intermediate calibre ammunition decreases
receiver weight by 20%.
•  Battle calibre ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 20%.
•  Heavy ammunition decreases the weapon's
base capacity by 40% and increases receiver
cost by 25%. Weight is increased by 10%.
•  Anti-materiel ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 60% and increases
receiver cost by 150%. Weight is increased
by 50%. It requires a light support weapon
receiver at minimum.
•  Heavy anti-materiel ammunition decreases the
weapon's base capacity by 80% and increases
receiver cost by 250%. Weight is increased by
100%. It requires a support weapon receiver
at minimum.

OTHER PROJECTILE

WEAPONS
Other ways of sending a projectile downrange exist.
Some rely on similar mechanisms to conventional
firearms but are suited to a particular role or
environment. Others use entirely different ways to get
their projectile moving, such as magnetic acceleration,
but ultimately all these weapons rely on hurling a
relatively small object with a great deal of kinetic energy.

Archaic Weapons
Archaic weapons such as black powder muskets and
pistols are considered to be conventional firearms
even if they use a different sort of initiation such as
a flintlock or wheel-lock mechanism. Archaic firearms
shoot a large-calibre ball or bullet, propelled by loose
powder. Most such weapons are muzzle-loaders. A

typical black powder pistol uses a 14-15mm diameter
ball; a musket typically has a calibre of 17-18mm.
These weapons are smoothbores. Black powder
rifles typically use a 15-16mm bullet and achieve a
higher muzzle velocity at the price of slower loading.
However, damage is much the same due to the trade-
off between weight and velocity.

Black Powder pistols have base Damage 2D-3. Cr10
per 100 rounds.
Black Powder muskets and rifles have base Damage
3D-3. Cr25 per 100 rounds.

All black powder and similar weapons have the
Slow Loader trait, typically with a score of 8 for
smoothbore longarms and 12 for rifled weapons. All
such weapons have Physical Signature (very high),
which cannot be reduced by design or accessories.
Most have Inaccurate and Unreliable.

Archaic weapons typically have a very short effective
range as their projectiles are not aerodynamic and
start with a low muzzle velocity. Range for an archaic
weapon is based on half the range of the equivalent
conventional weapon, down to a minimum of 5m.

Archaic weapons have a very low muzzle velocity and
begin with Penetration -2.

Low-Recoil Weapons
More commonly known as 'snub' weapons, low-
recoil special-purpose weaponry is a family of large-
calibre, low-velocity weapons designed for use in
low gravity. The use of a relatively heavy but low-

velocity projectile produces reasonable stopping
power without generating heavy recoil. This gives the
weapon the Zero-G trait, along with Inaccurate (-2).

Snub Weapons are typically chambered for a short
10mm cartridge not compatible with other weapons.
Base Damage 3D-3. Cr200 per 100 rounds.

They usually perform poorly against armor and other
hard surfaces, but specialist ammunition can offset this
though may cause the weapon to lose the Zero-G trait.

Snub Weapons are relatively low-velocity weapons and
begin with Penetration -1. This can be altered by using
specialist ammunition or various design choices.

Rocket Projectiles
Some weapons use rocket projectiles rather than
conventional bullets. These have the advantage of
producing very little recoil but are ineffective at short
ranges until the projectile gains velocity. A rocket
projectile weapon does the same damage as its
conventional equivalent, but is counted as a Zero-G
weapon. Rocket projectiles do only 1D of damage
if they strike a target within 10m. They tend to be
inaccurate, but not excessively so.

Rocket projectiles cost twice as much as conventional
firearm ammunition of the same calibre. Weapons
that use them possess the Zero-G trait. The pressures
experienced by 'accelerator' weapons – those that use
rocket-propelled projectiles – are low compared to
conventional firearms. Weapons can be more lightly
built, halving receiver and barrel weight. Costs
remain unchanged.

- Values assume the smoothbore weapon is firing a solid projectile such as a musket ball or rifled slug from a combat
shotgun. Pellet ammunition changes the weapon's characteristics. Ranges are given for solid and pellet ammunition.

These projectiles can attain high velocities if they
travel far enough, and range is not limited by barrel
length. They begin with Penetration 0, which can be
altered by specialist ammunition or design choices.
Accuracy is also poorer than conventional firearms;
accelerator weapons have the Inaccurate trait, usually
with a score of -1.

Gauss Weapons
Gauss projectiles are typically smaller than conventional
bullets but achieve a higher muzzle velocity due
to electromagnetic acceleration. A standard gauss
weapon typically uses needles with a calibre of
4mm. Performance is a little better than a standard
projectile firearm in the class; a gauss pistol typically
does 3D damage and a gauss rifle does 4D damage.
Gauss weapons become available at TL12, though the
projectiles can be manufactured at lower TLs.

For simplicity, it is assumed that gauss weapons have
a battery in the magazine which supplies the power
necessary to accelerate the rounds contained within.
Acceleration takes place within the receiver, over a very
short distance, with the barrel serving mainly to guide and
stabilize the round.

Standard Gauss propulsion units suitable for use in
a longarm become available at TL12 and have base
Damage 4D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Small Gauss propulsion units suitable for a handgun
become available at TL13 have base Damage 3D. Cr50
per 100 rounds.
Enhanced Gauss propulsion units become available at
TL14 and have base Damage 5D. Cr50 per 100 rounds.
Gauss Shotguns hold the same amount of projectiles
as an equivalent gauss weapon, but they are packed
into bundles of 16-24 depending on the weapon type.
Ammunition capacity is effectively reduced by 75%.
Gauss shotguns use small gauss ammunition but deliver
+2 damage per dice; typically this is 3D+6.

Gauss weapons have an intrinsic armor-piercing
capability due to their high muzzle velocity. This gives
them base Penetration +2. Gauss propulsion doubles the
cost of a weapon and increases weight by 25%. Due to
the method of propulsion used in gauss weapons, damage
is not reduced by short barrels in the manner of high-
velocity projectile weaponry.

solid projectile such as a musket ball or rifled slug from
a combat shotgun. Pellet ammunition changes the
weapon's characteristics. Ranges are given for solid and
pellet ammunition.

SECONDARY

WEAPONS
A secondary weapon can be fitted, usually under the
barrel. Most commonly this is a grenade launcher or
shotgun, but other configurations are possible. A sec-
ondary weapon mounting costs and weighs 10% of the
secondary weapon's values. There is no need to provide
a stock for a secondary weapon but it must have a bar-
rel, receiver and any furniture the designer requires. A
secondary weapon is separate from the primary, and is
used independently; a Traveller can fire their assault rifle
or the shotgun mounted under it, but not both at the
same time unless a complex joint-triggering mechanism
has been contrived.

Multi-Barrel Weapons
A weapon can have multiple barrels, which can be
achieved in different ways. For this reason multi-
barrel configuration is not always considered a receiver
feature. A multi-barrel configuration can either be
complete or partial. Complete barrels include a breach,
and sometimes a firing mechanism as well. If so, all
barrels can be discharged simultaneously at the same
target or fired independently. This is commonest with
double-barrelled shotguns and similar weapons. Barrels
of a complete multi-barrel weapon do not have to be
matched – for example a hunting weapon might have
a shotgun barrel and a rifle barrel, allowing the user to
deal with whatever breaks cover. Alternatively, a combat
handgun might have a separate barrel with a one-shot
flashbang discharger underneath the main muzzle, for a
non-lethal but very authoritative warning shot.

A complete multi-barrel weapon adds 10% to the cost
and weight of the receiver per extra barrel. Each barrel is
bought for its normal cost but each barrel after the first
adds only half its normal weight. Each additional barrel
reduces Quickdraw by -1.

Partial multi-barrel weapons have a firing chamber for
each barrel but share a firing mechanism. This may
be aligned with each barrel in turn, for example with
a rotating firing pin, or the barrels may be aligned
in turn in the manner of a 'pepperbox' pistol. This
configuration is unusual but used in a few specialist
weapons. Partial multi-barrel configuration does not
add to the cost and weight of the receiver, but each
additional barrel must be purchased.

Rotary Weapons and Multi-Mounts
Rotary weapons have multiple barrels which rotate in
turn to align with the firing chamber. This allows a
high rate of fire to be maintained as each barrel has
a chance to cool whilst another is firing. Mechanical

rotary weapons, such as a gatling gun, can be used to
create a rather crude equivalent of a machinegun. A
mechanical rotary weapon begins with a nominal Auto
1, which can be increased to a maximum of half the
number of barrels on the weapon. Thus a 6-barrelled
gatling gun can deliver the equivalent of Auto 3 with
some vigorous cranking.

A multi-barrel weapon combined with a powered feed
system allows an automatic, RF or VRF weapon to
dissipate heat whilst it is firing. Each barrel after the
first removes one point of Heat from the weapon per
round, whether it is firing or not.

An alternative way to deliver increased firepower is to
create an 'organ gun' with multiple complete weapons
mounted together. At low Tech Levels these are often
slow-loading weapons, creating a powerful one-shot
effect. An 'organ gun' – as these weapons are called –
is considered to have Auto 1 for every full four barrels
firing simultaneously, so a 12-barrel organ gun made
out of primitive muskets delivers an Auto 3 attack
when fired but then requires considerable time for
reloading. More advanced weapons mounted in this
manner can make such an attack every round if they
reload quickly enough. This is bulky and inefficient,
but sometimes useful. If the weapons mounted in this
manner are capable of automatic fire, their collective
effect is to increase their Auto score by +1 for every
additional weapon; a triple-mounting of Auto 3
machineguns can be treated as a single weapon with
Auto 5.

Multi-mounted weapons with a high Auto may be
treated as RF or VRF weapons. A twin-mounted
weapon with Auto 4+ can be considered a single RF
weapon. Each additional weapon beyond two adds
+1 to the Auto score, so a quad mount of Auto 4
machineguns can be considered an RF weapon with
Auto 6. Likewise, twin-mounted weapons with Auto
6+ can be considered a VRF weapon, and adding
more weapons on the same mount adds +1 to Auto for
each weapon after the second.

**Weapon-Mounted Launchers**
Some launcher systems are essentially secondary
weapons fitted to a primary. As with other secondary
weapons the fittings cost 10% of the cost and weight
of the launcher, which must be designed separately
from the primary weapon. Design notes for grenade
launchers and similar weapons are found on page 53.

Other launchers are more basic. An under-barrel rail
can be used to launch a one-shot rocket propelled
grenade, or one can be fitted onto a muzzle
discharger. The disadvantage of the latter is that the

primary weapon cannot be used with the grenade in
position. Cup dischargers for conventional grenades
are also occasionally used, but these require the use
of a blank rifle cartridge to propel the grenade, and
again prevent the primary weapon from being fired
when a grenade is in place.

An under-barrel rail weighs 0.1kg and costs Cr100. It
does not affect Quickdraw unless a grenade is in place,
in which case it imposes a penalty of -3.

A muzzle discharger weighs 0.05kg and costs Cr75. It
does not affect Quickdraw unless a grenade is in place,
in which case it imposes a penalty of -3 and the first
shot must be made with the grenade. Rocket-propelled
grenades can be used to make a direct attack so can be
effective Quickdraw weapons.

A cup discharger weighs 0.15kg and costs Cr50. It
imposes a -2 penalty on Quickdraw, increased to -4 if
a grenade is in place, and the grenade must be used
for the initial shot. Since this is inevitably an indirect
attack, the chances of success are minimal. However,
it may matter whether or not a grenade was delivered
before the user was shot.

AMMUNITION

CAPACITY
As already noted, the base ammunition capacity for a
weapon indicates a standard magazine or feed device
size. It is determined by the ammunition type and any
features the receiver might have, such as being a High
Capacity weapon. Actual ammunition capacity for the
weapon can be set at any amount up to 150% of the
base value. There are advantages to reducing ammuni-
tion capacity, in terms of saved weight and cost, though
it is quite rare to take capacity below 50% of base.

The capacity of the weapon determines how many
rounds are carried in a standard magazine, which fits
into the weapon without sticking out to an awkward
degree. Extended magazines can be created of course,
but these tend to be clumsy. Any increase over 150%
requires such a device.

•  Each 10% increase in ammunition capacity
adds 5% to the weight of a loaded weapon and
10% to the cost of the receiver.

•  Each 10% reduction in ammunition capacity
reduces loaded weight by 5% and reduces the
receiver cost by 5%.

BARREL FEATURES
As a general rule, a longer barrel translates to higher
muzzle velocity and therefore longer range with greater
accuracy at a distance. This generally also correlates
for energy weapons such as lasers and plasma guns. A
barrel of standard length is assumed within the weight
and cost of the receiver. Performance (in terms of range
and damage) with such a barrel is as noted for the
ammunition type.

There is a limit to how long a barrel can be added to a
given weapon before it becomes ridiculous. A carbine-type
barrel could be added to a handgun receiver to create
a pistol-calibre carbine – such weapons have existed
historically – but a weapon of this sort is as awkward to
carry as an actual carbine, and less effective.

The effect a given length of barrel has on muzzle velocity
(and thus range, accuracy and damage) depends on the
ammunition type. Relatively low-velocity rounds (handgun,
snub weapon and smoothbore ammunition) require less
barrel length to reach maximum velocity and do not benefit
from a very long barrel. Conversely, high velocity rounds
lose much of their effectiveness if not fired from a barrel
of suitable length. For high-velocity ammunition – this
typically means rifle calibres – damage is reduced by
one dice for a Minimal, Short or Handgun barrel. This is
applied before other damage-based effects are considered.

Minimal: A Minimal barrel barely extends past the end
of the firing chamber. All damage dice are converted to
D3s; e.g., a standard rifle calibre weapon with a Minimal
barrel reduces damage from 3D to 3D3. A weapon with a
Minimal barrel grants the user DM+8 during a Quickdraw.
Effective range for all weapons with a Minimal barrel is
reduced to 5m, and effects that rely on high-velocity, such
as non-explosive armor-piercing effects, are annulled.
A Minimal barrel has negligible weight and cost, but
increases Physical Signature by two levels when the
weapon is fired and reduces Penetration by -2.

Short: A Short barrel is typically used on handguns
intended for concealed carry. Effective range is reduced
by 90% and non-explosive armor piercing effects are
lost. A Short barrel weighs and costs 10% of receiver
values. A weapon with a Short barrel grants the user
DM+6 during a Quickdraw. A Short barrel increases
Physical Signature by one level when the weapon is fired
and reduces Penetration by -1.

Running out of Dice
Some modifications reduce the number of dice
damage a weapon delivers. If a weapon has only
1D left and must reduce by one dice, damage
drops to D3. Another nominal 1D reduction takes
damage down to 1 point, and the next reduction
drops damage to zero.

Handgun: A standard Handgun barrel reduces range by
80% for all ammunition types except rocket projectiles. A
Handgun barrel costs 15% of receiver price and weight is
20%. High-velocity weapons such as rifles using a Hand-
gun barrel also reduce damage by one dice. A Handgun
barrel grants the user DM+4 during a Quickdraw. A Hand-
gun barrel reduces Penetration by -1.

Assault: An Assault barrel is typically found on subma-
chineguns or short combat shotguns. Cost for an Assault
barrel is 20% of base receiver cost, and the barrel is 30%
of base receiver weight. High-velocity weapons such as
rifles using an Assault barrel reduce damage by one dice.
Thus a rifle normally doing 3D+3 damage which has been
fitted with an Assault barrel, reduces damage to 2D+3.
Base range is reduced by 50%. A weapon with an Assault
barrel grants the user DM+2 during a Quickdraw.

Carbine: The definition of a carbine is rather vague, with
general connotations of a short, light longarm. A rifle-type
weapon using a Carbine barrel must reduce damage by
1 point per two full dice of base damage. Base range is
reduced by 10%. A Carbine barrel costs 25% of receiver
price and adds 40% weight.

Rifle: A standard Rifle barrel produces normal performance
for all weapons. Cost is 30% of receiver price, and the bar-
rel adds 50% of receiver weight to the weapon.

Long: A Long barrel adds 75% to receiver weight and 50%
to cost. Range for high-velocity weapons is increased by
10%. Additionally, a Long barrel reduces the negative DM
for range by one if the firer is using a scope.

Very Long: A Very Long barrel adds 100% to receiver
weight and 100% to cost. Range for high-velocity weap-
ons is increased by 25%. Additionally, a Very Long barrel
reduces the negative DM for range by two if the firer is
using a scope.

**Heavy Barrel:** A Heavy barrel dissipates heat better than a
standard one. This is important when undertaking sus-
tained fire, as heat build-up can damage a weapon or
cause a malfunction. A Heavy barrel doubles the number
of rounds in which sustained fire can be maintained before
malfunctions become possible. Any barrel length can be
specified as Heavy, doubling its weight and price. A Heavy
barrel reduces Quickdraw by -1.

FURNITURE
The term furniture refers to parts of a weapon such as
its stock, grips and the like. Typically longarms have a
fixed solid stock, assault weapons tend to have a light-
weight stock which may or may not fold, and handguns
do not have one at all. Details like whether the foregrip
on a rifle is vertical or a traditional forearm are up to the
designer and do not affect cost or weight.

**Stockless:** A weapon with no stock at all cannot be fired
from the shoulder and is difficult to steady. Aimed fire
at ranges beyond 25m is subject to DM-2. A Stockless
weapon may have a mounting for a stock, at negligible
cost and weight, in which case it is covered by a butt
cap until a stock of some kind is mounted. A Stockless
longarm or assault weapon gains +2 to Quickdraw.

**Folding Stock:** A folding or telescoping stock reduces
weight at the cost of being less effective. When de-
ployed, a Folding Stock allows aimed fire at ranges
beyond 25m with DM-1. When the stock is not deployed
the weapon counts as Stockless. A Folding Stock adds
5% to the weight and 15% to the cost of the weapon.

Full Stock: A Full Stock is standard on most longarms and
can be added to a handgun to create a carbine of sorts.
Usually such stocks are detachable. A Full Stock adds
10% to the weight and 10% of the cost of the weapon.

Modularization: Any weapon can have one component
that can be detached at no cost or weight, such as a
detachable stock on a combat shotgun. Full Modularisa-
tion allows multiple parts to be swapped around quickly
and easily with only basic tools. For example, a Traveller
expecting close combat might remove the barrel and
stock of their rifle, swapping the barrel for an assault-
length one. Modularization adds 10% to the weight and
20% to the cost of the weapon.

Bipod: Any weapon with a rifle-length or longer barrel
can be fitted with a Bipod. This takes one significant
action to deploy and position the weapon, after which
it grants DM+1 to attack rolls at ranges beyond 50m.
A Bipod reduces Quickdraw by -4 unless the weapon is
already on target. Bipods cost 10% of receiver price and
add 20% of receiver weight to the weapon. A detachable
Bipod has all these characteristics but costs 15% of
receiver price.

Support Mount: Any weapon can have a Support Mount
rather than a stock. A Support Mount usually takes the
form of a tripod but could have other configurations.
Support Mounts typically use the same attachment
system as many vehicle mountings, allowing a weapon
to be dismounted from a vehicle and set up on a tripod
if necessary. A Support Mount weighs as much as the
receiver of the weapon and costs 25% of its price.

Small weapons such as handguns and shotguns can be
placed on a Support Mount for remote-controlled firing
or as booby traps. This makes the weapon unusable in
normal combat.

Improvised Support Weapons
Most longarm-type weapons can be fitted to
a pintle mount for support work, and indeed
the majority of pintle mounts have a universal
attachment that can take almost any weapon.
An assault rifle fed from a drum magazine could
make a useful improvised support weapon, but
not for long. Sustained fire will overheat the
weapon and there is no provision for a quick
barrel change. Weaponry intended for sustained
fire requires either a cooling system or the ability
to swap barrels in a matter of moments.

ACCESSORIES
Accessories can usually be swapped around at will.
For example, a Traveller might carry their Personal
Defence Weapon with a convenient 12-round magazine
inserted, allowing it to be worn in a holster, but have
a pair of 35-round combat magazines available to be
swapped in once the weapon is deployed. Most other
accessory-swapping actions can be as convenient as
reloading, providing the item is intended for quick
release. Some accessories, such as powerful scopes,
cannot be mounted this way as they require very precise
calibration. Such accessories require a workshop to be
removed or added, though the process is usually simple.

Suppressors
It is not normally possible to make a firearm silent,
but various mechanisms are available to reduce the
signature of the weapon to the point where it might

not be noticed, or may not be recognized as a gunshot.
Whatever the specifics of their operation these
accessories are referred to as suppressors.

Suppressor, Basic: A basic suppressor reduces weapon
flash and noise a little without greatly affecting its
performance. A basic suppressor reduces Quickdraw
by -2 and Physical Signature by one level. It costs
50% of the weapon's receiver price. A basic suppressor
imposes Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective range by
25%. A basic suppressor adds 0.2kg to the weight of
the weapon.

Suppressor: A standard suppressor can be quite bulky
and heavy. It reduces Quickdraw by -3 and Physical
Signature by 2 levels. A suppressor costs 100% of the
weapon's receiver price. A standard suppressor imposes
Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective range by 50%. It
also reduces Penetration by -1. A standard suppressor
adds 0.3kg to the weight of the weapon.

Suppressor, Extreme: An extreme suppressor is a heavy
item, adding significantly to the weapon's front-end
weight and overall length. Quickdraw is reduced by
-4 and Physical Signature by 3 levels. An extreme
suppressor imposes Inaccurate -1 and reduces effective
range by 75%. Penetration is reduced by -2 as the
suppressor reduces muzzle velocity significantly. An
extreme suppressor costs 200% of the weapon's receiver
price. An extreme suppressor adds 0.5kg to the weight
of the weapon.

Ammunition Feed Devices
Ammunition is used quickly in a firefight, and there is a
limit to how much can be carried. A typical loadout for
a combat soldier is one magazine in their weapon and
six more carried in pouches. Those not carrying much
else might increase this loadout, but when combined
with all the other gear a typical infantry soldier must lug
about there is not much capacity for more. A Certain
Kind Of Traveller might write down on their sheet they
are carrying 800 magazines for their gauss rifle, but it is
not physically possible to carry much more than a dozen
ordinary magazines. Their bulk must be considered
along with weight.

A magazine-fed weapon will come with a modest amount
of feed devices; belt-fed weapons will have a supply
of links, and so forth. Mercenaries do not, as a rule,
go to the gun shop and buy a few loaded magazines.
They typically purchase ammunition in crates and
load up magazines, belts and other feed devices as
needed. Thus the 'magazine' costs found in the Traveller
Core Rulebook and Central Supply Catalogue do not

generally apply to mercenaries. Even when buying in
small quantities, military units do not procure their
ammunition like a bunch of yahoos in town waiting for
their free trader to be unloaded.

As a general rule, magazines and feed devices can be
bought individually at the prices shown, or in a pack of 6
with a 10% discount. Crates generally hold 100 or more
magazines, and typically bought at a discount of around
30% plus whatever the unit's procurement officer can
bargain for. This does not include ammunition.

**Fixed Magazines:** Fixed magazines are part of the weapon
and, by definition, cannot be detached. They make
the weapon slower to load; instead of taking one minor
action to change a magazine, the user must usually feed
ammunition in one round at a time. Each minor action
allows the user to get D3 rounds into the weapon, and
in many cases it can be fired as soon as there is any
ammunition at all. If using a reload-assistance device
such as a stripper clip, en-bloc clip or speedloader,
2 minor actions are sufficient to place the contents
of the loading device into the weapon. Such devices
typically cost 1% of the weapon's purchase price. A
fixed magazine reduces cost and weight of the receiver
by 10%.

**Standard Magazines:** A weapon is supplied with a
reasonable amount of magazines or other feed devices,
usually 2-4 for most weapons. A military unit might
need more than this, and will typically purchase
significant quantities at a time. A standard magazine
holds whatever the ammunition capacity of the weapon
has been determined to be, and does so without being
unduly clumsy. If bought singly it will typically cost 1%
of the weapon's purchase price.

**Extended Magazines:** These are available for most weap-
ons that use a detachable 'box' magazine. They may be
longer, wider or use a 'casket' configuration. An extend-
ed magazine can hold up to 50% more ammunition than
standard, but sticks out of the weapon to a considerable
degree. Extended magazines impose DM-2 during a
Quickdraw. An extended magazine costs twice the price
of a standard one.

**Drum Magazines:** Drum magazines can hold up to 2.5
times the ammunition of a standard magazine. They
are, however, bulky and often noisy when carried. Drums
make the weapon unwieldy and difficult to aim, and
even at high Tech Levels they are prone to jam, imposing
the Inaccurate (-1) and Hazardous (-1) traits. They also
impose DM-6 during a Quickdraw; a fixed drum maga-
zine, as used in some shotguns and grenade launchers,
does not suffer from this problem but must be manually

reloaded in place. Drum magazines cost five times as
much as standard ones. A fixed (or 'semi-internal') drum
costs 5% of the weapon's receiver cost.

Belts: A belt can in theory hold as much ammunition
as the user wants, and a loader can keep adding belt
segments whilst the gunner is firing. This is not much
of a problem when the weapon is emplaced or mounted,
and imposes no penalty. However, a belt-fed weapon
can be difficult to use on the move unless some kind of
belt-holder and guide is available. All belt-fed weapons
suffer from the Inaccurate (-1) trait due to the motion of
the belt. An additional DM-2 applies when firing on the
move unless a suitable belt-holder is in place. Belts also
impose DM-8 during a Quickdraw.

Clips, Speedloaders and Cassettes: A variety of devices
are available to get ammunition into a weapon with a
fixed magazine quickly. In some cases this requires
physical transfer of the ammunition either all at once
in the manner of a speedloader for a revolver or in
rapid succession in the manner of a stripper clip. Such
devices cost around Cr5 and hold enough ammunition to
reload the weapon once. Some weapons use pre-packed
ammunition in which the feed device is no more than
a lightweight container which is discarded once empty.
Such a device costs Cr10 plus the price of the ammu-
nition inside. In some cases, ammunition cassettes of
this type are shipped directly from the factory in loaded
condition and cannot be reloaded outside the supplier's
own facilities. This practice is generally disliked by mer-
cenaries as it ties them to the manufacture's prices and
can cause problems if ammunition runs short.

The weight of a loaded feed device is included in the
weight given for all weapons. Additional magazines,
speedloaders, stripper clips and the like typically
weigh around 0.15kg for handguns and 0.5kg for
intermediate-calibre rifles. A 50-round length of
ammunition belt for a support weapon firing Battle
Rifle calibre ammunition typically weighs 1.5kg. It is
not always necessary to calculate the precise weight of
ammunition carried, but if the Travellers are trying to
get away with carrying thousands of rounds they should
be required to account for it.

Sighting Devices
Weapons almost always come with built-in iron sights;
typically this a simple front blade and rear notch type,
adjustable for range. At TL6 and above, it is usual
for military weapons to have a basic optical sight as
standard. This may have low magnification to assist in
aiming and is typical of the 'red dot' reflex type. These
sights are rugged enough to survive being run over by a

truck – if the rifle still works so will its sight. A reflex or
basic combat sight comes as standard on most military
longarms, and does not add cost or weight. It provides
a flat DM+1 on aimed or snap shooting but a positive
Quickdraw is halved if the firer takes time to align
even such a simple sight. For this reason many 'point
soldier' and close-quarters weapons are not fitted with
optical sights.

Mounting any type of scope (but not a laser pointer) on
a weapon imposes an additional -2 on its Quickdraw.

Scope: A typical optical scope offers variable
magnification of 1.5x, 2.5x and 4x, allowing personnel
to engage in precision fire out to considerable ranges. A
scope of this type costs Cr50 and weighs 0.2kg. It gives
the weapon the Scope trait.

Long-Range Scope: Long-range scopes are available with
optical magnification up to 50x, though this is rare since
most personnel cannot shoot accurately at such ranges.
A long-range scope costs Cr500 and weighs 0.5kg.
It gives the weapon the Scope trait and reduces any
negative DM for range by -2.

Low-Light Scope: A low-light scope negates the effects of
near-complete darkness, though it needs at least a little
light to function and cannot see through smoke or other
obscurants. A low-light scope is normally combined
with a standard scope into one unit, though sometimes
it may be configured as a standalone unit. In either
configuration it costs Cr150 and weighs 0.4kg.

Thermal Scope: A thermal scope can detect heat, so
can function in complete darkness or pick out well
camouflaged targets. It does not provide any positive
DM to hit, but grants DM+4 to Recon checks to spot
concealed targets, locate the source of a shot, and so
forth. They do not allow Travellers to see through walls.

Thermal scopes are usually combined with a standard
scope in a switchable configuration. It costs Cr250 and
weighs 0.25kg.

Combination Scope: At the cost of some bulk a
combination scope offers the benefits of standard, low-
light and thermal scopes. This device costs Cr400 and
weights 0.5kg.

Multispectral Scope: A more advanced version of
the combination scope uses a wider segment of the
electromagnetic spectrum and offers enhanced image
processing to assist target identification. A multispectral
scope offers DM+6 to Recon checks to spot targets and
DM+1 to attack rolls at all ranges, in addition to the
Scope trait. It costs Cr600 and weighs 0.5kg.

Laser Pointer: A laser pointer grants DM+1 to attack rolls
at ranges out to 50m. Despite some slight bulk and a
typical weight of 0.1kg, it does not affect Quickdraw
when in use. A laser pointer costs Cr200.

Integrated Sighting System: An integrated sighting
system (ISS) takes information on sensors mounted
on a weapon and projects them on to goggles or a
visor. The output can be adjusted by the user to a
range of preferences, or can auto-regulate in order to
penetrate smoke, see in the dark, and filter out bright
flashes whilst operating in low-light mode. An ISS
costs Cr500 for a set of sensors on the weapon and a
display device, and offers all benefits of a multispectral
scope even when the weapon is being hip-fired. Typical
weight is 0.4kg.

Holographic Sights: A holographic sight replaces physical
optics, using a sensor on the barrel of the weapon and
displaying what is effectively a holographic scope, aim
point or other sighting device. Mode and magnification
are usually controlled by pre-set buttons, sliders or

vernier dials in a convenient location on the weapon. A
holographic sight can also take data from other sources
in the same manner as an ISS. The device costs Cr750
but is of negligible weight.

OTHER ACCESSORIES
A variety of miscellaneous accessories are available for
most weapons. Some are more useful than others.

**Bayonet Lug:** Military longarms are assumed to have a
bayonet attachment as standard, but it is possible to
convert any pistol, shotgun, carbine or rifle weapon
to carry a bayonet. Most such conversions are clumsy
and difficult to shoot or fight with, however. A bayonet
lug, whether improvised in a workshop or fitted to the
weapon, adds no weight and is of negligible cost. Once
the bayonet is fitted it imposes DM-2 to Quickdraw
unless the attack is being made with the bayonet itself.

**Bling:** Weapons can be decorated, gilded or festooned
with fairy lights if the user really wants. Some owners
may wish to impress or intimidate with their weapons;
others just like to show off. Professional mercenaries
generally prefer to camouflage any weapon they take
into the field, though there is perhaps some value in
a gold-plated autopistol used to intimidate potential
hostiles. Any amount of bling can be added, though
objects swinging about on little chains dangling from
a weapon will make accurate shooting difficult and
a shiny or brightly coloured weapon may give away a
position. The referee should let Travellers spend as
much as they like on bling, but it will cause problems
in the field – not least of which is the ridicule of more
professional soldiers.

**Flashlight:** A high-powered flashlight can be fitted under
the barrel of most weapons. Cost is typically Cr50 for a
sturdy example with good battery life. A flashlight adds
front-end weight and reduces Quickdraw by -2.

**Gravitic Support:** From TL12 upwards, gravitic support
is available. This reduces a Very Bulky weapon to Bulky
and eliminates the Bulky trait entirely. A gravitic support
unit weighs 3x the weight of the weapon's receiver when
switched off, but effectively eliminates the weapon's
weight when activated. Gravitic support costs Cr2500
per kg of the weapon.

**Gun Camera:** From TL6 upwards a small camera can be
fitted to a longarm or assault weapon, with examples
small enough to fit on almost any weapon available from
TL8. TL6-7 cameras can be a little bulky and reduce
Quickdraw by -2. TL8+ examples may be integrated with
sights or kept separate, often carried on a rail under the
barrel. These are light enough not to affect Quickdraw.
All versions cost Cr75.

Intelligent Weapon: At TL11, a small processor located
somewhere in the weapon effectively adds a Computer/0
for a cost of Cr1000. At TL13, Computer/1 is available
for Cr5000.

Secure Weapon: Available from TL10 upwards, a
secure weapon requires some form of authentication
before it will function. This may be a DNA check, radio
signal, voice command or almost any other form of
authorization. Adding a security check costs Cr100 and
does not add any weight.

Stabilization: From TL9 upward, weapons can be
gyrostabilized. A gyrostabilizer weighs 20% of
the weapon's receiver weight and costs Cr300. A
gyrostabilizer offsets an aiming DM up to -2 caused by
movement or a poorly balanced weapon. This means
it is possible to conduct aimed fire whilst moving,
though only at a steady, careful pace. If a weapon is
Bulky or Very Bulky due to recoil (not actual weight or
bulk), a gyrostabilizer reduces Very Bulky to Bulky and
eliminates the Bulky trait entirely.

Example: Personal Defence Weapon
Personal Defence Weapons (PDWs) vary in design but
are similar in function. A PDW is typically a compact
high-firepower weapon intended to give advantages
over a handgun in emergency self-defence situations.
Some are essentially overgrown handguns, some
are small submachineguns and others use entirely
different concepts. A shortened, stockless combat
shotgun can fulfil the PDW role quite well – it is
quick into action, hits hard and is easy to carry, but
suffers from a small ammunition supply. These are all
characteristics of a typical PDW no matter how the
design requirements are met.

A mercenary unit decides to create a custom-designed
PDW to be carried by its support gunners, vehicle crews
and other personnel whose role is not direct short-range
combat with the enemy. The unit chooses 7.65x21mm
ammunition, a common light-pistol calibre, to base the
weapon around. The receiver chosen is an Assault type.
These initial choices create a weapon with a mass of
1kg, modified to 0.75 kg because the weapon uses light
handgun ammunition and has a fully-automatic receiver.
Base damage is 2D. The designer decides this will be a
fully-automatic weapon, pushing the cost up from Cr200
to Cr240 and granting Auto 3.

Base ammunition capacity for an Assault weapon is
20 rounds, increased to 24 by use of light handgun
ammunition. However, when the designer begins
choosing features for the weapon this may be altered.
The Travellers decide they want a compact weapon,
which adds 25% to the cost and reduces mass by 10%.

This reduces ammunition capacity by 20% of the new
total of 24, or 4.8 rounds. Rounded to 5, ammunition
capacity is now 19 rounds.

The Travellers then decide to reduce ammunition
capacity by 30%, down from 19 to 13, since there
are commercially available light handgun magazines
available in this sizing. Each 10% reduction in
ammunition capacity reduces loaded weight by 5% and
reduces the weapon's cost by 5%. The Travellers want
a higher Auto trait for their PDW, selecting an increase
from 3 to 4. This adds 10% cost and 5% weight.

They now have a receiver for their weapon. Its raw
cost is Cr420.75 and weight is 0.6425kg. With the
referee's approval these values are rounded off to
Cr420 and 0.64kg. This is the core mechanism of
the new weapon, ready to be fitted with a barrel and
any furniture or accessories the Travellers want. They
envisage this weapon as being carried in a hip holster,
so no stock is to be fitted. It does need a barrel, and a
Handgun type is chosen. A Handgun barrel costs 15%
of the receiver price and weighs 20% as much. These
values are calculated and added into the worksheet.
Using a Handgun barrel brings effective range down
from 40m – the nominal performance of light handgun
ammunition – to 8m. On the plus side, the PDW starts
with Quickdraw 2, which is increased to 6 by the use
of a Handgun barrel.

Since the Travellers do not want to add bells and
whistles, they stop there. Cost is Cr483, rounded to
Cr485, and weight is 0.668kg, rounded to 0.67kg.

The Travellers evaluate their weapon. It is comparable
in price to a standard submachinegun but much lighter
and can be carried in a hip holster. It is quick into
action, with Quickdraw 6 for its configuration, and has a
very high rate of fire. This makes it ideal for emergency
self-defence situations, and 13-round light handgun
magazines are easily available on the open market.
The Travellers are satisfied with the weapon despite its
limitations and decide to work out its final values.

Normally a magazine would cost 1% of the weapon's
price, but since this weapon uses commercially
available magazines for small handguns the cost of
an empty magazine is based on 1% of the price of
such a weapon plus 13 rounds of small handgun
ammunition. This gives a rough cost of about Cr9 per
loaded magazine if bought over the counter, but the
mercenaries will probably buy crates of magazines
and tons of ammunition at a much lower price. The
Travellers decide they want an extended magazine just

in case it is useful. This will cost Cr9 plus the price of
its 18 rounds of ammunition, or roughly Cr20 loaded
and ready to go.

The weapon's short barrel means it has a low muzzle
velocity, which has already been considered in regard
to effective range. It also affects penetration, giving the
weapon Penetration -1. Consulting the Final Penetration
table on page 18, this indicates the weapon has the
Lo-Pen (2) trait – any armor it encounters is treated as
doubled in value.

The Travellers decide this handgun-sized weapon will be
issued with one standard magazine in place (included
in the weapon's weight) and a spare plus two extended
magazines (18 rounds each), all on a standardised rig.
The whole thing comes in at under 1.5kg and does not
get in the way when operating a vehicle, yet delivers
a lot of firepower to deter pursuit or cover a dash to a
rescue vehicle.

Full Dice of Damage
Some effects are based on the number of 'full
dice of damage' done by the weapon. This has
nothing to do with any modified applied to the
damage; it is based purely on the number of
dice. In many cases, an effect might specify
a number of full dice, such as 'for every two
full dice of damage'. In this case, a weapon
that does 3D-3 damage or one that does 3D+3
are treated the same – they both have three
full dice of damage. If this weapon gains the
AP trait at a level of one per two full dice
of damage, it would gain AP 1. A Weapon
doing 4D-2 would gain AP 2. At the referee's
discretion, a modifier of -4 or +4, or greater,
can be treated as an extra full dice of damage.

SPECIAL

AMMUNITION
As noted elsewhere, most weapons use 'ball'
ammunition; simple inert projectiles which deliver
damage to the target by means of kinetic energy. If the
projectile is altered but the cartridge dimensions are kept
the same, different types of ammunition can be created
which can fulfil specialist functions.

Armor-Piercing (TL4): Armor-piercing ammunition is
designed to penetrate hard surfaces, typically using
a more powerful cartridge and different projectile
configuration. Projectiles are made from harder
materials and shaped to penetrate, at the cost of
reducing damage. This is largely because an AP round
causes a narrower wound track and is likely to over-
penetrate – a standard round may stop in the target,
delivering all its kinetic energy, whilst a round that
over-penetrates takes some of its energy away with it.
Armor-piercing ammunition increases Penetration by
+1. It costs twice the price of ball.

Armor-Piercing, Advanced (TL7): Advanced armor-
piercing ammunition typically uses a subcalibre
projectile mounted in a sabot which is discarded early
in flight. Other ways of achieving the same effect are
possible, but the result is a highly penetrative round
which can defeat most forms of armor. Advanced
armor-piercing ammunition increases Penetration
by +2. It costs four times as much as ball and is not
available for relatively low-velocity weapons such as
handguns and smoothbores.

Distraction (TL5): Distraction rounds use noise and light –
usually both – to startle anyone nearby, scare off animals
or draw attention to the exploding round. This can be
useful as a signal or to attract the attention of potential
rescuers, or can be used by security personnel to let
intruders know beyond any doubt they have been spotted.
If used as a distraction, such as by being fired into a
room as an entry team bursts in, a distraction round will
force everyone within to make an END check or be unable
to react. See page 23 for more information. Distraction
rounds cost four times the price of ball ammunition.

Enhanced Wounding (TL5): Enhanced wounding
ammunition is designed to mushroom, break up or
expand after striking flesh, creating a wider wound track
and ensuring the round dumps all of its energy into the
target. The trade-off for this is reduced penetration.
Enhanced wounding ammunition is banned in many
regions. It reduces Penetration by -2 and increases
Damage by +2 per dice. These rounds cost twice as
much as ball.

Explosive (TL6): This ammunition is typically intended
for anti-materiel work, though it can be highly effective
against personnel targets. Explosive ammunition for
small arms does not produce a massive blast, but can
rip apart communications equipment and similar lightly
constructed systems where a conventional bullet might
well pass right through leaving the device functional.
Explosive rounds cost six times as much as ball. They
reduce Penetration by -1 whilst adding Damage +1D plus
an additional +1D per 3 full dice. Explosive ammunition
increases Physical Signature by one level. Explosive
ammunition for small arms does not grant the Blast trait.

Flechette (TL7): Flechette ammunition uses a bundle
of small, lightweight plastic flakes instead of a single
projectile. It is intended for use against vermin, and has
a very short effective range as a result. The wide and
rapid spread of the flakes grants the Spread trait plus an
additional DM+4 on checks attack rolls out to 5m, but
the weapon's Range is reduced to 10m. All Damage dice
are reduced to D3s, and any D3s are reduced to a single
point of Damage. Flechette ammunition costs the same
as ball.

Gas (TL7): Gas rounds are used in some security weapons.
The round itself does Damage 1D, and is designed to
shatter into volatile fragments upon striking any solid
surface. One gas round from a shotgun or handgun is
sufficient to fill a 3x3x3m volume with a low concentration
of gas. Usually this is a tear gas or sedative type. Gas
rounds cost 6 times as much as ball ammunition.

**High Explosive Armor-Piercing (TL8):** High Explosive
Armor-Piercing (HEAP) rounds are used in relatively
larger-calibre weapons to create a penetration capability
even if muzzle velocity is low. HEAP rounds are not
very effective in small-calibre weapons as they require
a certain diameter to create a shaped-charge effect.
However, by using volatile squash-on-impact materials
a small plasma jet is formed which can punch a hole in
light armor. HEAP rounds are only available for weapons
of 10mm calibre and above. They cost ten times
the price of ball ammunition and increases Physical
Signature by one level. HEAP ammunition increases
Penetration by +2.

**Incendiary (TL6):** Incendiary ammunition is designed
to set targets on fire. It is primarily intended to cause
materiel damage but can have horrific effects on
personnel. Incendiary ammunition costs 6 times the
price of ball and gives the weapon the Incendiary trait.
An incendiary round that penetrates armor delivers
half as much damage as got through armor again the
following round, with the armor offering no protection.

**Low-Penetration (TL6):** Low-penetration ammunition uses
a deliberately weak propellant charge and a projectile
design that reduces the penetration of the weapon. This
is primarily useful in security weapons for use inside
installations and spacecraft, but may be used to create
a less-lethal response to low-threat situations. Low-
penetration ammunition normally reduces Penetration
by -1 but can be any value from -1 to -4. In addition
to the effects of the weapon's final Penetration, low-
penetration ammunition converts each dice of damage to
D3. D3s are converted to single points. Low-penetration
ammunition costs the same as ball.

**Pellet (TL3):** Pellet ammunition is typically used in
smoothbore weapons. Its primary advantage is the spread
of pellets, which makes a hit at close range likely. Pellet
ammunition gives the weapon the Spread trait. Damage
is the same whether using ball or pellet, but pellets
reduce Penetration by the weapon's Spread score. They
also increase the chance of a knockdown (see page 22).
Pellet ammunition costs the same as ball.

**Smart (TL10):** Although commonly called 'smart', this
ammunition is more correctly designated 'limited-
guidance'. It is only useful with a weapon mounting a
gun computer as no person can react quickly enough to
keep a bullet on target. The user can choose whether to
lock in a particular target then shoot, or to have the gun
computer assess the situation at the instant of firing and
make an assumption about what the target is to be. Either
way. once the projectile is in flight it deploys small fins

for guidance and attempts to correct he aim point using
signals from the weapon. This is of little use at ranges
under 100m as the projectile does not have time to make
meaningful course corrections, but at greater ranges
DM+1 is gained for guidance from an Intelligent weapon.
This increases to DM+2 for TL13+ intelligent weapons.
Smart ammunition costs six times as much as ball. If
the guidance capability is combined with another special
ammunition type, the two costs are added together. Thus
smart enhanced-wounding ammunition would cost 6
times the cost of ball plus 2 times the cost of ball, for a
total of 8 times the cost of conventional ammunition.

GRENADES, WARHEADS

AND EXPLOSIVES
The 'dangerous bit' of a missile or grenade is its payload,
and as a general rule payloads tend to be produced in
standard sizes. Most warheads do one of two things; either
they explode or they produce gas, smoke and similar cloud
effects. The latter is often achieved through a burning
process. How great the effect of a given warhead is
depends largely upon its size. Grenades, warheads and the
like are grouped together here for convenience.

The configuration of the weapon dictates the uses it can
be put to. However, a warhead can usually be removed
from one delivery system and converted to fit another or
to create an improvised explosive device. In other cases,
explosives are available in a form that allows them to be
tailored to the need at hand. Explosive charges can be
emplaced for a variety of purposes. This becomes possible
as soon as explosives are available, though low-tech
charges are generally inefficient in terms both of reliable
detonation and the effects of an explosion.

Hand grenades of a recognizably modern type become
available at TL4. Payloads configured as simple hand
grenades are bought at the base payload cost. At TL9,
advanced fusing becomes available, which allows the
grenade to be set for impact detonation, remote detonation
using a suitable communications device, proximity/
vibration detonation after a set arming time, or a variable
time delay. This permits a hand grenade to be set up
as a mine or booby trap without additional preparation.
Advanced fusing adds 25% to the cost of the weapon but
does not affect weight. Mini-grenades become available
two Tech Levels after the standard grenade of the type and
are usually hand-thrown. Cost for a hand grenade or mini-
hand grenade is simply that of the payload (see page 54)
unless advanced fusing or some other feature is desired.
Hand grenades can be thrown 20m, and have a Range of
100m from a cup discharger.

Rifle grenades become available at TL5. They typically use
the same warhead as a hand grenade of the type, costing
twice as much and weighing 50% more than a hand
grenade. Most rifle grenades are fitted to the muzzle of a
rifle and launched by firing it, which obviously prevents the
rifle from being used normally until the grenade is removed
or launched. Attaching or removing a grenade is a minor
action. Specialist rifle grenade launchers are available,
though uncommon. Cup-type launchers are rarely used
after TL5, but when they are they launch standard hand
grenades rather than rifle grenades. Rifle grenades have a
base Range of 100m.

At TL6 cartridge grenades, also referred to as launcher
grenades or launched grenades, become available. The
warhead can be any standard grenade or mini-grenade
type. The weapon as a whole is constructed as an all-in-
one unit much like a cartridge for a projectile weapon.
Cartridge grenades require a tube-type launcher and can be
fed from a belt or magazine. A cartridge grenade that hits
without detonating will do Damage 2D. Cartridge grenades
cost 2.5 times the payload price, plus the cost of any
additional features. Weight is the same as a hand-thrown
grenade and base Range is 200m.

Rocket-Assisted Multipurpose (RAM) grenades become
available from TL8. These are essentially an advanced
form of the cartridge grenade, with greater range and
accuracy. Some RAM grenades are configured to receive
basic guidance, typically from a laser designator. A RAM
grenade that hits without detonating will do Damage 2D.
RAM grenades cost three times the payload price, plus any
additional features. Weight is the same as a hand-thrown
grenade. RAM grenades have a base Range of 300m.

From TL5, Rocket-Propelled Grenades (RPG) become
available. These are rather basic unguided rocket weapons
which are almost always impact-fused and deliver a much
larger warhead than a hand, rifle or cartridge grenade.
An RPG requires a dedicated launch device, often a
tube but sometimes a spigot mortar. Rocket-propelled
grenades, whether configured as rifle grenades or used
with a launcher, cost five times the payload price and may
occasionally have additional features. Weight is usually
around five times that of a hand-thrown grenade. Rocket-
propelled grenades have a base Range of 500m. Unguided
RPGs have the Inaccurate trait, usually at -1 or -2.

In archaic terminology, an emplaced charge might be
known as a 'torpedo', though that term has changed
considerably in its meaning. Today, a charge placed as
a trap is normally termed a mine if of a pre-packaged
type, and an improvised explosive (or incendiary) device
if assembled using explosives and locally available
materials. Ground mines become available at TL5, and
are designed to lie more or less flat on the ground, though
some advanced variants can be stuck to a suitable non-
horizontal surface. Ground mines are usually designed
to attack vehicles from underneath or to throw a small
anti-personnel device up to a pre-set height where it
detonates. They present an all-round threat. Directional
mines, available from TL6, is designed to fling numerous
small projectiles in a cone from its 'hostile' face, with the
area behind its 'friendly' face theoretically safe. Directional
mines are usually anti-personnel devices but some
inventive ideas have been marketed at times.

Unless otherwise stated, a cartridge or rifle grenade will be
in the 35-45mm range and have a warhead equivalent to
a standard hand grenade of the type. RAM grenades are
also equivalent in effect but have additional propellant to
increase both range and accuracy. Light cartridge grenades
are typically in the 22-34mm range and equivalent in
effect to a light hand grenade.

Payloads
Aerosol, Antilaser: Aerosol grenades fill the air with a
fine mist of semi-reflective particles, scattering and
dissipating laser pulses and making visual targeting more
difficult. Laser attacks, communications or designation
into or through an aerosol cloud are impossible. Optical
targeting suffers DM-2. An aerosol cloud dissipates after
1Dx3 rounds, or D3x3 rounds for cloud produced by a
mini-grenade.

Aerosol, Corrosive: Corrosive aerosol grenades fill an area
roughly 3x3x3m with a corrosive gas cloud. This delivers
3D damage in the first round and is Corrosive. The cloud is
semi-opaque, reducing the damage done by laser weapons
fired into or through it by 1D. Corrosive warheads are not
available for mini-grenades.

Anti-Armor: Anti-armor grenades are typically impact-
fused, with a shaped-charge warhead designed to create
a jet of superheated gas which can cut through armor.
Anti-armor warheads are not available as mini-grenades,
but a hand grenade type using a streamer to ensure the
weapon strikes warhead-first is used by some low-tech
forces. It poses a modest threat to armored vehicles of
the era and can occasionally put battle dress out of action.
Hand-thrown anti-armor grenades suffer DM-2 to attack
rolls, and all grenades of this type have a small blast radius
compared to area-effect types. Damage is 4D, with AP 8.

Baton: Baton rounds, otherwise known as 'rubber bullets',
are designed to cause shock, knockdown and possibly a
stunning effect without being lethal. They are normally
available as cartridge grenades only, though in theory the
payload could be flung at someone's head. Small-calibre
baton rounds, when used as a cartridge grenade payload,
are treated as mini-grenades. Full-calibre rounds are
treated as standard grenades. At lower Tech Levels, instead
of a solid impactor a bag of lead shot is used. The effect
is similar. Small baton rounds cause 1D Stun damage;
standard baton rounds deliver 2D damage. Damage
delivered is considered to be tripled when determining if
a knockdown has occurred, but baton rounds are entirely
ineffective against rigid armor.

Battlechem: Battlechem payloads are banned by many
treaties but still see use at times. Configurations vary
but the delivery system usually takes the form of a cloud
of sticky particles sufficient to fill a 3x3x3m volume.

Battlechem is an irritant, with similar effects to an
incapacitant payload. In addition it is mildly caustic,
causing Damage 1D if it touches bare skin and Damage
3D if inhaled. These effects are repeated every round of
contact, and for D3 rounds thereafter. Battlechem also has
a tendency to clog up filters in breathing equipment. There
is no effect on a completely sealed air system like a vacc
suit but gas masks and the like will be choked, making
breathing difficult, after 1D rounds of contact with the
Battlechem cloud. A clogged respirator forces the user to
make a Difficult (10+) END check each round and imposes
any negative Effect on all actions taken until the filter is
cleaned or replaced.

Breacher: Breacher charges are not intended for use as
grenades against personnel targets, but can be harmful in
a small radius. They are designed to be slapped against a
door or wall, and use a tandem shaped-charge to crack and
shatter the area they are in contact with. Cartridge or RPG
type breachers can be fired at the target structure from a
distance. A typical internal partition wall in a starship has
Protection +6 and Structure 20; this much damage will
put a fist-sized hole through it. Materials such as concrete
will crumble if breached; generally three well-placed
breaches will be sufficient to collapse a section large
enough to duck through. Metal partitions and bulkheads
do not collapse in this way. D3+3 breaches are needed
to weaken a section so that it can be kicked out. An
accurately placed attack on a door or hatch can be used to
destroy the hinges and/or locking mechanism and allow it
to be pushed off its mounts.

Corrosive: Corrosive grenades contain a sticky gob of
corrosive material with a small bursting charge. When
the grenade detonates it flings small fragments around
within the burst radius. Each does 2D corrosive Damage
and is treated as a Weak area fire attack (see page 14).
Cartridge and RPG type corrosive grenades are more
commonly used to attack armored targets. If they hit, a
large gobbet of material is stuck to the victim, delivering
4D corrosive Damage. Corrosive payloads are not available
for mini-grenades.

Cryogenic: Cryogenic grenades are rare and difficult
to manufacture. Their effect is produced by a hugely
endothermic reaction between two chemicals, drawing
in heat from the immediate surroundings. Cryogenic
grenades are useful in firefighting but have some combat
applications. Damage against personnel is 5D. Mini-
grenades are not available.

Distraction: Distraction grenades create a loud noise and/or
a bright flash intended to confuse or disorient opponents.
A standard Distraction grenade is treated as an Average
Distraction (see page 23).

**Electromagnetic Pulse:** Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)
grenades are designed to disrupt electronics. Upon
detonation the device produces a pulse with an intensity
equal to its Tech Level. At TL12 an advanced EMP grenade
becomes available, which is more expensive but produces
a significantly more powerful pulse.

**Fire Suppression:** Fire suppression grenades are not
intended for combat, but are found in many installations
and aboard some starships. Their bursting charge is
distributed throughout their payload, and is too small to
cause any real harm. It is sufficient to count as a small
distraction device (see page 23) if used in this manner,
and will create a roughly 3x3x3m cloud of powder with a
high heat capacity. The effect of this is to smother flames
by depriving them of oxygen whilst at the same time
absorbing much of the heat that fuels the fire. The cloud
takes D3 rounds to settle, during which time it obscures
vision and interferes with weapons such as lasers, imposing
DM-2 on tasks or shots through the cloud. Anyone in
the cloud without eye and respiratory protection suffers
Damage 1D per round.

**Fragmentation:** Fragmentation grenades contain a small
bursting charge which hurls fragments of the casing and
often packing materials such as notched wire throughout
the burst radius. Performance is generally poor versus
armored targets but unprotected personnel are likely to be
severely injured. A fragmentation grenade is treated as an
Average area fire attack (see page 14). Small fragmentation
grenades deliver 3D damage with a Blast trait of 4.
Standard grenades deliver 5D damage with Blast 9.

**Gas, Incapacitant:** Incapacitant gases include various tear
and vomit gases, as well as disorienting psychoactive
substances. Incapacitant gas payloads are not available
for mini-grenades. A typical grenade will fill a 3x3x3m
area with gas, which will linger for 1Dx3 rounds or less if
there is significant wind. Anyone exposed to the gas must
make an END check each round or be unable to take
coherent action. In the case of psychoactives there may be
additional effects.

**Gas, Toxin:** Toxic gases are illegal, even for use in war, in
many systems. Most gas grenades use immediately lethal
agents such as neurotoxins. A typical grenade will fill a
3x3x3m area with gas, which will linger for 1Dx3 rounds
or less if there is significant wind. Anyone lacking a sealed
protective suit must make an immediate Very Difficult
(12+) END check or be intoxicated. Partial protection
such as a respirator reduces this check to Average (8+),
but the gas can still take effect by skin contact. The check
must be made every round the individual is exposed to the
gas. Once intoxicated, the victim suffers 1D INT damage
every 1D round. This continues for D3 seconds after the
individual is no longer exposed to the gas.

Incendiary, Antipersonnel: Antipersonnel incendiary
grenades typically use substances like white phosphorous,
which burns hotly and flings small fragments around its
area of effect. Incendiary grenades of this type produce
a cloud of white smoke equivalent to a smoke grenade
and may set secondary targets on fire. The grenade does
full damage automatically to anyone within 1m of it,
and is treated as a Weak area fire attack against anyone
within the burst radius. An incendiary antipersonnel
grenade will burn for 1D rounds, after which its smoke
cloud dissipates rapidly. Deliberate use against personnel
targets is outlawed in some systems, but intent can be
difficult to prove.

Incendiary, Demolition: Demolition grenades are not
intended for use against personnel, and not particularly
effective in this role. They contain material which burns
very hot for an extended period, and are typically used
to render equipment useless. A mini-grenade will start a
fire almost anywhere and destroy most light equipment;
a full-sized grenade can melt through a TL8 tank engine
deck and scrap the engine, or wreck the breach of an
artillery piece.

Microgrenade: Microgrenade payloads contain a
small bursting charge and a group of extremely small
fragmentation devices scattered by the explosion. These
produce the effect of a Standard area fire attack within
a 3m radius. Anyone hit suffers 2D damage, though
the fragments perform very poorly against armor.
Microgrenade warheads are not available for mini-grenades.

Multiple Projectile: Multiple projectile warheads are only
available for cartridge grenades, essentially functioning as
a giant shotgun shell. Projectiles are heavier but have a
lower velocity than shotgun pellets. Out to 10m, multiple
projectile grenades do full damage after which it is
halved to the maximum range of 25m, beyond which it is
completely ineffective.

Plasma: A plasma warhead contains chemicals which
combine to create a blast of superheated gas which will
be lethal to most personnel targets within its radius.
The blast is not directional. Creating a useful quantity
of plasma without machinery is difficult and expensive,
requiring specialist materials that must be stored safely
in the grenade yet capable of undergoing their reaction
when required. Poorly made plasma grenades are a serious
danger to all concerned.

Plasma, Anti-Armor: Anti-armor plasma warheads are
only available as cartridge or RPG weapons. The plasma
reaction is contained in a manner that focuses it – more or
less – in one direction. This makes the weapon much more
effective against armor than a standard plasma grenade,
but greatly reduces the area effect. Plasma grenades of

all types have an incendiary effect but do not burn in the
usual sense – they use their fuel instantly but may set fire
to other materials.

Smoke/Thermosmoke: Low-tech smoke grenades are
'burning' types which produce smoke slowly and can set
fire to nearby flammable objects. More advanced smoke
grenades rely on a 'cold' chemical reaction to rapidly
create a cloud of suspended particles. Either way, smoke
completely obscures vision and blocks lasers. A cloud will

thickly fill a 3x3x3m volume and will spread throughout a
wider area. It persists 1Dx3 minutes unless dissipated by
wind. At TL8, thermosmoke grenades produce a 'warm'
cloud, not hot enough to set anything on fire but entirely
sufficient to block thermal sensors.

Stun: Stun grenades use either intense light, noise or both
to incapacitate targets within the burst radius. These
weapons are more powerful than distraction devices and
are not available as mini-grenades.

LAUNCHERS AND

SUPPORT WEAPONS
Many of the support weapons used by infantry can be
constructed in the same manner as personal weaponry.
A general-purpose machinegun is typically of the same
calibre as a battle rifle. With a heavy barrel, fully-
automatic receiver and perhaps a tripod mounting, a
support weapon is created. The converse is also true;
heavier support weapons have been converted into anti-
materiel rifles by adding a stock and stripping away all
unnecessary components. Launchers for grenades or
rockets require a slightly different process, however.

Launchers are constructed one of two ways, depending
on their projectile. Those that launch a rocket-propelled
grenade or missile typically have only one primary
component, the receiver, which is normally assumed
to include the weapon's equivalent of a barrel and
a suitable shoulder stock or similar furniture. They
may have additional components; electronics and the
like can be added as accessories. Cartridge grenade
launchers are different in that they are constructed
like a conventional firearm, with a receiver, barrel and
furniture. Short barrels can be used, but the relatively
low-powered propulsion used in cartridge grenades to
keep recoil manageable makes a weapon with a handgun
length barrel or shorter pointless. The grenade would
not reach sufficient velocity to travel farther than a few
meters before falling to the ground. It may or may not
arm in that distance.

The effectiveness and effects of any kind of launcher
is entirely dependent on the weapon launched from it,
though warheads and payloads are not considered part
of the weapon itself.

Rail and Muzzle Launchers (TL5+): Rocket-propelled
grenades can be launched from a rail mounted on
a weapon. This is purchased as an accessory to the
weapon. Only the cost of the grenade need be paid – see
page 126 for possible payloads. Similarly, rifle grenades
are launched from an adapter on the weapon; only the
grenades need be purchased.

Disposable Launchers (TL6+): A disposable launcher
is typically made from lightweight but watertight
and durable materials, with a simple optical sight.
Disposable launchers use a rocket-propelled grenade
type warhead in a small missile which may or may not
have some form of guidance system. The container/
launcher has negligible cost and adds 0.25kg to the
weapon weight. It is designed to be thrown away after
use and cannot be reloaded.

Tube Launchers (TL6+): A tube launcher can discharge
any kind of cartridge grenade, and those constructed at
TL9 and above can also use RAM grenades. Light tube
launchers are typically made in calibres between 22-
34mm, firing projectiles equivalent in effect to a light
grenade. Standard launchers are typically 35-45mm
in calibre an equivalent to a standard grenade. The
majority of tube launchers are designed as a standard
receiver which can be configured for attachment to a
longarm or as a standalone weapon. Most tube launchers
are single shot weapons, though some magazine-fed
variants do exist. 'Grenade machineguns' require a
support grenade launcher receiver and a suitable mount.

A grenade launcher designed to fit under a rifle does not
require a stock and will normally use an Assault barrel.
There is no additional cost or weight for mountings when
fitting a launcher to a Modularised weapon. Otherwise
fittings for the launcher must be present on the weapon.
Standalone weapons generally use a Rifle barrel and a
Fixed Stock. Semi-automatic grenade launchers may use
a low-capacity detachable magazine but more commonly
use a fixed drum which much be reloaded one round at
a time, at the rate of one minor action per grenade.

Tube Launcher Receivers
Receiver Cost Weight Base Range Base Ammunition Capacity Traits
Single shot, Light Cr200 1.5kg 200m 1 Bulky
Single shot, Standard Cr300 2kg 300m 1 Bulky
Semi-Automatic, Light Cr400 2.5kg 200m 3 Bulky
Semi-Automatic, Standard Cr500 3.5kg 300m 3 Very Bulky
Support, Light Cr2000 10kg 200m Varies —
Support, Standard Cr2000 15kg 300m Varies —

Support grenade launchers are typically belt fed.
The bulk of cartridge grenades makes handling
magazines difficult, though some designs use them.
If a magazine is fitted to any launcher type it adds
0.5kg to the loaded weight of the weapon per grenade
for standard weapons and 0.3kg per grenade for light
grenade launchers.

**Reusable Launchers (TL6+):** Reusable launchers may
be fully reusable or utilise a container/barrel system
for each missile. 'Dumb' launchers are not uncommon
with mid-tech troops, typically in an anti-armor role. A
reusable launcher is purchased as a whole unit, which
is assumed to include furniture and whatever passes
for a barrel on the weapon. If a magazine-fed launcher
is created, each missile or rocket after the first adds its
full weight to the weapon, plus 10%.

Reusable launchers are subdivided into two categories

- light and heavy. Both generate significant 'backblast'
when firing and are dangerous to use in a confined
space. Light launchers are intended to be carried as
an additional piece of a soldier's combat load, though
they are rather weighty, whilst heavy launchers are the
primary weapon of a soldier or small team. Additional
ammunition is usually distributed among the unit.

A field launcher is not an infantry weapon but can be
deployed by a squad to provide heavy fire support. The
weapon includes a base plate and slewing mechanism.
Such weapons typically have 2 or 4 tubes, which
must be manually reloaded after launch. Costs are for
a 'dumb' launcher with basic manual controls. More
advanced missile guidance will push up the overall
cost of the unit – munitions costs and weights are not
included but the weight of a full set of missiles is.

Designing Missile Launchers
When designing most weapons, the 'loaded weight'
is calculated assuming a normal magazine or feed
device in place. This is for convenience and close
enough for small arms. When designing a missile
launcher or similar weapon using heavy munitions,
the weight of a full load of missiles must be added
to the base weight of the weapon system.

ENERGY WEAPONS
Most energy weapons have similar components to
slugthrowers; receiver, barrel, furniture and accessories.
The advanced technology required to build high-energy
weapons makes some combinations impractical, and
some energy weapons are constructed very differently to a
conventional firearm.

Projectors
Projectors are considered energy weapons for most
purposes. They damage a target by projecting a substance
which causes a change in the local energy level. In most
cases this is a flammable substance, which when ignited
damages the target by extreme heat and also consumes
available oxygen. Cryogenic projectors work the opposite
way, by coating the target in a substance that absorbs
energy. Both can be lethal against personnel but flame
weapons are more commonly used as combat assets.
Cryogenic projectors are rarely encountered, but do have
specialist uses. Some materials will become brittle when
frozen, enabling entry to a secured area, and the function
of devices and explosives may be slowed.

Projectors do not always resemble conventional firearms.
They consist of a device for guiding the projection,
containers for the substance to be projected, some
means of projecting it, and whatever frame and tubes
are required to make it all fit together. This is typically
inert gas under high compression. Projectors thus have
three key components.

Structure: The body of the weapon includes the nozzle
and some means of holding and directing it.
Propulsion: As technology advances it becomes possible
to compress propellant gases ever further, allowing more
shots for the same volume of propellant or reduced size.
Some projectors use chemicals which, when mixed in
small quantities, create a propellant gas.
Fuel: Whilst some projectors do not project a burning
fuel, all projectors use the term for convenience. In
some cases the 'fuel' may be generated by a chemical
reaction inside the fuel container, and this may
sometimes be combined with generation of propellant.

Projectors have the Hazardous trait, typically at -6.

If directly targeted a projector may be punctured and begin
to leak. See page 22 for details of the Mishap Threshold.

A projector can in theory have any amount of propellant
and fuel in its tanks. However, there are practical
limitations to how much bulk can be carried without
making the weapon unmanageable. This is given in
kilograms of payload, which is the total of fuel and
propellant combined. It is possible to use oversized
tanks, but the user suffers DM-2 on all physical tasks
for each additional multiple of the maximum load. Thus
a soldier armed with a huge flamethrower with 30kg of
fuel would suffer the penalty since the normal maximum
for a backpack-type flame weapon is 20kg.

Range is different with projectors than projectile
weapons; the effective range of a weapon is determined
by its propellant. The projected substance will travel
twice as far as this but in a distinctly random manner
suitable only for setting an area on fire or denying it to
the enemy.

Projector Combat
Projectors are not precise weapons and cannot be
used to attack just one target unless there is no-one
else nearby. Projectors have the Blast trait at a level
determined by their type. All targets within that area
are subjected to an area fire attack. At up to half the
projector's effective range this is treated as Intense. Out
to its full effective range it is a Typical area fire attack
and at up to the weapon's extreme range the area fire is
treated as Weak.

Projector Structure
There are only so many ways to build a projector, though
examples may differ somewhat depending on what
species they are made for or whether they are to be worn
as a pack or carried in hand. Projector structures come
in three general types, which determine the general
characteristics of the weapon and amount of propellant
and fuel that can be carried without making the weapon
unmanageable. When calculating the cost and weight
of a projector frame, the designer must decide what its
combined fuel/propellant capacity is to be and use these
values to calculate the equivalent of a receiver cost.

Large: A large projector is normally configured as a set
of tanks to be worn on the back or as a support weapon
to be mounted on a vehicle or trolley, and a hand-held
wand to direct the attack. A large projector can carry a
maximum of 20kg of payload without being unwieldy. Its
frame and mechanical parts weigh 30% of its payload
maximum and cost Cr50 per kilogram of the weapon's
total weight. Due to the relative lightness and mobility
of the wand a large projector has Quickdraw 2, but most
users would not want to be in a situation where that
mattered. Large projectors are Blast 3.

Compact: A compact projector is entirely hand-held, in
the manner of a rifle. A compact projector can contain
a maximum of 10kg of payload without being unwieldy
and weighs 20% of its combined payload weight,
costing Cr100 per kg of the weapon overall. Quickdraw
is 0. Compact projectors are Blast 2.

Hand: A hand projector can be very small, like the nozzle
of a hand-held fire extinguisher, but projector weapons
generally have a short tube to keep the payload away
from the user. A hand projector has a maximum payload
of 2kg and weighs 10% of the total payload weight. It
costs Cr25 per kg of the weapon overall. Hand projectors
have Quickdraw +2, halve the effective range of the
weapon, and are Blast 1.

Propellant
Propellant determines the effective range of the weapon
and sometimes certain other characteristics. Propellant
is measured in terms of the amount of attacks that can
be made using 1kg of propellant. Partial amounts are
always possible.

Compressed Gas (TL4): Compressed gas becomes
available at late TL4, making flame weapons and similar
projectors possible. Compressed gas gives 4 attacks
per kg, and imparts an effective range of 20m to the
weapon. Compressed gas costs Cr100 per kg.

**Projector Types**

Type Weight Maximum Weight Cost Blast
Large 30% of payload 20kg Cr50 per kg of total weight 3
Compact 20% of payload 10kg Cr100 per kg of total weight 2
Hand 10% of payload 2kg Cr25 per kg 1

**Supercompressed Gas (TL7):** Supercompressed gas

increasing effective range to 25m. Supercompressed gas
costs Cr250 per kg.

**Generated Gas (TL9):** Generated gas becomes available at
TL9. Using a rapid chemical reaction between 'tablets' of
chemicals a high-pressure gas is created almost instantly.
Generated gas gives 10 attacks per kg and increases
effective range to 30m. Generated gas machinery costs
Cr500 per kg. The reagents cost Cr200 per kg.

Combining Fuel and Propellant
In some cases propellant and fuel are the same
thing. The mechanics of creating a projector
weapon require that both capabilities be paid for
and a suitable weight assigned for both. In-game
effects may be cinematically different but the
rules are identical.

**Fuel**
The effects of a projector are determined by the nature
of its fuel. In some cases a projector can be used
for more than one purpose, such as a flamethrower
converted to spray an irritant chemical. For flame
weapons an ignition mechanism is necessary and it is
usually possible to choose whether the fuel is ignited
at the nozzle or sprayed on the target then ignited by
some other means such as an incendiary grenade.
1kg of fuel is sufficient to make one attack with any
projector weapon. It can be assumed that 'fuel' refers
to everything needed to cause fire, which may include
an oxidising agent for weapons intended to be used in
oxygen-poor atmospheres.

Liquid Fuel (TL4): Liquid fuel is technically available
at any Tech Level so long as a flammable liquid can
be produced or obtained. It becomes usable in flame
weapons at TL4 but is not very effective. Liquid fuel
does Damage 3D and costs Cr25 per kg. It is Incendiary
and Burn 1.

Jellied Fuel (TL5): Jellied fuel sticks to the target rather
than running off, causing a more intense and longer
burn. Jellied fuel does Damage 4D and costs Cr75 per
kg. It is Incendiary and Burn D3+1.

Irritant (TL6): Irritant projectors throw a liquid with
properties similar to tear gas. This may be volatile,
quickly forming a cloud of gas. The payload has the
effects of an Incapacitant (see page 55). Irritants can be
improvised from readily available chemicals and water at
no cost, or bought for Cr25 per kg. A volatile irritant that
also produces the effect of an Incapacitant gas grenade
costs Cr60 per kg.

Suppressant (TL6): Suppressant fuel has a high heat
capacity and is stored in a manner that keeps it very
cold. Liquid carbon dioxide is common. Suppressant
projectors are used in firefighting but have some
combat applications. An attack with a suppressant
projector delivers Damage 2D. Effective range is halved.
Suppressant costs Cr25 per kg.

Battlechem (TL8): A Battlechem projector flings a glob
of thoroughly unpleasant semi-liquid at a distant target,
where it scatters on impact to create a toxic cloud.
Battlechem is banned in most systems but if available
costs Cr300 per kg.

Advanced Fuel (TL9) : Advanced fuel burns hotter and
sticks better than its predecessors. Advanced fuel does
Damage 5D and costs Cr150 per kg. It is Incendiary and
Burn (D3+1).

Cryogenic Fluid (TL10): Cryogenic fluid makes objects
brittle and inflicts damage on unprotected targets.
Against sealed armor such as a vacc suit or battle dress
it may render the target immobile. The target must make
an Average (8+) STR check or be unable to move their
limbs for 1D rounds. Cryogenic fluid costs Cr100 per kg
and delivers Damage 4D to unprotected targets.

DIRECTED ENERGY

WEAPONS
Energy weapons, sometimes referred to as 'directed
energy weapons', project a beam or pulse of energy. To
be effective as a weapon this must be tightly collimated.
Even so, the beam will spread out and lose its effect.
This happens more quickly the denser the atmosphere
between firer and target, as the beam or pulse interacts
with gas molecules along the way. Energy weapons can
often be located by the trail of ionized air they create,
which may produce sound, flash or scintillations.

At close range, the primary difference between energy
and projectile weapons is the lack of recoil, which
makes them ideal for low-gravity work. Since the energy
pulse travels at lightspeed and is not affected to any
significant degree by gravity, shooting at longer ranges
requires a different aiming technique. It is not necessary
to lead a moving target or compensate for bullet drop
with a laser or other energy weapon.

By far the most common energy weapons are lasers,
which rely on a tightly focused beam or pulse to deliver
energy to the target. Lasers dump all their energy into
the first object the pulse encounters, which makes them
a poor choice for situations where there may be a need
to penetrate cover or thick foliage. On the other hand, a
laser can be used to burn through materials that would
resist multiple bullet impacts. Microwave guns are

occasionally encountered, functionally similar to lasers
but using guided electromagnetic waves rather than
intense light to deliver energy to the target.

When creating an energy weapon the same three primary
components are used as with firearms – receiver, barrel
and stock. The barrel is a collimator or wave-guide rather
than a hollow tube but its length affects the function
of the weapon in the same way as a conventional
firearm. Instead of ammunition, energy weapons require
power. This can be stored in a powerpack or generated
almost instantly by a disposable chemical cartridge.
Preferences vary; powerpacks can be heavy but allow a
lot more shots than a magazine of disposable cartridges,
and can be recharged.

Powerpacks
When designing a laser or other energy weapon, it is
necessary to specify the nature of the powerpack and
whether it is integral to the weapon or connected to
it by a cable. This should be done before the weapon
itself is designed, as powerpack types impose some
limitations. There are no 'calibres' of energy weapon as
such, since the output depends on how much power is
available and the beam or pulse generating machinery.
However, the power source has to be capable of
delivering sufficient energy and the weapon must be
able to handle it. For this reason energy weapons are
rated by their power output, which in turn determines
the amount of shots that can be fired from a weapon
using a given powerpack.

Weak energy weapons have an output of Damage 2D
or less.
Light energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 3D, plus modifiers.
Standard energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 5D, plus modifiers.
Heavy energy weapons have a maximum output of
Damage 8D, plus modifiers.

A shot from an energy weapon draws as many Power
points as it delivers dice of damage.

A powerpack can withstand the power draw of its own
rating or lower without being overloaded. Only enough
energy for the shot being fired is drawn – a Standard
powerpack in use with a Light weapon is drained of 2
points of energy per shot, for example. A powerpack that
suffers an excessive energy draw gains the Unreliable
trait at a level equal to the difference between its
normal maximum damage output and the damage
output of the weapon. Thus if the Travellers connect
a Light powerpack to their heavy support laser, the
weapon gains the Unreliable trait at a level determined
by the difference between the weapon's damage
output – in this case 7D – and the maximum the Light
pack can safely handle. This is 3D, so the weapon
gains Unreliable 4. Most of the time this weapon
will malfunction when fired, though most of these
malfunctions will be relatively minor in nature.

The power capacity of a weapon powerpack is determined
by its rating and Tech Level. Capacity is rated in shots per
kilogram, and a powerpack can be constructed with any
amount of capacity. The ability to jam a powerpack into a
given weapon will place practical limits on the amount of
firepower the weapon can offer. In practice most weapons
are designed to use existing power units.

Cartridges do not have a variable output. They deliver
an instant burst of energy when expended, sufficient
for one shot at the relevant power level. If a cartridge
generates more power than the weapon can handle,
it is treated as having the Unreliable trait at a level
equal to the difference between the maximum power
generated by the cartridge and the damage done
by the weapon. Thus a Standard cartridge (with a
maximum damage rating of 5D) used to power a
Light laser (with a maximum output of 3D) would
impose Unreliable 2. If an underpowered cartridge
is used the weapon will not be harmed but can only
deliver the level of damage that cartridge is capable
of producing. Attempts to use multiple cartridges at
once are rarely successful. Each additional cartridge
imposes a level of Hazardous and Unreliable.

Cartridge systems can be manufactured either as static
holders or in the manner of a conventional magazine.
Cartridges become very hot when used, so it is standard
practice to eject them from the weapon in the manner of
a standard firearm. Those that retain cartridges require
less moving parts but are more prone to accidents; non-
ejecting cartridge energy weapons gain Hazardous -2.
A cartridge holder does not have to be in the weapon,
though it must be connected to it by a cable. Cartridge
costs and weights are based on the type of cartridge.

Cartridges are cheaper per-shot than weapon
powerpacks but a powerpack can be recharged many
times whereas cartridges must be bought anew. The
weight of a disposable magazine or holder is equal to
the weight of the cartridges within it plus 20%. Cost is
equal to the price of one cartridge. Reusable magazines
cost twice this amount.

ENERGY WEAPON

RECEIVERS
Energy weapons have four classes of receiver – Minimal,
Small, Medium and Large. A Minimal receiver is
typically nothing more than a short tube containing the
collimator and laser generation equipment, which may
or may not be fitted with a pistol-style handgrip. Small
receivers are normally configured as pistols and medium
receivers are normally longarms. Large receivers are
typically used for heavy laser rifles or support weapons.

The type of receiver dictates how powerful the laser
weapon can be and its base range. This is heavily
modified by the barrel length. The weight of an energy
weapon receiver does not include a powerpack.

When a receiver is specified, the designer can choose
how much damage the weapon is capable of, in whole
dice, up to the maximum power available. It is possible,
though a little pointless, to create a Large receiver
and set the Damage to 2D. The only advantage to this
weapon would be reduced power usage.

The function of barrels and furniture is in most ways
the same for energy weapons as conventional firearms.
Most accessories, such as scopes and bipods, are also
identical. Energy weapons do have some exclusive
modifications, however.

Large Cr5000 8kg 500m Heavy

Laser weapons with Short barrels are limited in terms of
the damage they can deliver, as a result of early beam
dissipation. A full-length (Rifle) barrel or longer has no
upper limit on laser power, but shorter barrels waste
some of the weapon's power. A Carbine or Assault barrel
is limits power to 4D damage. Handgun and Short
barrels have a maximum Damage 3D, and a Minimal
barrel can deliver a maximum of Damage 2D. This
limit applies no matter how powerful the laser pulse
generator in the receiver may be. The weapon is not
damaged by the extra power, but it is wasted.

All energy weapon receivers gain the Zero-G trait and
base Penetration -1.

Efficient Beam Generation (TL11): Advances in laser and
other energy weapon technologies allow a more efficient
generation of beams and pulses. The new technology
is expensive, increasing costs by 50%, but the receiver
weighs 25% less and base range is increased 25%. This
modification is compatible with Lightweight, Compact
and so forth as those are modifications to the weapon as
a whole, whereas Efficient Beam Generation affects only
a few specific components.

Improved Beam Focus (TL11): Improved beam focusing
becomes available at TL11. Weapons with this
modification experience less energy wastage and thus
deliver a little more damage than standard lasers.
Improved Beam Focus adds Damage +3 to any laser
doing 2D damage or more. The improved focussing
crystals do not add any weight but push the cost of the
weapon up by 25%.

Intensified Pulse (TL12): By shortening the wavelength,
a more intense laser pulse can be created. This has the
effect of increasing Penetration by +1. Intensified Pulse
can be applied to any laser weapon, adding 10% to
receiver weight and increasing cost by 25%.

Variable Intensity (TL10): A variable-intensity
modification allows the user to set the damage dealt
by each shot, up to the weapon's normal maximum.
Powerpack weapons draw only enough power for the
shot, but cartridges are fully expended even on a low
power setting. The mechanism includes the capability
to bleed off excess cartridge energy safely. Intensity
variation adds 15% to the cost of the receiver and 10%
to its weight.

**PERSONAL AND LIGHT**

**SUPPORT WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-FIVE**

The choice of weaponry used by a mercenary formation
is often dictated by what is available. Where there is a
choice, general-purpose systems are usually favored
over highly specialized ones. Availability of ammunition
and ease of maintenance are both important factors as
well. Mercenary units would, on the whole, prefer to be
equipped with reliable weaponry of modest Tech Level
than high-end guns that cannot be replaced if they break
down in the field. There is, however, a market for specialist
and highly advanced weaponry. The TL bands noted here
are often used by mercenaries as a shorthand for what
weaponry they are likely to face or be able to obtain.

**Low Tech (TL0-4)**
There is a limit to how low-tech a unit's equipment can
be without becoming ineffective, but many items can
be obtained at low Tech Levels or fielded by opposing
forces. A musketball or even an arrow can put a high-tech
mercenary out of action if the shooter gets lucky, and
in many cases a basic weapon system does not change
function as technology advances. Although marketing
departments at arms firms try very hard to make their
version of the common field knife more desirable than
others there is a limit to how much a low-tech item can
vary from the baseline. Such equipment purchased by
mercenaries tends to be manufactured at a much higher
Tech Level but is not very different to something that
could be put together by a TL1 blacksmith.

**Mid-Tech (TL5-7)**
Mid-tech weaponry generally echoes the functions of more
advanced equipment, though less well. It allows local
armed forces to fight in much the same way as starfaring
mercenaries do – though technology will usually give the
mercenaries an advantage. Mercenaries may well equip
themselves with a few bits and pieces of mid-tech kit if it
is cheap or easy to come by, and many of the forces they
work alongside will be equipped to this level.

**Common Tech (TL8-10)**
The majority of mercenary formations use equipment
mostly from the 'common tech' band – hence its
name. This is mainly due to availability and ease of

maintenance. Beyond this point conventional firearms do
not improve much and tend to be supplanted by gauss or
energy weapons.

High Tech (TL11-12)
TL12 represents the upper end of what is commonly
available to mercenaries. This is mostly a function of
restrictions on advanced military-grade weapons and
the difficulty of maintaining them without major support
infrastructure. Those units that do rely heavily on gauss
and similarly complex weapons generally invest in a solid
support and maintenance capability in order to avoid
dependence upon outsiders.

Advanced Tech (TL13-15)
It is rare to find mercenary formations equipped to TL13+
standards unless they are very well funded indeed.
Such formations typically operate alongside or even as a
spearhead for local armed forces on high-tech worlds, or
as the elite of a larger mercenary formation.

HAND WEAPONS
Hand weapons never go out of fashion. Most are useful as tools and may never see use against another person, but
having a knife handy can mean the difference between life and death.

**FIELD KNIFE**

**FIELD BLADE**

Field knives vary from small stiletto-type knives
intended primarily for thrusting and well suited to
assassinating sentries, to large cutting knives designed
to chop through flesh and anything else that gets in the
way. The latter are better suited to use as tools than
pure combat knives. Indeed, some very fine combat
knives have a bad reputation as a result of being used
to open coffee cans and becoming bent or blunted. A
unit's preference for field knives may vary, and it is not
uncommon to find a large knife/bayonet in service as
a general tool and weapon, with a small stabbing knife
secreted somewhere about the mercenary's person.
Although the mode of use varies, performance in skilled
hands is about the same.

The term 'blade' is used in generic fashion by mercenaries for large survival or tool knives of the
Bowie type, machetes and similar heavy-bladed cutting implements, and a range of tool/fighting
weapons produced at spacefaring Tech Levels. Military field blades generally feature a stirrup
handguard and minimal crosspiece, but the whole array of hangars and not-quite swords falls
under this distinction. Blades are favored by mercenaries for their use as tools and ease of carry.
A blade can be used by a skilled fighter to counter a sword or similar hand weapon, albeit at a
slight disadvantage, and is much easier to carry.

Historically, the term cutlass referred to any heavy-bladed cutting tool/weapon used at sea,
though over time specific weapons were produced as cutlasses. In modern times the cutlass
is associated with naval boarding actions and security operations. It is a heavy-bladed
cutting weapon, usually but not always curved, with sufficient hand protection to serve as a
knuckle-duster in a close-quarters brawl.

Sabres are carried by some officers as a dress sword
which might be pressed into service in an emergency.
They can also be encountered in the hands of low to
mid-tech cavalry. Designs and weights vary, with most
having a curved blade optimized for cutting attacks.
Straight-bladed weapons of a similar design might
be referred to as sabres or by other titles such as
backswords or broadswords. Hand protection varies
from a simple stirrup hilt to an elaborate basket, with
most modern designs using a shell guard or half-shell.
Functionally, a sabre is not all that different to a cutlass
but is less well suited to extreme close-quarters combat.

**STEALTH DAGGER**

There is little distinction between a small one-handed
combat axe and a tomahawk in reality, but the term
tends to be applied to lightweight combat weapons with
secondary uses as a tool. Most military tomahawks have
attachment points for a rope or cord for use in climbing,
and a handle strong enough to be used as a prybar. A
tomahawk can be thrown using the Melee (blade) skill.

Moving dirt around by hand never gets any easier, but
it is one of the ways a mercenary can increase their
chances of survival. Entrenching tools vary only slightly
in details. They have a digging blade which may or may
not be positioned opposite a pick on a haft that can
usually be separated from the tools for ease of carry.
The haft sometimes contains holders for wire saws and
other basic tools. Entrenching tools can be used with
the Melee (blade) skill, and are sometimes sharpened
along one end of the spade for combat purposes.

**SECURITY SHIELD**

After disappearing from the low-tech battlefield, shields
begin to reappear as mid-tech security equipment. The
basic TL6 riot shield is usually round or rectangular
and made of fireproof material. It is used in the same
way as a low-tech shield but also protects the user from
small flame weapons such as Molotov cocktails and
adds +1 to the user's Protection against firearm attacks.
At TL8 an advanced version becomes available which
incorporates a single shot grenade discharger, normally
loaded with an incapacitant gas grenade but could be
used to deliver a flechette, baton or stun grenade. More
extreme situations might call for a multiple projectile
round. Advanced security shields are tougher, adding
Protection +2, and can be made from corrosion-
resistant materials for an additional Cr100.

BOARDING SHIELD
Boarding shields are known by various names.
Planetside security often call them entry shields, whilst
some are marketed under extravagant titles such as
'mobile field barricade segment'. The function of these
large, slab-fronted objects is much the same in every
case. A boarding shield is far too large and heavy to
parry with; it is a piece of mobile cover designed to
be emplaced and advanced in the face of potential or
actual hostile action.

Most boarding shields have a vision block; some also
have a firing port in the front surface. A boarding shield
completely protects anyone hiding behind it and is large
enough that two people can use it or move it forward
whilst remaining reasonably well covered. When moving
or firing from behind a boarding shield, the user(s) can
be hit, but the shield imposes DM-2 on opponents'
attack rolls. It provides Protection +12. Most boarding
shields are designed to be linked together using quick-
release fittings on their sides, enabling a protected
firing position to be thrown up almost anywhere. Ladder
shields, costing Cr50 more than a standard boarding
shield, have a series of bars across the rear enabling
them to be used as a short climbing aid.

LOW-TECH FIREARMS
Mercenaries might face an array of low-tech firearms, which will typically be unreliable smoothbore muskets
with poor accuracy and worse penetration. Better-made weapons can be surprisingly accurate in the hands of a
skilled user.

The typical civilian-owned shotgun is used, in rural
environments at least, for vermin control or to persuade
interlopers to absent themselves from property. Many
designs have twin barrels, either in an over-under or side-
by-side configuration. This allows two quick shots before
the weapon must be manually reloaded one chamber
at a time. In urban areas, those who own shotguns
for home defence are more likely to buy a combat
shotgun but relatively short double-barrelled shotguns

- usually with a carbine-length barrel – are sometimes
encountered. These weapons are not much of a threat to
armored troops, but nobody wants to be hit by one. This
representative example is a full-length 'farmer's shotgun'
firing light smoothbore ammunition. At TL3, essentially
the same weapon exists but using a flintlock mechanism,
imposing the Unreliable 1 trait.

from a 'legitimate' sporting gun. Some users produce

The 'crunch gun' is named for its distinctive sound.
The earliest models appear at late TL3, using black
powder and a flintlock mechanism. By TL4 a cartridge
version is available. These weapons are an upscaled
version of the primitive long-range sniping rifles in use
by some cultures. They are marginally effective against
heavy protection such as combat armor and may be
produced in large numbers by a society with no other
counter to high-tech invaders. They are sometimes used
for anti-materiel work such as shooting the breach block
of an enemy machinegun. This representative example
is not dissimilar to the anti-tank rifles used by infantry
on some low-tech worlds. It is fed from a 3-round
detachable box magazine and uses a manually operated
bolt-action mechanism.

SECURITY AND PERSONAL DEFENCE WEAPONS
Weapons intended for security work generally combine effectiveness at short ranges with a certain degree of
intimidation. The large bore of a combat shotgun is generally more likely to dissuade a potential opponent than a
rifle, even though the latter is probable more lethal. Security and self-defence weapons are generally used at close
range, where a one-shot knockdown is more important than potential lethality. Ease of carry is also a factor with
personal defence weaponry. Handguns and mini-submachineguns are favored by many users, but there are other
options on the market.

One of several unusual handguns marketed by Ailene
Armament, the Adjudicator was originally produced
as a deterrent weapon to be carried by government
or corporate officials, or others who might need a
one-shot stop in the case of a suddenly escalating
confrontation. It is chambered for a non-standard long
11mm cartridge which can be loaded with a single ball
round, potentially lethal pellets or lighter flechettes,
or a number of specialist payloads. As a large-calibre
smoothbore in a handgun frame it kicks hard and is
inaccurate at any sort of distance, but its chunky and
generally down-to-business air of authority adds weight
to any argument. Adjudicators are favored by some
personnel who venture into the wilderness, as they can
be loaded with flechettes for use as snakeshot or with
signalling rounds.

**ADJUDICATOR**

Loaded with ball ammunition the Adjudicator is an
impressive-looking weapon with modest performance and
a short effective range. It comes into its own when loaded
with pellet shells, giving DM+5 to hit at close range and
delivering significant damage for a handgun. Performance
against armor is lamentable, however. Flechette

ammunition is similarly limited, though it is hard to miss
even a small rodent or snake with this loadout. Some users
prefer explosive ammunition, which hits hard but cannot
penetrate any hard surface or body armor – and this can
make it a liability to the user. However, even a miss with
an explosive round will make most assailants retreat.

Gauss assault weapons come in two general types:
submachineguns and automatic shotguns. In the GA-
100, bundles of needle-like projectiles are embedded in a
plastic ring which disintegrates almost immediately after
the bundle leaves the muzzle. The result combines the
hitting power and penetration of a gauss weapon with the
spread and knockdown capability of a shotgun.

ANHUR INDUSTRIES GA-100
With a short barrel and bullpup configuration the GA-100
is fast on target and easy to handle in a confined space. It
is heavy for an assault weapon but compensates for this by
delivering automatic fire with far better penetration than a
conventional shotgun. Indeed, over-penetration can be a
problem in a typical urban environment or within a lightly
built structure.

Gauss weapons do not suffer reduced damage due
to a short barrel, as the projectile is accelerated in a
very short distance within the receiver. Accuracy is
affected by using an Assault barrel, but the GA-100
is a close-quarters weapon so this is rarely a problem.

Anhur Industries produces a range of gauss weapons for
military and security use, including contracts to several
governments. The GC-24 is a compact, concealable
gauss pistol with minimal external projections to snag
on clothing. Its lack of external moving parts or a need
to eject cartridges allows the weapon to be fired from
inside a pocket or bag if necessary. Users generally
accept the high price tag in return for having a highly
effective pocket pistol if they need one. The GC-24's
high rate of fire gets through ammunition quickly, and
even with a capacity of 24 rounds this is not a weapon
for a sustained firefight... but that is not what it was
designed for.

24-round compact magazines are not compatible with
full-sized gauss rifles, but a standard gauss pistol
magazine can be used in this weapon. It will protrude
awkwardly from the base of the handgrip and make
holstering a problem.

**ANHUR INDUSTRIES GS-40**

Anhur Industries markets two primary variants of its
flagship GS-40 gauss sidearm, both built on the same
receiver and using the same magazines. The GS-40
'Army Model' has a conventional length barrel and is
otherwise a standard gauss pistol. The 'Navy Model'
has an extended barrel more suited to a short assault
weapon, allegedly reflecting the preferences of certain
world governments' navies. Purchasers of the Navy
Model have the option of a detachable shoulder stock

- available in high-impact polymer or gorgeously carved
wood – which allows the weapon to be used as a sort of
carbine. The stock has an internal compartment housing
a holographic sighting device, the sensor for which
is located under the pistol's barrel. How many users
would seriously consider this a combat weapon is open
to debate, but it has found favor in the competitive
shooting community.

The Navy Model variant uses an Assault barrel,
increasing cost to Cr462 and weight to 1.3kg. The

Penetration is slightly better using the longer barrel, and
accuracy is maintained to a much greater range.

Colvery's Stowaway is marketed as a concealable
emergency weapon for self-defence, but in truth it is better
suited to assassination. Built from exotic and expensive
materials, the weapon uses caseless 'stealth' ammunition
and does not need to eject cartridges. Moving parts are
minimal, and all are internal. The Stowaway has grip and
trigger safeties but is otherwise ready to fire the instant
the trigger is pulled. There is no selector; the Stowaway
empties its 6-round magazine in a single pull of the trigger,
and the rate of fire is so high that no operator can stop
mid-burst. All autofire attacks must be directed against
the same target. The result is a near-instant dump of
small-calibre bullets into the target. The inevitable slight
movement of the muzzle creates a phenomenon called
'zippering', with multiple narrow wound tracks close
together. This makes the resulting wound difficult to treat
even though each round is not very potent.

Most users carry the Stowaway as an assassination
weapon rather than a combat tool. Whether their intent
is to take out a selected target or put an enemy down
so the Traveller can grab a more effective weapon and
escape, the majority of users consider the Stowaway
to be a one-shot weapon and do not carry spare

ammunition. Those that do must buy pre-loaded
6-round magazines. Ammunition is rarely sold in bulk.
The enormous rate of fire of this weapon results in it
emptying itself in an instant; all Auto attacks must be
directed at a single target.

**HANGUL LIBERATOR**

**MULTI-BARREL WEAPON SYSTEM**

Hangul Arms and Tactical is a division of the Hangul
Corporation, which operates in a range of sectors. Its
innovative Liberator was developed as a derringer-
like weapon for last-ditch self-defence but has since
been adapted into other forms. The derringer has four
minimal barrels – so short the tips of the bullets can
be seen – fired in turn by a rotating firing pin. There is
no manual safety, just a grip safety and heavy trigger
pull. Recoil is not excessive but the muzzle blast from
this weapon is prodigious. The minimal barrel does
not allow rounds to reach anything like their design
velocity, limiting range, penetration and stopping power.
However, as a concealed backup gun or emergency
weapon to be carried in a vehicle the Liberator is viable.

Sometime after the derringer's introduction, Hangul
began marketing a variant with a much longer barrel,
equivalent to a short submachinegun. This 'Liberator
Defender' model shares the derringer's top-break
loading mechanism and carries only four rounds, but it
hits hard and can be useful in an emergency. The ability
to manually load the four chambers with specialist
ammunition appeals to some users, though the order

in which rounds are fired cannot be altered. Liberator
Defenders can be encountered loaded with distraction
or snakeshot ammunition to deter local wildlife, or with
more lethal loads as an emergency weapon. Even in
Defender configuration the weapon is short enough to
be carried in an elongated hip holster, whilst most users
of the derringer conceal it in a pocket or under clothing.

Either variant can be loaded with a single round of
any compatible ammunition type in a minor action,
but requires four minor actions to fully reload. The
derringer's poor performance against armor can be

offset with HEAP ammunition if available. Both versions
use a standard heavy pistol calibre, making access to
non-restricted ammunition cheap and simple.

Combat shotguns can be produced at TL4 upwards, and
are ubiquitous in the field. Despite the rather grandiose
title, the 'Guard' series of shotguns are conventional
pump-action weapons with a reputation for reliability
in the field. They are produced at TL8 but other than
the laser pointer are identical in function to lower-tech
weapons. The 'Bodyguard' is the standard security

variant, with a fixed stock and full-length barrel. The
'Point Guard' version is the same weapon, greatly
shortened and lacking any form of stock. It is intended
for use by the lead soldier in a patrol, who may have to
react quickly to a changing situation, or as a 'grab gun'
for security applications. Its limited ammunition supply
is offset by good knockdown power.

The standard Bodyguard shotgun's rated performance
is based on use of ball ammunition, but pellets are
more common. This reduces penetration but improves
the chance of a first-shot hit and potential knockdown
due to the spread of a pellet charge. The shortened,

stockless Pointguard variant has increased pellet
spread due to its assault-weapon length barrel. This
adversely affects penetration but does increase the
chance of a short-range hit.

assumes the user is an idiot. In addition to a grip safety,
magazine safety and a manual safety catch, there is
also a second grip safety on the forearm. This weapon
will not fire unless it is held correctly with an approved

down to reduce the amount of fiddling-about necessary

The 'Mark 1' is not a specific weapon, but represents the
typical early semi-automatic pistol developed by most
cultures. Mercenaries encounter so many of these, with
minor variations, that they are all lumped together as
'Mk1 handguns'. As military weapons, these guns are
usually chambered in a calibre around 10-11mm which
limits ammunition supply and imposes significant recoil.

Weapons of this type are often picked up as souvenirs or
on a 'might come in handy' basis and left in a soldier's
kit rather than being locked up in the armory. The unit's
commanders and logisticians may well know there are
guns lying around but be unable to inventory or properly
secure them. Some units buy large quantities of these and
similar weapons for use as sidearms. They are cheap and
reasonably effective, and arguably sidearms are not worth
the same level of spending as primary personal weapons.

MK 1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL

The Posi-9 is one of a great many semi-automatic
pistols on the market. These range from poorly made
offerings formed from cheap stampings in a mid-
tech workshop to more upmarket weapons like those
produced by Tacload. The Posi-9 is produced at TL9,
and takes advantage of advanced manufacturing
techniques, but is otherwise similar to the other
weapons grouped as 'autopistols' in mercenary jargon.

A burst-capable version of the Posi-9 is available,
which pushes the price up to Cr435. The advantages
of this modification are debated by many potential

TACLOAD ARMAMENTS
POSI-9 9MM SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL
buyers, but there are those who long for more
firepower from their handguns. A burst-capable
Posi-9 can be converted into a true 'autopistol' by
removing the burst limiter and filing away part of the
mechanism to increase rate of fire. A gunsmith might
charge Cr200-300 to do this, though any decent
armorer can make the modifications. Messing up
this job imposes Low Quality at a level equal to the
negative Effect of a failed Mechanics check. This
is not an official variant and would not normally be

The Posi-9 and similar weapons are sometimes
encountered chambered for lighter ammunition,
especially if they have been converted to automatic
fire. A converted model has Recoil 5 – 3 for its damage
and 4 for its high Auto score, -2 for the weight of the
weapon. This makes the Posi-9 uncontrollable for those
who lack the training to use it properly, and highly
inaccurate in the hands of almost any user. The same
can be said for almost any full-auto handgun.

The concept behind the Crewmate was to create a
weapon capable of delivering good firepower from a
compact and easy-to-carry package, and which could
share magazines with standard service weapons. It is
built around a handgun type receiver, though with an
internal bolt and semi-bullpup configuration. Semi-
bullpup in this context means the magazine well and
the firing chamber are behind the handgrip, but there
is no shoulder stock. Making this configuration work
requires loading from the top of the weapon, which is
not intuitive for most users.

TACTICAL SYSTEMS INCORPORATED
CREWMATE PERSONAL DEFENCE WEAPON

Despite its slightly odd nature the Crewmate has
achieved reasonable market success. Examples are
often found clipped to vehicle crewmembers' hatches,
offering a chance to deliver heavy – if rather random

- firepower whilst escaping from a disabled vehicle.
The weapon is a bit too large to be holstered like a
pistol and, with a great deal of weight at the rear and
little to the front, suffers badly from muzzle climb.
Some users fit a longer barrel, which increases muzzle
velocity of the intermediate rifle ammunition, and find
a way to create a workable stock. This essentially turns
the Crewmate back into an assault rifle, which rather
defeats its purpose.

ASSAULT WEAPONRY
Close-assault weapons generally come in three types; high-firepower light automatic weaponry, weapons designed for
a fast knockdown such as assault shotguns, and specialist weapons developed to deal with a specific threat. Some
straddle the line between two or even all three of these applications.

Desperado is not a commercial designation, but a
generic term used to refer to basic submachineguns
thrown together in a workshop or built up from kits
sold on the open market. Several manufacturers supply
bolt-and-chamber kits along with dies and blanks for
making other components. Barrels may or may not
be supplied, and Desperadoes have been frequently

encountered with home-made smoothbore barrels.
This imposes Inaccurate -2. Hand-carved or crudely
machined wooden furniture is common. A badly made
Desperado may have Unreliable 1 or Hazardous -2;
occasionally both. The majority are decent enough
weapons if properly looked after, and lethal in the
hands of a determined – or desperate – user.

The typical Desperado uses a 20-round stick magazine
which may be carried under the barrel or to the side
depending on how the weapon was put together. Top-
loading and bullpup types have been encountered,
among other configurations. Ultimately the Desperado
is a device for spraying medium-calibre handgun

ammunition around, and it does it well enough. A
snail drum magazine, holding 50 rounds, is available
for Cr20. It makes the weapon unwieldy and is prone
to jamming. The standard 20-round magazine is a
common pistol size and readily available for Cr4 plus
the cost of ammunition.

HANGUL LIBERATOR
MULTI-BARREL WEAPON SYSTEM

The Eliminator was designed for people who know they
should have both hands on the wheel... but really do
not care. It is in some ways a standard small-calibre
submachinegun, but optimized for combat at extreme
close quarters. The weapon is officially aimed at those
who may have to use a shield or carry out tasks with the
other hand. Official marketing vids show cautious entry
teams moving through buildings, with the lead soldier
opening doors and carrying out all manner of tasks with
the offhand, the Eliminator held ready in the other. The
inevitable ambush is defeated by dramatic one-handed
shooting, emphasising accuracy and precision despite
having to guide a scared hostage or hold a grenade
ready with one hand. If the Eliminator is bought by
those who prefer to use a hand weapon – or another gun

- in their other hand, Ailene Armament is not reluctant
to meet their requirements.

ELIMINATOR CLOSE
ASSAULT WEAPON

Layout is conventional, with the magazine in front
of the trigger assembly. Unusually for a close-
assault weapon there is no foregrip. If the weapon
is to be used in both hands the usual practice is to
cup the front of the magazine well. This is effective
with standard magazines but when using extended
versions some users grip the magazine rather than
the well and pull back, misaligning the feed system
and potentially causing stoppages. The folding stock
is rarely used in extended mode, but when folded
acts as an elbow hook, allowing the weapon to be
supported at the rear if pulled in tight. The result is a
weapon that shoots much like a long pistol, but with
a high automatic rate of fire.

The Eliminator is nothing special as assault weapons
go when used two-handed – there are better guns
available for less money. However, it is highly effective
when combined with a shield for entry work, and the

marketing vids are not entirely misleading – the lead
soldier in an entry team needs a hand free to move
objects and open doors, and the Eliminator offers more
emergency firepower than a pistol whilst doing so.

Recoil is a problem for many users of one-handed
automatic weapons. The Eliminator has a nominal
Recoil 2 when firing in fully-automatic mode,
controllable for most well-trained personnel. The
addition of an integral recoil compensator reduces this
to zero, enabling anyone with the most basic of training
to shoot full-auto without undue difficulty.

Many users prefer armor-piercing ammunition
to compensate for the Eliminator's low-powered
projectiles, whilst others use enhanced-wounding
rounds which spread on impact. This reduces
penetration but increases the chance of putting a
target down with one burst.

ELIMINATOR CLOSE ASSAULT WEAPON

The Infantry Assault Weapon, TL12, or IAW-
12, is essentially a submachinegun using
electromagnetic propulsion instead of a
conventional firearm mechanism. It is intended
for urban combat at moderate to short ranges,
and emphasises firepower over accuracy. Rate of
fire is high but the low recoil of gauss weapons
and overall layout creates a controllable and
comfortable-to-shoot weapon whose sole
purpose is to get a lot of gauss needles into a
target at close range, and do it in the shortest
possible time.

INTERSTELLAR ORDNANCE IAW-12
A conventional layout was chosen, with the magazine
well located between the front and rear pistol grips.
This gives a balanced feeling which is excellent for
hip-shooting during an assault. The only accessory
provided as standard is a laser pointer; a set of iron
sights is provided but most owners never use them.
Safety devices are limited to the usual grip and
magazine safeties, with a manual safe/semi-auto/full-
auto selector, oversized to facilitate rapid action. If an
ambush or emergency requires maximum response, the
user can yank the selector all the way and instantly let
rip, taking the time to select semi-automatic if precision
is required. This setting is rarely used, though some
owners obtain an after-market folding stock and add an
optical sight to create a carbine of sorts.

ammunition and holds 72 gauss needles plus a

weapon, so some users prefer to carry the IAW-12 with
a 40-round gauss pistol magazine in place. For intense

The Planetsider is slightly unusual in that it attempts
to bridge the gap between close-range personal defence
weapons and serious combat weaponry. It was developed
as a security weapon for starship crews, balancing
firepower and a reasonable effective range – for a light
automatic weapon – with a short length and ease of
handling. The result is a surprisingly accurate carbine-
length submachinegun.

UNIFIED SPACE
INDUSTRIES PLANETSIDER
The Planetsider is heavy for a weapon of its type, but the
weight is mostly at the rear which helps bring the muzzle
up quicky when needed. Despite its barrel length the
Planetsider is short overall, and equally suited to fast-
moving operations inside a starship or combat in the open.
The optical sight is rarely used in magnification mode but
provides fast target acquisition at moderate ranges.

The weapon's designers decided to cram in as much
ammunition capacity as possible, creating a heavy SMG
with almost as much capacity as a standard one. For
those who require more firepower a 40-round casket
magazine is available for Cr40 and a 70-round drum

and eliminates many of the weapon's quick-reaction
advantages. With any kind of magazine in place the
Planetsider's weight absorbs recoil well, removing the
Bulky trait.

COMBAT WEAPONRY
Combat weaponry includes most weapons intended to be used in battle, where it may be necessary to engage
targets across short to relatively long ranges. Preferences vary; some users like short, handy, low-recoil weapons well
suited to urban combat or frequent moves in and out of vehicles, whilst others prefer hard-hitting weapons suited
to longer ranges. It is not uncommon to encounter support versions of a battlefield rifle. Whilst these are not true
machineguns and overheat rapidly when conducing sustained fire, they offer enhanced firepower in a configuration
that can be taken over by any rifleman and usually share ammunition feed devices with the rest of the squad.

The GR-80 gauss rifle is manufactured at TL13 along
with Anhur's other gauss weapons, but is functionally
little different to TL12 gauss weapons produced by
other companies. Its bullpup design takes advantage of
gauss weaponry's lack of an ejection system, creating an
ambidextrous rifle of short overall length.

**ANHUR INDUSTRIES GR-80**

The standard-configuration weapon has a carbine-length
barrel and is equally well suited to the assault role or
combat at battlefield ranges. The multispectral scope
can be omitted, saving Cr600 and 0.5kg, though it is
often replaced with a simpler optical sighting device.

In addition to the standard GR-90, a light support
variant is offered, built on the same receiver but using
a heavy, heat-dissipating barrel. This is significantly
longer than the standard carbine barrel, but in all other
ways the support version is identical to the infantry

weapon. As a result any trooper in a squad can take over
the support weapon at need. A 150-round extension
magazine is issued to support gunners, though since the
weapon can use either it is often 'borrowed' by rifle-
armed soldiers when their own ammunition runs low.

The AIWS is manufactured on a modular basis,
enabling users to purchase either a weapon
configured to their own specifications or a collection
of parts to enable various configurations to be put
together as required. The system is built around
a commonly available intermediate calibre round,
which is normally manufactured at TL10. Near-
identical ammunition is available down to TL6,
though prolonged use with such less finely machined
munitions will increase barrel and chamber wear.

The system uses a common receiver, with the firing
chamber located in conventional manner in front of
the handgrip. In standard configuration this weapon
is set up with a rifle-length barrel and fixed stock,
with a standard 1.5/2.5/4x optical sighting device
for general combat operations. The same receiver is
used in all configurations, and it is the intermediate
rifle cartridge fired that determines the weapon's base
characteristics.

The intent from the outset was to create a high-
capacity weapon, and in this the designers
succeeded. Nominal magazine size is 43 rounds, but
42 are normally loaded to prevent misfeeds. Standard
magazines cost Cr14 unloaded, with an extended
casket magazine available for support work. These
cost Cr28 and hold 64 rounds.

•  (A)Rifle Configuration: The standard configura-
tion of this weapon is a lightweight assault
rifle of conventional layout, with an effective
range of around 300m. The variable scope/
sight permits accurate fire out to much great-
er distances, and is rarely dismounted. Barrel
and stock can be detached in a matter of
moments without the use of tools. Some users
prefer to use a folding stock, which reduces
weight a little. The primary advantage of a
folding stock is ease of handling in a confined
space; with the stock folded the weapon gains
Quickdraw +2.
•  (B)Carbine Configuration: The AIWS is often
configured as a carbine for use by troops
whose primary speciality is not direct infantry
combat. In this configuration it has a carbine
barrel and folding stock, but is otherwise the
same as the rifle variant.

**INTERSTELLAR ORDNANCE ADVANCED**

**INFANTRY WEAPON SYSTEM**

•  (C)Light Support Weapon Configuration: The
light support weapon variant can be used
by anyone trained to use the rifle. It has a
heavier barrel and normally fed from extended
(casket) magazines but can take any feed
device compatible with the AIWS family of
weapons. Drum magazines are sometimes
used, but this makes the weapon clumsy and
is favored only when the support weapon is
mounted on a pintle or similar mounting.
•  (D)Assault Variant: Some users choose to
configure the weapon with an assault barrel,
vertical foregrip and no stock for close-assault
work, removing the scope as well. This reduces
effectiveness at range but is useful in urban
combat or assault situations. Casket maga-
zines are sometimes used in this role, but their
extra bulk can detract from the weapon's main
advantage which is getting into action quickly
when hostiles are suddenly encountered.

**TACLOAD ARMAMENTS INTRUDER**

**URBAN COMBAT WEAPON SYSTEM**

'Urban Combat Weapon System' is Tacload-speak for
an integrated assault rifle and breaching shotgun.
The weapon is most definitely geared towards urban
combat, ranging from one-block firefights to desperate
scrambles on the stairwell of an office building. The
receiver is constructed in bullpup configuration, with
the 36-round magazine inserted through the underside
of the fixed stock. Function of the rifle components is
conventional, with full or semi-automatic fire available.
A laser pointer and 1.5/2.5/4x magnification optical
sight are fitted as standard.

A secondary weapon is fitted under the barrel. This
is a very short shotgun, whose handgrip is used as a
vertical foregrip when firing from an 'assault stance' –
more Tacload-speak, this time a euphemism for blazing
away from the hip. The shotgun is fired using the fore
hand, meaning both weapons can be discharged at
once – albeit with DM-2 on both attack rolls. The short

barrel of the shotgun produces a very broad spread
of shot. Whilst the shotgun is intended for breaching
internal doors during urban combat, it does offer good
knockdown capability in an unexpected close-range
encounter. The shotgun holds one shell in the breach
and two in its short tube magazine.

One common variant exists, in which the under-barrel
shotgun is replaced with a rail launcher for an adapted
rifle grenade. Grenades cost double normal price, and
have a two-stage motor. The launching charge propels
the grenade far enough away from the user that the
main stage does not cause injury, though the weapon
can still be unpleasant to use. Commonly, HEAP
grenades are used to breach heavy doors or building
walls, or attack light vehicles from ambush. Other
grenade types may be substituted as necessary. With a
grenade fitted to the rail, the weapon weighs about the
same as with the shotgun. Reloading a grenade onto the
rail is a fiddly business requiring 1D+3 Minor Actions.

Tactical Systems Incorporated markets a wide range
of mid-tech weaponry, which most people believe is
designed and built in-house. This is only partially true;
TSI generally works from common designs found on
many worlds, creating a generic all-markets version
which is then commonly built under license. Quality of
these outsourced weapons is generally of an acceptable
level, though the occasional 'gin special' is found which
appears to have been assembled by a band of drunks
after a good night out. Weapons made in-house do not
suffer from these quality-control issues but it can be
hard to spot whether a batch has been manufactured
directly or bought in.

The Squadmate is a simple and effective battle
rifle design, conventionally laid out and with few
noteworthy features. It uses commonly available

7.5mm battle rifle ammunition and shares magazine
compatibility with a great many weapons. In
comparison with the intermediate calibre assault
rifles favored by many militaries, the Squadmate hits
harder and is accurate to a greater range, but heavier
and carries less ammunition. As a semi-automatic
weapon it cannot lay down suppressing fire in the
manner of an assault rifle, but those who favor it
claim this is offset by the ability to shoot precisely
rather than hosepiping the countryside.

The Squadmate is used as the basis for a marksman
rifle. Usually this is a matter of picking the very best
examples when weapons are bench-tested, then
working through an accurising process. In addition to
using a longer barrel and adding a scope, rifles are
hand-finished to a high standard. This drives up the
cost in return for a small improvement in performance.

LOW-G WEAPONS
Specialist weapons intended for low-gravity work are commonly built around the 'snub pistol' round and designed
to minimise the positional disruption caused by firing them. Barrels are often set low compared to conventional
firearms, directing recoil into the user's center of mass rather than causing muzzle flip and rotation of an unsecured
user. The relative power of snub weapons makes them attractive in some other applications as well; snub revolvers
are used as emergency weapons in some groundside installations.

A rather unusual offering from BeraTech, the Sentinel
uses a fatter and shorter version of standard accelerator
rifle ammunition, which is not compatible with other
weapons. Spin is imparted to the projectiles by
angulated thrust rather than rifling and initiation is
electrical, with no external hammer or other moving
parts. The whole weapon is treated to remain functional
in conditions of extreme cold and vacuum.

Ammunition is carried in a revolving cylinder made of
lightweight plastic. This is sufficient to withstand the
very modest chamber pressure and not inconsiderable

heat developed by a rocket-powered projectile
beginning its acceleration. A partially expended
cylinder can be refilled with loose ammunition once
or twice, but the manufacturer recommends against
more than one reloading. Cylinders are intended to be
disposable, and reloading is accomplished with a top-
break action. If done gently this retains the cylinder in
place. A sharp jerk of the barrel downward ejects the
entire cylinder. Unwary users reloading a Sentinel in
zero-g may be hit in the face by the cylinder, though
this is unlikely to do any harm. A complete cylinder
swap requires one minor action.

Although only holding four rounds, the Sentinel is
light and extremely easy to use. Its rocket projectiles
continue accelerating after leaving the barrel, so
range is not affected by barrel length. Many users
prefer high-explosive ammunition, oddly enough, for

safety reasons. An explosive round will detonate upon
hitting almost anything, whereas most other types
may ricochet and continue accelerating with entirely
unpredictable results.

Most special-purpose low-recoil ('snub') weapons are
standalone designs, but Unified Space Industries
has recently begun offering a configurable weapon
system built around a common receiver. Weapons are
available singly or in batches as a whole unit, or as
a kit containing all the necessary parts to make each
variant along with a single receiver. The weapon is well
put together, and capable of withstanding extreme
conditions including vacuum and high temperatures.

As a straightforward snub pistol the Shipmate is
grossly overpriced and rather bulky, though it does
offer the advantage of burst-capability. This is
surprisingly controllable even in low gravity, largely due
to the weight of the weapon. The primary advantage of
this weapon system is the ability to purchase multiples
and set up a full security armament with personnel
able to carry a handgun and carbine or close-assault
weapon that use the same magazines, or swap out
components as the need arises.

All variants normally use the same 20-round
magazines, which cost Cr10 plus ammunition cost
if bought singly. A 30-round extended magazine is
available for Cr15. It extends beyond the base of the
magazine well and makes the weapon impossible to
holster if in handgun configuration.

**Handgun Configuration:** The default setup for this weapon
system is a heavy burst-capable handgun, typically
loaded with simple ball ammunition. This weapon is
quick on target with Quickdraw 8 and potentially more
menacing than a conventional handgun. Standard ball
ammunition is the most common loading.

**Assault Weapon Configuration:** By adding a folding stock
and assault barrel, cost is increased to Cr610 and
weight to 1.5kg. Effective range is greatly increased,
to 20m, and penetration improved as well. Assault
weapons are typically left in a very 'clean' condition,
with few or no accessories to snag during a quick
deployment. The example here is rated using ball
ammunition in a standard 14-round magazine.

Carbine Configuration: Using a fixed stock and carbine-
length barrel, the Shipmate is converted into a
weapon capable of engaging targets at a modest
range – such as aggressors storming across a starport
landing area. It is usually equipped with a basic
optical combat sight giving the Scope trait. Cost is
increased to Cr610 and weight to 1.6kg, while range
is increased to 45m. Whilst not capable of counter-
sniper wok the carbine is an effective local defence
weapon with a useful burst fire capability.

The Ten-Six (10mm calibre, six shots) is in most ways
a conventional snub pistol. It is a top-break revolver
designed for rapid reloading using speedloaders, even
when wearing vacc suit gloves. Its vacc suit-friendly
design also includes an enlarged trigger guard and
wrist lanyard, along with a general lack of projections
to snag on or – in a worst-case scenario – rip a suit.
The Ten-Six is produced at TL9 using advanced
projectile weapon technologies, creating a weapon
with a slightly longer accurate range than is typical of
snub handguns. Whether this is worth the extra cost
is a factor debated by many potential buyers.

Where the Ten-Six departs from conventional design
is the addition of a second barrel under the primary
one. This is a single shot smoothbore, operated by
pushing a lever to move the firing pin then triggered
with the primary mechanism. The original intent
was to allow the lower barrel to function as an
emergency line-gun, firing a self-adhesive fixing round
followed by 10m of fine wire. This version was not
very successful and the feature was subsequently
reinvented as a secondary combat capability. Many
users will carry a distraction round in the lower barrel,

either to shock intruders or permit a warning shot
that no court can claim went unnoticed. Flechette
ammunition, carried to deal with small vermin, is
also popular. More gung-ho users may prefer to load a
pellet shell. This removes the Zero-G trait when used,
and cannot be fired at the same time as the primary
barrel. The weapon's very short barrel renders pellets
ineffective beyond point-blank range but their spread
makes it difficult to miss.

Performance with ball ammunition is modest, so most
users prefer to load HEAP. This offsets the weapon's
lamentable performance against armor but cannot

make up for its low muzzle velocity. On the plus side,
the Ten-Six is a very short weapon and easy to use at
close quarters, even in conjunction with a riot shield.

LIGHT SUPPORT WEAPONS
Light support weapons are designed to be integrated at the squad level, giving a unit some measure of self-support
capability. Weapons such as light missile launchers and grenade launchers are sometimes referred to as 'problem
solvers' – whether the problem is a sniper shooting from a window or a heavily fortified machinegun nest. Some
unit commanders frown on the use of expensive guided weapons to take out an infantry position, but the cost of
recruiting and training replacement personnel might be much higher.

Direct-fire support weapons such as machineguns offer much the same options a rifle squad already has – but more
of it. Some light support weapons are built on a rifle receiver and in truth are little more than overgrown rifles, but
these weapons are limited by their ability to dissipate heat. Dedicated support weapons are generally much more
capable of sustained fire and have the capacity to change barrels, allowing one to cool whilst another is in use.

Accelerator weapons are not universally admired; lasers
and low-velocity conventional projectiles are generally
preferred. Those militaries that use the accelerator
weaponry have long lamented the lack of support versions,
prompting BeraTech to introduce the Guardian heavy
accelerator weapon. Essentially a large-calibre, fully-
automatic variant of the accelerator rifle, the Guardian
has been adopted for support work by forces that would
otherwise not even look at accelerator weapons.

Layout is conventional, with a detachable magazine
loading in front of the trigger assembly. The weapon has
a long barrel but no bipod, as it is intended to be used

on the move. The most likely combat environment is
low gravity or microgravity, fighting on moons or aboard
vessels and space installations. In standard gravity this
weapon would be heavy and unwieldy, but whilst it still
has considerable inertia a skilled user learns to make use
of the stately swing of the barrel in much the same way
a sporting shotgunner might favor a heavier gun for its
steadiness on the traverse.

One advantage of accelerator weapons is the lack of barrel
heating compared to conventional firearms. Rockets
will heat the barrel eventually but sustained fire can be
maintained as much as five times as long without causing
a malfunction.

Ball ammunition is available for the Guardian, but it
is more commonly employed with explosive or HEAP.
Nominal ammunition capacity is 30 rounds, but
Guardian gunners tend to use a 75-round drum in the

weapon and 45-round casket magazines for reloading.
Drums are large and clumsy, so it is rare to see them
carried as spare ammunition unless the unit has a
munitions robot available.

SQUADMATE BATTLE RIFLE

Like many weapons from DMS, the Solo is a 'problem-
solver' – in this case the problem being armored troops
and light vehicles. It is very finely made at TL14, to the
closest tolerances and with great attention to detail.
The designers wanted to create a powerful and accurate
weapon that retained its effectiveness even when in
the field for extended periods. Lightness was also an
important factor, as the user might have to get into
awkward spaces.

**DIVERSIFIED MILITARY SYSTEMS**

**SOLO GAUSS SNIPER RIFLE**

Unusually for a sniping weapon, the Solo is capable
of fully-automatic fire. It is rarely used in this manner,
though sometimes bursts can help in getting a round on
target when making a marginal shot. The very low recoil
and lack of internal moving parts associated with gauss
weapons makes this a viable strategy. The rugged design
allows the weapon to retain accuracy whilst being
banged around in the field, but ultimately it is battery
life that limits effectiveness. Sighting and propulsion
both draw heavily on the weapon's batteries, imposing a
limitation not faced by conventional sniping weapons.

As a primarily aerospace company, Jervaux produces
only a few firearms and most of those are intended
for the starship-security marketplace. The Reliant is
no exception, but has found its way into the arsenals
of numerous mid-tech governments seeing a solution
to the problem of penetrating the armor worn by
planetary raiders or higher-tech enemies.

The Reliant is by no means a cheap weapon but is
effective in a support or general combat role. Its
shortened barrel and folding stock are intended to

make movement in and out of vehicles – or within
starships – easier but also lend themselves to using
the weapon like a heavy assault rifle. Nominal
magazine capacity is 37 rounds, but magazines of this
size are rare. Instead, a 50-round extended magazine
is favored by almost all users. This, combined
with an increased rate of fire, makes the Reliant an
unexpectedly good close-assault weapon. It is still a
light machinegun, however, and cannot react to threats
as quickly as a rifle or assault weapon.

Users who fear attack by heavily armored raiders or
pirates typically use the Reliant with advanced armor-
piercing ammunition as standard. This gives a roughly
8% chance of penetrating TL10 combat armor on any

given hit. The weapon's high rate of fire ensures a lot of
hits which, even if not particularly damaging, are likely
to cause raiders to reconsider their lifestyle choices.

are subject to the ammunition capacity reduction (or
increase) for their calibre, whilst those that are belt-fed
can use any length of belt. Changing a belt takes longer
than swapping a magazine; typically 4 minor actions.

The typical Jimpy-G is belt-fed, with belt lengths of 40-
50 rounds typically set up prior to beginning a mission.
Disintegrating-link belts can be made in any length,
but most weapons of this type use a drum, box or bag
to prevent the belt from swinging around whilst on the

move. This limits belt sizes to what will fit in the box.
Commonly GPMG teams are made up of three soldiers,
with each of the loaders carrying lengths of belt and
a spare barrel. A standard length of belt weighs about
1.5kg, with a spare barrel at 7.5kg.

SPECIALIST WEAPONS
A variety of specialist weapons are available to mercenaries who feel a need for them. Most have a limited range of
applications and may not be considered worth the effort needed to transport them, but for other units a particular
capability might be a must-have.

The Military Flame-61 has been in service for many years
and has become an industry standard in easily portable
flame weapons. Cheap copies continue to appear, some
of which are quite good and others a hazard to everyone
involved. The Krabbine weapon looks like a chunky rifle,
which is an advantage as flame weapon gunners tend to
attract a lot of enemy fire if identified. It is fed from a
combined fuel/propellant tank loaded through the stock
in the manner of a bullpup assault rifle. If other members
of a unit carry spare tanks the flame weapon can be kept
in action almost constantly since reloading is extremely
quick and simple.

The MF-61 stands out from its rivals for having additional
safety features, which drives up the price but reassures
the soldiers selected to use it. With a Mishap Threshold
of 5, flame weapons such as this one are potentially a
danger to their users. The weapon's armor helps prevent
a penetrating shot whilst its extensive safety features
reduce the chance of a catastrophic fuel ignition.

The MF-61 carries enough fuel and propellant for four
attacks, and is reloaded using bulky 4.4kg en-bloc fuel
modules. Although heavy and blocky the weapon is
easy to handle and generally reliable. Its fuel contains
an additive that produces heat upon exposure to air,

self-igniting with no need for a flame at the nozzle. This
does mean the MF-61 cannot be used for 'hose and
ignite' applications, but it is a combat weapon rather
than one intended to destroy property.

The Cryojet was not intended to be used as a weapon,
and for the most part it is not. It is a backpack-fed
projector device developed for spacecraft emergency
crews. The projector's cryogenic fluid can be used
to extinguish fires or make doors and sections of
wreckage brittle, enabling them to be easily shattered
or punctured. Security crews occasionally found the
projector useful against intruders or hijackers, though
use on personnel targets is vaguely 'advised against'
by the manufacturer. Over time the Cryojet became a
recognized tool in the arsenal of some military forces,
though it remains primarily a breaching aid rather
than a weapon.

The combat Cryojet is a weaponised version of the
rescue/firefighting system. In addition to armored and
bulwarked tanks it mounts a large-calibre smoothbore
weapon under the cryogenic nozzle. This can be used to
deliver shotgun rounds for emergency self-defence, but
is more commonly employed with specialist 'breaker'
ammunition. It is a tremendously heavy and bulky
device, and normally employed by specialists who
breach an area then step back to allow their more agile
comrades to enter. It is a deadly implement however,
and can be a nasty surprise for those who think heavy
armor makes them invulnerable.

Breaker shells launch a pattern of small explosive
charges with an adhesive head, which detonate almost
instantly upon fixing to the target. They can be fired as
a combat round but more commonly they are used to
shatter something made brittle by the cryogenic fluid. If

a breaker round is used with the cryogenic fluid, this is
treated as a single attack. Alternatively the breaker can
be launched after the target has been given a thorough
hosing with cryogenic fluid. Either way, the end result is
to double the damage delivered by the cryogenic fluid.

LASER WEAPONS
Lasers are by far the commonest directed energy weapons on the battlefield. Their main drawback is an
inability to penetrate foliage and other minor obscurants, along with near-uselessness in heavy rain, dust or
mist. This has prevented lasers from being universally adopted, though they are popular with forces primarily
operating in a low-g environment.

Marketed by Personal Security Solutions, the BL-3 is
not intended for combat. It is a semi-covert weapon
for self-defence, favored by corporate executives who
like to pretend they are important enough to be in
danger. Those that enter the mercenary marketplace are
typically bought by personnel who must interact with
questionable clients.

The BL-3 has a short cylinder, usually of plain stainless
steel with a band around its circumference near one
end. This has a concealed section which acts as
a trigger when pushed with the thumb. Whilst not
actually disguised the BL-3 does not look like a weapon
and may not be noticed among paraphernalia on an
officer's desk or in an attaché case. It delivers three

laser shots – hence its full name of 'Bottled Lightning',
using disposable energy cartridges. These are held in a
screw-out section at the rear of the weapon and can be
replaced individually or all together. The process takes a
few minutes and is rather fiddly, however.

Although not a powerful weapon, the BL-3 has the
advantage of being almost completely silent. This may
enable the user to take additional enemies by surprise
if they do not realise what happened to the first target.
Marketing vids for this weapon depict a suave secret
agent effortlessly taking out four enemies – the last
by hurling the BL-3 at his head – but realistic users'
expectations are more modest. Nevertheless, as a silent
holdout weapon the BL-3 does have its uses.

**BL-3 EMERGENCY DEFENCE WEAPON**

The M-84 designation for this weapon was assigned
by one of the larger interstellar powers during trials,
and has become the standard identifier despite the
fact it was not adopted for service. The basic concept
was to create a battlefield laser weapon which could
be configured as a carbine, full-sized rifle or specialist
weapon. The resulting design required compromises
but has found favor with a number of low-g-trained
forces. It also serves as a personal weapon for some
forward observers, functioning as a designator as well
as combat carbine.

The weapon is supplied without a complex sighting
system, since some users choose to fit a holographic
sight rather than a physical one, and others have differing
preferences depending on the weapon's intended role.
The design is not modular in the sense that it is not
possible to remove and replace the barrel in a few
moments without tools. Mounting a different barrel in a
laser weapon is a delicate process requiring a workshop,
not difficult but requiring calibration. A badly mounted
barrel can absorb some of the laser's energy – in effect
the weapon shoots itself. This can have catastrophic
results, making modular laser weapons distinctly rare.

The M-84 has an internal power reserve good for 14
shots, but this is not sufficient for sustained combat.
Typically the weapon is used with a 3kg power pack
carried low on the user's back. This provides 2,100
Power, or 420 shots, which is likely to be more than
enough. A 1kg belt pack good for 140 shots is also
available for Cr1500.

When set up as a carbine the M-84 is limited by the
length of its barrel to 4D damage. Each shot still costs
5 Power. If configured as a rifle, usually with a full
stock, the weapon does 5D damage and has a greater
effective range. The rifle variant costs the same as the
carbine but weighs 5kg.

M-84 LASER WEAPON SYSTEM

Named after an ancient god of the first sunlight,
the Nefertem 'Personal Directed Energy Weapon'
is an entry-level laser pistol designed to be used in
conjunction with an external powerpack. Weapons of
this type are sometimes installed in spacecraft for the
defence of specific points, with power outlets located
at intervals. The concept is unpopular with most users,
since being tethered to a single location or trailing a
long power cord around can be a problem in combat.
However, as a means of saving the weapon's powerpack
for mobile use it has some advantages.

The Nefertem weapon is standard as laser pistols go,
though it has a longer than usual barrel. Range is
limited, as with all short-barrelled laser weapons, and
stopping power is at best modest. Nevertheless, the
weapon is sufficiently popular with merchant starship
security crews that it has become a household name in
the entry-level energy weapons market.

The standard powerpack for this weapon is a 1kg belt-
mounted unit with a capacity of Power 300. These
are drained at the rate of 3 per shot. The powerpack
is designed to plug into any standard power outlet for
charging. Aboard a starship or military vehicle this will
not cause any problems but civilian power systems

are not designed to support multiple lasers charging
at once. The power drain may be noticed or could trip
safety devices. Many hotels have a 'no laser charging'
rule, and signs indicating this are popular souvenirs
among Travellers who have broken this rule.

LAUNCHERS
Some launcher weapons are extremely simple, especially low-tech ones designed for use with 'dumb' projectiles, and
in some cases can be thrown together in a blacksmith's workshop. More advanced weapons incorporate electronics
or use complex materials that drive up their purchase price considerably. Ultimately, however, it is the warhead that
counts. Everything else is dedicated to getting it to the target.

The IP-2 is a disposable one-shot unguided rocket
launcher constructed from lightweight polymers. Its sole
purpose is to send a 50mm rocket-propelled grenade
on its way. The latter has a white phosphorous warhead
which creates a dense cloud of white smoke and may
pose a hazard to any personnel within the burst radius.
It is officially marketed as a 'battlefield concealment

A spigot mortar is one of the most basic methods of
launching a rocket-propelled grenade, and is typically
referred to simply as 'RPG' even though the term
properly applies to the projectile rather than the
launcher. The device itself is nothing more than a
hollow post with handles and a basic optical sighting
device. A rocket-propelled grenade is fitted to the
front of the weapon and launched in a shallow arc or
flat trajectory. Devices of this kind are typically used
for direct fire against armored vehicles or infantry

positions, but can pose a threat to grav vehicles and
aircraft. Dedicated RPG launchers of this type are
common among mid-tech forces that face a threat
from higher-tech militaries, and may be issued in
disproportionate numbers. The concept is reinvented at
TL8, when a basic guided version becomes available.
'Dumb' RPGs can still be launched from this weapon.
The standard spigot mortar costs Cr500 and weighs
10kg with a grenade in place. The guided variant costs
Cr1000 and adds the Smart trait.

The cost and weight of the weapon are calculated with
one anti-armor grenade in place, which is the usual
configuration. It is unusual, but not unknown, for users
to carry a mix of grenade types. However, the standard

role of these weapons is to engage armored vehicles
and every grenade of another type is extra weight to
carry which does not serve that purpose.

The Light Munitions Launcher is a magazine-fed semi-

roles. Its short barrel and bullpup configuration are well
suited to close-quarters work, and the limited effective

The two commonest loadouts for this weapon are
either guided antipersonnel fragmentation grenades
or multiple projectile shells. Loading is rarely mixed
as the grenades are launched in sequence, though a
squad preparing to breach a room or position might

try to set up a pre-selected sequence to maximise

One of the lightest TAC missile launchers available,
Xierbin's TMMS is designed to be carried by a team of
two infantry soldiers, one with the launcher and one
carrying a loaded missile magazine. Additional missiles
or magazines can be shared out among the squad. The
weapon is fed from a 2-round over-under magazine
located at the rear of the receiver. Launch takes place
directly from the magazine, which then rotates on a
pivot to present the second weapon. Once both have
been launched can be ejected and replaced with a fully
loaded magazine, or reloaded with loose missiles.

one anti-personnel and one anti-armor – and can
switch between the two by triggering the magazine
rotate function. A magazine with two missiles aboard

GRENADES AND WARHEAD DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Grenades and warhead weapons tend to fall into four categories. Those intended to directly inflict casualties are generally
of an explosive type, either as anti-personnel or anti-armor weapons, though other options are available. Those intended
to degrade the capabilities of an enemy typically use gas, flash or noise, possibly in the form of a stunning concussion
effect, and might be termed distraction grenades. The third type of grenade alters the tactical situation, usually by
obscuring vision or making laser-based devices ineffective. Smoke can also be used for signalling. Signalling grenades
typically use colours or – at higher Tech Levels – laser-reflective particles that can identify one pall of smoke from another.
Signalling grenades cost the same as a smoke grenade of the type but are little use as obscurants.

A typical light guided TAC missile, the AV-7 is
designated Tactical, Light, Multipurpose Anti-Vehicular
in most military directories. Its guidance electronics
and supporting sensors are capable of tracking fast-
moving targets at high and low altitude, though in
order to intercept fast-crossing targets the operator
must provide the missile with considerable lead. The
multimode warhead can be detonated as a fragmenting
charge to give the best chance of a hit on an aircraft,
or as a shaped-charge against armored targets. The
fragmentation effect is not intended for use against
personnel; it produces multiple large fragments rather
than a hail of smaller ones, and is likely to miss

something as small as an individual soldier. Proximity
detonation grants an additional DM+2 to hit vehicular
targets but significantly reduces damage. Missiles weigh
6kg and cost Cr12000.

A low-tech solution to the problem of armored
vehicles, the anti-armor grenade also offers marginal
capability against combat armor and battle dress. The
hand-thrown version is a weapon of utter desperation
against such opponents as it requires getting very
close and hoping the weapon hits cleanly. Even then,
the focussed plasma jet created by its shaped-charge
warhead is generally ineffective, but enough of these
weapons can make the battlefield unhealthy for
armored troops. A hand-thrown anti-armor grenade
costs Cr50 and weighs 0.5kg. The rifle grenade version,
with much better range and accuracy, costs Cr100 and
weighs 0.625kg.

**GRENADE, MINI,**

**MULTI-PURPOSE ANTI-PERSONNEL**

**GRENADE, MINE DELIVERY**

A small grenade with advanced fusing, these weapons
are often carried in threes. The advanced fuse allows
the grenade to be impact-fused or set to detonate
one to ten seconds after impact, or after a one to ten
second delay. A 'mine' setting also permits a grenade
to emplaced as a booby trap, detonating if disturbed.
Depending on the sensitivity chosen this may require
a sharp knock or something as minor as being tapped
by a door as it opens. The detonation power can also
be selected. Normally full power is chosen, creating a
blast type anti-personnel effect with small amount of
fragmentation. Damage can be selected as 1D, 2D or
3D, or the grenade can detonate in distraction mode
in which case is causes a Typical level distraction but
no damage. Multi-purpose grenades are expensive but
considered worth it by some users. A single grenade
weighs 0.3kg and costs Cr35.

Mine delivery grenades are unusual, but sometimes
used to deploy anti-personnel mines at a distance or in
inaccessible places. A mine delivery grenade is simply a
canister with a basic self-righting mechanism. Once in
place it can be remotely triggered or set to respond to a
certain level of vibration. This is a little random at times
but in theory a mine will activate when a person walks
within 2m of it. Anyone who knows what to look out for
can easily spot grenade-delivered mines in the open,
but even then their presence can impose delay. They are
commonly used as an early-warning system more than a
serious defence. The warhead can be any mini-grenade
type, though fragmentation and distraction types are
most common. Mine delivery grenades are only available
in standard cartridge and RAM grenade sizes.

Plasma grenades are rare among troops not equipped
with battle dress or combat armor, but sometimes
encountered as emergency weapons or extreme room-
clearance devices. The Smart-RAM grenade is designed
to be launched by one soldier and designated or actively
guided by another, though it can also be preprogramed
to travel to selected detonation point. The grenade
is capable of limited maneuver, so must be sent on
a trajectory that will bring it close to the intended
destination for the guidance to be effective.

The humble rifle grenade makes a resurgence once cheap
guidance kits become available. Basic guided grenades
are programmed with a location and launched in a
high arc, using inertial location or feeds from a satellite
communications network to alter their trajectory using
movable fins. A more advanced version is available for use
against armored targets. This is guided to the general
target location the same way, but then seeks the outlines
and signatures of a selected class of target. Usually this
will be lightly armored vehicles but grenades can be
programmed to seek battle dress-equipped infantry. A
top-attack profile makes these weapons useful against
lightly armored vehicles, and at least they will force
commanders to button up and stay behind armor. Basic
guidance adds Cr50 to the price of the grenade; terminal
seeking adds another Cr100 on top.

A cheap and often marginal solution to the problem
of armored vehicles and fortified positions, an RPG
typically carries a shaped-charge warhead capable
of damaging lightly armored vehicles. Grenades of
this type are cheaply made in mid-tech factories and
generally bought in large numbers. Accurate shooting
with an unguided rocket weapon is problematic,
making short-range ambush or massed fire the best
tactic. An anti-armor RPG costs Cr150 when bought
singly and weighs 5kg.

**PERSONAL EQUIPMENT**

**CHAPTER-SIX**

Personal equipment ranges from humble boots to
advanced electronic devices. The variations on offer
can be bewildering, but mercenaries typically avoid
gimmicky one-trick-pony items and extremes of high

and low price. Cost-effectiveness is usually the deciding
factor in choosing what equipment to issue to a unit,
though individuals may decide to provide themselves with
something a little more capable.

DEVICES
Many of the devices used by mercenaries are also found in specialist industries where protection or specific capabilities
are needed. Others are unique to the military marketplace. Civilians outside specialist industries may find it difficult to
obtain these devices, but they are generally available from mercenary outfitters.

Thermal regulation units are built into some advanced
armor, but more commonly available as a separate
item. Typically carried on an equipment belt and
connected to an environment suit or advanced field
dress, a thermal regulation unit acts as a heat sink
most of the time. It contains a gel with an extremely
high specific heat capacity, which can store thermal
energy taken from a suit or piece of equipment.
Devices of this kind can be used to cool suitably
adapted weapons, allowing protracted periods of rapid
fire, or can reduce the thermal signature of a soldier
wearing appropriate clothing.

If used to reduce thermal signature, a chill can
is good for around four hours, during which time
the user's thermal signature is reduced almost to
background levels. This imposes DM-4 on attempts
to detect, track or target the individual using thermal
sensors. By the end of the period the unit is saturated
and thermal suppression is lost. The gel does not
reach high temperatures; little more than the user's
body temperature, but a can could be deliberately
ruptured to create a thermal decoy. The unit can

('CHILL CAN')

protect the user against unpleasantly hot conditions
rather than reducing thermal signature, and in an
emergency a reverse reaction can be triggered which
introduces an additional chemical into the gel. This
produces a modest amount of heat which can be put
back into a suit to protect the user from cold.

If a chill can is used as a heat sink for weapons, it has a
capacity of 100 points of Heat. Each 25 points of Heat
reduces the duration of thermal signature reduction by
1 hour.

Faraday weave is a web of ultrafine metallic threads
within or under the fabric of a garment, camouflage
net or covering. The threads are too fine to provide any
protection from electromagnetic pulse; the induced
current will make them hot, possibly sufficiently so to
set fire to the garment or harm the wearer. However,
lower-intensity electromagnetic waves will be absorbed
and dissipated, concealing whatever is underneath.
The weave will also conceal low-level electromagnetic
emissions from equipment. Faraday weave is quite
expensive, costing Cr250 to install in a set of clothes or a
3x3m covering. A small belt-mounted power and control
device, costing Cr500, adds an additional capability;
whereas faraday weave normally blocks waves and
conceals what is behind it – but is itself very obvious

- the control device can be set to match the incoming
emissions, effectively rendering whatever it is covered in
invisible to radar and similar sensors. This is not perfect
but imposes DM-4 on attempts to detect the user with
radar and similar emissions.

**MATCH TARP**

A match tarp is a one-use camouflage device. Before
use it is a dull matte grey colour but when spread on
the ground its underside scans the terrain beneath and
triggers chemical changes in the upper side to match
it almost perfectly. A person or object placed under the
tarp will be almost perfectly concealed, and the tarp will

also spread out any thermal signature to make it far less
obvious. Once activated, the changes are permanent
but the tarp remains effective in the same terrain. A 3m
square tarpaulin – which is also weatherproof – costs
Cr250, whilst a smaller version large enough to cover a
prone sniper and weapon costs Cr150.

**THERMAL REGULATION COVERING**

A thermal regulation covering is supplied in a form
that can be used as a blanket or poncho, as half of a
field shelter, a groundsheet or a thermal camouflage
device. As a shelter or poncho it is normally worn
with the 'cool' side outward, keeping the wearer warm
whilst reducing their thermal signature. Turned around,
the covering will leech heat away from the user and
radiate it outside. This has a cooling effect and can
also be used as a distress or target-marking beacon. A
heat source placed under a thermal regulation covering
will create a large share of high thermal radiation
unlikely to be missed by sensors.

On its own a thermal regulation covering passively
provides thermal protection and dispersion sufficient
to provide DM+2 on all checks to resist harm from
cold or hot conditions, and DM-2 to attempts to spot
or target the user if used as camouflage. When used
with a small (pocket-sized) battery pack it can create
a warm shelter for some days, and with a chill can will
reduce the wearer's thermal signature to match the
surroundings. A standard thermal regulation covering
costs Cr50, with versions intended to fit a particular
environment or to match a sniper's camouflage costing
up to Cr150.

CLOTHING AND ARMOR
It is rare for any but the largest mercenary units to use custom-made equipment, and this applies equally to clothing and
armor. Day-to-day items like t-shirts and socks can be obtained commercially or ordered from a local supplier, whilst
uniforms tend to be selected from a range of items offered by mercenary outfitters. By selecting a combination of clothing
items, colours and configurable insignia, a unit can create a distinctive uniform without going to the expense of setting up
a bespoke outfit.

Most mercenary units have clothing for different occasions. Working dress is worn most of the time, and typically consists
of coveralls in the unit's style. Field dress is similar but more attention may be paid to camouflage. Field dress is intended
to be worn with body armor and combat equipment, and usually has attachment points for the unit's standard field
equipment. Most, but by no means all, units have a formal uniform. Mercenaries are rarely concerned with ceremony but
may need to look presentable to impress a client or when working with one under non-combat conditions. Full mess dress
uniform is very rare among mercenary units. The largest sometimes use it, as do some highly pretentious formations, but
as a rule a unit whose combat reputation does not justify frippery will attract ridicule.

Although commonly referred to as a uniform, discreet
operations clothing can be tailored in almost any style.
Operators may need to pass as ordinary civilians, or to
wear formal uniform but be ready for action. A discreet
operations uniform is tailored from light ballistic cloth
and has pockets suitable for concealing a handgun
and some small items of equipment. It is favored by
officers who have to do a lot of liaison work and cannot
be seen to be armed or mistrustful of their clients, but
also sees considerable use by covert-operations forces.

The uniform grants Protection +2 without appearing to
do so, and can be paired with what is inevitably known
as an 'indiscreet operations kit' consisting of a flak
jacket and associated supporting equipment. This is
normally black or green, but can be produced in other
colours. At a distance, someone wearing the full kit
might not attract notice but anyone taking a proper
look at the wearer will notice magazine pouches and an
obvious military styling even if the wearer does not have
a visible weapon. When paired up with the flak jacket
the kit offers Protection +6.

An environment suit is not necessarily a piece
of military equipment. Hazardous-environment
workers use them, since they bridge the gap
between full vacuum protection and exposure
to airborne hazards. An environment suit is a
coverall-like garment with detachable boots and
gloves. It includes a hood which seals to a face
mask to give complete protection but is often
paired with a full helmet and/or chest unit.

On its own, an environment suit affords the
wearer Protection +3 against conventional
threats and an additional Protection +3 against
heat or cold attacks. Its belt unit has space
for an air bottle, rebreather unit and up to two
external thermal regulation units. With these in
place the suit can be made active, increasing
its defence against heat and cold to a total of
Protection +12. The suit can also be tuned to be
thermally neutral, or close to it, with respect to
its surroundings. This feature is rarely used in
industry but is useful to mercenaries.

A shoulder-and-helmet unit is available to pair
up with the suit. This is a full, sealed helmet
which provides better head and neck protection
than the flexible hood, and is heavier but more

Field dress bought in bulk tends to be serviceable
and hard-wearing but offers few benefits beyond
that. Enhanced field dress incorporates technological
advances to protect the user, including a technique
known as 'thermal dulling' whereby the wearer's thermal
signature is reduced and made fuzzy. This imposes
DM-1 on attempts to detect or target the wearer using
thermal systems. In addition, a suit of enhanced field
dress provides Protection +1 which stacks with other
armor worn over the top. Enhanced field dress is
not entirely impervious to airborne chemical agents
but does provide DM+1 to resist the effects of skin-
absorbed agents. The wearer needs an enclosed helmet
or breathing system to receive this protection from
airborne agents but would benefit from it when dashing
through a contaminated area without breathing, or in

three sets of working dress, two sets of field dress and
one formal uniform to the unit's specifications. Formal

ELECTRONICS
Military electronics tends to be more robust and resistant to hazards like electromagnetic pulses than civilian
devices, though usually capabilities are about the same. Indeed, once the device is opened up it may well be exactly
the same as a civilian model, just housed in a milspec rugged case with a matte green finish. Military electronics
systems are always more expensive than their civilian counterparts, so units on a budget will often make do with
those. However, all military systems have at least some basic protection against hacking and electronic warfare – and
perhaps more importantly they have interoperability protocols which allow them to interface with other standardised
military systems.

A military portacomp can be plugged straight into an information or systems control net and used as soon as the
security protocols are satisfied. A civilian model would require additional software and possibly an external drive
containing the necessary operating system patches and interfacing software. Milspec electronics almost always has a
set of security protocols that impose a negative DM on attempts to hack or interfere with the system equal to 1 plus
1 per 2 full Tech Levels above the intruding system. This is in addition to any anti-intrusion software

**AUTOHACK**

Autohacks are palm-sized devices designed to crack
commonly available electronic security systems. They
are not creative or clever, but programmed to recognize
common security systems and automatically apply
exploits or make a targeted attack. Some systems require
all software producers to leave a backdoor for the security
services, in which case a properly authorized autohack
need do no more than input a request code. Autohacks
are useless against any system they do not know but
extremely useful in getting past mass-market security
software that would otherwise pose a significant problem.

Possession of autohacks is highly restricted, with black
market devices commanding high prices. Mercenary
units can usually obtain a license for the standard
autohack without undue difficulty, though their use will
occasionally be audited. A preprogramed autohack might
be provided for a particular mission, in which case it will
have been set up to defeat the target's security even if it
would normally be immune.

For example, a mercenary unit has been hired to
retrieve certain items from the evidence lockers of a
local police force. The cops are using a commercially
available security system – quite a good one in fact.
A standard autohack will defeat the security on most
personal devices found in the building, as these use
common systems 'known' to the unit, but it does not
have the tools to attack the specialist system at the
police station as its vulnerabilities are not widely known.
However, the client has obtained enough information
to put together a package that should be able to defeat
the system, and added it to a standard autohack. The
mercenaries now have a single autohack that can get
them through doors or into inventory systems. If it is not
available at any point they will have to use conventional
intrusion methods to get into the computer system or
parts of the building.

Autohacks require no skill to operate. They will normally
be able to interface with nearby electronic systems
without contact, but systems that do not communicate
wirelessly require access to the network. This may
require finding a suitable port, but from TL10 upwards
autohacks can use a close-contact induction system to
communicate with electronics that are not well shielded.
Military systems are generally immune to this form of
attack, but most commercially available networks are
not. A single action, such as opening a locked door or
gaining control over a camera, takes 1Dx10 seconds if it
is possible at all. Only one attempt can be made at any
one system – either the autohack can get in or it cannot.
Its chance of doing so is based on Tech Level but may be
modified for good or bad system security. If the Autohack
is of lower TL than the security system an additional
DM-1 applies for each TL below.

A comm scrambler is a small device usually fitted
inside the case of a standard personal comm or into a
port on a civilian portacomp. Normally, civilian devices
transmit and receive a standard code and style of
encryption for the network. This includes sufficient
encryption to secure comms against casual intrusion
but a comm scrambler provides much greater security
by making the signal indecipherable to the system's
own software. Another scrambler or a military device
with the correct decryption codes can read signals,
but anyone else would have to undertake a serious
decryption effort. More advanced units provide greater
security; DM-1 applies to any attempt to decrypt
scrambled comms per Tech Level the scrambler is
above the decryption system.

Interface boxes are a cheap and simple way to make
civilian electronic devices compatible with military
equipment. An interface box fits to an external port
on the device and allows physical and electronic
connection to a military network. The device contains
a small computer which translates signals going
in and out of the civilian device, essentially acting
as a translator. The interface box provides some
measure of electronic security to the device, but if it
can be bypassed the civilian device behind it is still
vulnerable to intrusion whereas a full military unit has
integrated protection.

**MILITARY PORTACOMP**

**MULTIFUNCTION ELECTRONIC DEVICE**

A military portacomp is housed in a lightly armored
case which will provide Protection +6 to the contents
or anyone hiding behind it. Cases are usually 'security
black' or 'military green' but do come in other
'tactical' colours. The case is ruggedised, as are the
internal components, and it will act as a faraday
cage when closed. If a Traveller has time to slam the
portacomp shut it will survive all but the most powerful
electromagnetic pulse attacks. A military portacomp
has interface systems for most standard equipment
so can be used to control or program a point defence
system, or undertake intelligence analysis work.
Capabilities are not dissimilar to civilian equipment of
the same Tech Level.

A Multifunction Electronic Device, or MED, is a small
wrist-mounted computer capable of being programmed
to interface with all common battlefield electronics.
Depending on the user's needs it can be set up to
control Smart-RAM grenades in flight, display sensor
data from a drone, monitor remote sensors, detonate
a charge on command, or all of those. An MED has
a modest amount of processing power and can run
guidance programs, but typically acts as an interface
rather than handling complex tasks itself.

**TACTICAL RELAY NETWORK**

It is possible to coordinate the actions of a small unit
using personal communications equipment, but as the
size of a force increases this becomes problematic.
At its most basic a tactical relay network organises
radio traffic into groups and channels. At TL6, when
the system first becomes available, this is done by
a manual operator but the role is soon taken over by
dedicated electronic systems.

A tactical relay network operates as a set of local
nodes, with members of different groups having access
to some or all available channels; members of first
section have their own internal comms, as does the
support section. Section leaders are tied in to the
platoon command net, and the platoon commander
is in the company command group. Automated
systems can devolve access if a sub-unit's command
transmitted goes offline, and most networks have
an emergency override that allows any member to
transmit right across the network if necessary. The
technological sophistication of the relay limits the
level of the Tactics skill that can be applied using it,
though a commander who can communicate directly is
not so limited. Thus the leader of a squad can always
use their full Tactics ability, but a commander two
kilometers away can only assist to the level permitted
by the network.

From TL8, visual information is shared in real time,
and in addition to radio sets the unit's members
are given body-worn or helmet cameras, and/or
gun cameras. These have provided a great deal of
evidence at inquiries over the years, and have useful
applications as training and debrief aids. TL9+ units
also project a holographic map of the battle zone with
individuals and groups marked by their transponder
codes. It takes a skilled user to make sense of all the
data but a commander can – in theory at least – see
where everyone is, how much ammunition they have
left, and whether they are injured.

A tactical relay network consists of a central relay
unit, housed in an 8kg backpack, and personal
equipment to be issued to each member of the unit.
The cost of the central unit depends on the size of
the network desired.

Platoon Network: Up to 50 users, Cr25000
Company Network: Up to 250 users: Cr100000
Battalion Network: Up to 1,000 users: Cr 250000

Increasing technological sophistication improves
performance rather than bringing cost down, and
individual-issue equipment must be purchased for
every user.

SENSORS AND TARGETING AIDS
Beyond immediate 'point and shoot' combat, one of the most decisive factors in battle is the quality of sighting aids.
Those that fit on a weapon are considered to be weapon accessories, but more sophisticated equipment is often
carried on the soldier's person, receiving input from sensors on the soldier's own weapon and possibly remote sensor
feeds too. Typically the resulting images and prompts are displayed on a helmet visor or similar physical surface but
can be projected as a hologram at a location designated by the user.

**BALLISTIC LOCATION SENSOR**

**BATTLEFIELD COORDINATION UNIT**

This detects the sound of a gunshot or similar weapon
and attempts to pinpoint its location using a map
of the surrounding area. Multiple echoes off the
walls of an urban area can complicate the process,
but the system can 'learn' the sound patterns of its
surroundings to make zeroing in on the location easier
with successive shots. Once set up the operator can
make an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check
to locate the source of a weapon discharge by using
its physical signature. The check is modified by the
weapon's signature level and any other factors such
as acoustically complex terrain. A cumulative DM+1
applies to subsequent from the same position by a
weapon of similar type.

At TL9, an improved version becomes available which
can automatically control an attached weapon. The
weapon must be on a tripod or support mount to
which the auto-aiming device is attached. It can be
set to automatically return fire with a single shot,
multiple attacks or not at all depending on the user's
preferences at the time. It does not include a weapon
or mount for one.

A battlefield coordination unit is a backpack-sized
communications and administration center. Its
holographic display can project maps and images as
well as sensor input, and the unit can undertake limited
analysis to suggest likely meanings of data. For example,
the unit can cross-reference incoming passive sensor
information on the emissions of an enemy unit with other
known data to produce an estimate of the formation's
composition and state of readiness. A battlefield
coordination unit grants DM+1 on Tactics checks and
related tasks, such as requesting artillery fire on a very
precise location. The whole unit weighs 6kg, or about
twice that if stands, folding stools and other comfort
accessories are included.

A personal HUD provides the user with data as well
as a targeting prompt. It is usually controlled from
a wrist-mounted device, with some pre-set voice
commands. The device can project any data available
to it, and if a communications net is available it can
interrogate nearby civilian databases or communicate
with them. On the battlefield its primary function is to
provide a targeting prompt in the form of an aim point
superimposed on an image of the target. Various display

devices are available, ranging from a helmet visor to a
pair of designer shades. A HUD grants DM+2 on attack
rolls at all ranges, for any weapon it is keyed to. It costs
Cr1500 and weighs 0.5kg, and comes with pickups for
one weapon. A set for an additional weapon requires an
hour or so to fit and calibrate. There is no real limit on
how many weapons can be calibrated to one HUD. At

CLOSEGUARD SEMI-AUTONOMOUS
POINT DEFENCE SYSTEM

**SUPPORT WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-SEVEN**

Support weaponry includes weapons too large and/or
heavy to be carried and operated by a single infantry
soldier without the assistance of powered armor. It

ranges from heavy machineguns and similar weapons to
light artillery and aerospace defence equipment.

The Closeguard system is designed to provide short-
range defence against ground, air and missile
threats. It is aimed at the mid-price market, and
sacrifices top-end capability for reliability and ease of
maintenance. Although constructed at TL9 the system
has the ability to use lower-tech components in most
areas if necessary. The unit is housed in a robust but
unarmored cylindrical mounting which has three
detachable legs allowing it to be emplaced in the field.
If these are removed, the unit can be installed in a
vehicle or aboard a watercraft with a minimum of hull
penetrations. This takes up 1 Space. A standardised
connector block allows power to be fed to the unit
and command signals to be received, but the internal
batteries are good for 36 hours or more of deployed
use with no external power feed. The unit can be
programmed or directly controlled with a dedicated
portacomp, either by direct cable connection or local-
area radio link. The latter has the disadvantage of being
vulnerable to electronic warfare.

The Closeguard unit has its own short-range radar and
thermal sensors mounted atop the receiver block of
the primary weapon. This is usually a rapid-fire twin-
mounted machinegun with an augmented cooling
system, but variants do exist. A pair of TES-12 laser
support weapons, usually set up to fire an instant apart
to increase the likelihood of a hit, is a popular upgrade
for those units that can afford the extra Cr40000 or so,
or a twin rapid-fire heavy machinegun can be mounted
instead. Closeguard is popular as a cheap anti-missile
unit but has a loyal following as a 'homicidal sentry that
never sleeps'. Units that employ it in this mode can set
exemptions so their own people will not be attacked
providing they carry the correct IFF transponder. The
unit may still open fire on large passing wildlife, though
its targeting parameters are generally good enough that
it can tell a deer from a human.

The Closeguard unit has Point Defence 2; it can
engage two targets of the same general type – ground,
high airborne or low airborne – in a given round. Its
automatic targeting system provides DM+2 to hit.

The origins of the term 'Ma Deuce' for a heavy
machinegun date back to old Earth, where the definitive
heavy machinegun was designated M2. More advanced
weapons fulfilling the same role ended up being referred
to by the same nickname, until eventually a whole
family of similar but more advanced weapons emerged.
These are known as the 'MDD family', from 'Ma Deuce's
Daughters'. Governments have their own designations
for specific members of the family, but to the typical
mercenary they are all the Beautiful Daughters of Old
Lady Deuce. This in turn leads to jargon that can seem
incomprehensible to the average civilian, but a mercenary
who hears 'Mike Two Delta on the field!' knows there is a
heavy automatic weapon nearby. Whether that is a good
thing depends on which side is using it.

MDD INFANTRY SUPPORT
WEAPON SYSTEM

The most common form of the MDD type is a heavy
automatic weapon in the 12-15mm range. Most users
have standardised on 15mm as the standard light
anti-vehicle/anti-materiel/heavy antipersonnel weapon.
It is just about possible for an infantry squad to lug a
dismantled MDD-15 into position, though normally they
are emplaced or mounted on vehicles. 50-round lengths
of belt are standard when setting up a weapon, but any
length can be produced by fixing sections together.

The 'Porky' consists of a baseplate weighing 3kg,
with fittings for two rows of six rifle grenades. The
baseplate can be angled to set up a spread of grenades
aimed at a rough point 50-100m from the launcher.
No grenades are supplied, but typically explosive
warheads are preferred. Used with 'dumb' grenades

weapon, which can be relied upon to saturate an area
with explosives. Grenades can be launched singly or in
any combination, and will generally scatter quite badly.
As a result the Porcupine is rarely seen in use with
dumb grenades by forces with access to higher-tech
equipment. When paired with more advanced grenades
it can be very deadly.

TES-12 is an acronym for Targeted Energy Support,
TL12. This weapon is often encountered as an infantry
support/designation system and aboard vehicles for
anti-personnel work. It is long and heavy, and not well
suited to fluid actions, but hits hard for a laser weapon.
The near-instantaneous arrival of the laser bolt is useful
in some sniping situations, and the weapon can be used
as a designator whether delivering damaging fire or
purely as an artillery direction system. If used purely as
a designator the power drain is negligible.

**TES-12 LASER SUPPORT WEAPON**

The TES-12 has an internal powerpack good for around
125 shots, which is enough for a short action, but is
often used with a 3kg external power unit. This costs
Cr 7500 and has Power 3,000. It may be carried by
the weapon's user if operating solo but more commonly
the support weapon gunner is provided with a spotter/
security team of 1-2 additional personnel who carry

MILITARY VARIANT

**SUPPORT EQUIPMENT**

**CHAPTER-EIGHT**

A great variety of support equipment is available to
mercenary units. Generally multipurpose equipment is
preferred but some problems require a specific solution.
Whilst many pieces of supporting equipment are readily

carried by one person, larger items are normally either
mounted on a vehicle or carried in one and deployed to
a static position.

PERSONAL AND GENERAL EQUIPMENT
There is a limit to how much personal equipment a mercenary can carry in the field. Those who try to bring along
device for every occasion find themselves overloaded and unable to function properly. On the other hand, there are
some situations that cannot be resolved without the correct tools. Choosing the correct equipment for the task at
hand is one of the hidden skills required by successful mercenaries.

Automedics are used by some civilians in hazardous
environments and by dignitaries who may face threats
to their lives. These devices are part monitor, part
autoinjector. They monitor the user's life signs and
blood chemistry, and can provide detailed information
to a physician if needed. Under certain specific
circumstances the unit can inject painkillers, antidotes
to common toxins, stimulants, sedatives or whatever
else the user needs. Specialist drugs are often delivered
this way, such as regular doses required to keep a
chronic condition at bay or stop a medical episode early.

Military automedics take this function a stage further.
Like the civilian variant they must be tailored to a
specific individual but can carry requirements of
other members of a unit as a backup. This 'buddy
system' allows treatment of others if necessary. In
addition, the automedic can be preconfigured to react
to external stimuli, for example delivering an antidote
to tranq gas as soon as it is detected in the air rather
than waiting for it to enter the user's system. Military
automedics can also administer combat drugs either
at the command of the user or – if access has been
granted – from a remote location.

Military Automedic 11 0.2 Cr17500

They are configured to dispense a single dose of Fast
drug should it ever be needed. If the wearer is seriously
injured or dying (two or three physical attributes at zero)
the automedic will automatically use the Fast drug if
available and there is no risk of overdose. The user can
manually activate the drug at any time if needed.

**SUPPORT COOLING UNIT**

Although primarily associated with support weaponry,
the 'SCU' has become a ubiquitous piece of equipment.
Some use replaceable consumables whilst others
are based on more conventional heat exchangers. A
consumable based unit weighs 5kg plus 1kg per 'chill
can' it can hold. Using a forced heat exchange, the SCU
removes heat from a weapon or an area and stores it in
the disposable cans. Removing the expended cans and
burying them – or sending them off for environmentally
friendly recycling, depending on the unit – is a simple
and not very onerous task which is nevertheless
despised by most military personnel.

Conventional SCUs use a high-capacity heat storage
fluid which can, in an emergency, be dumped and
replaced with fresh fluid. Depositing large quantities of
hot semi-liquid gel creates a large heat signature which
can be useful as a decoy if well positioned, or even as a
booby trap. More commonly, heat is dissipated through

a system of radiators, allowing the gel to return to liquid
form and be reused. A conventional SCU weighs 10kg
and can hold 50 Heat per kg of cooling fluid. This is
stored in tanks which must be purchased separately.

An SCU doubles the rate at which heat is removed from
a weapon with an advanced cooling system, providing
it is properly connected. Dissipating heat through the
system's radiators is at the rate of 1 Heat per minute
per set of radiators, but this does create a significant
thermal signature. Reducing the rate by a factor of five
allows the thermal plume to be largely concealed.

SCU units can be used to heat an area using residual
stored heat or to cool one, and heat thus obtained can
be stored for an extended period rather than dissipating.
For this reason SCUs have become a standard climate
control system for living areas and work spaces which
need a constant temperature.

**BREACHING CHARGE**

**DEMOLITION BLOCK**

EXPLOSIVES AND DEMOLITION CHARGES
Explosives come in two basic types, known as high and low explosive. High explosives detonate very quickly, creating
a cutting action when emplaced correctly. Low explosives may not explode as such, but instead deflagrate; that
is, they burn very quickly producing a pushing action. Both are useful to mercenaries who know how to emplace
charges correctly.

A breaching charge typically takes the form of a light
frame which can be unfolded and stuck to a wall
or door with self-adhesive pads. Upon command it
detonates in a manner that cuts the target, causing a
hole large enough to move quickly through. A charge
is sufficient to breach a section of domestic wall or
an internal door but will not significantly damage
heavier structures.

Item TL Kg Cost
Breaching Charge 7 2 Cr100

Explosives are typically issued in convenient
amounts, with training geared to how many blocks
are to be used for any given task rather than requiring
precise calculations. A demolition block is composed
of plastic explosive that can be moulded to any
shape needed. It is extremely stable and cannot be
detonated by impact or heat. A small explosion such
as that provided by a detonator is required. Two
blocks, applied correctly, are sufficient to sever a
30cm steel I-beam.

Item TL Kg Cost
Demolition Block 7 0.5 Cr100

If used as a grenade, a demolition block explosive
produces a small blast effect which is destructive
in a modest radius. Properly tamped or used to
project loose debris, the effect is far more deadly. An
explosive charge does Damage 1D plus 1D per two
additional demolition blocks. Blast trait is 1 plus 1
per 2 full dice of damage, or 1 plus 1 full dice of
damage if used to project debris as a booby trap or
pipe bomb.

**DEMOLITION CHARGE**

**DEMOLITION CHARGE, NUCLEAR**

A standard demolition charge consists of 12 demolition
blocks plus detonators, wires and basic electronic
timers/receivers allowing a range of charges to be put
together. It is supplied in a carrying satchel with a few
basic tools. If used as a weapon, for example thrown
into an enemy foxhole, the charge as a whole would
do 6D damage with Blast 4. If detonated in a confined
space or in contact with an object, for example thrown
onto the engine deck of a tank or under it, damage to
the target is doubled.

Nuclear demolition charges are not commonly available
but may be improvised by mercenaries or issued under
desperate circumstances. A nuclear demolition charge
is sometimes called a 'suitcase nuke', though it is too
big to fit in one. Yield is normally in the 0.1kt range –
equivalent to around 100 tons of conventional explosive

- which is sufficient to totally destroy most buildings or
small installations.

MINES AND MINE MODIFICATIONS
Basic anti-personnel mines become available at TL4-5, but those purchased by the typical mercenary unit are
rather more advanced. Advanced mines are more difficult to detect and more reliable both in terms of triggering and
effect. Mines can be set to detonate after a random period or instructed to do so by remote signal, making clearance
operations dangerous, or can be command detonated. More commonly they are simply left lying around for the
unwary to step on, and can usually be rendered safe by a remote encoded signal.

A variety of modifications are available for land mines. The commonest involve means of delivery and construction.
FASCAM (field artillery scattered mines) are designed to be launched from an artillery piece, and air-dropped
versions are similar. Delivery is rather random but a wide danger area can be created with multiple shells. Converting
mines for remote delivery adds 25% to their cost.

Low-observable (stealth) mines use non-magnetic materials and, in extreme cases, exotic explosives to reduce the
chance of detection by chemical sniffers. The Stealth modifications found on page 35 can be applied to mines,
imposing a negative DM to anyone trying to detect them.

**MINE, ANTIPERSONNEL**

**MINE, ANTI-VEHICLE**

Anti-personnel mines can be small, intended to injure a
foot, or a more lethal type which flings a fragmentation
charge up, detonating at a height likely to cause the
greatest injury. Variants include the cascade mine, which
flings a cluster of microgrenades up when triggered.
These detonate at random between 0.5-2.5m from the
ground, creating a lethal fragmentation zone. Micro
mines are intended to deter pursuit. They are armed
by striking a resilient surface such as the ground, and
detonate either a pre-set time later or upon contact
with the next person passing. Micro mines are not very
powerful but can seriously injure a foot. Alarm mines
do not have a lethal payload but either launch a flare
or detonate a distraction round equivalent to a small
grenade. This has the joint effect of alerting sentries that
something is amiss and startling an intruder, thus making
them slow to react to whatever the sentries decide to do.

Anti-Vehicle mines are intended to attack a vehicle

seriously harm a tank. Large directional mines can blast
right through the belly armor of an AFV.

Directional mines are designed to fling small projectiles

- typically ball bearings – in a cone out from the mine's
'danger' face. Blast radius in this case refers to the
area in which its explosive effect will endanger anyone
nearby. Range is the distance projectiles will travel
downrange. A directional mine is treated as a Typical
Area Fire attack.

DEFENSIVE EQUIPMENT
A variety of defensive equipment is available for the protection of troops in the field. Most are advanced versions of
concepts that have been in use for centuries, updated either for ease of deployment and use or greater effectiveness.

Fackles – a term derived from 'field obstacles' – are
tubes approximately 1m long and weighing 10kg each.
When deployed, three sets of spikes are unfolded from
the center and points 1/3 and 2/3 along the tube. This
can be done manually but in an emergency a fackle
can be flung down, causing its spring-loaded spikes to
unfold violently. This does cause the device to jump
unpredictably before settling, so is not a preferred
option. Short chains housed inside the tube allow
multiple fackles to be fixed together, creating a barrier
held in place by its own weight or fixed down with
additional spikes driven into the ground.

Fackles are primarily useful in creating a secured
area or breaking up an assault headed for a position

- essentially functioning like barbed wire or archaic
chevaux-de-frise. A determined person can bypass the
spikes by making an Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity)
check, but this requires either careful movement or
a reckless jump. Failure inflicts Damage 2D and may
leave the victim stuck. Some fackles have a small

sensor unit which serves primarily as a security alarm
to detect anyone clambering over the fence. It can also
be tied into a battlefield sighting system to indicate the
chest height of a person moving between the spikes,
granting DM+2 on attempts to shoot someone as they
cross the barrier.

SkySpotter Drone 7 2 Cr50

**SENSORFENCE**

Item TL Kg Cost
Sensorfence 9 4 Cr500

A sensorfence consists of a set of six posts that can be
driven into the ground or stood on their removable bases.
The posts mount small sensor arrays including thermal
and optical cameras, vibration sensors and magnetic
anomaly detectors. If positioned no more than 20m apart
they communicate with one another and with the control
station. Additional posts from another kit can be added to
network if necessary.

In passive mode the fence will detect and track
movement nearby and alert the user. Data can be used
to accurately target an intruder with any weapons tied
into the sensor net. This includes detonating a grenade
directly above them or perhaps bracketing them with
flashbangs. In active mode the fence has more options.
It can project an 'ultrasonic fence' between the posts
that will discourage most animals from approaching and
makes some people feel a sense of unease. Weapons
can also be set up to automatically fire on anyone in the
fence's protected zone who lacks the correct transponder.

DRONES
Drones differ from robots in that they do not have complex control mechanisms. Some drones are capable of limited
decision-making whilst others require control from a remote operator, but even the most sophisticated drones
require specific programming or the selection of pre-programmed options and cannot decide to deviate from their
instructions. Most have a 'please advise' function triggered by an unexpected situation or one in which none of
the drone's programmed options applies, but even so drones are notorious for blindly carrying on a mission despite
totally changed circumstances.

SkySpotter is one of a great many very basic
reconnaissance drones available from TL7 upwards.
It carries forward and sideways looking optical and
thermal cameras, but little else. SkySpotter takes the
form of a hand-thrown miniature aircraft powered by a
'pusher' propeller. It is quiet and fairly small but tends
to be rather obvious to anyone looking out for such craft.
The drone can be directly controlled using a selected-
waypoint system which requires no special skill beyond
a familiarization period, or can fly a pre-set course.
Its batteries are good for about 2 hours of operation.

A control station is available but a SkySpotter drone
can be controlled from any personal computer using
software that comes free with every drone.

Aerodagger Drone 8 2.5 Cr500
Aerodagger Cluster (6) 8 12 Cr2000

Aerodagger is a ground-launched drone using rocket
propulsion to reach an altitude of up to 1km. It then
guides itself using stub wings and, like other non-
grav drones, can only function in a Thin or denser
atmosphere. The drone's sole purpose is to deliver a
warhead to a suitable target, which must be within
10km of the launch site. This can be pre-programmed,
but the user has an option to set target selection
criteria. These are fairly basic, with options such as
personnel, light vehicle, transport vehicle, artillery
weapon and electronic equipment. Aerodagger is not
very cost-effective when attacking personnel but can
be used to harass hostiles or attack otherwise hidden
enemies. It can deliver a warhead equivalent to any
standard grenade, which must be bought separately.
Targeting software is adequate, giving DM+1 to attack
any target that can be identified by its optical and
thermal outline.

Battle Mule is one of several supply-and-reloading
drones on the market. It takes the form of a low,
lightly armored box with six large balloon tyres
similar to those of an all-terrain vehicle. It can cross
calm water without preparation using its tyres for
buoyancy and is agile enough to deal with rough
terrain. Battle Mule has two internal compartments.
The larger one is purely cargo stowage and can
carry 50kg of ammunition or various supplies. The
smaller compartment can be configured for cargo by
removing the automatic reloading equipment, but is

more commonly used as a field loader when in direct
support of a unit. The auto-reloader carries 1,000-
2,000 rounds of ammunition, depending on calibre,
in its ready hopper. It can reload standard magazines
for up to three different weapons or ammunition types
at once. Actual reloading takes one combat round
but inserting an empty magazine or taking a full one
out is a minor action for the soldier. The ammunition
hopper can be reloaded using pre-packaged or loose
ammunition. A box of 1,000 rounds typically weighs
around 10kg.

Battle Mule can be used to conduct semi-autonomous
resupply operations to forward positions or even troops
on the move, or can accompany a force in the field. It is
a large target, and despite programming to use terrain
as cover Battle Mules tend to be put out of action on
a frequent basis. The drone has Protection +12 and
takes 40 hits to disable. A variant has recently reached
the maetplace which trades the cargo and reloading
areas for a very cramped operator station. The operator
kneels with their legs inside the cargo space and most

of their torso sticking out. A raised, folding shield is
fitted to the front and sides, which can be swung out to
provide mobile cover for two infantry soldiers on each
side. Some units have attempted to fit a light support
weapon for the operator to use, but this has achieved
little success. Despite looking ridiculous the shielded
variant can provide cover during an advance and has
seen success with some starport security formations.
The shield adds Protection +8 against attacks from the
side it is facing.

DesiGnator is a grav-mobile drone about the size of a
tennis ball, equipped with a laser designator/rangefinder
and a battery of thermal and optical cameras. Range
is about 15km, assuming the operator wants the drone
to be able to return to its launch point for recovery and
recharging. DesiGnator does not move much faster than
a jogging human but is a difficult target, with Small
(-4), Protection +2 and 6 hits. Its name is derived from
'gravitic propelled designation drone' but DesiGnators
are more commonly used for reconnaissance.

**GRAV MULE**

**GRAV PIONEER**

Item TL Kg Cost
Grav Mule Drone 10 220 Cr250000

Grav Mule is an enlarged and grav-mobile version
of the Battle Mule drone intended for resupply and
casualty evacuation missions. When configured for
resupply operations the unit can carry 300kg of
supplies, with one or more field reloading kits slotted
into place. Equipment bays along the sides allow quick
deployment of necessary items or can carry additional
systems such as sensor jammers, decoy launchers
and the like. Using high-speed nap-of-earth flight the
Grav Mule can get supplies to a surrounded unit under
conditions where a crewed vehicle would face too
much risk.

Alternatively, the drone can be set up for casualty
evacuation. A pair of slide-out stretchers are always
fitted, and a life-support pack for each can be quickly
installed. Once in place, two casualties can be slid into
a Grav Mule's armored box and transported – safely
but claustrophobically – to the rear for treatment. The
Grav Mule has Protection +16 and can take 50 hits
before being disabled.

Grav Pioneer is an obstacle-clearance drone taking the
form of a 1m radius disc. It uses grav propulsion which
eats up power, requiring recharging every 1-2 hours of
use. The primary function of Grav Pioneer is to clear
mines and improvised explosive devices. It carries an
array of sensors for the purpose, and can detonate mines
with a specialized weapon located in a turret on the
underside of the disc. The usual projectile is a heavy
penetrator or a small explosive charge, though a multiple
projectile round is available for certain applications.
Grav Pioneer is not programmed to fire on personnel
but can be tricked by a skilled operator or hacked and
reprogrammed. Some units use their pioneers as security
bots in this manner, but unfortunate incidents do occur
as a result of incomplete or buggy coding. If firing on
personnel the weapon is treated as a heavy smoothbore
firing pellet ammunition, which was developed for the
safe destruction of explosive devices.

Grav Pioneer has Protection +8 and can take 20 hits
before being disabled. Its grav drive is programmed
to 'make the drone light' in the event of a pressure
wave such as that caused by an exploding mine. This
means the drone is more likely to be tossed about than
damaged, and takes half damage from blast effects. A
pair of retractable arms, one ending in powerful cutters,
allows the clearance of wire and similar light obstacles.
Heavier obstructions can sometimes be reduced by
firing all the drone's explosive ammunition into them in
the hope of shaking the obstacle apart

**AC-25 AUTOMATIC CANNON**

Heavy weaponry is the province of either small,
specialist units that do nothing but serve a single big
weapon or large forces that can afford the expense
not only of obtaining and maintaining it but also
transportation. As with small arms, mercenaries

**HEAVY WEAPONRY**

**CHAPTER-NINE**

typically prefer general-purpose weaponry over highly
specialized equipment. The exception is units providing
very specific high-end capabilities, who can get away
with charging a premium because they have the only
battlefield meson accelerator for hire in the subsector.

DIRECT-FIRE WEAPONS
Direct-fire weapons are typically used for fire support and bunker-busting as well as engaging enemy vehicles. The
line between 'support' and 'heavy' in this context can be blurry, but as a rule weapons in this category are too large
to be operated by infantry. They are typically encountered aboard vehicles and in installations.

The AC-25 is very much the industry standard for light
autocannon in the interstellar marketplace. Numerous
variants, copies and similar weapons exist. Light
autocannon become available at TL6, but by TL8 they
have reached their peak. Ammunition feed is usually by
disintegrating-link belt carried in a box, drum or basket.
Ball ammunition is uncommon, with most weapons
combat-loaded with three high explosive rounds
followed by two armor-piercing, the pattern repeated
throughout the belt.

COMBAT LOADING
It is common practice to combat-load light
autocannon ammunition, and the practice can
be followed for some other weapons if desired.
When firing a combat-loaded weapon, the referee
should apply damage per the most destructive
type and the best AP and other features possible.
This only applies when making an autofire attack
that will use enough rounds to guarantee a mix.
Otherwise it will be necessary for the Travellers
to keep track of the order in which rounds are
fired in order to determine what comes next.

AC-25s can be encountered almost anywhere, providing
inexpensive fire support or anti-aircraft defence. A semi-
autonomous ground mount is available, which can be
slaved to a set of perimeter sensors or a manual control
system. The weapon can be switched between auto-
response mode and soldier-in-loop operations as the
need arises, allowing a single skilled operator to run an
entire permitter defence system with multiple weapons.

A standard AC-25 suitable for installing in a vehicle
or bunker costs Cr10000. The semi-autonomous
version, complete with controls and a heavy-duty tripod
mounting, costs Cr25000.

**AC-40 MEDIUM AUTOMATIC CANNON**

Like its smaller cousin, the AC-40 is an industry
standard weapon capable of fulfilling a range of roles
from air defence to light anti-vehicle work. AC-40s
typically use a short-belt feed system, with pre-prepared
lengths of belt carried in reusable container/guides
which can be 'chained' almost indefinitely if space
allows. Ammunition is typically pre-fragmented high-
explosive dual-purpose, with reasonable penetration
characteristics and a modest burst effect. Canister
ammunition is sometimes available for infantry defence
or foliage clearance. The AC-40 is very much a jack-of-
all-trades and is superseded in most roles by weapons
specifically tailored to the circumstances, but offering
good all-round capability at an affordable price.

AC-40s are rarely encountered outside a vehicle or
permanent emplacement. The basic weapon costs
Cr25000 but many users buy a package which includes
the mountings, traverse mechanism and power unit
to allow standalone operation, plus a basic track-and-
target sensor system which allows 'click and shoot'
engagement of air or ground targets. The whole package
costs Cr45000 and requires mounting on a vehicle or
building into a permanent installation.

capable of penetrating light armored vehicles or
fragmentation warheads for anti-personnel or anti-
aerospace work. Ammunition feed is by way of a

The Blackjack weapon system is designed to permit
combat vehicles to launch guided missiles or fire
conventional shells depending on the current
requirement. The weapon is a lightweight 150mm
cannon not compatible with standard artillery
ammunition. It cannot tolerate the immense chamber
pressures generated by high-velocity ammunition so
is primarily used in an infantry support role, firing
explosive or smoke rounds. A canister round is also
available for anti-personnel work, along with a variety of
experimental ammunition types. Notable among these
is a multiple-submunition penetrator round intended
to offset the gun's low muzzle velocity by using rocket
assistance and a small HEAP warhead. It is of limited
effectiveness but has found a niche as a defence
against infantry equipped with powered armor.

The Blackjack can launch a variety of anti-tank and
anti-aerospace missiles providing they are pre-loaded
into a container designed to fit within the gun. Loading
a missile into the weapon requires swinging the breach
aside and inserting the missile container before closing
up ready to fire. A properly trained gunner can load
and ready a missile in 3 combat rounds, whilst the gun
normally uses a revolver-type autoloader. This contains 6
shells which can be selected in any order, and requires
2 combat rounds per shell to reload.

The Blackjack weapon system is normally purchased
with mountings. Its standard mount is equivalent to an
8-Space large turret, with room for a gunner, loader and
some ready ammunition. The mounting can be supplied
enclosed or open, and will normally be protected to the
same level as the vehicle it is mounted on. Armor cost
and mass are assumed to be part of the vehicle's design.

A common weapon on fire support vehicles, the LC-85
is an 85mm smoothbore cannon capable of delivering
explosive, smoke or anti-armor rounds. A canister
round is also available for anti-personnel work. The
LC-85 is designed to be as compact as possible to
allow it to fit in a variety of mounts, and has relatively
low recoil for a vehicle-mounted projectile weapon. It
is fed either by manually loaded single shells or from a
rotating 6-shell magazine which can be reloaded whilst
the weapon is not firing. Each shell takes 2 rounds for
a crewmember to load but an autoloader is available –
which consumes 1 Space and costs Cr50000 – which
will load the empty chamber as it passes, effectively
allowing the cannon to fire every round until the ready
ammunition runs out.

with the problem of heating. This is not so pronounced
as with chemical propellants but the electromagnetic
acceleration process does produce a considerable amount
of heat. A common solution is to use a jacket containing
cryogenic fluids to cool the chamber, but this has the

problem of requiring additional support in the field. The
VRF-3 instead uses a triple-barrel arrangement, each
with its own acceleration chamber. Whilst less efficient
than a cryogenic cooling unit the arrangement requires
only physical maintenance and no handling of dangerous

fluids. The end result is an extremely high rate of fire
which can be sustained for 9 consecutive combat rounds
before overheating makes a cooling cycle necessary.
Ammunition uses standard gauss rifle needles.

Marketed as a self-contained unit, the MPS-22 is a
heavier version of the standard gauss cannon found on
many vehicles. Although it is built at TL12 and requires
high-technology spare parts it is designed to be fitted
on a 'black box' basis into any standard heavy weapon
mounting so long as sufficient power is available. In the
mercenary marketplace the weapon is popular as a cost-
effective tank-killer for those forces able to afford it.

Firing 22mm penetrator darts in bursts of six, the
cannon carries sufficient ammunition internally most
engagements, and can be reloaded in a matter of
seconds from a suitably equipped support vehicle. It
is marginally effective against aircraft, since the high-
speed darts require very little aim-off, but tends to over-
penetrate without causing much harm unless a critical
component is struck. Anti-personnel use is also limited,
but light to medium armored vehicles – including grav
vehicles – are easy victims.

ARTILLERY WEAPONS
Artillery weapons fire in an indirect arc, sometimes on a very high trajectory. Some can engage directly, 'over open
sights' as the saying goes, but others are entirely useless once the enemy gets close enough.

The Aggressor is essentially a cluster of three
rifled 90mm infantry mortar tubes mounted on a
rotating base plate suitable for installation aboard
most vehicles or in an installation. Reloading is
accomplished by releasing the breach lock and
swinging the muzzles down on a pivot. A single barrel
can be loaded with a projectile, but more commonly
three are loaded at once from an autoloader. The
weapon is then returned to firing position and the
breach locked. The Aggressor can be fired manually
but is more commonly used in conjunction with
remote sensors to deliver precise fire even without
guided projectiles. One, two or three barrels can be
fired at once with the same or different payloads.

The single-barrelled version of this weapon is soldier-
portable once broken down into frame, tube and
baseplate, but the triple-barrelled version is too heavy
and bulky to be moved more than a few meters in this
manner. Both versions can be remotely traversed and
elevated, though it is traditional to train for manual
operation of such weapons.

Typical projectiles are high-explosive dual-purpose,
with both blast and fragmentation effects. Smoke and
incendiary rounds are also common. Operators willing
to pay for guided munitions usually tie their mortars
into a designator network, though a click-to-bombard
inertial guidance system is included as standard. A
homing round is also in widespread use, which can

**AGGRESSOR 90MM MULTIPLE MORTAR**

be set to seek the parameters of enemy vehicles or
a specific target installation. Once in the target area
the warhead deploys a parachute to slow its descent,
seeking a suitable target before launching a powered
submunition which will almost always strike the top
of the target.

**DOMINATOR 200MM SIEGE MORTAR**

**FA-150 GUN-HOWITZER**

Mortars are, by definition, short-barrelled and relatively
low-velocity artillery weapons. Most are simple infantry
support types, but superheavy mortars are popular
bombardment weapons. The Dominator, like many
similar designs, is a smoothbore breach-loading design
capable of firing approximately once every minute if
ready ammunition and an autoloader are available.

The Dominator is intended to be mounted on a vehicle,
and is manufactured in such a way as to make this as
easy as possible. Despite this, it is more commonly
encountered as a defensive weapon. Dominators and
similar weapons are highly effective at denying a narrow
approach or choke point such as a mountain pass to
enemy forces, and those built into installations are
always pre-sighted on critical points.

Airburst-fragmentation rounds are commonly used for
anti-personnel work, but a parachute-retarded anti-
armor shell is a common backup. This seeks a suitable
target as it falls, launching a penetrator submunition at
enemy ground vehicles. It is not particularly effective
against grav vehicles even when they are flying very
low, as their speed and agility makes a hit problematic.
However, as a relatively cheap way of getting heavy
artillery to the battle area, the Dominator has seen
considerable market success.

An autoloading unit is available for an additional
Cr100000, adding 0.5 tons to the weapon's weight.

Despite advances in technology, tube artillery remains
a cost-effective way of delivering fire support on the
battlefield. Gun-howitzers offer a balance between long-
range fire (and effectiveness at shorter ranges when
firing over open sights) and the lightness of a short-
barrelled howitzer. The FA-150 is typical of the type.
Firing a medium-calibre shell it has limited usefulness
as a direct-fire weapon against armored vehicles but is
highly effective against soft targets and light fortifications,
and can put several rounds into the air in rapid success
from its 6-round rotary magazine. This allows a time-on-
target salvo, though without an autoloader the magazine
is laborious to refill. The weapon itself costs Cr450000,
with an autoloader costing Cr75000 and taking up an
additional 2 Spaces in a vehicle.

When using indirect fire the gun-howitzer has a range
of 25km, though accuracy is not great at this distance
without guided shells. Direct engagement range is
around 3km using a modest arc. A loaded magazine
allows a theoretical rate of fire of 10 rounds per minute

in either mode, with manual reloading of one shell
taking around 6 seconds for a well-trained crew. This
gives a sustained fire rate of 5 rounds per minute until
the crew become fatigued.

MISSILE AND ROCKET WEAPONS
By convention, guided weapons are typically referred to as missiles whilst unguided ones are termed rockets. In
practice there is considerable crossover between the two since the addition of a basic guidance system can turn a
rocket into a precision weapon. Missiles and rockets fly relatively slowly and are vulnerable to interception.

**AIRSPACE DEFENCE SYSTEM**

The AirSpace system is a common fit on light vehicles.
Configured on an unarmored gun-over-hull basis it
consists of a light laser cannon and quad-mounted light
anti-aerospace missile system mounted coaxially on a
rapid-slewing base. The base is the equivalent of a large
turret in most ways, but does not carry a crewmember
and has no armor protection for the weapons. They
are unlikely to suffer a hit even if the vehicle is directly
fired upon, due to their small size relative to the hull.

**ASA-40 HEAVY AEROSPACE**

**DEFENCE MISSILE SYSTEM**

The ASA-40 is a common large aerospace defence
missile system, manufactured under license on multiple
worlds. It is designed to be operated from an installation
or a vehicle, though trailer-mounted variants are not
uncommon. The system consists of a launch rail on
a slewing/elevating base, control station and sensor/
antennae complex that can be mounted on the launch
vehicle or separately.

The ASA-40 has various designations depending on
where it is in service. Most users obtain missiles on the
open market, so typically a missile will be of standard
design and with well-known capabilities. The usual
choice is a two-stage weapon with a fast-burn main
stage to get the missile into the target vicinity or to
altitude quickly. After this is jettisoned the attack
stage can coast for some time before activating its own
engines. This stage is agile but has difficulty targeting
grav vehicles that make rapid and violent direction
changes. It is capable of intercepting most aircraft and
has no difficulty with spacecraft.

The standard missile used with this weapon system
is the HighStrike long-range aerospace missile. Its
warhead is capable of self-selecting between impact
detonation and close-pass proximity burst. If an impact
can be achieved the missile does 2DD damage with a
small blast area. A proximity burst reduces damage to
12D with a much greater radius. The missile is capable
of endangering small spacecraft with a direct hit.

The launch and control system costs Cr750000 and
weighs 3 tons with a missile in place. Missiles typically
cost Cr100000, or more depending on warhead.
Additional missiles are loaded with the assistance of
a hoist on the loader, a process that takes around 20
minutes. Each spare missile weighs approximately one
ton with its protective packaging.

WEAPON (PLASMA)

RESGAW-220 ROCKET
ARTILLERY SYSTEM

The P-12 vehicular plasma gun is a standard Plasma-C
gun mounted in a remotely controlled blister turret. This
is designed to be fitted on the top, sides or underneath
a vehicle depending on its role. The mountings are
universal, with only control and power feeds required.
It is designed to vent plasma outward if the firing
chamber is breached, rather than into the vehicle, and
considered one of the safest plasma weapons available
on the open market.

Cheaply manufactured at TL7, the Resgaw system is a
common large-calibre rocket artillery system designed
to be retrofitted to almost any vehicle. At its core is a
traversable carrier/launcher rail system which carries
eight 220mm unguided artillery rockets. These typically
deliver high explosive warheads or an airbursting
fragmentation payload for area attacks. In open
configuration the system takes up 9 Spaces and costs
Cr25000, carried outside the structure of a vehicle –
and thus unprotected by. An enclosed version, protected
by the vehicle's armor, costs Cr40000 and consumes
12 Spaces. Vehicle-mounted systems can make use of
an autoloader, which can be carried on the same vehicle
or another in support. The autoloader takes up 4 Spaces
plus 4 more for every 8 missiles carried and costs
Cr25000. Standard warheads cost Cr2500 each. Range
of this weapon is not great but it can be fitted to light
trucks or similar vehicles to create a powerful, if short,
barrage capability. At TL8, a simple guidance system
can be fitted at the cost of Cr100 per missile. This does
not home in on precise targets but does grant DM+2 to
attack rolls.

**TAC-150 MISSILE SYSTEM**

The TAC-150 missile system is named for its role and
general size. The bus, propulsion system and most of
the electronics are common to all missiles in the family,
with warheads and any specific components fitted as
a single unit. TAC-150 missiles can be launched from
a Blackjack gun/missile system or any other launcher
capable of carrying missiles in the 150mm diameter
range. If mounted on a post a pair of missiles consume
1 Space.

The commonest variants are the TAC-150AA and TAC-
150AT, intended for anti-aerospace and anti-armor
work respectively. The AA version is designed for
proximity detonation and uses a warhead surrounded
by tungsten cubes for maximum effect, whereas the AT
variant is fused for impact or close-standoff detonation.
The latter is intended to defeat reactive armor by
positioning the plasma jet formed by its shaped-charge
warhead in such a way as not to be disrupted by
exploding reactive armor. Designated TAC-150ATS,
this warhead is expensive but ignores any reactive
armor a target vehicle may have. Other mechanisms
intended to impair shaped-charges, such as mesh or
bars, are similarly ineffective.

An antiradiation weapon designated TAC-150AR, is
also available. Normally used to seek enemy radar
and similar sensor equipment, this warhead can
analyse emissions and determine the nature of sensors
and communications equipment. It can be directly

controlled or permitted to autonomously seek targets
of the correct nature. If a radar or communications
array is turned off the missile will attack its last known
location unless directed to another target. Antiradiation
weapons gain DM+4 to attack emitting sensors or
communications equipment, and if home-on-jam mode
is selected they gain DM+6 to attack active jammers
and similarly powerful emitters. An attack on a shut-
down target is made without these DMs but the missile
still gains the usual modifier for being a smart weapon.

**HEAVY EQUIPMENT**

**CHAPTER-TEN**

Heavy equipment is normally carried aboard a vehicle
or installed in a facility. Small mercenary units are
unlikely to be able to afford much in the way of heavy
equipment, but if an item is considered necessary
enough the money will be found... somehow.

A field armory is a modular structure designed to
provide maintenance and secure storage for weaponry
and ammunition. Lower-tech variants are available but
the TL10 version is equipped to maintain energy weapons
and similar high-tech equipment in at least a basic
fashion. A field armory can hold sufficient small arms

which case it consumes 24 Spaces.

**FIELD BARRACKS**

**FIELD MEDICAL UNIT**

A field barracks is somewhere between a large and
well-insulated tent and a prefabricated building. Each
structure has a modular base, a framework that can
be configured various ways and sections of flexible
covering along with a rather minimal set of shower and
washing facilities. The standard setup is a six-person
sleeping area, a general-purpose working space and
a small 'field fresher' which is served by a modular
set of power and water connectors. A furniture kit
capable of being put together as six field bunks, a
table and stools is also provided, along with a heating/
air conditioning unit which makes the shelter liveable
under a wide range of conditions.

Multiple modules can be combined to create a base.
It is not uncommon to find accommodation structures
made up of most of two kits, with the left-over parts
used for mess, command or briefing facilities. Although
nothing like as good as a permanent structure, a field
barracks can be set up almost anywhere and prevents

the inevitable degradation of morale that comes with
living in inadequate facilities. The modular nature of
the kits takes some getting used to – to the point that
knowing how to erect or strike a camp of this sort is
considered an essential skill by many mercenary units.
When broken down each module takes up 6 Spaces
aboard a vehicle.

A field medical unit is designed to be carried aboard
one or more vehicles and deployed to the ground, but
can be installed inside vehicles instead. It contains two
emergency operating units and two non-surgical aid
stations along with a central sanitization and general-
stores area. If deployed to the ground, each of the
five modules is protected by a translucent 'bubble' of
light polymer on a collapsible frame. Perfectly sterile
conditions are hard to come by in the field, but a unit
of this sort comes close. If carried aboard a vehicle for
deployment groundside, the unit takes up 20 Spaces.
Installed in a manner that permits surgery to be carried
out inside a vehicle, Space requirements increase to
40, which is usually split between two or three vehicles.
The TL9 version relies on medical professionals with

some automated assistance. At TL32 a variant is
available which contains two autodocs in place of the
surgical units. A live medic can still use these but they
are typically programmed for automatic treatment of
common injuries.

**FIELD NUCLEAR DAMPER**

FIELD SURVEILLANCE
SYSTEM, MULTISPECTRAL

Although nuclear weapons are rarely used in the sort
of conflicts mercenaries get involved in, the threat
is always present. Nuclear dampers render nuclear
warheads inert, more or less, and are typically deployed
to protect major troop concentrations, headquarters
and field bases. A field nuclear damper is sufficient
to protect an area 1km in radius from tactical nuclear
weapons and to nullify radiation attacks. It will thus
provide protection from the radiation associated with
plasma, fusion and particle weapons. One can also be
used to make an irradiated area somewhat safer, but
contact with contaminated material will still pose a
severe hazard.

A field nuclear damper requires so much power that
it will normally be carried aboard a vehicle or in an
installation with its own fusion reactor. Although smaller
than the units used aboard starships, portable dampers
consume 12 Spaces in a vehicle.

Item TL Kg Cost

Field Surveillance System 9 8 Cr6000

A field surveillance system consists of a central operator
station – little more than a military portacomp, a stand
for it and a folding chair – plus a tripod mounted
multispectral sensor array. This includes a passive
emissions detector, active radar, a laser mapping and
rangefinding system on a rotating platform, and thermal
and optical sensors. Additional ground sensors in the
form of small discs are included. These detect acoustic,
magnetic and seismic traces. The unit provides
monitoring and alerts over an area 1-1.5km in radius,
depending on the terrain, and can be linked into a
larger network. Its fuel cells are good for around 72
hours of operation, significantly reduced if active radar
is used. The system provides DM+2 to Recon checks
within its area of coverage.

**FIELD WORKSHOP**

**MILITARY SATELLITE LAUNCHER**

Units that have more than one or two vehicles soon find
they become a maintenance burden in the field. Repairs
and maintenance can be improvised at need, and some
units do this on a constant basis. A field workshop
allows work that could otherwise not be undertaken to
be carried out almost anywhere. The workshop includes
hoists and frames to support them, heavy tools and
some fabrication equipment which allows parts to be
adapted or wrangled back into shape. It requires a crew
of two mechanics at a minimum to make use of the
facilities, and can be used by up to six. The unit as a
whole is designed to be carried in several crates aboard
a vehicle, and takes around four hours for a 4-person
crew to deploy. One large or two small vehicles can be
worked on at once. The workshop takes up 16 Spaces
when carried as cargo in a vehicle, and can be broken
down between vehicles if necessary. The TL10 version
has provision for repair of grav vehicles.

Satellite reconnaissance is a luxury for most mercenary
units unless their clients can provide coverage. Those
forces that can afford one can buy a self-contained
launcher and control unit which can be fitted to a
vehicle or carried aboard one and emplaced in the field.
The unit contains an erector-launcher which consumes
12 Spaces aboard a vehicle either fitted or as cargo,
and a ground control and preparation station which
takes up another 4 Spaces. A single rocket takes up 24
Spaces. A satellite already mounted on the rocket takes
up no Spaces; additional satellites take up one Space
and weigh 250kg.

Rockets can be built if a decent workshop is available,
though fuel handling is hazardous. These military
satellites are capable of conducting communications
relay work, mapping and ground monitoring with a
variety of sensors. Duration in orbit is fairly short;
typically 3D days plus the Effect of an Electronics
(remote ops) check.

Using the term 'mobile' for a fusion reactor is something
of a stretch, but this unit is as close as it is possible
to get. A field reactor is derived from the units fitted to
many military vehicles, but is designed to be carried
as cargo in a vehicle rather than forming an integral
part of its structure. The reactor and its associated
control and monitoring stations consume 14 spaces if
carried in a vehicle. The unit can power a modest-sized
base including heavy laser weapons, and recharge grav
vehicles at the same time. Power draw limits recharging
to half a dozen vehicles and will be halted whilst
heavy current drain is experienced, such as when firing
aerospace defence lasers powered by the unit.

**MOBILE FUSION REACTOR**

**VEHICULAR CITADEL**

Item TL Kg Cost
Mobile Fusion Reactor 10 3500 MCr1.75

A vehicular citadel is an armored chamber within
a vehicle. Normally installed around a crew area, a
citadel could in theory protect computers and electronic
equipment or a propulsion system. A citadel consumes
one Space plus one additional Space for every four
full Spaces contained within it. It provides additional
armor protection for the occupants or contents and
can be combined with NBC protection to create a refuge
within the vehicle. A weapon that penetrates the outer

armor and would strike something protected by the
citadel must get through its armor to do so. Ideally
enough of the weapon's force is spent on breaching the
outer armor that the citadel can withstand what is left,
though the vehicle's interior will most likely be wrecked
even if the crew and critical systems survive.

**VEHICULAR NBC PROTECTION**

Item TL Spaces Cost per Space Armor

Vehicular Citadel 10 1+1 per 4 Cr35000 20
Vehicular Citadel 12 1+1 per 4 Cr50000 25

A basic citadel is essentially a steel box with a door but
as technology advances it is possible to add additional
features. From TL8 upwards citadels offer additional
protection and are fitted with a cooling system which
will allow the occupants to survive a serious fire in the
vehicle. Shaped-charge warheads that detonate against

the outer hull of a vehicle will not be well positioned to
penetrate the inner citadel. Such weapons lose all AP
traits and do half damage to the citadel. The cost of a
citadel is per Space contained within it, including the
Space the citadel itself consumes.

It is possible to protect the occupants of a vehicle from
biological or chemical attack, and from radioactive
fallout, without installing a full life-support system.
Some bottled oxygen may be used but for the most part
air is drawn from outside the vehicle through filters
or is scrubbed in a rebreather unit. NBC protection
is no use in vacuum or where an atmosphere is
wholly unbreathable as it does not change the gas
composition, but filters will clean out most taints. No
airlock is provided, so unsealing the vehicle will allow
contamination to enter.

Basic NBC equipment is essentially personal
protection for use inside the vehicle. It takes the form
of masks provided with filtered air. This is bulky and
uncomfortable, since the crew have to wear protective
clothing and deal with hoses getting in the way, but it is
cheap. Contaminants can enter, so the interior must be
decontaminated before use by unprotected personnel

Standard NBC protection creates a comfortable and safe
environment within the vehicle by sealing the vehicle
and maintaining a slight overpressure inside.

Item TL Spaces Cost per Space
Basic NBC Protection 7 0 Cr1000
Standard NBC Protection 7 1 Cr2500

**VEHICULAR PROTECTION, EXTERNAL**

Combat vehicles may be attacked in a variety of ways.
Shaped-charge warheads are designed to defeat
conventional armor and are effective even against
advanced composites. Grenades and explosives can the
thrown onto a vehicle, or flammable liquids poured onto
upper surfaces. Mines and other explosive devices can
be emplaced so as to attack from the underside of a
vehicle. External protection is designed to defeat these
attacks, and comes in three types. Any or all can be
fitted to a vehicle, paying the costs separately.

Grenade protection involves shaping the upper surfaces
so grenades roll off and fluids spill onto the ground
rather than entering the vehicle or pooling on its
surfaces. Wire mesh can be used to create a roof which
will do the same for grenades but does not affect fluids
or satchel charges. Non-magnetic coatings are used to
prevent charges from sticking to the hull.

Mine protection can be provided by shaping the
underside of a vehicle to deflect blast and adding
armor plate to vulnerable areas. It may be more
efficient to simply increase the armor weight of the

vehicle and move some of it to the underside, but mine
protection is often fitted on a temporary basis or as a
modification after bad experiences in the field. Mine
protection consumes two Spaces plus one for every full
20 Spaces of the vehicle. It adds 25% to the value of
the vehicle's underside armor. Mine protection can
only be applied once

Shaped-charge protection is normally achieved by
adding slat (or bar) armor and skirts around a vehicle
which can cause a shaped-charge warhead to detonate
short of the optimum location. Unless the weapon has
advanced fusing that compensates for this, or a standoff
probe, there is a 2 in 6 chance that any shaped-charge
warhead striking the vehicle will be impaired. Damage
is halved and all AP traits are lost. The mountings for
slat armor take very little space inside the vehicle but
can make operations awkward. Slat armor requires
one Space for every 25 Spaces of the vehicle, rounding
down, and costs Cr750 per Space of the vehicle.
Slat armor has no effect on energy weapons, kinetic
penetrators or blast.

**CHAPTER-ELEVEN**

Most vehicles used by mercenary forces are either
bought surplus from large militaries or built in large
numbers by corporations for sale to government and
mercenary clients. A unit that can afford a small run of

custom designed vehicles is a rare thing, though often
vehicles are refurbished and upgraded once in service.
Overall, however, most vehicles in mercenary service are
variants of a few common designs.

SIDES 2

GS-3 stands for 'ground strike, 3-wheel'. This slightly unusual offering from Halversten Armaments
Incorporated was developed for the fast-response and scouting role but has developed into a general-purpose
light weapons carrier. The basic vehicle is a large three-wheel design, with roll bars around the driving
position but no significant protection from weapons fire or the elements. The area behind the driver is set
up as configurable space, and can carry a cargo box capable of holding 4 Spaces of equipment or 1,000kg
of load. In this configuration the GS-3 is occasionally encountered as a 'last mile' logistics vehicle running
ammunition and supplies at high speed to forward-positioned troops.

As standard, the vehicle is very basic. It has no sensors or electronics other than a modest driver-assistance
package and encrypted comms system. The 'cargo area' was designed from the outset to be configurable,
though most commonly all that is added is a pintle-mounted weapon for the use of a second crewmember
who stands in the vehicle's rear bed. This is the standard patrol and security configuration for the vehicle,
acting as a mobile light support platform or escort for logistics vehicles. An alternate configuration allows two
infantry personnel to ride in the bed along with a little cargo, dismounting to fight or make a foot patrol whilst
the driver covers them with a pintle-mounted weapon above the driving position. The art of dropping from a
standing 'gunner' position into the driving seat without inflicting self-injury is an important one.

Reconnaissance Variant: The GS-3 makes an effective
reconnaissance and artillery observation vehicle, providing
it can evade detection. Its small size enables it to find a
concealed position on a hillside or behind an obstruction
and relay information back to the parent force. In this
configuration the vehicle is fitted with a TL9 navigation
system providing DM+2, an extended-range communications
system and an improved, increased-range sensor system
(DM+1) which is hardened and mounted on a mast. These
modifications are expensive, bringing the vehicle cost to
Cr150350. Communications are handled by a second
crewmember who normally is provided with a pintle-
mounted weapon for self-defence.

Electronic Warfare Variant: Like the recon version, the
electronic warfare variant of the GS-3 is designed to be a
cheap way of getting an expensive piece of equipment into
the field. The EW package adds an improved, extended-
range electronic countermeasures package to the rear
bed. This adds Cr40000 to the vehicle's price for a readily

available TL8 package and is sometimes included in a
recon-variant vehicle. The resulting platform is fast and
mobile, though vulnerable if attacked. It is often used as
a mobile electronic reconnaissance asset, mapping enemy
emissions and investigating any anomalies before retiring
without making contact. An imported TL11 advanced ECM
pack can also be installed, adding Cr80000 to the cost of
the vehicle for an extended-range package.

Strike Variant: Most users retain the GS-3 in its basic role,
as a fast and mobile weapons carrier. The strike variant
can carry a range of weapons, usually on an open mounting
equivalent to a small turret with no armor protection.
The turret weapons are directly controlled by a second
crewmember. Typically a light autocannon is mounted,
increasing the vehicle's cost by Cr20000, but some GS-3s
are used as mobile anti-aerospace platforms and carry a
quad-mount light anti-air missile system which increases
vehicle cost by Cr30000.

The Field Ranger is a ubiquitous security and transport vehicle often converted into a light patrol asset for lack
of anything better. It is a 6-wheel-drive ground vehicle somewhere between a large SUV and a small truck,
with good off-road capability and endurance. The vehicle's blocky sides maximise internal space at the price of
being a good target, whilst the large rear area can be left open-topped or covered with a lightly armored body
shell. The crew area and critical components are protected by light armor plate offering modest protection
against most small arms fire from medium range or greater.

Field Ranger was designed from the outset to be customised, and indeed several standard kits are
manufactured. The basic vehicle is set up for a crew of two, with the rear cargo area open or enclosed as the
purchaser prefers. There are no weapons as standard, but the cab roof hatch has provision for a pintle mount.
The rear area can hold 2,750kg of cargo or 11 Spaces' worth of equipment and/or personnel. The bed of the
rear area is sufficiently well constructed to be able to support a light turret weapon.

Field Rangers are typically used for personnel transport, in which case they carry 8-10 personnel in the rear, or
for light logistics work.

WEAPONS

**Survivability Enhancement Package:** Survivability can be greatly
improved by fitting bolt-on armor panels and defensive
systems. The full up-armoring kit increases armor to 20 at
the front and rear, and 28 on the sides. Anti-mine protection
increases underside armor to 24, and a decoy dispenser and
smoke discharger are added on the cab sides. This enhanced
protection comes at the cost of reducing internal space;
cargo capacity drops to 2,000kg or 8 Spaces. The cost of this
upgrade is Cr 12000, slightly more than the cost of building
the vehicle in this configuration from new.

**Light Turret Weapon Package:** A 4-Space small turret is
available to fit the Field Ranger. It takes up only one internal
Space but can hold four Spaces of weapons, and costs
Cr40,000 without fitted weapons. The turret is capable of
high-angle shooting as well as engaging ground targets, and
can be controlled from either the cab or rear area according
to the user's preference. A turret will reduce cargo capacity by
250kg or equipment Space by 1.

**Large Turret Weapon Package:** If heavier combat capability is
desired, a Field Ranger can be configured as an armored
reconnaissance or fire support vehicle. This requires fitting
a larger turret as an integral part of the vehicle, taking up 5
Spaces. This will almost entirely take up the available space
in a survivability-enhanced Field Ranger, turning it into a light
combat vehicle. The cost of a large turret without weapons

is Cr150000. The turret has capacity for one crewmember
and six Spaces of weapons, though sometimes a second
crewmember is carried as a commander, artillery observer or
in some other role. This will reduce the turret capacity to 4
Spaces of weapons.

Most Field Rangers are set up as light transports, with only
minor modifications, or as security/personnel transports
using the survivability kit. These vehicles typically mount a
machinegun on a pintle mount atop the cab and carry 6-10
infantry depending on the unit's preferences. A light patrol/
logistics escort Field Ranger will typically have the survivability
package and a small turret mounting a light autocannon and a
pair of light air defence missiles on a rail launcher. The cost of
this vehicle with weapons is Cr72500.

A fire-support or armored recon vehicle will often mount a
heavy autocannon or a medium-calibre direct-fire weapon
such as an 85mm gun. These weapons are effective against
light to medium combat vehicles but incapable of taking on
battle tanks. If an LC-85 cannon is mounted, the revolving-
cylinder magazine allows six shots, one per round, before
the crewmember operating the weapon has to begin the
laborious task of reloading. A pintle-mounted machinegun
will usually be carried atop the turret, possibly with another
on the cab roof.

NEGAV TEN-WHEEL OFF-ROAD TRANSPORT VEHICLE

DESCRIPTION

FRONT 6

REAR 6

SIDES 8

UNDER 6

The Negav is an unusual design of off-road truck, with
two articulated body sections. The front, four-wheel,
section contains the cab and main driving/working area
whilst the six-wheel section at the rear can be configured
for a variety of roles. Both sections contain fuel cells, and
all wheels are driven and steerable. This gives good off-
road manoeuvrability for such a large ground vehicle.

The basic model is lightly armored for protection
against shell fragments and small arms fire. Underside
armor is improved, and shaped to deflect blast from
a mine sideways rather than upwards through the crew
compartment. Equipment is serviceable but nothing
special, with some communications and navigational
aids. Nominal crew is two, though many versions carry
additional personnel either to operate installed systems
or operate dismounted. The basic model has 9 tons (36
spaces) of cargo capacity, which can be used to install a
great variety of systems.

**Survivability Enhancement Kit:** The Negav is not intended to
function as a combat vehicle, so its survivability kit focuses
more on standoff weapons and air attack than direct fire.
Armor is increased to 10 front and rear, 12 on the sides and
12 underneath. In addition an ECM (improved) suite is added
along with a decoy dispenser and smoke discharger. A small
turret atop the crew compartment replaces the roof hatch. It
usually mounts a pair of 25mm autocannon but can take other
weapons at need. With autocannon mounted the package costs
Cr100000 and takes up 5 Spaces, reducing cargo capacity to
7.75 tons.

**Headquarters Support Vehicle Modification:** Using TL12
components, the HQ support vehicle kit is designed to
instantly provide a medium-sized mercenary unit or other
military formation with key functions. The vehicle's power
system is replaced with a TL9 fusion plant, which takes up
10 spaces in the rear compartment. Power take-offs enable
this vehicle to recharge others or run several ground-based
systems. Most of the remainder of the rear compartment is
taken up with a TL12 nuclear damper**.** A Computer/3 is also
housed in the rear compartment, which additionally mounts
a small turret containing a twin-mounted rotary autocannon
with advanced TL12 fire control at the front end of its top
side. A second small turret housing four light anti-aircraft
missiles is mounted at the rear of the cargo section. A laser
anti-missile system is mounted atop the crew compartment.
As a result of all these modifications only 8 Spaces are left for
cargo or additional personnel. This variant of the Negav is very
expensive, with the new components plus the cost of the base
vehicle bringing the price tag to MCr2.062, but it provides a
unit's headquarters with virtually unlimited power, protection
from nuclear attack and defence against aerospace and missile
threats – all in a single, mobile package.

**'Bombus' Conversion Package:** Dubbed the 'Bombus' by a
notoriously amateurish mercenary force, this conversion is still
'officially unofficial' but is requested often enough that many
consider it a standard option. The intent is to turn what was
designed as a transport vehicle into a mobile raiding platform.

Against a credible starfaring-tech opponent this vehicle would
be questionable at best, but it can smash through most
opposition put up by disorganised mid-tech opponents. Armor
is heavily upgraded, with 20 points on the top, front and rear,
28 on the sides and 22 underneath.

The crew compartment is heavily modified, with an LC-85
cannon in a limited-traverse mount pointing forwards. This
takes up most of one side of the compartment, limiting the
crew to a driver and a gunner/loader whose working space
is directly behind the driver. The gun and its associated
autoloader take up 7 Spaces within the crew compartment,
with most of the remaining area given over to tools and
ammunition. Atop the crew compartment is a small turret
mounting twin light autocannon in a high-angle turret. These
weapons are capable of air defence or engaging ground
targets but must be controlled by a crewmember from the rear
compartment if the driver and cannon gunner are both busy.

The rear compartment is divided between a crew area and a
TL9 fusion reactor, giving the vehicle more or less unlimited
range. A full turret mounting a light laser cannon sits atop
the compartment, with space inside for a single gunner.
Additionally there are small sponsons on each side of the
rear compartment, each carrying a pair of remote-controlled
machineguns. There are crew stations for three personnel,
plus one in the turret, bringing the vehicle's complement to
six. A small amount of cargo space is used by gun racks and
a wet bar.

The resulting gun-festooned monstrosity can function as
a useful fire support vehicle or tank destroyer, though it is
expensive and inefficient in either role. It has come to be
associated with reports of gangs of trigger-happy yahoos
kerb-stomping under-equipped yokels and is considered
a questionable purchase by reputable mercenaries. The
conversion brings the total cost of the vehicle to MCr1.8.
This is more than a variant designed from the outset to
follow this configuration and includes the cost of a base
vehicle and subsequent modification work.

UNDER —

Named after a venomous scuttling creature, the Marrix is one of the few tracked combat vehicles in widespread
service with interstellar mercenary formations. Most forces favor wheeled or grav vehicles, or a combination
of them, since they have better strategic mobility. Heavy tracklayers are well protected but can be vulnerable
to powerful weapons they are unable to evade, but there is a solid market for light tracked combat and support
vehicles in certain roles.

The Marrix family of vehicles is based on a common chassis and power plant, with fuel cells distributed under
the driving and crew compartments, and a front-mounted motive unit which provides the crew with a measure of
additional protection against bow hits. Armor protection is adequate to deal with light support weapons in all arcs,
and can be upgraded with applique armor packs. All variants are fitted with decoy dispensers and smoke grenade
launchers, and the majority of users add at least a pintle-mounted machinegun for self-defence.

The basic version has no turret although there is provision to fit one. All three crewmembers are housed in the front
compartment with 3 Spaces available for additional systems or 750kg of small items. The rear compartment has
16 Spaces available for systems or personnel. Typically this is used to carry an 8-10 soldier section if the Marrix is
functioning as an APC, in which case it will usually have a small turret mounting a light autocannon. This does not
come as standard and must be bought separately. A pintle-mounted machinegun is typically added atop the driving
compartment, though other weapons are possible. If the Marrix is in use as a logistics vehicle it can carry 4,000kg
of cargo in the rear compartment, which is of course reduced if systems or weapons are added.

**Infantry Support Upgrade Package:** The most basic upgrade
package available adds a small turret capable of holding
4 Spaces of weapons. This takes up one Space in the
rear compartment, costing Cr40000 for the turret alone.
Typically the turret mounts a heavy autocannon such as the
AC-60H model, for an additional cost of Cr600000. Turrets
are fitted for high-angle fire, permitting a group of vehicles
to act as an anti-aircraft battery – ideally under the central
direction of a command unit.

**Defensive Upgrade Package:** The defensive upgrade package
greatly increases armor protection using bolt-on applique
sections and adds improved reactive armor. This upgrade
costs Cr123000. Armor protection is increased to 86
on the front, 60 on the sides, 50 at the rear and 45
underneath, creating a vehicle capable of functioning as a
battle tank. This modification is usually accompanied by a
main-calibre gun or similar weapon in a full turret. It uses
up 3 Spaces.

Primary Weapon Upgrade Package: The primary weapon
upgrade package usually, but not always, includes a full
turret. The standard turret is a 2-crewmember design, which
consumes only 6 Spaces inside the vehicle but can hold 10
Spaces of weapons or systems in addition to the crew. The
turret alone costs Cr250000. This turret is commonly used
with a piece such as the FA-150 gun-howitzer to create a
mobile artillery platform. The high angle of fire on these
weapons makes them eminently suitable for direct-fire
support operations in urban terrain, enabling snipers in high
buildings to be taken out in a distinctly heavy-handed but
effective manner. Alternatively, a straight tank-killer can be
created by mounting a heavy gauss cannon. This weapon
is above the nominal TL of the vehicle but several self-
contained weapons are available.

For all its martial pretentions, the base-model Taisben is basically a ruggedised civilian air/raft. Vehicles of
this sort serve in the liaison role without conversion, and are primarily used for scouting or patrol work when
they venture onto the battlefield. Some variants are more combat-worthy and can be encountered as fire
support platforms or providing vertical mobility to urban combat formations.

The rather grandly named 'cockpit' has room for a pilot and a second crewmember, and is fully enclosed.
It is lightly armored and capable of withstanding small arms fire from all directions, with slightly better
underside protection than elsewhere. The rear bed can be configured as a flatbed, low-sided passenger or
cargo compartment, or as a fully enclosed systems compartment.

No armament is fitted as standard, but it is common to fit a pintle-mounted weapon on the cockpit roof, to
be used by a crewmember standing on the seat through the roof hatch. The rear area can carry six Spaces
or 1,500kg of cargo, or up to six people if they do not need to move around much. When in diplomacy and
liaison mode the rear area is often outfitted to create a comfortable space for two VIPs or officers. This can
cost anything from Cr2500 for some basic seats to upwards of Cr50000 for the unit that wants to impress.
Outfitting in this manner does not alter the function of the vehicle.

Enhanced Survivability Package: An additional layer of
applique armor increases protection to 16 all-round
including the underside, allowing the vehicle to survive
fire from a heavy machinegun or similar weapon in all arcs
except from above. In addition an improved electromagnetic
countermeasures suite is fitted in the rear area though it
is usually controlled from the cockpit. These measures
increase cost by Cr50000 and reduce cargo or passenger
capacity by 2 Spaces. Vehicles in this configuration are
typically used for light patrol work, often with 2-4 personnel
riding in the rear compartment.

Urban Prowler: The 'urban prowler' has an open-topped
rear area with a half-ring mount each side. These typically
mount a light autocannon on each side, operated by two
crewmembers who stand in the rear of the vehicle. If this
modification is paired with the enhanced survivability
package, all available space and lifting capacity is used up.
Fitting the autocannon, with gun shields and ring mounts,

increases cost by Cr25000. This modification's name comes
from its initial concept as a close-range fire support vehicle
for personnel operating in cities with tall buildings, but in
practice it can be encountered as a top-cover and overwatch
vehicle on open-country patrols or convoys.

Tank Destroyer: The tank destroyer variant is an attempt
to create an inexpensive fire-support and grav-strike
platform on a very limited budget. A heavy weapon, such
as the LC-85 cannon, is mounted in a front-firing limited-
traverse mount running right through the side of the
cockpit normally occupied by the second crewmember. The
gunner's position is in the rear of the vehicle, along with a
limited supply of ammunition. With no spare capacity for
improved armor, this vehicle is vulnerable but can provide
useful fire support or ambush light armored vehicles in
urban or cluttered vertical terrain. Modification to fit the
cannon costs Cr150000 including the gun, and takes up all
available space.

The Preplenn is a small avian creature native to the homeworld of Dirgess Industries, a medium-sized
constructor of military and paramilitary grav craft. Like its namesake, the Preplenn fast attack platform is
designed to strike hard and fast, often from behind the concealment of terrain. The fuselage and critical
spaces are lightly armored, making them proof against small arms fire from all likely angles. The underside
has been given enhanced protection as is common with vehicles intended for the air support and strike role.

Primary armament is a gauss cannon in a fixed mount, suitable for ground attack or air-to-air combat against
less agile or large targets. In addition the Preplenn has an internal weapons bay capable of holding two
one-Space weapons and three underside hardpoints capable of carrying three more. It is not uncommon to
encounter Preplenn class strike platforms in a swing-role configuration, equipped with light anti-air missiles on
the three external hardpoints and bombs or missiles in the internal bay.

The usual deployment for this craft – which it was designed for – is as a tankbuster and close-support
platform, enabling mercenary forces to provide their own air support without need for runways or extensive
infrastructure. Typically the main gun is operated by the pilot, with the weapons operator delivering missiles
or guided bombs using the secondary fire control system. Fire control is provided for both crew positions and
can be switched between weapons as needed. The cost of the base model includes the gauss cannon but no
missiles or bombs.

**Aerospace Supremacy Variant:** Where lightly armored flying
targets are more likely than tanks, this variant provides
maximum firepower at the expense of penetration. The
gauss cannon is replaced with a pair of rotary autocannon,
with a pair of rotary machineguns installed in the internal
weapons bay. The three underside hardpoints are normally
used for light AA missiles but any or all of them can carry
rotary machineguns in streamlined packs. This gives the
Preplenn a potential of five rotary machineguns and two
rotary autocannon, which is enough to chew any mid-tech
aircraft out of the sky. The same weapons fit can be used to
create a formidable ground-attack platform, at least against
lightly armored targets. The 2-autocannon/2-machinegun
package costs Cr80000 which actually reduces the cost
of the vehicle by Cr20000. Each rotary machinegun pack
costs Cr15000 if added to a hardpoint.

Interceptor Variant: Intended for area air defence against
large aircraft or perhaps ballistic missiles, the interceptor
variant replaces its gauss cannon with a pair of rotary
autocannon and carries light anti-air missiles in the internal
bay. The three underside pylons are merged to support a
long-range anti-air missile. In this role the interceptor's
ability to take off from a hidden forward position without
the use of a runway and to climb to altitude in a short time
are of paramount importance. The large missile is effective
against heavy bombers or transport aircraft and can even
be used to attack satellites in low orbit. This variant is
Cr50000 cheaper than the standard one before missiles are
purchased, but if an expensive missile such as HighStrike is
used the cost increases considerably.

The Chagride was developed as an inexpensive grav APC, and like many vehicles in the marketplace it has
been used as the basis for a range of variants. As a result the basic model is known by the designation 'grav
sled' rather than any role-specific term. The actual role of the vehicle is indicated by a second term, such as
Chagride Ambulance or Chagride Fire Support Vehicle. This tells personnel what they need to know – what
the vehicle does and which chassis it is based upon.

The basic Chagride grav sled has three crew positions, all up front in the driving compartment, and can be
configured with an open or closed rear structure. No weapons are fitted as standard. Armor is sufficient to
give all-round protection from infantry-portable anti-vehicle weapons and light support weaponry, and can be
upgraded with a bolt-on armor package. The rear area holds 22 Spaces or 5,500kg of cargo, sufficient to
deploy an 8-10 soldier infantry section with room for some supplies or equipment. Limited NBC protection is
available as an option, adding a hostile environment package and short-term life support. This consumes one
Space and adds Cr170000 to the price. There is no airlock with this package, which is intended to allow the
vehicle to survive NBC attack rather than operate for an extended period in a contaminated area.

**Survivability Upgrade:** Bolt-on armor plates and inserts
increase protection to 28 rear and sides and 24 top and
bottom. Frontal armor is 30. The vehicle's structure
cannot carry much more than this without a complete
rebuild. This package consumes 2 internal Spaces and
adds Cr160000 to the cost.

**Fire Support Upgrade:** Adding a full-sized turret uses 4
Spaces inside the vehicle and costs Cr125000. The turret
is self-contained and remotely controlled from the crew
compartment. Ready ammunition is stored within the
turret, with reloading possible from within the vehicle
through a pair of hatches in the crew compartment roof.
The turret cannot traverse with the reloading mechanism
in use. Standard armament is a 60mm autocannon and a
co-axial machinegun in a low-profile turret, though other
turrets will fit on the mountings. Adding a turret in this
configuration costs Cr180000, or Cr325000 if combined
with an armor refit. Cargo capacity is reduced to 18
Spaces or 16 Spaces with the armor refit, though 8-10
infantry soldiers can still be carried.

Artillery Sled Modification: The Chagride is the basis for
a variety of artillery platforms, some of which are fairly
modest. One common modification adds an enclosed
220mm rocket artillery system protected by the vehicle's
armor until raised into firing position. Eight unguided
220mm artillery rockets are carried, with no reloads.
These can be launched singly but are almost always used
in multiples. The ability of a grav platform to approach
within firing range then retreat quickly allows a suitably
equipped force to harass enemies without becoming
vulnerable to counter-battery fire. The missile system takes
up 12 Spaces and costs Cr40000. No autoloader can be
fitted due to space constraints, so typically a Chagride
will launch then retire for rearming. Autoloader-equipped
vehicles – which might be others on the Chagride chassis
or soft-skinned support platforms – can rearm the launcher
at a suitable rendezvous point. Some users carry a set
of spare missiles in the rear compartment and reload
manually, though this is heavy work for a 3-person crew.
Others carry no reloads and use the remaining space in the
vehicle for defensive weaponry.

The Saita grav tank was developed for the commercial market, though it can be encountered in service with many
governmental clients as well. Like most grav tanks it is designed for a ground-hugging mode of operation, using
terrain for cover and firing over it rather than flying above the battle area and firing down.

Armor is allocated in a classic tank style, with a heavy frontal glacis plate and lighter armor at the sides and rear.
Top and underside protection are good for a vehicle of this class, allowing highly mobile dash-and-strike maneuvers
to be undertaken with relative impunity. This is still a light tank, of course, and by no means invulnerable.

Internally, the tank is built around two interconnected compartments. The driving compartment contains the driver
and commander, with the gunner and a technical crewmember seated in the rear compartment. No personnel are
carried in the turret, which is remotely controlled and separated from the rest of the tank. Saitas have survived having
the turret blasted off by a fusion gun, through the cost of a rebuild would likely be prohibitive if the fusion reactor
were to be damaged in any significant way.

The fusion reactor is the heart of the vehicle and contributes most to its high price tag. The decision to install one
has always been controversial, but was based on an analysis of the likely market. An on-board reactor gives virtually
unlimited range and more importantly eliminates downtime for charging. A unit that wants to operate grav tanks will
need a reactor to charge them anyway so cannot avoid the cost, and whilst larger forces could get more armored
firepower for their Credits by buying a charging vehicle and non-fusion powered tanks, these would have to rotate
through states of readiness.

Primary armament is a C-type plasma cannon, which takes up the entire 16-Space turret. Smaller or more compact
weaponry can be fitted if this is desirable, depending on the intended role of the vehicle. The plasma gun has a
nominal range of 12km but this assumes a high position and downward fire over terrain undulations. Against lower-
tech foes a grav tank can get away with firing from altitude but against credible opponents it must stay low and use
cover, in which case the effective range of the weapons greatly reduced.

standard version. Some users purchase one fusion tank to
lead a platoon, with the others taking power from it when
necessary. The fusion reactor bay can be used for stowage
or additional systems, adding 10 Spaces (2.5 tons) to the

The S-series is a large grav transport developed to meet a variety of needs. The basic unit is a lightly armored
'grav truck' suitable for most logistics or personnel movement needs. Its broad oval hull form is reasonably
aerodynamic, though awkwardly shaped cargoes carried on an open frame can catch the wind alarmingly. The
driving compartment has space for two crewmembers and is separated from the configurable rear area by a
bulkhead pierced by a strongly built hatch. The rear area has drop-down sides and rear to allow loading from all
angles. These outer walls are only 1m high above the truck bed, with extendable posts to permit a soft covering to
be applied at need. A fully-enclosed model with permanent sides is available at no extra cost, used as the basis
for most variants.

The basic S-Series is armored all round against small-arms fire, including its underside. Top armor is
notoriously weak, but this was never intended to be a combat vehicle. The crew ride in an NBC-protected citadel
which has an additional 20 points of armor. No weapons are fitted as standard, but many users add a remote-
controlled machinegun or similar light support weapon on the cab roof. In its basic logistics configuration the
S-series is assigned the reporting name 'Skate' whilst when serving as a personnel transport it is referred to as
'Snake'. A Snake can easily transport an entire platoon of infantry, and some users fit pintle mounts around the
periphery of an open-topped vehicle for support weapons.

High-Survivability Variant ('Sermon'): An applique armor
package increases armor protection to 20 front, back and
sides, with 18 on the underside and 14 on top. A laser anti-
missile system is fitted atop the cab roof and an improved
ECM unit is built into the front of the cargo area. This adds
Cr750000 to the cost of the vehicle and reduces cargo
capacity to 42 Spaces (10.5 tons).

Mobile Hospital Variant ('Studio'): The mobile hospital
variant mounts a TL10 field medical unit inside the rear
compartment, carried in ready condition and able to be set
up or closed down for travel in a matter of minutes. This
variant costs MCr7.171. It has 10 Spaces (2.5 tons) for
stores, spares or additional facilities. This space is often
turned into a 'travel lounge' for the medical professionals
assigned to the vehicle.

Mobile Support Variant ('Scholar'): The mobile support variant
attempts to pack a unit headquarters into a single vehicle.
It incorporates the protection of the Sermon variant and
in addition carries a TL10 fusion plant and a field nuclear
damper. A small command center, capable of supporting six
personnel, is housed within a second citadel connected to
the driving chamber by a short tunnel. No weapons are fitted
as standard but there are 9 spaces available for weapons,
cargo or any additional facilities the user may want. Cost is
Cr7,566,575.

Direct Support Variant ('Salacious'): The direct support
variant was given the reporting name Salacious as a
convoluted reference to potential users apparently needing
to compensate for something. The basic vehicle has been
heavily up-armored, raising protection to 30 all round and

27 underneath. The cab has 15 points of top protection but
the rest of the vehicle is open-topped. The rear compartment
is crossed by two large beams, from which a pair of outriggers
are slung along the sides of the vehicle. These have open
weapon stations at the front, rear and center, with a gunner
seated directly at the weapon they control.

Armament can vary but 'showroom standard' is a Blackjack
gun/missile system in the front position on each side, with a
co-axial machinegun. The weapon station for these incudes
space for a gunner and loader, with 18 rounds for the gun
and three missiles. The central and rear stations mount AC-
40 medium automatic cannon, with a single operator and
hopper containing 200 rounds for each gun. All guns have a
co-axial machinegun.

The outriggers take up a lot of the vehicle's lifting capability,
and their supports block off much of the rear compartment.
Aft of the rear support is a mounting for an AirSpace defence
system and an operator station for it, consuming all available
space in that area. Immediately behind the cab, between it
and the forward strut, is a built-up framework supporting a
turret. This mounts an LC-85 cannon and a co-axial 25mm
autocannon, remotely controlled from the cab.

The conversion process requires some sub-optimal
arrangement of components, with the result that only 10
Spaces (2.5 tons) remain in the center of the open rear
section. Some users carry additional ammunition, whilst
others find a way to cram more weaponry into this space.
Cost without weapons is Cr650000. With the weapons fit
listed above the vehicle costs an additional Cr750000.

**CHAPTER-TWELVE**

**STARSHIPS**

The majority of mercenary units cannot afford starships of their own. Those that could will often choose to
spend the money on combat-related hardware instead. Starships are essential to the operations of two kinds
of mercenary force, however. Those that operate primarily as a starship crew – known as starmercs – typically
act as escorts for merchant traffic or protectors of vulnerable star systems and are organised differently to the
typical ground-combat unit. Some mercenary forces are geared towards ground combat but require starships as
an integral part of their equipment, such as space-mobile formations or orbital assault units. The remainder will
obtain and use starships if they seem useful and are available at an affordable price.

DIPLOMATIC SKIFF GRAVITAS-CLASS

The Gravitas- class is intended to function as a
diplomatic or headquarters vessel. Most commonly,
it is used by well-off mercenary units to transport
representatives. These may be attending conferences
or meetings with potential clients, visiting arms
fairs or negotiating with a weaponry supplier. The
ability to house emissaries in a secure and mobile
facility is also useful during delicate negotiations
with unreliable opponents. The Gravitas provides all
this, as well as the capability to bring a client close
to the combat zone and keep them informed without
placing them in danger.

Some specialist formations operate the Gravitas as
a major asset. These are not starmercs per se, since
they provide strategic or groundside services such as
electronic warfare, intelligence and strategic analysis
and the like. In this role the vessel essentially serves
as a mobile command post rather than combat
asset, though it may be armed for self-defence.

Hull form is a typical 'humped cylinder', arranged as
two primary decks. The drives and engineering spaces
are housed in a two-deck-high section right aft, with
the bridge above these on a dorsal hump. Forward
of engineering is the accommodation block. On the
upper deck are four standard staterooms and two
high-quality staterooms, with a lounge area forward
of these. On the lower deck is a block of barracks-

like accommodation with its own associated leisure/
working area. This is not required on some vessels
and often converted to other uses. Forward of the
accommodation/barracks block on the lower deck are
the medical and workshop areas, plus an oversized
armory. The forward section of the upper deck
contains a briefing/analysis/command suite whose
operation is the primary function of many vessels.

Performance is quite lively, which can be useful
when getting into and out of a combat zone
and which also allows the Gravitas to act as a
coordination platform for long-range missile strikes
or control vessel for fighters. It is not commonly
deployed in a space combat operations role,
however, and would normally host an intelligence or
cyber-warfare staff in its mission chambers. These
can also be used as a command post or to impress a
potential client.

Weaponry is defensive, and backed up by a lightly
armored hull. Both turrets are carried on the dorsal
surface, in a pronounced central hump and a smaller
forward one. Standard armament is a dual pulse
laser turret forward to engage enemy craft and a
multi-purpose turret mounted centrally. As standard
this has a beam laser and a sandcaster for defensive
work plus a missile rack which can be used to deploy
satellites or in a more conventional combat role.

GUNSHIP SHADOW-CLASS

The Shadow was developed from the outset as a
space combat vessel to be used by mercenaries or
small navies. It is not designed to fight larger vessels
unless they are very lightly armed, as its intended
space-combat role is piracy suppression and
protection of commerce. It does make an effective
commerce raider or light combat vessel, and was
designed to operate with or protect the Gravitas- class
diplomatic vessel. The Shadow can also transport
a platoon of ground troops, though long-term
occupancy is inadvisable. In this role, the gunship
can deliver troops and their personal equipment
but relies on a support vessel to transport heavy
equipment and supplies for a long-term deployment.
If troop transport capability is not desired the
barracks and its associated common area can be
converted to other uses.

Hull form is a 'cranked wedge' configuration, with a
wide 2-deck high section at the rear and a narrower
single-deck section projecting forward from it. Drives
are located aft on both decks, with the barracks
area, workshops, medical bay and armory forward

of them. The upper deck contains crew staterooms
and a small common area, forward of which lie the
bridge and command spaces.

The dual-purpose turrets are located atop the wedge
section, each with a small missile magazine. When
not launching missiles these turrets can provide
defensive fire. The two triple turrets rest atop the
main dorsal surface and are primarily used to
engage enemy vessels.

The vessel requires a crew of 9 for normal
operations, though adding a medic is advisable.
Some users dispense with the barracks and convert
the lower deck into a vehicle bay and deployment
area. Giving the ship's commander and the leader
of ground troops their own stateroom and moving
all other crew into double occupancy leaves six
staterooms which can be used by up to twelve
groundside personnel. This frees up the whole
barracks and troops' common area for spares and
supplies or vehicles and combat equipment.

ASSAULT SHIP DEYST-CLASS

The Deyst was conceived as a strike-and-retrieve
transport for a small force of heavily armed troops,
intended to be the spearhead of an assault or a
facilitator of commando missions. The hull is well
armored and performance in space or atmosphere
is generally good, enabling the Deyst to bring its
primary armament of twin fusion barbettes into
action against most targets.

Hull form is a streamlined wedge, two decks high at
the rear and tapering forwards. Drives and command
spaces are located aft on the upper deck, with the
staterooms, some common areas and utility spaces
split between the port and starboard sections of the
upper wedge. The fusion gun barbettes are mounted
at the front of the dorsal surface. Two triple laser
turrets are positioned aft and slightly outboard of
these, with the other pair on the outer edges of the
wedge to provide all-round firepower.

The lower deck is almost entirely given over to
troop operations. A platoon of infantry can be
easily accommodated in the barracks, with senior
personnel assigned cabins on the deck above.
Cargo, training and common spaces are specified
in the standard design but many users customise
their vessels by swapping functions around. The
assault capsule system is the heart of the ship for
some operators and wholly irrelevant to others, in
which case the area is usually repurposed. If it is
used, the system can put a dozen troopers on the
ground from orbit, with a second wave landing in
the ship.

Nominal crew is twelve including gunners, though
typically medics and armament technicians are
carried – especially by those rare units with
access to battle dress. Some operators do away
with the barracks and associated areas, adding
a few staterooms if necessary and creating a
large cargo space. This is useful for vessels that
undertake planetary raiding or piracy, but does
have some less nefarious applications.

TRANSPORT BORWEN-CLASS

The Borwen was developed as a small and inexpensive
troop transport for mercenary and government clients. It
is not an assault ship, though inevitably there are users
who will try to use it as one. Like many paramilitary
ships, the Borwen has a lightly armored hull and some
weaponry fitted as standard for self-defence.

General hull form is a 'flared cylinder', formed from
a primary hull with three compartmentalised sections
below. The central secondary hull is much longer and
larger than the other two, which flank it to create a
broad rear section. The primary, or 'working', hull
is dedicated to 'ship' operations, with the drives
and power plant conventionally located aft. Crew
accommodation is forward of this, with common areas
and the bridge positioned right forward. 32 staterooms
are provided, which is far more than a standard working
crew would need even with all crewmembers being
allocated a cabin of their own.

Nominal working crew is 20 including gunners and
one medic, though when troops are aboard the usual
medical complement is one medical officer and six
assistants, all of whom are familiar with emergency
low berth revival protocols. With 25 crew aboard it is
possible to jam a platoon of infantry into the remaining
staterooms, more or less, though normally cabins are
reserved for officers and senior NCOs.

Weapons fit is above average for a transport ship, with
ten dual turrets. Eight are grouped into two clusters on
the dorsal surface of the main hull, each containing
a twin pulse laser turret, two sandcaster turrets and

a missile/beam laser turret, with ammunition bays
serving each. Most vessels carry a few missiles for
combat work or even ground attack, with the rest
of their capacity available to launch satellites or
surveillance probes. The remaining dual pulse laser
turrets are mounted singly to give a wider arc of fire.

The lower deck contains three almost identical 'platoon
transport segments' arranged in parallel. The outer two
each contain 60 low berths each plus a small ready
area, cargo stowage and a medical bay. The central
one is has 40 low berths and a double-sized medical
bay that serves as a trauma center when the vessel is
supporting groundside operations. Forward of this are
training areas, a barracks capable of transporting a
platoon-sized unit and an extensive armory/workshop
for the unit's weaponry.

A company of up to 200 infantry can be transported
aboard a Borwen, with one platoon and command
personnel travelling 'awake' and the remainder in
low berths. A limited amount of supplies and support
equipment can be carried, though a unit with a lot
of vehicles may need a bigger ship. One of the key
factors in deciding what equipment to purchase is
whether it will fit aboard the unit's transport vessel.
Common variants replace the three low berth bays
with cargo space, creating a logistics ship, or with
garages for combat vehicles. An armored company
will often be able to squeeze its personnel into the
barracks and spare staterooms, raising carrying
capacity to around 200 tons depending on the nature
of modifications undertaken.
