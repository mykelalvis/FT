# Contract

**Security, Platoon. Cr100000 per month plus salaries and bonus. Ongoing.**
[[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation]] (ZRC) is a resource-extraction firm focused on obtaining materials for the starship manufacturing industry. [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] is a well-funded firm whose lead investor is [[Achenaar Antilles]], the sector-wide merchant line. [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] is headquartered on [[Gaen Luum]]/[[Core sector |Core]] and has a limited-term contract to develop a previously untouched undersea lanthanum lode on [[Arvlaa Gam]]. [[Arvlaa Gam]] does not have the resources or technology to access the lode and requires the assistance of its high-tech neighbor. After the term of their contract has expired, [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] must terminate the extraction operation and leave the gear behind for a consortium of local firms to continue working the mine.

[[Arvlaa Gam]] is administered by Saregon but its people are largely left to govern themselves. The power vacuum sometimes creates conflicts between industrial concerns on the planet. A conglomeration of mining firms confidentially established the contract with [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]], going over the heads of its own miners' union. The project was intended to be confidential but there was a leak. [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] considered scuttling the operation but a lanthanum shortage in the Shesh belt made them decide to go through with it in spite of the risks. The union and excluded companies have expressed their displeasure that the mine was being developed without their involvement by an offworld agency. The union and some of the excluded mining companies have vowed to oppose the operation, violently if necessary.

[[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] needs a platoon-sized mercenary unit to provide security for a multiple-phase ticket. They are offering Cr100000 per month plus standard salaries for the unit for the duration of the ticket. An additional bonus of Cr50000 will be given if none of [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]]'s equipment is damaged by the opposition.

# REFEREE'S INFORMATION

There are a number of issues at play here. On the surface, a ragtag group of miners should pose no threat to a well-trained and equipped platoon of mercenaries. However, what neither [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] nor the mercenaries know is that the lanthanum acquired has already been pre-sold to a subsidiary of [[Achenaar Antilles]]. [[Tukera Lines]], which is in heated competition for routes in the [[Saregon subsector]], has gotten word of this operation through its corporate intelligence arm. Tukera has surreptitiously equipped the miners with high-tech weapons and equipment from offworld. While most of the miners are not well-trained in the use of the equipment, merely having it makes them more dangerous than expected. In addition, Tukera operatives are providing support and intelligence to the miners.

# MISSION PHASES

The first phase of the mission is to secure the starport on [[Gaen Luum]] while mining equipment and vehicles re loaded onto [[Achenaar Antilles]] freighters. The [[Arvlaa Gam]] Miners' Union is not thought to have the resources or reach to sabotage the mission at this point but [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] is a somewhat paranoid company and does not want to take chances.

The second phase is the arrival on [[Arvlaa Gam]] and transit to the work site. The platoon is split into two sections for this phase. One accompanies part of the expedition to the coastal city of Madinudadi, where [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] is to rent several submersibles and other watercraft for use at the work site. The second section reports directly to the work site where survey and initial set-up is performed, including the construction of a floating structure where the [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] miners, personnel and mercenaries will be housed for the duration of the operation.

The third phase is to make sure that the operation is secure for its duration. [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] suggests setting up listening posts in the region.

The final phase is to provide cover for [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] during the return jump to [[Gaen Luum]].

# THE MINERS' UNION

The union are a rough-and-tumble bunch, many of whom are former soldiers. They are not in the business of fighting wars but [[Arvlaa Gam]] is a tough world and its laissez-faire industrial sector is not above fighting over resources. In short, an assault on the mercenaries will not be the first time they have engaged in combat. They are not nearly as organised as a qualified mercenary unit but underestimating their abilities would be unwise. Their morale is initially high but drops quickly if they encounter setbacks.

# THE OPPOSITION

The goal of the miner's union is to disrupt the [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] operation on [[Arvlaa Gam]] and to prevent it from extracting lanthanum from the mine. If they can accomplish this with sabotage, thereby avoiding armed conflict, they will do so. However, if the mercenaries do their jobs well, and they prevent the miners' union from accomplishing their goals, the union will become increasingly frustrated, eventually resorting to a more direct approach.

If the Travellers do not set up listening posts or some other form of surveillance, they are likely to be taken by surprise. Thanks to Tukera, the miners are equipped with high-tech submersibles, surface watercraft and weapons with which they intend to attack the [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] mining platform, killing anyone who resists and imprisoning the others, possibly to ransom them back to [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]]. The attack is likely to be multi-faceted, with the mercenaries forced to defend multiple sites at once.

# TICKET SUCCESS INDICATORS

This ticket has the following success criteria:
1: CRITICAL: Secure the mining platform, mining equipment and protect all [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] personnel from attack.
2: IMPORTANT: Prevent sabotage to all [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] gear during deployment and departure.
3: ROUTINE: Determine in advance whether an attack is planned and by whom.
4: ROUTINE: Keep the [[Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation|ZRC]] staff informed with daily briefings and situation reports.

One Critical, one Important and two Routine objectives give a maximum TSI of 11. The Travellers must run an airtight security operation to achieve all of these objectives. Simply going to and from [[Arvlaa Gam]] and waiting for someone to attack is likely to result in a lower score.
