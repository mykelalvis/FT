Lablon is an agricultural world at the very edge of the subsector; its economy is supported mostly by the sale of agricultural produce to the [[Vargr]] through the local trading station. Most of the population of 500,000 lives in small farming towns scattered about the most fertile areas of the four continents. The government is called the Lablon Planetary Cartel; its main duty is insuring that no community exports goods for other than the legally set prices: since the prices are high, there is little resistance.
