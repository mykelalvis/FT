### BICORNN
Lying off the main trade routes, Bicornn is a low-tech world of no great importance. Its local population have a stable TL2 society but never progressed further. There is no reason why the locals could not develop their technological base but this would require enormous external investment before any returns were made. Few would consider the effort worthwhile even if it were not for the risks. Bicornn is heavily balkanised and its population are engaged in a war of survival against a burrowing arachnoid species known as Krvn. These creatures resemble the Chamax, a hugely destructive species found to spinward of the region, but are not thought to be related. However, the alarm caused by a possible connection with the Chamax sparked a research project that made the startling discovery that Krvn are present on a number of other worlds in quite distant regions. How this came to be is not yet apparent, although teams of Imperial researchers regularly risk their lives on Bicornn to find out.

KRVN

Krvn are omnivorous and capable of burrowing through dense soil. Their nests contain dozens, perhaps hundreds, of workers and one or more large breeders which are rarely seen aboveground.
