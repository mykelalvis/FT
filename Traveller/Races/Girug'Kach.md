## GIRUG'KAGH

The Girug'kagh are a subject race of the [[K'kree]], dwelling within the [[Two Thousand Worlds]]. Such races are collectively known as kr'rrir, which translates literally as 'subjects'. All have been forced to adapt their cultures to conform to standards imposed by their K'kree overlords.

The name Girug'kagh was bestowed by the K'kree upon the people of a world named [[Savitztah]], who originally called themselves the Savezitaisoh. They are roughly humanoid-upright bipeds, homeothermic, standing at one and a half meter tall and generally hairless, with faint scaling always visible. Scales are dyed in various colours to indicate rank and status through patterns of different sorts, a point of great pride to the Savezitaisoh people and one of their few links with the past.

Girug'kagh hands have long, delicate fingers with seven digits. There are three grasping fingers, mutually opposable to all the other digits, and four shorter, stubbier, thumb-like members. Physically, the race is undistinguished; mentally they seem subservient, easily cowed and almost totally without spirit. Some have gone so far as to describe them as a slave race.

### HISTORY

The Girug'kagh are descended from omnivore/gatherer stock that lived in the coastal plains of their homeworld. They developed intelligence in the face of changing climate and increased competition for food collected from shoreline tidal pools and nests of burrowing animals, which dwelt along the coastal cliffs. Cooperation proved essential in the face of threats from several species of amphibian and shore dwelling carnivores.

The combination of intelligence and group cooperation led, eventually, to the rise of civilization but the Girug'kagh had only attained TL2 when the K'kree first came across them. This was the third non-K'kree race to be contacted and opinions were mixed on how to deal with them. The K'kree interdicted Savitztah for quite some time and came close to implementing a policy of genocide. However, it was eventually decided that there was some hope for the Girug'kagh, who foraged for such food as they could find and had already developed a flourishing agricultural base.

After deciding that the people of Savitztah might not need to be exterminated as meat-eating vermin, the K'kree offered them the option of adopting new ways or facing certain destruction at the hand of their technological superiors.

To the primitive Girug'kagh of that time, the K'kree were little short of gods. It is doubtful that they understood what was being asked of them but K'kree dictates on diet, conduct and other modifications in culture were accepted as teachings from heaven and widely embraced. Those who failed to adapt to the new ways were hunted down and slain by bands of vegetarian zealots, which were usually – but not always – composed of young K'kree warriors intent on making a name for themselves.

The Girug'kagh were eventually deemed ready to enter the mainstream of society in the Two Thousand Worlds and granted full subject status nearly 4,000 years ago. Subject status conferred a limited autonomy of self-rule and the right to travel to other worlds. The interdiction of Savitztah was ended, allowing the Girug'kagh to be visited by K'kree ships and those of other subject races.

By this time, the Girug'kagh had evolved a culture that was highly artificial, forced upon it from above rather than developed naturally from within. The cultural shock had left the Girug'kagh unable to realise their original potential as a civilised people.

### SOCIETY

Few vestiges now remain of the pre-K'kree ways of the Girug'kagh. Their language is all but dead, although in the last century or so there has been an effort to revive the old tongue and keep it from passing away forever. Ancient literature has been preserved as far as possible but the majority of pre-contact cultural materials were destroyed long ago.

Most social customs have arisen out of the K'kree dominance with the result that vegetarianism – and hatred of meat-eaters – is deeply rooted at the core of Girug'kagh culture.

The Girug'kagh have been instilled with an absolute conviction that they are second-class citizens, utterly inferior in all things to their K'kree overlords. Visitors from human states have attempted to persuade the Girug'kagh to throw off their chains and realise that they were as good as anyone else. These efforts were not merely unsuccessful; they were actively resisted and opposed by the Girug'kagh. The luckiest of these well-meaning emissaries were deported for their efforts.

The Girug'kagh simply cannot accept the idea that they were not naturally intended as servants to the K'kree. Though they no longer regard their masters as gods, there is still an intense feeling of awe and reverence characterising their attitudes towards the K'kree.

Equally, the Girug'kagh feel a superiority over other non-K'kree races. They were the first race to attain full subject status and consider themselves to be a sort of next step down in an inter-racial caste structure. The K'kree nobles, merchants and servants come first, then the Girug'kagh and then the rest of the universe. Many of the race's institutions are coloured by this opinion and the most honorable career for a Girug'kagh is that of underservant to a K'kree family group.

The Girug'kagh are often found as translators and intermediaries among the K'kree, particularly those K'kree who have dealings outside the Two Thousand Worlds. Less easily offended by the smell of meat-eating outsiders, and more capable of racial tolerance and enclosed spaces than their masters, Girug'kagh are very useful in conducting negotiations and other functions requiring close contact between K'kree and outsiders.

### GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY

The Girug'kagh government is a curious amalgamation of pre-contact structure and K'kree-imposed concepts. It follows a loose caste system, with a hereditary nobility occupying the highest echelons. This nobility was originally a sort of priesthood selected to deal with the K'kree, earning this honor mainly by being the first to embrace vegetarianism and capitulate entirely to the K'kree in all things. The fact that entry to the ruling class of the Girug'kagh was based on utter subservience to the K'kree had major implications for the development of society thereafter.

Other functions and services are dominated by a guild structure which, although not completely dependent upon birth, tends to limit social mobility. The only exception to the generally stagnant guild structure is the potential for anyone to volunteer for training to serve the K'kree as translators and servants.

The Proctor's Guild acts as a police force but the Girug'kagh have no military as such. Subject status to the K'kree does have one major benefit – a threat to a subject race is a threat to the Two Thousand Worlds and would be dealt with by the forces of the overlords.

### GIRUG'KAGH TRAVELLERS

Girug'kagh are unlikely to be encountered outside the Two Thousand Worlds or away from their K'kree overlords. Small groups are sometimes placed as trade or diplomatic emissaries and allowed to conduct the business of the Two Thousand Worlds with virtually no supervision – the K'kree are quite confident of the loyalty of their subjects.

Girug'kagh display a peculiar mixture of subservience and arrogance; subservience to their overlords and a haughty disdain for those below their station – which is more or less everyone who is not a K'kree. Their behaviour has been compared to that of an English butler, managing to convey an air of contempt while behaving with complete propriety.

#### Careers

Most careers are available to Girug'kagh on their homeworld, other than military and spacefaring services. However, the only Girug'kagh likely to be encountered by outsiders are translators working for the K'Kree. Girug'kagh translators have no rank structure recognizable by humans and do not receive mustering out benefits. They are part of a K'kree's entourage for life.

Translators receive one skill level in both Steward and Diplomat when they begin their career. One additional skill is earned from the following tables during each term of service.

|  1D | Personal Development | Service Skills   | Education   |
| :-: | -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
|  1  | STR +1               | Mechanic         | Admin       |

#### Characteristics

Girug'kagh roll for STR and END on 1D+2. DEX is rolled for on 1D+7. Other characteristics are generated normally, although SOC indicates the level of K'kree society the Girug'kagh serves more than anything else.

#### Traits

All Girug'kagh have the following traits:

Kr'rrir: Any Traveller with this trait is recognized by a K'kree as being a 'good subject'. They smell right and display the correct level of abject servitude, enabling K'kree to feel comfortable around them. Someone with the Kr'rrir trait suffers DM -6 on any checks that go against their loyalty to the K'kree, even if they want to disobey or harm them. A Traveller with the Kr'rrir trait would be bypassed by rampaging K'kree warriors or even protected by them – whether protection was needed or not.
