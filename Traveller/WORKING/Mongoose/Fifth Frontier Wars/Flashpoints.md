# INTRODUCTION

Flashpoints is an adventure set against the backdrop of the Fifth Frontier War. It draws upon the classic adventure Expedition to Zhodane for inspiration and some plot elements but has a very different storyline. It begins with the Travellers working in rather poorly- paid jobs in Utoland, in the demilitarised zone between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. How they got there is a rather convoluted story which will be unravelled as the adventures progress.

There are many choices for the Travellers to make $3 along the way and there is no 'right' set of answers. The Travellers will need to decide what they want to do and find a way to do it. At first they have only their own resources and it may not be clear who they can trust. The Travellers will literally get to decide who they are and what side they support.

With so many options available, it is not feasible to pre-programme this campaign with every dice roll and skill check; nor is it desirable to do so. The Referee's judgement and the Traveller rules provide all the tools necessary to resolve any situation. Flashpoints is a framework rather than a set of railroad tracks and how it progresses is a matter for interaction between Travellers and Referee.

Note also that this campaign can be completed by almost any Travellers, with any set of skills, although they will need to operate a starship. If there are no Travellers with suitable skills, a skeleton crew should be provided by the Referee. One or more workers at Utoland may be willing to come with the Travellers, although how they react to what they find aboard their ship may or may not be a problem. These additional personnel might also have secrets of their own.

## TIMING AND LOCATION

Flashpoints takes place during the early phases of the Fifth Frontier War, in the Demilitarised Zone between Imperial and Zhodani space. Or at least, the Travellers are physically present in that area throughout; their consciousness will spend some time elsewhere as a result of rather unusual circumstances. Referees will find The Fifth Frontier War useful but it is not absolutely necessary. Sufficient background information is presented here.

The border area between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate has always been the scene of tensions. Four frontier wars have been fought (in 589, 615, 979 and 1082) which, along with numerous scares and border incidents, might make the region seem like a powder-keg. Conventional wisdom held that this impression was false. Two of the wars were close together and so might be considered a single period of hostility, and in any case, four wars in 500 years is not indicative of implacable enemies awaiting a spark to trigger conflict.

To the Imperial intelligence agencies and the strategic planners they reported to, it seemed that neither the Imperium nor the Zhodani Consulate wanted another war. That might well be true but factions on both sides considered one necessary. The Imperial Hawks plotted and agitated to prepare for a first strike, never knowing their enemies were already readying one. The opening move in a three-pronged strike was against the Jewell Salient, driving on Jewell, Efate and Regina. A secondary thrust came through the Demilitarised Zone towards Regina, with smaller offensives against Lanth and Vilis.

The initial hammer-blow was not as decisive as the Zhodani planners hoped, although the Imperial response was strangely hesitant. As the Riverland campaign bogged down into sieges and raids, Imperial reinforcements began moving towards the combat zones. However, more subtle forces were at play. Decisions made years previously, intelligence operations successfully carried out or thwarted, political figures sidelined or discredited; all of these influenced the outcome of the fleet clashes. It may be that the outcome of the Fifth Frontier War was determined in the shadows, long before the shooting started.

# REFEREE'S INFORMATION

Flashpoints takes place in three segments. In the first, the Travellers find themselves working under dangerous conditions in the Utoland system, with a sense that something is wrong and a need to get out. They must escape from under Zhodani occupation and find a hidden starship. There, they trigger the second segment of the adventure, discovering they have had a personality overlay to conceal their real identities. As they try to find out why, they experience past events as if they were present... and discover they actually were. With their personalities restored the Travellers must escape from Utoland with the information they have uncovered, whilst the Imperials and the Zhodani contest the Demilitarised Zone around them.

The following information is for the use of the Referee. Part or all of this data might be available to the Travellers by various means but there is no guarantee that they have the whole story or accurate information. Many subjects are prone to distortion due to propaganda, misunderstanding or simply bad reporting. The Travellers would be well advised to cross-reference critical data rather than relying on a single source.

###### EXPERIENCING ZHODANE

Part of Flashpoints takes places in Zhodani territory and it may be that some of the Travellers are Zhodani themselves. The concept of 'Zhodane' may thus become important; the term 'Zhodane' is a common Imperial figure of speech rather than a specific location - 'Zhodane' in this context simply means an area that  is culturally Zhodani. The figure of speech also refers to anything Zhodani in terms of worldview, mindset or ethics. The key facet here is the acceptance of psionics as the foundation of both social strata and a way of life.

Zhodane, in this context, is a very alien place for all that it is populated by humans. Zhodani culture is quite different to that of the Imperium, best conveyed to the Travellers through small details and incidents rather than a single information-dump which may be forgotten about along the way. This means that the Referee will have to remain conscious that the Travellers are not in the Imperium any more.

Naturally, most of the 'common knowledge' about the Zhodani Consulate is vague or inaccurate. The impressions formed by most are heavily influenced by portrayals in entertainment shows rather than hard facts or personal interactions. A great many misfortunes and setbacks are blamed upon Zhodani influence or infiltration; occasionally this might actually be the case but as a rule it is more a matter of habit and prejudice than anything else.

Infiltration and a quiet takeover is considered a real possibility by many, however. This is mostly groundless and is more about fear of what life might be like under the Zhodani than any real threat of worlds being annexed. Most Imperials have a very distorted view of the Consulate, viewing the non-psionic Proles as either poor downtrodden serfs under psionic overlords or weak and ineffectual people who have meekly accepted psionic dominance. The idea that most Proles in the Consulate are actually happy (or at least content) is considered by many Imperials to be proof of unnatural mind-tampering and therefore another reason to fear a Zhodani takeover.

The deeply-ingrained mistrust of psionics in the Imperium causes all things Zhodani to be viewed with suspicion. This is not helped by the number of vid dramas in which Zhodani agents plant psionic spying devices or force good people to do bad things for the sake of advancing the plot. As a result, most Imperials are very uncomfortable around higher-ranking Zhodani and suspicious of what they might be doing behind their polite fa√ßade.

If Imperial citizens living along the border are naturally wary of all things Zhodani, the reverse is true in the Consulate. Zhodani citizens might receive a more honest portrayal of Imperials from their media but they are not inclined to find that truth attractive. Zhodani society is generally very honest, since lies and thievery are easy to uncover, so Zhodani are wary of a society where everyone seems to lie all the time. Agitators on both sides of the border play on these fears to further agendas, creating an atmosphere of mistrust and general discomfort which has at times been fanned into hate or fierce defensiveness.

###### CROSS-BORDER INTELLIGENCE WORK

The Zhodani intelligence services have a huge advantage over their Imperial adversaries, in that they can telepathically detect lies and false identities. The likelihood of this happening is actually much lower than Imperials think but an asset only needs to be caught once and networks are easily unravelled by psionic interrogation. Imperial intelligence work is for the most part undertaken either by covert means ‚Äì stealthy spy ships and listening stations ‚Äì or open intelligence gathering by diplomatic staff who must be careful to remain within their remit. True covert operations are rare and undertaken with great caution.

Zhodani have less to fear in terms of telepathic detection and have been known to psionically condition agents to truly believe they are someone else. These 'sleeper' agents can be left in place for years without fear of exposure and in some cases can be conditioned to take suicidal or extremely dangerous actions. The Imperials have sought a way to obtain this capability for a long time. One possibility was the work of people like Professor Charles Rashani Riket, whose insights might enable agents to fade into the background of Zhodani society better.

The Imperials also explored technical means. Psionic shields could only go so far; they needed a way to deceive a telepathic scan. To this end the Imperial intelligence services have tried for many years to perfect a personality overlay machine, or rather they have paid a lot of money to get someone else to do so. Several promising prototypes are available but they must be fine-tuned to create an Authentic Pseudo-Zhodani (APZ) personality. Riket naturally was called in to work on the project and somewhere along the way his mighty but rather na√Øve intellect came up with an idea.

###### PROFESSOR RIKET

Professor Charles Rashani Riket was once a highly respected academic at the University of Regina. His early work on society and politics remains standard reading on the subject but around 20 years ago he developed an interest in the effects of psionics on society and politics. This field gradually absorbed his entire interest and, since the whole field of psionics research is considered unpalatable by most of society, his generally pro-psionics stance attracted a great deal of controversy.

Riket eventually took an indefinite sabbatical from the university, continuing his research in private and publishing several books on the subject. It would normally be assumed that he lived off the proceeds of this work but this is only partially true. Most of the professor's income came from consulting for the Imperial intelligence agencies. As an expert on the effects of psionics on interstellar politics, his opinions on how to deal with the Zhodani Consulate were often sought out.

Once he became aware of the personality overlay project Riket became fascinated with the idea of seeing the Zhodani Consulate for himself, 'from the inside' as it were. His plan was not in any way malicious but it was na√Øve and selfish. When the opportunity presented itself, he created an overlay personality for himself using the most promising prototype of the overlay machine. A combination of the personality overlay and his position on the fringe of the intelligence community enabled him to slip away with a covert observation vessel, which he used to reach the fringe of Zhodani space. There, he planned to switch to commercial transport and continue his travels as far as Cronor. Once he was done experiencing Zhodani society he would simply reverse his steps. To his brilliant but extremely na√Øve mind this all seemed quite straightforward.

Riket had no ill intentions. He simply wanted to experience life in Zhodani society for himself and see first-hand the effects of psionics on daily life. He would eventually return, write up his findings and present the intelligence services with the results of a truly epic field test regarding the overlay machine. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Of course, Riket neglected to consider what might happen if the overlay machine's effects unravelled and revealed him as an Imperial infiltrator whilst in the middle of Zhodani space. The Zhodani were unaware of the existence of the overlay machine, making Riket's actions one of the greatest intelligence blunders in Imperial history.

He left a recording stating his intention to return but the intelligence services were unsure if he was telling the truth or intended to defect. Elimination was a possibility but they wanted him back alive if possible. Interrogation would reveal exactly how he went about using the device and slipping out from under their proverbial noses. It was possible Riket had help from the Zhodani or influenced others to help him somehow, and the obvious means was the overlay machine itself. However, the details of his escapade were still unclear; a deficiency that must be remedied when Riket was brought back into Imperial space.

Thus the Imperial intelligence services needed Riket back, or failing that he must be silenced. Given the embarrassing nature of the incident it was heavily compartmentalised. The operation to recover Riket was known to only a handful of people and those selected to carry it out were not the usual intelligence operatives. Instead the intelligence services co-opted a rather unlikely assortment of personnel, who agreed for varying reasons. Their sincerity was never in doubt; the personality overlay machine would see to that. Their methods might be questionable but they were deniable. Indeed, the whole matter could be erased from memory... providing nothing went too badly wrong.

##### PROFESSOR CHARLES RASHANI RIKET

Professor Riket is the very epitome of an academic who can barely function outside a research facility. He has very little idea how the world works; anything he wants to buy he orders from a datanet shopping site and most of his outings are organised by his assistants. Similarly, he does not really understand conflict and inter-state animosity in the same way as normal people. In particular, he considers Zhodani culture and way of life to be rather charming.

Riket does know, in a dry and academic sort of way, that the Zhodani Consulate is a foreign state and does not allow outsiders to wander around poking into things. However, he truly believes that since he is doing no harm they will not mind all that much. His overlaid personality is as much about preserving the purity of his data gathering as concealing his activities.

The overlaid personality is one Carlos Rashani, a journalist from Arden. Riket immersed himself in Arden's culture as best he could, consuming all the vid-dramas and popular novels he could. The resulting personality was convincing enough in terms of what he pretended to be but his knowledge of his 'home' and the anecdotes he might tell about it would probably cause a real Ardenite to burst out laughing.

Most other aspects of Riket's personality are unchanged. He is inquisitive and thorough to the point of fussiness, expecting everything to be planned out for him before he commences any action. His time aboard Rock Twelve was tedious, although he quite liked the way the vessel's automated systems took care of everything that needed to be done. All the same he was stressed by the time it took to reach his destination and perhaps a little too eager to get away from the ship. In addition, he had fiddled about with settings and systems he did not understand. That would have consequences later.

Riket was careful to reinforce his overlaid personality just before leaving, as he expected to be away from Rock Twelve for some weeks at least. He is firmly entrenched in his cover identity, a journalist working on a major story about the implications of a Zhodani takeover of Arden. Riket could not have picked a worse cover story. Far from the hypothetical scenario he believed it to be, this was actually unfolding as he arrived at Ninjar. In a way this helped deflect suspicion for a while, as no intelligence operative would be stupid enough to draw attention in this manner.

###### THE OVERLAY MACHINE

The existence of the overlay machine is a closely guarded secret. Few know that such a device is possible, far less that it actually exists, so there will be virtually no data on this subject outside high-clearance secure files. There are a few conspiracy theories and science-fiction dramas that come close to something similar in concept. Few consider these reliable sources and those who do are not credible witnesses.

In fact, there have been several attempts at creating a device of this type, some using purely electronic means, some combining surgery and other methods, and some taking a more organic/psychological route using reprogramming ('brainwashing') techniques accelerated by drugs and an electromagnetically induced receptive state. It is possible that machines using psionics or artificial psionics might exist but there is no data available on this subject.

The overlay machine encountered in Flashpoints remains something of a work in progress. It works but not without dangers and side-effects. At present only a handful of prototype machines exist, some of which are more fully developed than others. Using any overlay system is hazardous at the least and some of the prototypes are more risky than others. However, it is sufficiently useful that the risk may be worth it.

Most of the people that know it exists believe that the overlay machine uses a combination of drugs, artificial implantation of knowledge using RNA injection and exotic psychomanipulation techniques to build a false personality for the user. This is deliberate misdirection; this particular device is based around an exotic relic thought to date from the Ancients era. No other such devices have ever been found, to the knowledge of the intelligence services and this example is being eagerly sought by everyone who knows about it.

The machine 'overlays' the person's existing persona rather than completely suppressing or destroying it, and can be removed by a reversal session in the machine. Removing the false personality in this manner takes time but is not especially hazardous. Alternatively, a
'jettison option' is built into the programming which will ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì cause the overlaid persona to be suppressed or completely discarded. However, this is a traumatic experience and will probably not work completely; elements of the overlaid persona might remain, or the subject may become unstable on a temporary or permanent basis.

The overlay machine was developed to allow deep- cover operatives to avoid detection even when working in a psionically adept society such as the Zhodani Consulate. The intent was to overlay a personality that could be maintained with little conscious effort, behind which the real personality could be hidden. The actual result was slightly different.

The overlay machine can build various types of personality.

Light Overlay: A lightly overlaid personality gives the recipient a new set of mannerisms, speech patterns, accent and the like, which can be consciously
'switched on or off'. This will not fool a telepath but will permit a flawless performance even under conventional interrogation. The light overlay capability was the project's initial goal and was achieved, more or less. In some cases the new persona becomes
'stuck' and cannot be easily undone, if at all. Likewise, a subject who frequently switches between their own and the overlaid personality, or tries to have several overlays in place at once, risks mental damage. It is much safer to emplace the overlay, then remove it at the end of a mission or deployment.

Full Overlay: A fully developed personality is overlaid, suppressing the subject's original persona for the time being. The subject is convinced that this is who they are but retains a set of 'triggers' that can allow the overlaid personality to be discarded or put aside for a time. A full overlay will fool a telepathic scan but a psionic interrogator who is willing to cause serious harm to the recipient can unravel it. The full overlay should be removed using the machine to undo the process in careful steps but might contain a 'jettison' command triggered by a particular object or set of circumstances. The usual setup in this case is for a certain phrase, place or object to trigger a partial response. This takes the form of realisation there is an overlay in place and knowledge of how to remove it. If the subject chooses not to, they will forget about the incident and revert to fully believing in their overlaid persona within minutes.

Deep Overlay: A deep overlay is similar to a full overlay but has no 'trapdoors', i.e. there is no way that the underlying personality can be removed without access to an overlay machine. This method is used by deep- cover operatives who are absolutely convinced they are who the machine has told them to be. Extracting such an operative is difficult ‚Äì they may not cooperate and will find the claim they are someone else totally bizarre and a bit threatening. This option is rarely attempted with voluntary subjects but could be used to
'reprogramme' a captured enemy to believe they were an Imperial agent all along and thus obtain information. It might also be used to send someone on a one-way mission, such as creating an assassin who can get close to a target protected by telepaths.

Deep Command: Any overlay can include one or more deep commands. Most take the form of
'trapdoors' that allow the underlying personality to briefly surface and evaluate the situation but other commands can be implanted. Typically, a recall command is used, whereby if certain circumstances occur the operative will feel compelled to go to a particular place or take a particular action. This could be used to programme someone to undertake sabotage or assassination but it is quite hard to get someone to act completely against their nature. This means suicidal actions are virtually impossible for most subjects and being placed in a position where the subject has to do something like shooting a loved one may cause the programming to unravel messily.

Personality Alteration: Complete personality alteration, with the eradication of the former personality, might in theory be possible and could be used to rehabilitate criminals after a fashion. The machine in Flashpoints is not capable of full personality alteration, nor is any known overlay device. It is possible that this technology has been developed in the past but if so it is so secret that the Imperial intelligence services in the Marches know nothing about it.

Therapeutic Use: The overlay machine could in theory be used to treat psychiatric disorders but this would be an extremely risky proposition in practice. There is no way to tell what collateral damage might be caused by altering an already damaged mind and overlaying a new personality on an unstable one might result in more harm than good.

Psionics Activation: There are those who believe that the overlay machine might be used to activate latent psionic talents. At present there is no information on how this might be done, or if it is even possible.

Note that the overlay machine creates a personality, complete with memories and mannerisms, but does not imbue the user with new skills. Someone who is overlaid with the persona of a naval fighter pilot will remember flying fighters, living in pilot's accommodation and hijinks at graduation but they will not know how to pilot a spacecraft unless they already had that knowledge. Use of a wafer could grant the subject the necessary skills to go with their deceptive personality but a telepathic scan may reveal the skills are implanted which will be at odds with the overlaid persona.

Likewise, it is usual to provide the subject with a framework to build memories around as part of the programme. The machine's operators will provide anecdotes of college life to someone who is to pretend to be a graduate, maps of the college campus and so forth, and these will be built into real-seeming memories by the subject's subconscious. Without this information, the subject will invent memories as best they can. They will be convinced the memories are real but might someday go to a place they 'remember' and find it is quite different. The result of someone trying to create a set of believable memories about life in a society they know nothing or very little about is likely to be comical rather than convincing.

There are also some serious risks associated with the overlay machine. It is not perfect and there may be unexpected personality traits or characteristics even if everything goes well. It is particularly risky to 'jettison' a personality overlay without using the machine to carefully undo it. Switching a light overlay on or off also carries risks that the overlay and the subject's real persona will interact destructively.

When a persona is created, it has a viability period which depends on the quality of the machine used and other factors. This is typically 30 days plus or minus the Effect of an Average (8+) Medic check to operate the machine. At the end of each viability cycle, there is a chance of the persona beginning to slip or interacting with the subject's own personality.

Similarly, each time a user 'surfaces' their own persona and then reintroduces a light overlay personality, there is a chance that the overlay process will begin to unravel. Use of a deep command also challenges the viability of the overlay.

Each time the persona is challenged (by use of a trapdoor, deep command or at the end of a viability cycle), the subject must check to see if something has gone wrong. The chance to avoid a problem starts at Simple (2+) and becomes one difficulty level higher each time. Thus, the second challenge to a persona requires an Easy (4+) check, the third is at Routine (6+) difficulty, until Formidable (14+) is reached. All subsequent checks are at this level unless the subject's persona is reset by the overlay machine.

There are no modifiers to this check. It may be that future research into overlay technology could allow subjects to be trained or conditioned to avoid ill-effects but this is not possible at the present time.

If the check is successful, the subject has no problems. If it is failed with an Effect of -5 to -1, the subject gains a minor personality problem such as irritability, persistent misuse of certain words, forgetfulness of certain facts, a small but upsetting memory gap or other minor effects that must be roleplayed. These may fade over time or might require therapy to remove.

Each minor disorder gained adds a cumulative DM+ on the Major Problem table.

If the check to avoid problems is failed with Effect -6 or worse, roll on the Major Problem table for the results. The Traveller must apply their INT modifier ‚Äì less intelligent people are less likely to become unstable as a result of this process.

A psionically trained person could be given the persona of a Zhodani noble or intendent. A non-psionic might be able to pull off the deception for a time but since psionics use is routine they would at some point be forced to reveal they had no talents. This might be as bad for the subject as for their cover identity ‚Äì someone sure they are a telepath who cannot send or receive thoughts, and who has no idea why, might become deeply troubled. This is especially true if the person came from a society where telepathy was the norm for people of their social class.

The converse is possible. A psionically adept person could be given a non-psionic persona and will not even think of using psionics ‚Äì not even if someone tells them to. This could be used to suppress a dangerous psion, although the overlay must be renewed regularly. It can also be used to slip a psionically skilled agent into an environment where they will be watched or scanned for the signs of psionic familiarity. Only when the real personality surfaces will they be able to use their powers.

###### WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE

Both the Consulate and the Imperium consider it necessary to undertake intelligence operations and stir up trouble for the opposition, and maintain a position of strength along the border despite this potentially being seen as inflammatory. There is a tightrope to be walked between deterring aggression and making the opposition feel they have to strike. Both sides know that the other is undertaking a constant risk- opportunity-reward-consequences analysis based on information they have available, but they cannot be sure exactly what information the other has, nor how much importance is assigned to any particular item.

For example, a given system might be trivial to the long-term plans of one 'player' in this game but be seen by the other as critical to a strategy that might one day have to be implemented. The result is that strategic planning must account for not only the state's own aims but also the expected or likely goals of the opposition. It is also possible that the opposition might consider some long-term objective so important that they might risk war (or even start one) in order to obtain a key component of their strategy.

There is always the possibility that war might break out because some apparently unimportant rockball was left unguarded. Whatever else is gained or lost, if that rockball is important enough to long-term strategy, one day the defeated side might look back to its loss ‚Äì barely noticed at the time ‚Äì and wonder if that was the beginning of their downfall. Knowing the mind of the enemy is vital to successful deterrence or war planning.

It is for this reason that the work of academics like Professor Riket is of great interest to Imperial strategic planners. Riket's work on the effects of psionics on political and social affairs is not to the taste of many in the Imperium but it gives the intelligence community an insight into how the Zhodani think and what they might consider important. This is important to winning any war that breaks out, since it allows prediction of the enemy's goals, but equally it is vital to preventing one by not giving the Consulate an opportunity to secure their goals at an affordable cost. Although his interest in psionics ‚Äì albeit indirect ‚Äì made him unpopular to the point of having to quit his mainstream teaching job, it also made Professor Riket an asset to the Imperium for several years. During this time he rather innocently moved deeper and deeper into the strategic intelligence world, never really understanding the importance of his work outside academia. By the end, he had access to ultra-secret projects. His very lack of strategic comprehension placed him, if not above, then generally outside suspicion; Riket was obviously only interested in research and seemed quite content so long as he was given the resources to pursue it.

It was this lack of understanding, rather than any malice or treachery, that took him to the Zhodani Consulate. He simply decided he would like to make some direct observations and set off to make it happen. He was no pilot nor astrogator, so he set up an automated flight plan aboard an observation ship. Riket never thought to conceal this and in any case he did not know how. Soon after his disappearance was discovered, his destination was known. He had set up a course for Ninjar, a Zhodani world. This created a problem for the intelligence community. A major undertaking to find and return or kill Riket would require admitting that a top-clearance researcher had simply wandered off with a spy ship and a prototype top-secret device. Careers would be ruined. So a covert operation was undertaken using some of the equipment Riket had been working on.

Off the books, deniable and extremely dangerous, Operation Kasuesh was named for a peculiar creature found on a handful of worlds, which has a water-dwelling larval stage, becomes an amphibian as an adult and eventually returns to the water. The name seemed apt, as for a time the operatives would not know whether they belonged in one environment or the other.

###### OPERATION KASUESH

Operation Kasueh was devised as a way to undo the damage caused by Riket's departure and protect the reputations of those affected by it. Rikett himself was valuable but the most promising prototype of the personality overlay device was aboard the covert reconnaissance vessel he stole. Imaginatively named Rock Twelve, the ship was disguised as a planetoid and might still be recoverable. A group of operatives was selected from outside the usual sources and given suitable cover personas using a different model of personality overlay device.

Along with their new identities, the operatives were programmed with certain imperatives:

- Locate Professor Riket
- Extract Riket if at all possible
- Kill Riket if extraction is impossible
- Prevent the Zhodani from discovering the existence of the overlay device
- Return Riket along with the ship and the device to Extolay Naval Base

The mission was half-baked at best but it stood an outside chance of success. Security was extremely tight, such that even if there was a leak or Riket was captured ‚Äì both of which the Imperial intelligence community feared ‚Äì the identities and even the existence of the operatives could not be compromised. The operatives were given a good cover and really believed they were who they said they were. They were conveyed as far as Quar by a fast Imperial cruiser, catching up to Riket as he plodded along his pre-programmed route. At Quar, the operatives boarded a local passenger ship and headed to Ninjar in the hope of intercepting Riket.

The intelligence services knew, but did not inform the operatives, that the overlay device was imperfect. The overlaid personality would begin to unravel and might eventually collapse. The operatives knew their mission was time-sensitive but were not aware of all the reasons why. Nor were they told that additional imperatives had been implanted. Exactly what these were may end up being determined over the course of Flashpoints ‚Äì by the Referee or the Traveller concerned. For example, the Travellers might discover some parts of their logs have been erased and eventually realise they did it themselves. Finding out why may become an important plot element.

Whether or not the Travellers succeeded in locating and/or extracting Professor Riket has not yet been determined. When the Travellers unlock their memories they will play out the events of this part of the adventure and find out ‚Äì or rather, determine ‚Äì whether or not they succeeded. In any case, they were able to recover Rock Twelve and made a rendezvous with a more conventional intelligence ship in the Stave system. If the Travellers successfully extracted Riket he was taken off their hands and after a debrief they continued towards Extolay.

The Travellers' flight path was determined by their jump-2 capability. From Stave they jumped to Caloran, using reserve fuel for a second jump to Zircon. There, they found Zhodani ships in the system and a proclamation on the local datanets that the Federation of Arden was now recognised by the Zhodani Consulate. The Zhodani ships were broadcasting an order for all Imperial vessels to proceed to the starport to be interned. That would only happen in a war, although the Zhodani made no mention of that.

#### USING IMPLANTED IMPERATIVES

It is necessary to tread lightly when using these imperatives. They are not intended to railroad the Travellers the way the Referee thinks they should go but are instead plot devices designed to place the Travellers in a position where they must make difficult choices. For the most part, a Traveller would feel a compulsion to take certain actions or have a feeling of rightness about some situations. A use of implanted imperatives must create more options than it takes away. The outer limit would be having a Traveller carry out an action and not remember doing it.

For example, if the Travellers are investigating who deleted a critical section of the logs and one of them discovers they did it, this raises questions that could be interesting. Should the Traveller tell the others? Is the video of them taking this action faked? Why did this happen? Handled well, the imperatives might kindle a burning resentment towards an intelligence agency that violated the Traveller's free will, which would be an interesting in-game situation. Used in a heavy-handed manner they are more likely to result in resentment towards the Referee.

The question was resolved by a coded signal embedded in routine datanet chatter. It was an advisory, planted by an intelligence operative who might well have been captured soon after. The code indicated that the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate were now at war and that the Zhodani had struck first. There was no other information.

The Travellers set their next jump, to Tremous Dex, but their ship had other ideas. Professor Riket had fiddled too much with its programming, or perhaps just set too many parameters. For whatever the reason, the ship implemented an emergency measure, altering its destination to Alternate Rendezvous Delta in the Utoland system. The Travellers were unaware of this until they arrived and as soon as jump emergence was complete the ship began to shut down. Frantic efforts to prevent the shutdown produced some information but could not halt or even slow the process.

Rock Twelve had detected anomalies in its security programming, suggesting it had been compromised. It was activating a 'shut down and wait for instructions' protocol which could not be countermanded without the

correct codes. The Travellers were never given those. Without them, the ship would lie silent until correctly reactivated. That meant no light, no heat, no water... a slow, cold and dark death for anyone remaining aboard.

There was only one possible solution. The Travellers pulled an auxiliary data core and gathered what they thought they might need. Anyone who thought it necessary gave themselves a new personality overlay that would let them hide out on Utoland. Then they boarded the ship's boat and headed for Utoland. Perhaps they would be extracted by the intelligence services; perhaps they might figure out how to get the codes they needed from the data core. Perhaps they would ride out the war as simple miners.

... and now the Travellers are on Utoland working in the mining industry for too little money. Their personality overlays are wearing thin and they are beginning to realise something is amiss. At this point, they have no idea just how badly wrong everything has gone.

###### INVOLVING THE TRAVELLERS

Flashpoints begins with the Travellers already involved. They are on Utoland with a personality overlay in place. How they got there remains to be determined but if existing Travellers are to be used they will not have their usual goods, money and equipment. It is missing and they do not know where it is. The Travellers must choose a backstory which accounts for this ‚Äì suggestions are noted further on. They will be able to recover everything they had in the course of the adventure.

The Travellers came to be on Utoland as a result of working with the Imperial intelligence services. There are various reasons why they might have done that but the end result is the same. The Travellers entered Zhodani space and evaded detection as spies by using a personality overlay, which is still in place. They are convinced they are the overlaid personality but there are 'trapdoors' that will allow the real personality to surface and also deep commands that compel the Travellers to work towards certain goals.

If new Travellers are in use the Referee need not reveal anything about the situation to them ‚Äì they think they are the people in question. However, for existing Travellers some explanation is required. The Referee should reveal as little as possible to avoid confusion and assure the Travellers that all will become clear. However, that knowledge ‚Äì and recovery of their possessions ‚Äì will have to be earned in the course of Flashpoints.

The Referee should tell the Travellers something along the lines of:

This adventure begins 'in medias res' ‚Äì right in the middle of something. Your Travellers find themselves in a difficult situation and for the time being cannot remember how they got there. They will get the chance to unravel the events of the past few weeks and recover their money and equipment, but they will have to deal with what is in front of them first.

The Demilitarised Zone between Imperial and Zhodani space is the result of multiple wars and the treaties that ended them. Some of the worlds within it have been part of one power or both at times and all are subject to varying degrees of cultural influence. Many of these worlds have developed their own culture that is neither Imperial or Zhodani in nature and some have developed a sense of identity that may lead to the creation of a small interstellar power. The Federation of Arden is certainly trying to foster such a measure... with itself as the leader, of course.

Under the existing treaty, neither the Imperium nor the Consulate are permitted to maintain bases in the DMZ but there is no prohibition on using facilities of neutral but friendly planets. Likewise, freedom of navigation is to be safeguarded by both powers but there is nothing to stop local worlds from imposing tariffs.

The Federation of Arden has done so in the case of Imperial (but not Zhodani) registered vessels. Ships registered out of Arden are exempt, prompting some operators to reflag their vessels in order to gain an advantage over those who will not.

The Imperial and Consular navies are permitted to send vessels into and through the DMZ, although any movement of over 100,000 tons of vessels must be announced and all ships involved identified to the opposing power. In practice this means notification is often made very late due to 'situational necessities', and the fleet movement plan provided is out of date in any case. There are plenty of excuses for this, such as availability of vessels or a need to deal with reports of pirates and such like. Both sides play fast and loose with the details but the general principle is that battle squadrons or large flotillas moving into the DMZ would be considered inflammatory or even grounds for war.

# THE DEMILITARISED ZONE

The Demilitarised Zone is generally considered to consist of distinct sub-regions, each with its own slightly different characteristics.

##### ESALIN

Esalin, in the Jewell subsector, is not part of the DMZ but has an unusual status. It was not settled until 835 and almost immediately the expected tensions emerged. Captured by the Zhodani during the Fourth Frontier War and ceded to the Consulate at its end, Esalin passed through joint administration to full independence. There are Zhodani and Imperial enclaves on-planet, creating opportunities for back-channels diplomacy but also continued tensions between the powers.

##### THE QUAR END

The worlds of Algebaster, Narval and Rasatt lie adjacent to member systems of the Zhodani Consulate and are either officially client states of the Consulate or subject to heavy economic and cultural influence. Imperial- registered ships tend not to visit these systems very frequently. Plaven, Quar and Gougeste are Imperial clients or as good as and connected to the Jewell cluster by a regular freight and passenger service.

Quar was the site of an Imperial naval base until it became neutral. Since then the facility has been officially non-Imperial but is not open to anything but Imperial warships. Typically a token corvette or destroyer is assigned there, 'liaising' with local defence forces and patrols take liberty at Quar. A similar situation exists at Narval, although in this case it is Zhodani ships 'visiting' their ally.

##### THE ARDEN GROUP

Imperial officials in particular go to considerable lengths to avoid using and therefore legitimising the term 'Federation of Arden' but the Arden Group is made up of worlds heavily influenced by The Arden Society, which is intent on creating an interstellar polity. Therefore, the Arden Group and the nascent Federation of Arden are essentially the same thing.

The Arden Group consists of Caloran, 899-076, Zenopit, Arden, Zircon and Utoland. Some of these worlds have minimal populations which might be better considered outposts of Arden's economic sector than world governments in their own right. Zircon is at present resistant to Arden's influence, with objections occasionally spilling over into violence.

##### THE IMPERIAL-ALIGNED WORLDS

Frond, Edinina and Tionale are officially client states of the Imperium, with treaties in place permitting Imperial forces to be stationed in-system without violating the DMZ. Digitis has had client state status in the past but there are legal questions concerning whether this is still in place. The Imperium usually maintains that it is, whilst the Zhodani Consulate does not recognise the claim.

##### THE ARDEN TRANSIT

Pequan, Tremous Dex and Rangent are usually referred to as the Arden Transit. 871-438 is associated with them but has no population and is generally bypassed. The Class B starport at Tremous Dex is an anomaly, representing considerable investment in an otherwise low-value system. It was built soon after the Fourth Frontier War by a private consortium funded by the Zhodani Consulate. The goal, apparently, was to foster increased trade and perhaps better relations between Imperium and Consulate. Although officially non-aligned, Tremous Dex is sometimes referred to as a Zhodani Protectorate and often has a consular navy guardship present.

##### STAVE

The proximity of Stave to Zhodani territory places it within the Consulate's sphere of influence but the system is of little interest to Zhodani strategists and economic groups alike. It is generally bypassed, with jump-2 traffic moving between Caloran and Rapp's World.

##### RUIE

Ruie is heavily balkanised, with nations ranging from pro- to anti-Imperial in their stance and having little fondness for the Consulate either. The proximity of the system to Regina makes it desirable for the Imperium to annex it or at least negotiate the right to base warships there, but existing treaties do not permit this. At the beginning of the Fifth Frontier War the Zhodani Consulate staged a fleet through Ruie to attack Regina - exactly as the Imperials had feared ‚Äì in violation of the DMZ treaty. The outcome of this action is still in doubt at the beginning of this adventure.

Utoland is a small, dry planet with a tainted atmosphere. It is semi-officially owned and governed by Arden, an independent world about three parsecs away. Utoland has little economic value of its own and is currently being stripped of its mineral and natural assets by the government of Arden. In addition to the permanent population of around 40,000 there is a variable but large transient workforce, most of whom work in or are based out of large complexes. The biggest of these is Mining Complex 4, located about 100 kilometres south of the planet's only city, Utane.

Utoland is outside the Imperium and has a low Law Level, making it a suitable place to hide out for a while or seek employment where few questions will be asked. Indeed, many of the miners are convicts shipped off to work their sentences, whilst others would probably become convicts if they frequented systems that were less of a backwater.

The mining companies, notably Arden Mining, are constantly seeking reliable employees with skills the company requires. The sort of people who come to Utoland to hide out, or who are sent there, are by definition not at all reliable, so there is good money to be made for shuttle pilots, administrators, technicians, planetary scientists and other experts. Or so it seems.

The companies are very good at luring people to Utoland with promises of high living conditions and a fat salary but in order to prevent staff from migrating away they tend to put obstacles in the way. Salaries have to be paid into the company bank and it is very difficult to withdraw sums large enough to buy a ticket offworld. Living expenses seem to creep up over time to the point where the big salary is virtually worthless and even starship operators find themselves bound by tricky contracts.

In short, Utoland sucks and everyone wants to leave. The authorities know this and have made it very difficult.

## THE ARDEN SOCIETY ON UTOLAND

The Arden Society is a group of powerful and rich individuals dedicated to making Arden the leader of an interstellar state. They do not always agree on how to go about this, and there are certainly rivalries, but at present the Society is working towards its common goal in a coherent fashion. The 'Utoland Project' is the flagship initiative of The Arden Society. It is intended to turn Utoland into a colony of Arden, purely for the benefit of Arden itself.

Utoland had a small and scattered population until The Arden Society decided to make it an economic asset. A few thousand people occupied the only large settlement, Utane, with about the same number dwelling in minor communities within 500 kilometres of it. There was no known settlement on the rest of the planet. Trade ships out of Arden would sometimes land at Utane but once the Utoland Project was implemented things changed quickly.

# UTOLAND

## UTOLAND'S TAINT

Utoland's atmosphere is tainted with fine dust which irritates respiratory passages and can, over time, increase the risk of cancer. The taint is worse around surface mining operations, as might be expected. A standard filter mask is overkill in this situation; cloth masks are entirely sufficient providing they are cleaned regularly. Being exposed to the taint for a short time is not likely to be harmful, although sneezing and some discomfort is likely.

Most buildings have what are grandly termed 'airlocks' but which might better be described as dust-traps. Blowers are common, forcing most of the dust back outside, but in poorer areas dust protection is a matter of stopping between the doors and knocking the dust off. Such dwellings usually have a thick carpet of dust outside, where it has been brushed out of the dust-trap. Such basic measures are not really adequate and respiratory diseases are common among those who cannot afford blowers and good door seals.

Citizens from Arden arrived and set up businesses in Utane. They were lavishly funded and had access to more advanced machinery and goods than the locals. The ensuing period of expansion and economic conquest seemed at first to be beneficial to the locals but it quickly became apparent that all the money was being made by the Ardenites. As the mood changed, protests began which provided an excuse to deploy the newly formed Economic Protection Service.

The EPS was supposedly charged with no more than protecting Ardenite personnel and facilities from 'disruptive elements' but in practice it became an occupation force. At the same time, Ardenites were buying all the best places to live and building exclusive estates on the fringes of Utane. An influx of colonists arrived from Arden, most of them quite poor and lured by the promise of a better life. Some found it, taking good jobs in Ardenite businesses, but most ended up in the same situation as the locals; underpaid and deprived of opportunities.

On the face of it, Utoland did seem to be undergoing an economic boom. Mining complexes were constructed - at great expense ‚Äì along with a rail network for transporting ore to the starport. This in turn supported a small offworld mining industry. Support for all this activity provided work, which brought in more colonists and when the majority of the construction was complete they could not afford to leave. Most found jobs in the mining sector or its supporting industries.

There was never much investment in Utoland other than the mines and infrastructure needed to get products to Arden. What industry was created was entirely focused on supporting the mines. The end result was a disaffected population of Utolanders and poor Ardenites, equally oppressed by the EPS, with a managerial class above them. There is no real elite on Utoland; the rich people who own the mines do not visit unless they absolutely have to. Competition for managerial status is fierce, with far more mid- and higher level jobs going to personnel hired offworld than local people. This situation is exacerbated by a poor education system.

The Economic Protection Service absorbed local law enforcement, such as it was, but is concerned with protecting the managerial class and then Ardenite businesses, to the near-exclusion of other functions. Individuals or circumstances that threaten stability or undermine profits are dealt with but most other crimes are half-heartedly investigated, if at all. The EPS operates on something close to a war-zone footing much of the time, carrying out heavily armed patrols in force or implementing lockdowns of troubled areas if the perceived need is sufficiently great. Most neighbourhoods have unofficial enforcers, who vary from gangs of thugs protecting their own activities to a semblance of actual police.

The situation is better in the mining complexes, in the sense that everyone there has a job and there are more guards. Infractions are punished with docked pay or assignment to punitive duties, which are hazardous and unpleasant. Living conditions are basic but generally better than in the capital, since the complexes were planned rather than growing in a rush as more people arrived. Overall, The Arden Society has taken control of Utoland and is plundering its natural resources. Its members do not care about the population so long as their factories are kept fed by a steady supply of ores and minerals.

# UTANE

Utane is home, if that is the right word, to about 40,000 people. At the centre is the Old Town, the original settlement. It is surrounded by new-built facilities and neighbourhoods, with undeveloped areas in between. The overall impression is of several small settlements in close proximity to one another, linked by an internal rail system. The character of these areas varies considerably.

Although the official Law Level on Utoland is quite low, the city of Utane is subject to tighter restrictions. Most are supposedly temporary but few have ever been lifted. Movement between some parts of the city is subject to a system of permits, although enforcement can be patchy. Anyone using the internal railway system is required to have a permit for their destination and street checks may be carried out on anyone who does not look like they belong. However, permits can be traded and it is always possible to move through marginal areas between the built-up zones.

These marginal areas are often overgrown with scrubby desert plants. Where they butt up against walled parts of the city there is usually a cleared zone of a few metres but not always. In the case of unwalled areas there is usually an interface zone where a few buildings have pushed out into the semi-desert or scrubland has intruded into the town. There are occasionally small gardens in the marginal land, although the difficulty of preventing others from taking their produce usually means the owner will be living nearby or that those who own the garden maintain some form of guard rota.

With an official Law Level 4, handguns, shotguns and non-military rifles are technically legal anywhere on the planet. However, longarms ‚Äì essentially anything larger than a pistol ‚Äì are restricted in all urbanised areas of the city. Ownership is not prohibited but open carry is. Enforcement in these areas is patchy to non-existent but other armed citizens might react to a perceived threat. Criminals and those who consider the law applies only to poor people may have access to light automatic weapons.

The higher-security areas of the city are walled or fenced and subject to a no-weapons restriction. Those who can afford it can buy a 'home defence' permit which allows firearms to be kept for the protection of dwellings or business premises, and those with the money and 'obvious apparent requirement' can get a permit for their staff to carry weapons. This comes down to a disarmed working class whilst the elite can buy the right to carry more or less whatever they choose.

Visitors are generally kept confined to the starport and startown areas. This is accomplished by a combination of tedious bureaucracy surrounding rail tickets and access permits, and distractions available in offworlder-friendly parts of the city. Newsvid reports of violent crime elsewhere are tailored to create the impression the locals are hostile to offworlders. Once someone is outside the startown and spaceport, access is heavily restricted. Tickets are expensive and permits routinely refused for spurious reasons or subject to inexplicable delays.

## THE OLD TOWN (1)

The Old Town, as it is now known, was the original city. It has been expanded with some new construction around the fringes, built before The Arden Society decided it was better to construct entirely new neighbourhoods. Most buildings are old but clearly constructed in a spacefaring-colonist style from lightweight but strong materials. The result is rather dreary and somewhat chaotic, as there was little overall planning during the colonisation phase.

Some sections are made of individual structures which have air filters and a double-door system to keep the atmospheric taint at bay, whilst others are a warren of living and work spaces within an airlocked corridor system. These were improvised by the early colonists and expanded or shored up over the years thereafter. The result is cramped and ramshackle but at least it is possible to move from building-to- building without a mask.

There are several such clusters, some of which are connected to others by passageways that serve as choke points for the gangs or local enforcement agencies that control the areas at each end. The largest cluster contains the Utoland Market, a chaotic bazaar where all manner of goods are traded and stabbings are commonplace. The population of the Old Town is predominantly Utolanders but there is little distinction between them and the equally downtrodden and miserable Ardenite population.

###### UTANE STARPORT (WALLED SECURE AREA) (2)

The starport is located on the southern side of the city, forming a large bulge. It was built to TL9 standards, with some advanced equipment brought in by The Arden Society. Facilities are good, creating a favourable impression with offworlders who have not seen the rest of the city. The port has very obvious heavy-loading equipment for ore and minerals, and will often have an ore freighter on its large pad.

The port is served by a rail link which has separate heavy and light elements. The light rail elements carry passengers and minor goods within the city, whilst the heavy element uses a wider gauge and links the starport rail terminal (2a) with the northern rail nexus (8a) and to the mining complexes by way of the central rail hub (9). The city's administration complex (2b) is also located at the starport. Here, new arrivals undergo an orientation process which builds up their hopes before being sent to wherever they are to work. Orientation is sufficiently slick that many retain their optimism for weeks or even months.

A belt of managerial level housing (2c), interspersed with dwellings for their staff and an Economic Protection Service contingent, surrounds the southern end of the port. The whole area is walled and monitored by cameras. Beyond this is a cleared area delineating the limits of the city. Such cleared areas are often taken over by locals hoping to grow food or construct a living space but those near the starport are off-limits and anyone trying to move in is run off by the EPS.

###### UTOLAND STARTOWN (WALLED SECURE AREA) (3)

Utoland has a small startown linked to the port by a short section of light railway. The startown is walled and well secured by the EPS. Uniquely of all areas of the city it has a light atmosphere dome, enabling visitors to move between buildings without a mask. Most structures are still sealed in case of a breach. Conditions are good; the startown is bright, modern and cheery with a decent array of shops and recreation facilities.

The population is almost 100% Ardenite and although most are not of managerial level they know they are favoured and lucky to have the best jobs planetside. Competition for a place at the startown is fierce and it is used as a tool to manipulate and pacify the workers. With their thinking redirected from wanting a better world to fighting for a place in the best part of a rather poor one, most of the workforce is kept compliant.

Offworld trade is minimal, although ships from Arden use the port on a regular basis. Their crews are well looked after at Utoland Startown, as are the world's few visitors. It is quite possible to leave Utane with a favourable impression of happy, hard-working people earning good salaries in Arden's economic showcase. This is of course entirely deliberate and has assisted in luring offworlders to Utoland in search of good jobs. Some find them; the startown is home to port staff and technicians as well as the crews of mining shuttles operating elsewhere in the system.

###### MANAGERIAL ENCLAVE TWO (FENCED SECURE AREA) (4)

ME2 is built on the site of the original Arden Economic Complex, which was set up early in the economic takeover of the world. Once the Ardenite presence had outgrown it, this area was largely ignored until it was torn down and recently rebuilt. Surrounded by a double fence with a ditch between, the area houses the tallest buildings on Utoland. At only 6‚Äì10 storeys these are hardly impressive to offworlders but they are a symbol of Arden overlordship. Not coincidentally, one of the towers rises from a compound housing the Economic Protection Service training facilities, armoury and vehicle garage. The tower is rumoured to have concealed weapon mounts capable of firing into the Old Town and other nearby areas. The EPS headquarters is on the top levels of the tower.

The rebuilt ME2 is the best place to live on Utoland. Its population is about 80% Ardenite, with most of the Utolanders working in service industries or employed by the EPS. Permit enforcement is strict and reasonably honest in this area, to the point where just requesting a permit to visit is grounds for a background check. As with the starport, those privileged to work here are grateful and will rarely do anything to risk their status.

###### MANAGERIAL ENCLAVE ONE (FENCED SECURE AREA) (5)

Managerial Enclave One was constructed early in the expansion of Utane, as an administrative centre and housing for the more privileged workers at the northern processing works. It is more basic than ME2 but still comfortable, with most buildings in clusters sharing a common airlocked environment. There is a small barracks for EPS troopers at the western end, immediately beside the light rail terminal.

###### MARSHALLING YARDS (PARTLY WALLED AREA) (6)

These heavy equipment yards are contained within a partly-completed wall, with other walls and the remains of them subdividing the area. The yards have been remodelled and expanded over time, with some sections more or less abandoned pending a thorough rebuild. These are sometimes used by intruders to reach tool and equipment stores.

The yards are served by both light and heavy rail lines, which feed into a marshalling and storage yard for rail wagons, passenger cars and locomotives. These are maintained here, so there are usually one or more vehicles in a partially dismantled state. Mining equipment and vehicles are stored and maintained elsewhere in the area. There is no truly huge mining equipment; the biggest vehicles are housed at the mining complexes. However, there is a considerable amount of half-repaired planetside mining equipment here including robotic drilling units and ore extractors. A smaller yard, with a complete and intact fence, houses the maintenance works for mining equipment to be used in space.

Part of the area was repurposed to act as a reception and processing area for food coming in from the farms to the east. Eventually it proved simpler to run all food into this area, including that coming by train from more distant farming settlements. At any given time there are multiple warehouses filled with crops and vegetables, steadily feeding into the processing and distribution network.

###### THE NEW TOWN (7)

Unlike the Old Town, the New Town was planned from the outset and is more organised. Buildings are clustered, with covered and airlocked walkways between them. The New Town has better amenities than the original settlement and most of its population has at least a little money to spend. The New Town can be dangerous at times but is really the only place to go for miners from outlying complexes. This brings in a little money, which in turn buys hope of better times. The atmosphere is less wearily grim and hostile than the Old Town as a result.

###### NORTHERN RAIL TERMINAL AND PROCESSING WORKS (8)

The Northern Rail Terminal was the original rail hub for the city. It still handles most of the ore and minerals coming in from the northern mining complexes. Ore is given a first-pass at the complexes, getting rid of most unwanted materials, but arrives at Utane in irregular lumps with many impurities. It is cheaper to have the more complex second-pass purification and ingot-moulding in one place. The facilities for that are rather small at the northern rail terminal, so only high- value ores are processed there. Lower-value materials such as iron and copper are sent through to the main processing works at the centre of the city.

This part of the city is not walled or fenced but the rail yards and ore processing plant are. The rest of the area is given over to worker housing and associated facilities. There is little in the way of recreation or retail, since the Old Town is just a short train ride away. The light railway between the two is the least restricted of any in the city.

###### CENTRAL RAIL HUB AND ORE PROCESSING WORKS (9)

The central rail hub was built once it became apparent that output from Utoland would exceed the original expectations. It is co-located with the main ore processing works, with produce from the mines efficiently unloaded, sorted, processed and made into ingots for shipment offworld. The rail hub and processing works have good fences which are surrounded by a belt of worker housing. There are guard posts and a partial fence facing the Old Town to deter thievery but this does not prevent enterprising Utolanders from sneaking into the hub from time-to- time. Work is underway on improved security but has never been assigned a high priority.

###### ABANDONED ZONE (10)

Work was begun on a new section of worker housing, eventually to become an extension of the New Town. However, shifting priorities resulted in work being postponed over and over, with construction taking place in fits and starts. Some areas are more or less complete whilst others are construction sites or ruins where partially completed buildings have collapsed. A small community of locals have moved into the zone and are more or less ignored by the EPS so long as they do not cause trouble. Groups are occasionally run off by rivals or the security service but for the most part the 'abandoned' part of the city goes about its business without interacting much with outsiders.

###### FRINGE LAND (11)

In between the built-up areas and around the city is a zone of fringe land. In some areas there are clusters of ramshackle buildings or the remains of them, whereas in others the land is too dry to be useful. Elsewhere, enterprising locals have claimed areas which they cultivate as best they can. In some cases these claims could be considered to be small farms but the majority are just patches of land mainly used to farm vegetables.

Some sections are heavily overgrown with scrubby vegetation, which can conceal abandoned or partly- collapsed buildings, and in a few cases liveable spaces. Clear paths and trails run through parts of the fringe land but there are other ways of crossing the internal fringes to enter a different part of the city. Further out, the fringe land contains a few small hamlets which trade foodstuffs with the city population.

###### ARTIFICIAL LAKE (12)

Utoland rests atop a natural aquifer which provides water to the city through a basic pumping and storage system located at the eastern end of the Old Town. Control of this facility is occasionally disputed by criminal groups but it became less important when the new water processing plant was built outside of town. This is located at the bottom of an artificial lake, with towers protruding up through the surface. The plant is fully automated, drawing water up from the aquifer to maintain a constant level in the lake. Some of this water is drawn off through surface canals to support local farming initiatives and underground pipes run to distribution hubs in each area of the city.

###### FARMS (13)

Most of Utoland's food production comes from outlying communities which are left alone most of the time so long as they meet their contracted quotas. However, since the creation of the artificial lake it has become viable to construct large farms on its flanks. These are run as subsidiaries of the mining corporations and have security teams on call as well as armed workers. Produce is normally driven in offroad trucks into the marshalling area before being distributed inside the city.

Located 100 kilometres south of Utane, MC4 is a purpose-built facility serving as a processing hub for ore mined in the local region. The facility as a whole is walled, with regular security patrols and cameras
'for the safety and security of the workforce'. The city's heavy-gauge rail hub serves five outlying mining areas. Living conditions are a bit better than in Utoland for the most part but the overall impression is of utilitarianism. Everything about MC4 is drab.

Clothing is mostly hard-wearing coveralls, with workers tending to carefully look after what they arrived with as replacements are expensive. An occasion for changing into something other than workwear had better turn out to be worth it and even basic non-workwear is considered a status symbol. Diet is equally dreary, consisting mainly of rice-flour noodle dishes with local vegetables. Meat and other animal products are virtually unavailable to the general workforce, although anyone with the money to spare seems to be able to get whatever they really want.

There are plenty of open-use terminals but they are restricted in what they will play and what information can be provided. Personal electronics tend to be treasured for a while then traded for necessary items. Indeed, this seems to be a pattern to life at MC4; people arrive with a few possessions and gradually trade them for necessities. Everything ends up in the hands of those higher up the metaphorical food chain, to be traded up or down as needed.

Most workers become inured to this state of affairs, alleviating their boredom and misery by trading for luxuries they cannot afford. There are pressure release valves in the form of bonuses and education programmes that offer a way to climb the food chain. Backstabbing and currying favour can also work. What happens for most people who come to Utoland is that their world-view shrinks to the point where a small privilege is all they can aspire to. Those who retain big dreams like buying themselves out of their contract and getting offworld face a number of challenges.

Chief among these is the local financial system. Salaries are actually quite high by most standards and there are bonuses for high production. However, salaries are paid into the worker's account with the mining corporation, which holds a proportion in a high- interest savings scheme for when the worker leaves. On paper this looks generous but it makes a portion of the worker's salary unavailable. The remainder is quickly used up in deductions that were underplayed in the original contract and job offer ‚Äì accommodation, equipment and food all have to be paid for. Whatever is left can only be withdrawn in small amounts, 'to prevent reckless overspending common among the workforce'.

Most transactions are undertaken in cash, using company scrip which change in value relative to the Imperial Credit or the scrip of other companies according to circumstances never explained to scrip users. In short, the system is designed to ensure workers find it hard to leave once they have joined the workforce. They may not actually owe their souls to the company store but it can feel like it at times.

## COMPANIES IN MC4

MC4 itself is owned and operated by the Ursherer Mining Consortium, or UMC. The largest business group on Utoland, UMC more or less controls the Economic Protection Service planetwide and operates most large-scale facilities such as rail hubs and processing works. All other companies pay a percentage to use its facilities but most find this cheaper and all consider it less risky than attempting to build their own. Almost all administrators in MC4 are employees of UMC, except those working in the offices of smaller mining concerns. Most businesses are private but subject to licensing from the installation owner.

# MINING COMPLEX FOUR (MC4)

### ATRAN EXTRACTION Atran Extraction (AE) specialises in surface mining. It operates both a large open-cast mine south of the complex and several mobile surface extraction units. Atran is one of the better employees on Utoland, in the sense that it has less restrictions on withdrawals of scrip and personnel movement. One of the standard ways out of Utoland's worker-trap is to be offered a job with Atran as a stepping stone. Of course, this gives the firm the pick of employees for the time it takes them to obtain a ticket offworld.

###### KHIGUR AND ANDREWS INCORPORATED Khigur and Andrews (K&A) is a general mining and minerals corporation which mostly operates planetside tunnel-mining facilities. It also performs about half the asteroid-mining out of Utoland starport. Personnel from the two branches of the firm rarely interact, although there are a few in MC4 who were demoted from a space job for whatever reason. Others arrived at Utoland thinking they had signed on with an exclusively asteroid-mining company only to find their contracts permitted deployment wherever the firm considered necessary. After waiting months or even years for the promised berth to open, these people are the most disaffected of the entire workforce.

###### ATRAN OPEN-CAST MINE (1)

Operated by Atran Extraction, this is the largest mine on Utoland. The rail terminal and loading complex on the north edge leads to a gouge in the planet's surface over 20 kilometres long and over a kilometre deep at its lowest points. An artificial roadway structure winds down from the transport hub, carrying vehicles, whilst personnel mostly use the elevators built into its supports.

There are other open-cast mines and what they all have in common is abandonment when they are no longer viable. In the case of this project that day is not far off. Most of what has come out is industrial materials such as nickel and copper, and whilst veins of these materials run southward out of the mined area they are beginning to be too deep to justify carving away thousands of tons of rock to get at them. A limited tunnel-mining operation, chasing these veins, may be possible. Experimental shafts are being driven to find out.

###### THE STRIPS (2)

A region of viable metal veins close to the surface surrounds the rail hub built to exploit it, collectively known as the Strips. These are deep gouges clawed by slow-moving extractor machines which tear up the surface layer and dump it on a conveyor belt to be sorted at the rear of the machine.

Some machines are owned by Atran but most are operated directly or on contract to the UMC. Minor operations are also carried out by a number of small single-site mining companies, some of which specialise in extracting small quantities of high-value materials from spoil left behind by other mining methods. The whole Strips region lies under a permanent dust cloud which makes visibility poor even on a windy day.

###### URSHERER DEEP MINE (3)

The Ursherer Deep Mine began as a small high-value extraction site but quickly expanded into a deep shaft with galleries radiating from it. Wild rumours claim something very strange was found at the bottom of the shaft but the reality is likely more mundane. Gem beds have been confirmed, along with deposits of platinum and a viable amount of palladium, all of sufficient value to justify a rail link although volumes are small.

###### URSHERER NORTH RIDGE (4)

The long ridge east of MC4 is due to a tectonic fold which pushed useful minerals close to the surface. In the case of the Ursherer North Ridge facility this is a mix of iron ores and radioactives such as uranium. The UNR facility is subject to enhanced safety and security measures as a result. Most of what comes out it very mildly radioactive iron, which is run through a specialist nuclear damper unit to render it safe. Uranium is shipped in consignments aboard special freight cars and stored carefully until a full load is ready. Although not a particularly benevolent employer, UMC prefers not to have its employees fall ill with radiation sickness.

###### SOUTH RIDGE MINE COMPLEX (5)

The South Ridge Mine Complex is owned and operated by Khigur and Andrews Incorporated. Its primary products are industrial metals which are shipped straight back to MC4 and thence to Utoland. The complex is deep and extensive, with multiple levels of tunnels bored using large drilling machines and smaller shafts in which robotic driller-extractor units perform the actual extraction of ore.

###### NORTH SHAFT (6)

The North Shaft mine is run by K&A and is sometimes known as the 'money pit'. Despite promising surveys, the site has never really justified the effort of sinking the main shaft but tantalising hints of viable deposits have repeatedly drawn in new rounds of exploratory drilling. Some saleable material does come out of the mine but for the most part the North Shaft produces nothing but rocks.

Arden, and therefore its possessions, officially holds a neutral position in the conflict between the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate. However, the reality is that Arden is aligned towards the Consulate. This is not entirely out of choice. The Zhodani are willing to recognise Arden as an interstellar power and guarantee its sovereignty, unlike the Imperium, but it has also made it plain that Arden must cooperate or be crushed. In the longer term The Arden Society will need to find a way to remain independent, but for now they must be seen to comply with the wishes of their mighty patron.

The Zhodani Consulate is at present concerned with large-scale fleet assaults on the Jewell Salient. Securing the Demilitarised Zone is a minor concern, and Utoland even less significant. Nevertheless, gaining and maintaining control of minor worlds between the Consulate and the Imperium is a requirement for a successful strategy. Any territorial gains can be useful at the negotiating table, and the sooner the DMZ is made safe for Zhodani support vessels the easier it will be to push supplies forward to the combat fronts.

The strategy for securing minor worlds like Utoland is simple. A naval force, consisting of light vessels, makes a grand entry to the system and declares it is under Zhodani control. It is followed by a small transport carrying personnel from the Consular Army who set up a secure base and begin 'liaising' with local leaders. Those who go along with the process receive a light presence and little interference in their affairs, at least for the present, whilst those who resist face swift removal by Zhodani reinforcements.

Since Arden is cooperating with the Consulate, its holdings at Utoland fall into the first category. A cruiser of the 40th Fleet with accompanying destroyers arrived without warning, followed by an army transport carrying a small 'administration and liaison' detachment. No resistance was possible, even had it seemed desirable. Emissaries from Arden, arriving with the Zhodani, ordered compliance. This took place just days after the Travellers arrived.

The Consulate is not really interested in Utoland, other than controlling its starport. The naval force moved on within days, to be replaced by intermittent security patrols using light vessels. A company of Consular Army infantry, with a few light transport vehicles, secured the starport and within a couple of days everything returned to normal. Ore freighters kept coming and the situation did not change for workers. Requests for assistance from the Economic Protection Force were simply ignored.

The Zhodani have made occasional forays out of the starport, apparently to gather a first-hand impression of their new possession. They were, as far as can be discerned, unimpressed. There is no strategic imperative to pacifying the rather lawless society of Utane, and the production of Utoland's mines is significant only to Arden. All the Zhodani do is inspect ships using the port, interning any that seem suspicious. Crews seem to be treated well, but are sent to Managerial Enclave Two under the 'protection' of the authorities there and are not allowed access to their ships. This is a temporary measure, at least according to the occupiers.

Interned ships are held at the port, which will eventually run out of room for new arrivals. As a solution, ships may be moved to temporary parking areas away from the city or taken up to a holding orbit. There are presently four suspicious craft at the port.

Lixin Umkiir is a far trader registered out of Arden. She was reflagged in order to get around tariffs imposed by the Federation of Arden; not in and of itself suspicious, but her original port of registry is Regina. As an Imperial ship, Lixin Umkiir is automatically under suspicion.

# THE ZHODANI OCCUPATION OF UTOLAND

Aurora Four is a Type R subsidised merchant registered out of Macene, an Imperial Navy reserve auxiliary, and therefore an enemy vessel. Caught in the DMZ by Zhodani light forces at the outbreak of war, she surrendered to avoid destruction and spent several weeks in a holding orbit around Caloran. Transfer to Utoland is a step up for her crew, who are technically prisoners of war but have simply been interned like other suspect crews.

Lone Trader is a free trader registered out of Lunion. She has wandered far and passed through multiple hands before being detained at Utoland. Her crew are the most difficult of those currently being held at ME2. They seem to have decided if they make enough of as nuisance of themselves the authorities will let them go.

Ship's boat FB-220011 is something of an anomaly. She was sitting on a corner of the landing area when the Zhodani arrived less than two weeks ago. Her paperwork is in order but there is no record of the ship she arrived in-system aboard. Nor is it clear who her owners are. It is possible this vessel was bought by one of the mining companies for use in the asteroid mining sector, but inquiries by the occupation force have produced no answers.

All the authorities know at this time is that this craft must have been brought aboard another ship, but has been standing idle since before the Zhodani arrived. Her arrival coincides with a group of prospective workers passing through the customs and orientation process. Their identities are known but they are currently at Mining Complex Four. A request for investigation has produced a frustratingly slow response, resulting in the Zhodani officer commanding the occupation force demanding that a squad from the EPS go and bring these workers in for questioning ‚Äì or he will send troops.

For all the severity of that threat, this is still a routine manner. The crew and passengers of this craft are contained planetside and are probably just itinerant workers. There are many tasks to be accomplished and investigating these people is of low priority. That may change as the Travellers come to recognise their situation and take measures to get offworld.

Outsiders have the impression that Zhodani Consulate ground forces are built up of neat blocks of 10 soldiers, with 10 of those forming a company-equivalent and 100 to a battalion. This is in part due to the titles of leaders (non-commissioned officers) and officers, which follow a one, two, five progression through multiples of 10. The reality is a little less rigid.

Zhodani ground forces are built around teams of approximately 10 soldiers, led by a Leader of Ten assisted by a Leader of Five. Any given Ten will be equipped and designated for its main function, with higher formations built by combining Tens. 'Ten' and 'Five' in this case are designations rather than absolute numbers. Operational requirements dictate a Five may have three to seven members and a Ten may actually comprise eight to 15 soldiers. As far as possible, however, organisation does try to follow a neat 'blocks of ten' model.

A Five is equivalent to an Imperial squad or fire team and a Ten might be considered equivalent to a section. A Ten set up for infantry operations would contain a mix of weapons suitable for getting its job done, which would possibly mean tackling armour or engaging in aerospace defence. A Ten sent out on a mission would normally be assigned a fully qualified officer as its commander, although sometimes a Waiting Officer who is close to completing their qualification period might be trusted with a task or dispatched for lack of anyone more suitable.

The lowest rank of fully qualified officer is an Officer of Twenty, who would normally command a force built from two Tens. A Twenty might be referred to as a half-platoon in Imperial terms and forms the standard battlefield infantry element. The next rank up, Officer of Fifty, is equivalent to an Imperial senior lieutenant. This level of command equates to an Imperial platoon. Two Officers of Fifty are assigned to command the sub-units of what Imperial observers normally call a company.

# ZHODANI CONSULAR ARMY OCCUPATION COMPANY

Zhodani ground forces companies are thus made up of two platoon-equivalents (or four half-platoon equivalents, depending on viewpoint), plus some additional troops. A rifle battalion would, on paper at least, contain 10 companies, each smaller than the Imperial equivalent but the force overall is arguably more flexible. The standard 'three and one' battle formations used by Zhodani ground forces are typically formed from three units of the formation's main type, a support unit and a headquarters which may have an assortment of troop types. This model works at the company, battalion and higher levels if the correct troop types are available.

Occupation battalions are raised and equipped for their role rather than being converted from lift rifle formations and intended to perform a mix of security operations and defence against a significant military threat. They are often broken down into companies scattered across a planet or even several minor worlds and installations. The company sent to Utoland is typical of the type, in that its companies are capable of operating independently, or being amalgamated as pairs or into a half-battalion alongside the headquarters/support company.

Nominal company strength is 100 personnel, organised as 10 'Tens' which are grouped into two Fifties (platoons) each of which contains two Twenties (half-platoons) with differing specialisms. The company overall is commanded by an Officer of One Hundred, equivalent to an Imperial Army captain. This officer is assisted by two Officers of Fifty, each of whom has two Officers of Twenty below them. An additional Officer of Twenty assists the company commander, along with a variable number of Waiting Officers who carry out duties as required.

The company has defensive and security elements, each with slightly different roles. Normally the defensive element is concerned with securing the unit's base (in this case, the starport) and preparing to repel a significant military attack. It will loan some of its rifle and heavy weapons elements to the security force as needed but these are normally set up in prepared positions. The security element is available to carry out patrols or react to unexpected events, although at present this is limited to the Startown under most circumstances. The headquarters and security element each have a handful of light grav vehicles and augment this with local transport commandeered (or 'borrowed') from the port authorities.

The unit's headquarters element is capable of handling its own administration and minor support, such as medical and cooking requirements. However, long-term it would require additional support unless local facilities can be co-opted. This has been accomplished by taking over a small part of the starport. The unit is securely established but lacks mobility. This is not much of a problem given its mission is primarily to monitor the starport and ensure it is not used by hostiles.

###### SECURITY OPERATIONS

The Zhodani forces encountered on Utoland and elsewhere are on a wartime footing. They are trained to be respectful of civilian populations but will not tolerate resistance. Nor are they a police force. Occupation units operating in the DMZ, will co-opt local law enforcement to keep order. If they fail or are unwilling, the Zhodani will take heavy-handed measures. It is notable that whilst Imperial troops on peacekeeping duties might be issued batons and told to use less-lethal measures if possible, the Zhodani approach is more stratified.

The Zhodani approach to occupation is more black and white than most. That is, occupation troops are more polite and civil than might be expected, at least until their instructions are not followed. Response will then escalate rapidly and become lethal much earlier than would be the case under most professional forces. The reason for this is embedded in the Zhodani social psyche.

Civilians in an occupied area are treated with courtesy and respect so long as they do not interfere or otherwise cause problems. A surly, resentful population is only to be expected and the occupation force is expecting sullen compliance at best. A population that is obviously unhappy and undertakes the occasional demonstration is acting according to its nature; the onus is on the Consulate to educate these people about how well-off they are ‚Äì or are about to become ‚Äì and until that is done the Consulate cannot blame dissenters.

However, the Consulate cannot and will not tolerate interference in its mission. It is unequivocal and unwavering in its rules and their application. Anyone who breaks these rules is dealt with. There are no grey areas; either an action or an individual is of interest to the occupation force or it is not. Full integration, and a move to Consulate-type policing, will come in time. For now the only important consideration is securing the objective. Thus the occupation force is on a military footing. Dissenters are only to be expected and of no consequence unless they pose a real threat. At that point their nominal civilian status becomes irrelevant; a threat is a threat is a threat.

Zhodani troops engaged in security work are equipped for combat, deliberately putting them in a position where the only place they can escalate to is lethal. This is a broad hint to the local populace and those that take it will be unharmed. If possible, the first response to a developing situation is a politely phrased request to desist, disperse or surrender. Those who do not respond to a request are warned. Warnings are accompanied by raised weapons, with a clear lethal threat. In some cases a warning shot may be fired or a concussion grenade detonated.

Those who disperse will usually be allowed to go, although anyone identified as a known troublemaker or suspected insurgent is likely to be pursued at the time or tracked for pickup later. If the warning is not heeded, Zhodani troops will demand immediate surrender and open fire on anyone who does not comply. There is nothing wrong with shooting unarmed civilians if they pose a threat due to their numbers, according to the Zhodani mindset. Anyone attacking occupation troops is an enemy combatant. Troops will drive off or capture low-end threats if possible but will shoot if they have to. Once a warning has been given, the consequences are upon those who choose to face the inevitable.

Troops on security duty wear combat armour whose information systems are keyed into the local database. They compare faces and biometrics of anyone they see to what is known about them. Someone who has made a sufficient nuisance of themselves or carried out an action meriting detention will be seized by a patrol or guard unit upon sight. This usually takes the form of a demand for surrender backed by lethal weapons. If they run, they will be fired upon, even if they are only wanted for questioning because they shouted too many anti- Zhodani slogans over the past few days.

Detainees are usually taken to a holding area for questioning and may well be released without further action. The occupation force is not interested in minor crime at this point, only in retaining control of important facilities. Questioning anyone detained, even for minor reasons, is a routine part of intelligence gathering. It is not uncommon for an entire crowd to be detained at gunpoint, held for a few hours then politely questioned before release. Prisoners are not mistreated, although violence against their captors is dealt with rather firmly.

An occupation force will not have the facilities to detain large numbers of people. They will set up a temporary holding and questioning facility but detainees are only held long enough to accomplish this. Those clearly a threat to the occupation cannot be freed but the occupation force is not interested in minor dissent.

If local law enforcement is cooperating with the occupation force, miscreants might be transferred to their control. An alternative solution is to inform a local official that they are now responsible for the prisoners and to let them get on with it. Only those posing a real threat are kept by the occupation force, usually in an improvised or co-opted holding facility. Often these people demand fair trials, not understanding that ‚Äì according to the occupiers ‚Äì they are being treated fairly. An occupation is in place and anyone challenging it is guilty of that much at least. This clash of mindsets can cause additional friction but all the occupation force has to do is keep the lid on the situation long enough for a hand over.

Anyone detained for any reason will be placed on a watch database and those who turn out to pose a threat will be dealt with. This can mean a raid to capture them but quite often all the occupying force will do is put out a request for the person to surrender. If they do not they will be subject to a detain-on-contact order at the least and in some cases occupation troops will be ordered to shoot on sight. However, even if someone commits an act of violence against the occupation troops it is unlikely they will be sought out ‚Äì protection of the port and associated areas is the mission, not bringing individuals to justice.

The occupation force is on a war footing. Troops deploy in combat armour, going unarmed and unarmoured only inside secured areas.

## OFFICER OF ONE HUNDRED DLIKLPIDL ONTDIDKRETE

Like many Zhodani forced to operate outside the Consulate, Officer of One Hundred Dliklpidl Ontdidkrete uses an Anglicisied version of his title and name, going by 'Captain Onkrete' in his interactions with Utoland locals. He is a member of the Intendant caste who has received appropriate psionic training and can aspire to reach the rank of Officer of One Thousand (the Zhodani equivalent of colonel) by the end of his career. Intendants do not become general officers but Captain Onkrete knows that serving well will earn him respect and personal satisfaction.

Assignment as a garrison commander and governor of an insignificant world is an appropriate task for an officer of his talents and record to date, and Onkrete intends to carry out the mission with honour and dutifulness. Whilst direct combat against Imperials might seem desirable, Onkrete is certain that this is where the Consulate wants and needs him to be. He feels some trepidation and frustration at having to deal with the chaotic society of Utoland but this is his challenge and he accepts it fully.

In fact, Captain Onkrete is a little out of his depth. He is the senior officer on an entire planet and one populated by mental barbarians at that. He is used to an honest society where locks are designed only to prevent containers popping open when roughly handled and where people speak their minds. The officials he is forced to deal with on Utoland sometimes do not seem to know whether or not they intend to keep the promises they make ‚Äì they are not even honest liars!

The captain is not na√Øve or stupid but society outside the Consulate is alien to him. All he can do is follow the guidelines he has been given, refer to his training and make the best decisions he can. His overwhelming imperative is to make sure the starport remains secure, causing him to place objectives like tracking down mysterious workers well down his list of priorities. He is treading carefully, sincerely trying to learn local society, and fulfilling his primary function at least adequately. However, he is intrigued by the mystery of that ship's boat and those it brought to Utoland. Some instinct tells him they may be trouble.

###### ZHODANI TROOPERS

Armed with a laser carbine and concussion grenades, ordinary troopers make the bulk of the force. Vehicle crews and technical personnel such as warbot handlers are identically equipped in the field but will have additional skills, as will small-unit leaders such as Leaders of Five. A handful have laser marksman rifles instead. Heavy weapon operators carry the same carbine but normally crew their heavy weapon, which may be a VRF gauss gun or an anti-armour/ anti-aerospace missile launcher. Warbot handlers also carry the same personal weapon as the infantry, to prevent enemy snipers from distinguishing them. They are trained to avoid danger where possible to ensure warbots remain effective.

##### MEDIUM WARBOT

This design is a popular warbot model, with customised versions in use throughout the Consulate. The warbot is solid and reliable, with good intelligence (as far as Zhodani robots go). The model shown here is a basic configuration but many other variations are available, depending on the operating environment or type of mission the warbot will be called upon to perform, carrying a variety of weapons, equipment and additional armour. Warbots intended for boarding actions often swap the laser rifle for a flamethrower.

Flashpoints begins rather abruptly. The Travellers are all at The Strips, aboard a giant rock-gouging machine. How and why they are there will become apparent but first they must deal with the problems they immediately face. At the moment the adventure starts the Travellers literally do not know who they are, nor where. They have been jarred out of their overlaid personas, although they do not know that. The sensation is rather like waking suddenly from a deep sleep; there is a moment of disorientation followed by recognition and recall. Unfortunately for the Travellers, this moment coincides with a life-threatening situation.

The Referee should decline requests and even demands for detailed explanation. The Travellers need to act now and trust that the situation will become clearer. The Travellers are aboard Militte Gouger, a surface mining machine which is the sole asset of the Militte Mining Cooperative. They are wearing standard worker outfits and carry no weapons. The gouger has just lurched dramatically, shedding a digging wheel, and is beginning to slide sideways into a crevasse which is opening up along its right side.

The Travellers will recall how they got here quickly enough but at this moment they are confused and focused only on what is happening right now. The short version is that after leaving Rock Twelve they needed to hide, especially with Zhodani forces arriving in the system. Militte Gouger was short-handed as usual and was quite happy to hire a party of new workers. Almost any Traveller can find a job here; administrators, technicians and stewards are all needed to keep the gouger running, whilst those without relevant skills can always help with manual tasks such as unclogging the conveyors or sorters, or removing errant rock chunks from the top of the crew compartment. The Travellers joined the crew and got to work and for a short time everything was business as usual.

# A MOMENT OF REVELATION

Militte Gouger was being run in a slipshod manner, with every possible corner cut. Most notably, surveys of the ground ahead were cursory at best. Liberal use of the launcher has allowed the gouger to carve a swathe through the countryside, tearing up a considerable volume of low-value ores interspersed with a little silver which will command a better price. Driven by greed, the gouger has pushed into an area of more solid rock which has not been properly broken up by the penetrator projectiles. Instead a deep crack opened up along a fault line and was not immediately detected.

The immense weight of the gouger forced a slight slip in the cracked rock, which in turn resulted in digging wheel #4, the outermost starboard one, to bite deeper than it should. The gouger was brought to a grinding halt, accompanied by a screeching of metal and an ominous shuddering through its structure. Wheel #4 broke its mountings, sending fragments flying in all directions. By mischance one smashed the front viewports of the main control chamber at the front of the crew level, killing the duty driver and wrecking the controls. The automated stop-everything failsafe... failed.

The remaining gouging wheels have been dragged down and are trying to continue to rotate despite biting too deep into the ground. It is unclear whether they will break their mountings, twist the support framework, or tear themselves free and continue to rotate. The broken wheel has components of its driving mechanism still lashing about. All personnel and cargo elevators have emergency-halted and some (or perhaps all) are jammed due to distortion. Meanwhile a poorly surveyed weak area of ground under the rightside 'foot' is giving way, causing the gouger to tip to starboard. All this takes place in a cacophony of human screams, grinding metal and the booming of rocks falling onto the crew compartment.

###### DISORIENTATION

The Travellers will be wherever their job would place them. Mostly this means in the crew level but they may be on the conveyor or the top platform if they are general workers. Technicians could be anywhere, whilst those with a scientific background will likely be in the small sampling laboratory of the processing centre. The Travellers wear standard working dress with minor tools and an emergency filter mask. There are helmets, first aid kits and the like at regular intervals, although their condition may be poor.

As the world suddenly lurches and screams around them, the Travellers are shocked out of their normal, rational personas. In this moment there is no sense of identity or past, just an overwhelming need to do something to survive. All the Travellers know is:

- They felt a jarring impact that rolled on into what feels like an earthquake.
- The deck is tipping.
- People are screaming in fear and pain, others are shouting words that make no sense.
- The noise is tremendous. Squeals of metal combine with the rumbling of runaway machinery and what sounds like metal cables lashing against something hard.
- They are wearing worker-type coveralls and carrying tools.
- They are confused and disorientated, so much so they can do nothing but react.
- The shock they are experiencing means they are functioning at more or less an animal level, recognising things and people as they see them without higher understanding.
- They are in mortal danger and must react immediately.

This instant is like a freeze-frame as each Traveller stumbles across the deck and grabs or crashes into something. They look around and down at themselves, taking in their immediate circumstances. Now they know where they are, sort of. They are aboard Militte Gouger, a surface mining machine. They do not know why they are there, nor who they are. Something is dreadfully wrong inside their minds as well as on the machine. The Referee should place each Traveller according to their job aboard the gouger and they might not be together when the disaster strikes.

###### I KNOW YOU!

When Travellers catch sight of one another they feel familiarity but cannot put a name to the person they see. They will recognise some capabilities, so Travellers will be identified to one another as 'that admin guy', or 'the tall one who does... whatever it is they do'. Names will come later but for now the Travellers know their fates are bound up together. They just do not know why, nor indeed who they are.

The Travellers have an instinctive appraisal of what they know how to do, at least in general terms. They will recognise things they know about as they see them. Someone who has good technical skills will recognise the communications gear or other relevant systems and realise they know how to operate or repair them. If asked questions like 'do you know how to disarm a penetrator charge?' they may be surprised to find they do (assuming they have the Explosives skill), although they as yet cannot say how they know.

###### I WANT ANSWERS!

Travellers who do not accept the immediacy and unusual nature of the situation may insist on being told exactly what is going on and why. In-game this translates to holing up somewhere and desperately trying to remember everything, or perhaps just standing around in a confused fugue state as jumbled memories tumble over one another. Travellers trying to force recall in this manner will be out of action for 2D rounds each time they try. They may come back to consciousness to find a small fire has broken out nearby, or a colleague is shaking them violently and asking if they are hurt. Travellers attempting recall in a situation where they would be injured or killed will not enter a fugue state. Their minds and bodies are functioning in a sort of survival-autopilot mode.

Travellers attempting to make sense of their jumbled memories may make an Average (8+) INT check, with the following DMs:

- At the peak of the crisis, when conditions have not improved much from the start point: DM-6
- Once the gouger wheel has been stopped and the situation is less threatening but still ongoing: DM-4
- When the danger has subsided to a significantly lower level but there is still a crisis going on: DM-2
- Once the Travellers are safe and there is nothing immediately needing to be done: DM +0
- If all the Travellers are within sight and/or sound of one another: DM +2

If the INT check is passed, the Traveller experiences a massive inrush of what seem to be conflicting memories. They recall a meal at the starport on... Utoland... and talking to someone about something... a job. They recall coming aboard the gouger and getting to work in an appropriate capacity. Random snippets of conversation with workmates, the constant rumble of the gougers and the conveyors. Bangs from the ore processing plant and

the crushers... the odd lurch as the driver negotiates a rough patch. Hissing rocket exhaust from the launcher, then distant booms as penetrators break up the ground ahead ‚Äì always accompanied by at least some of the crew cheering and making the same tired old quips. It is as if the Travellers have always been here, on this gouger, since they can recall.

Just for a moment, they get the feeling that something is wrong. Different. In that instant they thought they were someone else, an overwhelming sensation that this was not their life. They can relive memories and explain decisions but there is the feeling that the Traveller is more than this. It was not their fate to be here and there is something they must do. Perhaps someone they must become. The feeling fades almost instantly, replaced by weary resignation to the daily grind of work and too little rest. Yet not entirely. The Traveller has the vague impression there is a place, a device, which does not fit with these memories. The answers are there. They feel a compulsion to find it.

###### GENERAL DISASTER

If the Travellers do not do anything, the gouger and most of the people aboard it are doomed. Safety cutouts on the propulsion system have halted the wheels, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand the gouger is not driving its digger buckets deeper into the ground or pushing itself over but at the same time it is not making stabilising movements. The gouger wheels are still powered and will eventually either drag the vehicle over or twist their supporting structures to the point where they fail ‚Äì bringing huge amounts of debris down to crush the crew compartment. There are also dozens of live penetrator projectiles on the top platform.

The gouger has a crew of around 40 personnel under normal circumstances. Several are already dead or critically injured and others are in desperate danger. The duty drive crew are all down, although there are other people who could direct or control the vehicle. The main problem is a lack of coherent leadership. The general manager is in overall charge but has no experience of life-threatening incidents. His instinct is to try to find someone who can deal with the technical and physical problems, and set teams working to that end. In short, he is trying to methodically put an action plan in place in a situation where decisive action is necessary right now. The chief engineer, second in command of the gouger, is fighting fires in the reactor chambers. This is worthy enough and necessary to overall survival but she has lost sight of the bigger picture.

If this situation is allowed to continue it will go irredeemably out of control and the vehicle will topple over and/or suffer structural collapse. That can be delayed, mitigated or even averted if someone acts decisively. For the moment, the situation can be considered 'peak of the crisis' ‚Äì if it gets any worse there is no chance for most of the crew. The Referee should adjudicate the actions of the Travellers on a 'disaster movie' basis. There are tools and equipment throughout the vehicle, so it is possible the Travellers may be able to grab what they need.

If it is desirable to adjudicate an attempt to grab some useful item or locate a route through a damaged section, the Referee can use the 'finding a solution' table using the Traveller's INT modifier. Skills may also apply; attempts to scrounge items might be based on Streetwise or a relevant skill such as Mechanic, indicating a familiarity with emergency equipment and procedures. A Traveller who can make a case for using a skill should be permitted to do so unless there is some major reason why not. Negative modifiers may apply if circumstances dictate. For example, trying to find medical supplies in a fire-ravaged compartment will be tricky and looking for something that would not plausibly be there is impossible.

###### THE CREW

There are plenty of people who need assistance. The gouger's tiny sick bay cannot accommodate many but there are crew cabins and eating spaces to use. Most of the casualties have been hit by falling debris or struck by objects flung by the gouger wheel. Some have

fallen or been burned. Their injuries vary in severity. The Travellers will have to deal with immediately life- threatening situations but in the longer term they will also have to consider how to get people to safety.

Life-saving might take the form of dragging people out of wrecked compartments or setting up an effective triage system and centralised treatment point, depending on the Travellers' inclinations. They may wind up coordinating a team of rescuers or medics, or smashing their way into a stores area to grab more medical supplies. These are worthy actions, although they do not make the overall situation any better. If the Travellers decide to focus on evacuation they have two basic options ‚Äì up or down.

Up, in this case, means using grav vehicles. There are two, although there is a real danger they might slide off the upper platform if not secured quickly. One is a standard air/raft normally used for surveying, the other a cargo-van type used for light transportation. These vehicles are imported and represent a significant investment on the part of the gouger operators. Vehicles may come from other gougers in the area, in which case some means must be found to get casualties up to the top platform or somewhere a vehicle can come alongside to take them off.

Incidents might include the following:

Rescue Zars: Zars Azikhkfaek, a Vargr worker, is tangled in cables near the gouger wheel and suspended above a long drop. His right leg is completely crushed and he is bleeding badly. Zars is in shock and will die very soon unless rescued; his best prospect is to live long enough that a vibration shakes him out of the cable tangle and he falls to his death. Reaching him requires some dangerous climbing or a grav platform, then he must be disentangled ‚Äì possibly by amputating his leg in situ ‚Äì and brought to an aid station where he can begin life-saving treatment.

###### Finding Solutions Table

|2D+Modifiers| Outcome |Notes|
|0 or less| Disaster |The situation goes badly wrong in a life-threatening manner. Structural collapse, fire or panicking workers create a threat that must be overcome.
|1‚Äì3| Setback |The Traveller cannot find what they need and encounters a setback or complication, such as wounded who need evacuating or a collapsed chamber.|
|4‚Äì6| Failure |The Traveller cannot immediately find what they need but can keep looking.|
|7‚Äì9| Difficult Success| The Traveller finds what they want ‚Äì a route ahead, useful items or hatever ‚Äìbut there is a problem to solve first or some complication; the Traveller finds a route but it is partially blocked by debris, or there is a wounded survivor creating a choice between helping and moving on.|
|10‚Äì12| Minor Success |The Traveller achieves a minor success, such as locating a small amount of equipment or a short section of clear route.|
| 13 or more| Major Success |The Traveller finds what they need without undue complication.|

Rally Workers: Everyone is hurt and scared. There are several workers who are not badly injured but clamouring for medical treatment, evacuation or both. If the Travellers can reassure and redirect them, these people could save others. The most likely solution is a quick examination and whatever treatment is needed whilst downplaying their injuries, then giving them a clear task. That might be to locate and fetch other casualties, scout the vehicle and provide an update on the situation and available resources, or carry out some other specific task. 'Anyone with tech skills head for the reactor chamber and assist the chief engineer' might be one of the most significant phrases said during the crisis.

Collect Information: Just getting a clear picture of the situation would help a lot. This might be personal observation but questioning survivors would also be useful. Travellers might collect a personnel roster and see who is accounted for, inspect the propulsion machinery to see if it can be used, try to locate a driver or someone who knows how to shut off the gouger wheel... there are many possibilities which will assist in dealing with the many problems facing the Travellers.

Pickups and Rescues: The Travellers may be able to organise grav vehicles to pick up crewmembers who are trapped or too injured to reach the upper deck, or they may have to persuade people to wait for pickup in an orderly fashion ‚Äì or take some extreme and dangerous measures in order to reach the ground. However, whilst saving lives is a good thing it will not improve the overall situation.

###### GENERAL MANAGER ROMAN TAHIR

Roman Tahir is a career manager, starting out in logistics for a firm on Arden and working his way up to a well-paid position as the general manager of a mining gouger. He has little in common with the roughnecks who operate the machine, socialising only with a handful of senior technicians and administrators, and the gouger's resident geologist. Like many managerial-level Ardenites, Roman is very class-conscious and expects deference from the workers. He is not popular and has no desire to be.

Management of a crisis is not Roman's forte. He lives in a world of forward planning and 'prepared readiness' and similar corporate buzzwords. Reacting on the fly is not his inclination. He is not a fool or a coward but he wants all the information before he will act. This translates to sending out messages demanding a status report on the intensity of the fire, emergency supply levels, structural failure margins and available qualified personnel. He can be redirected but this requires logic and persuasion rather than obvious common sense. Roman is not receptive to being shouted at by common workers.

Initially, Roman tries to find out everything and make a plan to restore the situation. He will not countenance extreme measures until he is sure the gouger cannot be saved. At that point he cares only about saving lives ‚Äì everyone, of all social classes. This means that he goes from not doing enough because he feels it is not necessary, to focusing on casualty location and evacuation when there is still a chance to salvage the situation.

###### CHIEF ENGINEER AEUENG EGHSAE ('ALIKKA')

Like many Vargr in areas where few people can even attempt to pronounce traditional names, Aeueng Eghsae uses an Anglicised version based ‚Äì in this case very loosely ‚Äì on her actual name. She is known as Alikka throughout the gouger. An actual Alikka is a venomous reptiloid found on several worlds and there are many who wonder if she knew that when she chose her workplace-name.

Alikka learned her trade aboard small starships, not all of which operated within the law. She is on Utoland in the hope of leaving that life behind and is willing to tolerate the conditions here for the time being. Alikka is a skilled engineer, although her qualifications might not bear close scrutiny. When the incident at Militte Gouger is investigated she will come under closer scrutiny than most but has committed no crimes on-planet.

Although she is the best person to coordinate a response to the disaster, Alikka has her hands full in the reactor chamber. Her request for assistance from the general manager did not produce the results she expected. Rather than sending a team, he returned a data query about the precise conditions in the reactor chamber and requested a recommendation for personnel to be assigned there as well as to other danger points. Alikka has no time for such nonsense and a plentiful supply of bad words to say about it.

Alikka will take a practical risk-vs-return approach to the crisis, although she is still thinking like a starship engineer. With vacuum outside, keeping the power on and some compartments liveable is the priority. Here, Alikka could afford to shut down the reactor and take everyone outside. She has lost sight of this for the moment.

	Gouger Reactor

###### REACTOR

The Reactor itself is fine. Its starship-grade installation and shielding will protect it even if the gouger tips over. However, the surrounding machinery is endangered by a serious fire. With the main control chamber gone this equipment is needed to control the gouger and shut down the digging wheels. There is firefighting equipment in lockers nearby, just not enough people to use it. Those available include some who are walking wounded and there are more serious casualties to attend to.

##### ENTRY CORRIDOR (1) It is hot in the entry corridor. The Travellers may encounter personnel trying to evacuate casualties.

##### REACTOR CHAMBER (2) The reactor chamber is also a control room. It is surrounded by thick bulkheads which should withstand even the gouger toppling over, making this the safest place in the vehicle ‚Äì if it were not on fire. The reactor itself is in the centre of the chamber, surrounded by an oval safety rail. Alarms will sound if unauthorised personnel pass the barrier but under the circumstances this is unlikely to attract notice. The reactor is a small starship model, to which has been added a tangle of cables and pipes. The end result is messy and unattractive but whilst this may worry the Travellers, the installation has been competently done. There is nothing wrong with the reactor itself.

There are banks of controls and other elements of the gouger's electronics around the walls of the chamber (3). Those on the opposite side to the entry point are well afire (2a). The automated suppression system has failed due to a ruptured pipe (2b). This creates a ridiculous situation in which large quantities of suppressant foam are being dumped at one end of the chamber whilst the fire is being manually fought at the other. The foam will run out soon.

##### EQUIPMENT STOWAGE (4) Two large walk-in stowage areas contain reactor spares, tools, sections of piping and conduit, and also emergency equipment. Hoses can be run out to spray foam manually but pressure is dropping due to the ruptured pipe. There are also several hand-held extinguishers, heat-resistant coveralls and breathing gear, and mobile shields that can be used to protect personnel as they fight the fire or transit the area.

##### CONTROL CHAMBER (5) The gouger's secondary control chamber has so far withstood the heat. Its door is closed and nothing is on fire inside. However, the door and surrounding bulkheads are hot and beginning to warp. This may cause problems if the Travellers want to use the controls.

##### UNCOMPLETED CHAMBER (6) This chamber was originally intended to house additional systems for the reactor but they were deemed too expensive and unnecessary. Half- completed, it was relegated to a dumping ground for anything that had no place elsewhere. This is where the fire started; a broken cable shorting against the chamber floor. The cable is still live.

##### FIGHTING THE FIRE

The intensity of the fire is modelled using an abstract rating which begins at 100. Each round, the intensity of the fire increases by 1D plus one for every whole 10 points of intensity. So in a round where the fire has escalated to 126, the next round it will be 126 plus 1D+12. Uncontrolled, it will spread further. At intensity 125 the control chamber will also begin to burn, which will destroy the secondary controls in 3D rounds. Intensity 250 will be sufficient to damage fuel and control conduits to the reactor, requiring a shutdown to avoid explosion of its liquid hydrogen fuel.

The automatic firefighting system is dropping a scattering of foam on the flames, imposing DM-2 on the intensity increase roll. If the broken pipe can be repaired this will increase to DM-10 for 2D rounds before the foam runs out. Any person fighting the fire using a hose or hand-held extinguisher may make an Average (8+) Mechanic check and applies any positive Effect as a further DM to reduce the intensity of the fire. The Travellers might come up with some more unusual methods, such as using fire-shields to bulldoze the pile of foam down the chamber and onto the fire. Ingenuity and a good story should be rewarded.

If the fire can be contained or extinguished, the Travellers can enter the control chamber and shut down the gouger wheels. This will improve the overall situation but not eliminate all the problems facing the crew. The gouger can be driven from this location using its remaining external cameras, which would allow the Travellers to reverse it onto more solid ground and perhaps offset the rotation of the gouger wheels somewhat.

###### MOVING PARTS

The gouger's propulsion system has halted it but is not attempting to retire onto more solid ground. It could be driven from the secondary control room but the Travellers may come up with some other solution. The main control room is smashed but the wreckage of the controls can still communicate with the drive system. It might be possible to jury-rig some sort of controls and tie them into the remains of the existing control pathways. A Traveller attempting to drive something as gigantic as the gouger using a gaming controller or their personal comm will suffer a large negative DM to anything but the simplest actions but it can be done. A similar jury-rig could be used to shut off the power to the gouger wheels.

Alternatively, it may be possible to cut the power closer to the wheels. This requires locating a suitable junction point and severing the connection or ‚Äì if the Travellers think of it ‚Äì using local safety cutouts. A more extreme solution to the gouger wheel problem would be to somehow jettison the damaged one or even all four. There is no mechanism for doing so, of course, but penetrator charges could be rigged to cut the support beams and cables, causing the wheels to collapse the structure under their own weight. This is risky; if the whole machine can be dragged about by a misaligned wheel, what four would do is frightening to imagine. A less dramatic solution might be to damage some supports just enough that the automated cutouts are finally triggered. However they do it, if the Travellers can stop the gouger wheels they will assure the survival of everyone left alive on board.

###### PENETRATOR CHARGES

The penetrator charges are stored in a bulkheaded deckhouse which should protect them under most circumstances. They should also have safety pins in place and detonators should be stored separately.  'Should' in this case refers to what sensible people do and regulations require. In fact, storage of explosives aboard Militte Gouger does comply with regulations and the stored charges are probably safe to leave in place. However, corners were cut in the interests of increasing launch rate. There are live charges in the autoloader and more importantly others brought forward ready to be inserted into the autoloader as soon as possible. There are three projectiles, live and ready to launch, on the upper deck. They are contained only by a jury-rigged fence which is likely to give way at any moment.

Each projectile consists of a three metre long, cylindrical bus section which contains the propellant. The payload section carries six smaller rocket-propelled penetrator projectiles, each 80 centimetres long, and a central guidance unit. These are cheap and expendable but good enough to get the bus to its separation point and programme the penetrators with their final trajectory. The whole process is overseen from the launcher control cabin next to the launcher. Penetrators are armed electronically after launch and cannot, in theory, detonate before this. However, a sufficiently high level of energy, such as another explosion or being in the path of an exhaust jet, could activate them.

The penetrators themselves are armoured to allow them to punch deep into the ground before exploding. They use a 'slower' type of explosive than military shells, creating a greater pushing effect which breaks up rock more effectively. Typically the warheads are set for a bracket pattern of six around a particularly tough spot, or two triangles for more common rock. A line or other pattern is also programmable. Accuracy is not great but these penetrators could be used to attack stationary vehicles or enemy positions.

Apart from the danger of someone being crushed, projectiles may ignite their propellant if knocked about enough. This would cause the live rocket to hurtle about the deck, changing direction as it hits solid objects or punching holes in lighter ones. If it gets stuck somewhere, the propellant will cause fires and there is a chance of warhead detonation if the missile gets hot enough. Making the weapons safe would require opening them up and disarming them. Alternatively, they could be pushed over the side ‚Äì the fall is unlikely to cause ignition or detonation, or shoved along the conveyor and dropped in the ore crusher. That will coat the inside of the crusher with flammable fuel but the crusher is very robust. Another alternative is to fire the charges in the launcher and cycle the autoloader, feeding the loose projectile into it until they too can be launched.

###### RESCUE

There will not be a single instant where the crisis is over; more a gradual slide toward destruction or salvation. The Travellers may be able to restore order aboard the gouger to the point where personnel can

stay aboard or they may be on the ground nearby or in a grav craft speeding away from the incident. However the situation comes to an end, the Travellers will witness an assistance effort from other gougers and then from more distant installations. There are not many grav vehicles on Utoland but soon most of them will be clustered around Militte Gouger, trying to land rescue crews or take off survivors.

The Economic Protection Service will arrive in due course and begin an investigation. The Travellers are safe to assume they are not suspected of anything but being Travellers they may decide to avoid questioning anyway. If so, they will become persons of interest. This means security forces are alerted to watch for and detain them for questioning. They will have to tread more carefully if they take this route.

###### MILITTE GOUGER

The Militte Gouger is a gigantic mining machine, more of a mobile building than a vehicle. It runs on three giant independently steerable 'feet', each of which has a pair of tracks running around its base, with the feet forming a triangle. Its turning circle is over 12 kilometres at best. The upperworks consist mainly of four giant gantries, each independently capable of minor traverse and elevation, with a rotating wheel at the front. Rock and soil are gouged up and dumped on a huge conveyor to be shake-sorted along the way. Material that makes it all the way aft goes into a crusher to be deposited in containers which are dropped behind the gouger for pickup by ground vehicles.

The gouger is fitted with a 500mm smoothbore mortar/ launcher, which projects its munitions high into the air out to a range of about 15 kilometres. There, they deploy rocket-propelled penetrator submunitions which plunge deep into the ground before detonating. This loosens soil and cracks rock, making the task of the gouger much easier. There are strict rules about surveying the area ahead and ensuring no personnel are present before firing the launcher, although how closely these are followed depends upon circumstances. On Utoland, enforcement is almost non- existent so the main barrier to indiscriminate use of the launcher is the cost of projectiles.

Devices of this kind are enormously destructive and normally subject to agreements to refill the areas they have devastated after mining is complete. In theory, re- laying the discarded soil and planting some local fauna should be inexpensive and not much of an imposition but many gouger operators prefer to find excuses not to do it. Again, since The Arden Society considers Utoland to be an expendable asset there is little incentive to tidy up afterward. This attitude has led to a general loosening of procedures everywhere, particularly among the independent mining concerns which are often operating on narrow profit margins.

##### PROPULSION LEVEL (1) The propulsion level is a roughly triangular platform resting atop the three tracked feet. It is gimballed to stay level even if the feet are crossing rough ground. The propulsion level also contains the gouger's power plant, an imported starship-grade reactor. It is old and has been poorly maintained since it was bought from a starship scrapping facility. A framework of enormous girders carries personnel and equipment elevators up to the higher levels.

##### CREW LEVEL (2) The crew level is a separate deck containing living spaces for the crew and a small command/ administrative suite from which the gouger is driven and operated. The working crew is surprisingly small for such an immense device, although additional personnel are carried to support mining operations.

##### VERTICAL FRAMEWORK (3) The vertical structure of the gouger supports the great digging arms and permits each to traverse slightly and to be raised or lowered according to terrain. Most personnel take the elevators straight past this level but there are numerous platforms for inspection and maintenance. Clips and cables are spaced at regular intervals to allow workers to secure themselves.

##### UPPER DECK (4) The upper deck is a large platform, fenced at the edges, with a scattering of personnel shelters and equipment pods. It is easily able to accommodate grav vehicles. The mortar/launcher is located at the front edge of the platform, with projectiles stored

immediately behind it. It is normally operated from the command area on the crew level but can be manually targeted from here. The autoloader is 'quirky' and needs unjamming on a frequent basis. This is a very physical task made just a little fraught by the presence of a large quantity of explosives.

##### DIGGING WHEELS (5) The digging wheels are tipped with curved 'teeth' designed both to rip up fragmented rock and carry it back onto the conveyor belt atop the arm. Broken teeth are not uncommon and the machine can operate with a few out of action. One wheel can be stopped for repair or replacement whilst the others work. This is unsafe and banned by regulations but that does not stop it being a routine undertaking here.

##### CONVEYORS (6) Arguably the heart of the machine, the four great conveyors are designed to channel lighter materials away from heavier ones. Crushing wheels are positioned at intervals, ensuring that what reaches the rear of the belt is small enough to process. Personnel gantries run along the sides above troughs into which the lightest materials are diverted. These are sent down spillways towards the outer edge of the machine, falling outboard of the 'feet'. The occasional heavier fragment finds its way off the belt and lands on the roof of the crew level. This usually causes new personnel some anxiety, whilst old hands barely notice it. At the rear of the conveyors the semi-sorted material falls into the processing unit.

##### PROCESSING UNIT (7) Further crushing and sorting takes place in the processing unit, which uses imported plasma furnaces to produce first-stage purified ore. This is formed into billets which are dropped behind the gouger, whilst spoil is dumped to the sides. The composition of a billet can vary considerably depending on what sort of terrain is being crossed. Normally the output is a mix of relatively low-value metal ores but other minerals can be mined. In theory, the gouger could pick up and compact soil for use in a terraforming or agricultural improvement programme, although this is not cost-effective unless someone is willing to pay very high prices.

Once the crisis is over and the Travellers can rest, they can unjumble their memories. They start functioning at a higher level of cognition and can recall each other's names... the names they are currently using anyway. People outside the Travellers' group might ask if they are okay, as they seemed 'a bit out of it', but given what just happened this will not seem out of the ordinary. In fact, it seems like everyone but themselves thinks the Travellers are operating within normal parameters given the circumstances.

The Travellers now know who they are and who their comrades are. They can remember their whole lives and recount many interesting anecdotes about things that happened to them. They are also aware of an odd compulsion to seek out a place where there are answers to their questions and to do something with that data core they have. The Travellers also have a compulsion not to talk about that with anyone but their group. At present they do not know why but there is something wrong with their lives. They were not meant to be underpaid corporate wage-slaves on a backwater world. Deep down they know their present existence is a lie but they keep forgetting that.

Each Traveller must choose an origin story before continuing. This is their cover persona. One fact they all have in common is that they arrived on Utoland to take jobs in the local mining industry or its supporting sectors. Their cover must be something they can do without attracting suspicion by being totally incompetent. For example, someone with the Admin skill could get a job in stores or administration; someone who has Explosives might be a demolitions expert. Those without relevant skills will have to pose as manual labourers or unskilled support staff. Note that the Travellers' cover persona cannot be anything to do with starships and spacecraft, other than from skills like Mechanic and Vacc Suit which could have been obtained elsewhere. No-one must suspect they can operate a spacecraft.

Cover personas can be built from the following elements or created by the Traveller. A good cover does not suggest affiliation with any major political entity. Thus 'I served a term in my planetary defence force' is fine, 'I was in the Imperial Army' is more risky. A Traveller could create a story about disaffection or dishonourable discharge that will avert suspicion but it is a general rule that attention is best avoided altogether. The Travellers are thus well advised to create 'grey person' covers that fade into the background among the many others working on Utoland.

The Travellers will have to fill in the details and personalise their stories and the more mundane it is the better. They do not at this time know why they are using this cover identity, only that they have very authentic- seeming documentation for it. They should have the general impression they are hiding out on Utoland but not what they are hiding from or how much trouble they are in. That will become apparent later.

One of the Travellers has a data core in their possession. It is nondescript; it could have come from a starship or an office. Connecting it to any computer results only in an access prompt. None of the Travellers have any idea what the access requirements are, nor where they got the core, but they know it is important somehow. Other possessions are mundane:

- Each Traveller has some civilian clothes of a sort likely to be owned by a skilled worker, with no insignia or any clues to the Traveller's real background.
- Each Traveller has a basic personal comm of a sort that can be bought anywhere.
- Each Traveller has Cr10x3D in cash lying around and Cr100x3D in their company-run 'bank' account. Cash takes the form of local mining-company scrip.
- Each Traveller also has workwear and basic tools for their current occupation.

It may strike the Travellers that there is little personalisation in these possessions. It is plausible that migrant workers would not carry keepsakes and trinkets around with them but the lack of anything linking a Traveller to any sort of past is a little strange. By now they should be aware there is something buried in their minds, which they cannot access at this time. The data core is the key to unlocking that information.

# TOTAL RECALL... ISH

###### RECALLING THEIR ARRIVAL

The Travellers recall their arrival on Utoland perfectly well. They landed in a ship's boat at the port. They find their memories rather vague on the origins of this boat, however. If asked, they will find themselves saying it was 'dropped off from a passing freighter' and that they do not know who the owner or the crew were. Even as they say this they will realise it is a bit implausible but it is what they remember. They passed through customs and started looking for work. The owners of the Militte Gouger were hiring, so they rushed into signing contracts which turned out to be less generous than they seemed.

The Travellers may wonder at the discrepancies in their own stories. They can explain why their cover identities came to Utoland but they have a sense that there is something wrong with the situation, as if they are not really people who would seek work in a mining colony. The Travellers may wonder if their memories have been tampered with, perhaps by Zhodani telepaths. They also have fleeting thoughts about where they can get answers. Somewhere in this system is the ship they arrived on and they can reach it using their ship's boat. However, that means somehow getting inside the secured starport and it will be pointless ‚Äì they are sure of this but do not know why ‚Äì if they do not first get access to the data core.

**Background Story Elements**

|Keywords| Notes|
|Drifter| The Traveller is a typical 'spaceways bum' who drifts from one crummy job to another with no real plan.|
|Unfortunate| The Traveller was drawn to Utoland by the promise of big salaries and fast promotion, and got stuck here unable to afford to leave.|
|Seeker| The Traveller came to a career turning point, such as being fired during downsizing of a corporation, and never really found a new prospect. They still have aspirations, just no opportunities.|
|Failed Traveller| The Traveller left a career, such as mustering out of a local defence force, and set out to travel and see the universe. Then the money ran out....|
|Runner| The Traveller came to Utoland to get away from something. A relationship, a criminal case, a responsibility... they may or may not be willing to say what it was. They are not actively hiding, just trying to leave something behind.|
|Abandoned| The Traveller was part of a work group of small subcontracting company that unexpectedly went bust or pulled out of Utoland, leaving them stranded here until they can afford passage somewhere better.|
|Hiding| The Traveller is hiding out on Utoland and will probably just refuse to answer questions or give evasive answers. This will not seem out of place; there are many on Utoland doing the same, mostly hiding from things like debts and other personal concerns.|

Once the immediate disaster is dealt with, representatives of the authorities start to arrive. There will have to be an investigation, of course, but the immediate concern is ensuring the safety of those aboard... or so they say. The authorities on Utoland are not especially concerned about worker welfare but neither are they completely uncaring. Starting with the most seriously hurt, groups of workers are evacuated from the site and taken by air/raft to Mining Complex Four.

It will be difficult to avoid this, as there are few places to go and excuses are not being accepted. Indeed, it would look highly suspicious for someone to want to slip away after a disaster like this one. If the Travellers want to completely avoid notice they will have to sneak away without anyone noticing they or any vehicle they use has gone missing. Even then, their absence will be noted and internal camera footage shows they survived at least part of the disaster. Witnesses will have seen them. They will become persons of interest at this point, which may impede their later activities.

Nobody will find it suspicious if the Travellers are reluctant to be relocated or try to talk their way out of it; everyone is shocked and not necessarily thinking straight. A direct refusal to go to MC4 produces one attempt at persuasion, to the effect that there has to be an investigation and everyone will be questioned. Anyone refusing looks guilty and given the world has just been occupied by the Zhodani, they are taking an interest. The Travellers have a choice between going willingly to MC4 or being arrested and taken there anyway. Resistance will likely bring a squad of armoured Zhodani troopers ‚Äì and nobody wants that.

This is exactly what will happen if the Travellers refuse to go or decide to fight. Something this big in the early days of the occupation will attract the attention of the Zhodani force, who will send troops to capture and interrogate any holdouts. They follow standard procedure ‚Äì ask politely, demand cooperation, then arrest under threat of lethal force. If the Travellers go down this route all future actions will have to be covert, as the Zhodani will be actively looking for them.

## THE INQUIRY

Unless the Travellers do something stupid they are not in any danger. They will be escorted to MC4 ‚Äì probably as rescuees rather than suspects ‚Äì and given accommodation. They are told they will be questioned in due course then allowed to do as they please in the meantime, providing they have not caused too much trouble. By the time the Travellers are due for questioning the authorities will have viewed the surviving camera footage. It will show them going about their business aboard the gouger before the disaster, with no hint of any wrongdoing. They are obviously surprised by what happened and their actions afterwards are likely to be beyond reproach. Smart Travellers will realise there cannot be any evidence against them, although they may be paranoid enough to worry anyhow.

The Travellers are eventually called for questioning. They are interviewed one at a time, by a tired-looking EPS investigator, with a dark-skinned woman present but saying nothing. She dresses in an obviously Zhodani style and anyone who knows about their society would realise she is an Intendant. The Travellers all realise this, although they may find that puzzling if their backstory does not involve an interest in Zhodani society. The observer stands at the rear of the room with an inscrutable expression. The Travellers will not know if they are being telepathically scanned unless they are psions themselves. In fact they are not; the Intendant is a visual bluff on the part of the occupation force; ironic, perhaps, as it would help their case if they were being scanned, since they have done nothing wrong.

Although the Travellers are interviewed one at a time, their responses can be adjudicated together and they can take turns answering the questions. This begins with routine matters like their names and what they were employed to do on the gouger. The interviewer then runs through a set of questions it is clear he has asked a few times already.

# UNDER INVESTIGATION

- Where were you when the incident began?
- What were you doing?
- Is that one of your usual tasks or activities?
- Were you aware beforehand that something was wrong?
- Did you cause this incident or contribute to it occurring?
- What was the first sign you had that something was wrong?
- What did you immediately do?
- Was suitable leadership provided?
- How well did the crew handle the situation?
- Did anyone stand out as unexpectedly poor in dealing with the situation?
- Did anyone seem to do particularly well?
- Were the penetrator charges stowed properly?
- Was sufficient emergency equipment provided?
- What was your most significant contribution to handling the situation?
- With hindsight, what would you have done differently?
- What should the people in charge have done differently?

The investigator has seen footage of what happened and the Zhodani operative, whilst not a telepath, is skilled in human psychology. If the Travellers tell the truth, or their answers fit within reasonable variance from it given the extremely pressurised situation, their statements will only reinforce the impression they were just victims of a disaster. Indeed, the greatest danger the Travellers face here is giving negative answers about the general manager or the gouger's operators. They may be asked to repeat or rephrase such answers until they are likely to please the investigator's superiors.

The Travellers may be able to figure out that the investigation is corrupt and that there is no real suspicion of foul play. The authorities simply want to have something to put in the report; ideally something that exonerates the company and its manager. If the Travellers say something carefully neutral about his actions or even praise him, they will be viewed favourably by the gouger's owners and their cronies in The Arden Society. Criticising the company is viewed as hostility and will affect the Travellers' treatment on Utoland. They will have no trouble getting other jobs, since there are plenty that need doing, but they will not be able to find good posts or seek promotion. However, pandering to the investigator's agenda brings additional problems.

Each Traveller should make an Average (8+) Persuade check during the interview. If the actions they describe match what they actually did, more or less, DM+4 applies. Slight variance but an overall truthful story grants DM+2 and even if there are obvious discrepancies this will not impose a negative DM as the investigator knows memory plays tricks under extreme pressure. Only if the Travellers blatantly lie about what happened and are contradicted by other witness statements will a negative DM apply. This can range from -1 to -4 depending on how outrageous their lies are.

A successful check means the Travellers are not, officially at least, under suspicion. However, if they spoke negatively about the company or its manager they will be regarded as troublemakers. If, on the other hand, they bent or ignored the truth to tell the company what it wanted to hear, they will arouse the suspicions of the Zhodani observer.

###### INVESTIGATION OUTCOMES

The most likely outcome is a conclusion that the Travellers were caught up in a situation not of their making and they did their best to survive it. This is a neutral outcome, which leaves the Travellers out of work at Mining Complex Four. There are jobs to be had but they are low-income even by Utoland's standards. If the Travellers were ordinary people their best option would be to seek employment on one of the other mining projects, perhaps requiring them to split up.

If the Travellers performed well (which in this case is defined as 'in the interests of the gouger's owners') they will be thanked and assured they have earned some goodwill. With the company's sole asset out of action this means little in the immediate sense but the Travellers may be viewed favourably when approaching other mining concerns for work. This translates to DM+2 on interactions with officials. However, what they say in the investigation may produce other results.

###### PERSONA NON GRATA

Travellers who spoke negatively about the manager or the company's provision for emergencies will annoy the local authorities ‚Äì although the Zhodani occupiers do not care so long as these statements appear to be more or less true. In this situation the Travellers are not persons of interest, and may be completely exonerated, but the company now has it in for them. DM-2 applies whenever the Travellers want something from the Utoland authorities and they will face routine hassles.

For example, trying to buy a rail ticket or get a permit to a loosely restricted area is not normally a problem but persona non grata status means the Traveller will be harassed by the EPS or face additional questions when trying to perform any bureaucratic task.

###### PERSONS OF INTEREST

The Travellers can become persons of interest to the occupiers and security services in a variety of ways. If they stray too far from the truth during the investigation into the incident on the Militte Gouger, the Zhodani observer will note that they are liars and be intrigued as to why someone who was clearly not to blame for what happened would lie about it anyway. If the Travellers lied to protect the company or the manager, the Zhodani will note them as dishonest and likely to be detrimental to the well-being of society. After all, helping someone or an organisation get away with failing in their responsibilities is a betrayal of everyone else.

Once the Travellers have become persons of interest they will remain so. Local law enforcement will be requested to stop and question them from time-to- time ‚Äì although whether they actually do it depends on current circumstances ‚Äì and any encounter with Zhodani personnel will result in at least a brief detention to answer the same tired old questions. There are no major repercussions for this but it does mean the Travellers will be investigated every time they appear on someone's heads-up display, even if they are just passing by. Person of interest status is not a problem in and of itself but it does make everything else just that little bit harder.

If the Travellers are stopped and questioned, they will be searched for illegal weapons and other contraband. EPS personnel will uphold local laws and restrictions, whilst Zhodani troops follow their own rules. Whatever permits or permissions they may have, no-one will be allowed to bring weapons into a secure area. Outside the port, the Zhodani really do not care about weaponry unless it can penetrate their combat armour. The Travellers might be surprised to be handed back their guns, if they have any, but this will happen unless the Zhodani suspect them of being hostile. In that case, no local law matters.

Questioning during a stop is routine. The Travellers are requested (and then ordered) to state their names and explain what they are doing. If they seem plausible and not deemed harmful, they will be released. Lies are grounds for detention and deeper questioning if the Zhodani think there is something sinister going on but

they are more concerned with the likelihood of attacks than suspicion of criminality. Indeed, 'we have stolen some electronics and tools, and are on our way to sell them' may actually get them dismissed rather than detained. The occupation force does not care about local criminality, although it might pass offenders to the EPS. Of course, someone who admits to crime under the occupation will face corrective action once Utoland is integrated into the Consulate but that is a problem for someone else on a different day.

Each time the Travellers are stopped they must make an Average (8+) Persuade check, with a positive DM if the Traveller roleplays a good response. For all their training in dealing with deceitful Imperials, the Zhodani troops are not good at detecting lies, so DM+4 applies to attempts to deceive them. Officers are more savvy, receiving DM+2 and local personnel are no more gullible than anyone else. A successful check means the Traveller does not arouse further suspicion.

###### UNDER SUSPICION

Travellers can come under suspicion in a variety of ways. It might be the result of this investigation, or due to some action they take later on. If the Travellers are caught doing something that might pose a hazard to the occupation they will be considered suspect. For example, whilst stealing from other Utolanders is not of interest to the occupiers, rabble-rousing against the mining companies is. This is the litmus test for whether the Zhodani become interested ‚Äì are the Travellers rocking the boat enough to merit intervention? Carrying an illegal weapon in the Old Town is not of interest, through pointing it at a Zhodani patrol would be. Being caught with the same weapon close to the starport is grounds for suspicion.

Alternatively, each time the Travellers evade suspicion with a plausible excuse for their actions, any discrepancies will be noted. Enough interactions with the security force will eventually add up to a need for questioning. The most likely response is for the Zhodani to request the EPS arrest the Travellers and for the EPS to make a half-hearted attempt to do so. The Level of Suspicion table indicates the likely response. Each time a Traveller becomes a suspect, roll 2D with the current level of suspicion, which starts at +0, as a DM. The table will indicate what happens next. Note that the level of suspicion can actually go down, perhaps because the authorities conduct a quick investigation and decide the Travellers are merely a nuisance, or the person reporting them has been wrong several times. Escalation is more likely, however.

Once they are under suspicion, the Travellers will face deeper questioning sooner or later and this time a telepath will be available. Their cover personae will withstand probing, so only their answers to questions are relevant. The Travellers will be closely questioned then detained for a time in an improvised holding area. During this time, they will be observed to see if they say anything useful and if their behaviour matches their explanation for their actions.

The likely outcome of questioning by the Zhodani is for the Travellers to be handed over to the EPS, who are expected to bring charges accordingly. So long as the Travellers cease to be a problem, the Zhodani are content. If the Travellers are obviously a serious threat to the occupation they will be held by the Zhodani themselves but for the most part the assumption is that they are just local miscreants best left to the locals to deal with.

The Referee can impose additional DMs for relevant factors. If the Travellers roleplay their answers to interrogation well, or have arranged a plausible alibi or innocent explanation for their actions, a negative DM may be imposed. It is possible that the authorities may discount the Travellers as a threat, having questioned them several times and found nothing to worry about.

###### IN THE SLAMMER

Travellers who end up imprisoned by the EPS will be held in cells at their barracks until they can be dealt with. They will be put on trial for whatever crimes they are accused of, which may mean the EPS has to decide what they are to be charged with. If the Zhodani just want the Travellers out of the way, they may take any report about proceedings at face value. There will be serious repercussions if the EPS is found to be releasing suspects handed over to it, however, so any proceedings will be heavily politicised.

##### Level of Suspicion Table

|2D+DMs| Level of Suspicion| Response|
|0 or less| Cleared |None. Investigation suggests there has been a mistake or the Travellers are not worth a response. They may actually be innocent.|
|1‚Äì2| Mild Interest |Zhodani troops sighting the Travellers will detain and question them. Level of suspicion is reduced by the Effect of an Average (8+) Persuade check. |
| 3‚Äì4| Interest |Zhodani troops sighting the Travellers will detain and question them. EPS is requested to detain and question the Travellers if they are encountered and may or may not comply. If questioned, level of suspicion is reduced by the Effect of a Difficult (10+) Persuade check. Level of suspicion increases by +1 if the check is failed.|
|5‚Äì6| Strong Interest| Zhodani troops sighting the Travellers will detain and question them. EPS is requested to detain and question the Travellers if they are encountered and will comply. If questioned, level of suspicion is reduced by the Effect of a Very Difficult (12+) Persuade check. Level of suspicion increases by +D3 if the check is failed.|
|7‚Äì8| Minor Suspicion |Zhodani and EPS personnel will arrest the Travellers on sight, taking them to a holding area for questioning.|
|9‚Äì10| Major Suspicion |Zhodani and EPS personnel will arrest the Travellers on sight, bringing them to a holding area for questioning. EPS personnel are requested to find and arrest the Travellers but will make little effort. |
|11‚Äì12| Wanted |Zhodani and EPS personnel will arrest the Travellers on sight, bringing them to a holding area for questioning. EPS personnel are requested to find and arrest the Travellers and will probably comply.|
|13‚Äì14| Most Wanted| A Zhodani force will be sent to find and arrest the Travellers, with or without EPS assistance. EPS forces are expected to located and arrest the Travellers, and will face censure if they make little effort.|
|15 or more| Shoot on Sight| Zhodani troops will open fire upon identifying the Travellers. EPS forces are under orders to do the same but are more likely to attempt an arrest or inform the Zhodani and 'wait for backup'. |

In short, detention by the EPS is totally corrupt. The EPS serves the interests of the mining companies exploiting Utoland and at present those interests are best served by giving the Zhodani what they want. The likely upshot of this is for the Travellers to be presented with a long list of charges and encouraged to make a plea bargain. Sentences will usually take the form of indenture, sending the Travellers back to MC4 or another mining complex to work off their alleged crimes. So long as they cause no further trouble, the Zhodani will not be very interested in them after this. If the Travellers choose to fight the case they face stiffer penalties and will have to remain in their cramped cells until the EPS gets around to setting up a trial. This will be adjudicated by a senior EPS official with little semblance of due process and likely produce the same result as a plea bargain, only with longer indenture.

If the Travellers have caused real problems for the occupation force, they will not be handed over to the locals. Instead, they will be detained, probably without trial, until the occupation becomes integration. After a few days in improvised cells at the Zhodani force's base, the Travellers will be transferred to a newly-built detention centre just outside Managerial Enclave Two. The centre has been thrown together quickly and the only well-built thing about it is its fence. It is guarded by personnel recruited from the local population, who are resentful of offworlders and willing to take Zhodani money to ensure they do not escape. They are unlikely to be diligent; escapees might not be noticed for days and even then the guards may decide it is not in their interests to inform anyone. In time, interned starship crews and other detainees will be moved to the detention centre, a significant downturn in their living standards. These personnel may facilitate an escape if the Travellers cannot come up with a way to do it themselves.

Assuming the Travellers do not get themselves thrown in the brig during the investigation, they will find themselves in Mining Complex Four at a loose end. A rather underwhelming welfare clause in their contracts provides lodging for a week and medical attention if necessary, after which they are on their own. The Travellers' possessions are returned to them, having been taken from their old accommodation, searched, then neatly packaged for transit. The Travellers will not be under any official travel restrictions.

If the Travellers talk through the gouger incident and compare notes, they will be reasonably sure it was nothing more or less than a disaster resulting from corner-cutting to reduce costs. They will be aware of vague rumours about a lack of concern for people when profits are to be made but if they want to learn more the Travellers will need to go seeking specific information. Data terminals are restricted in what they provide and what information can be obtained is obviously sanitised by the mining companies.

The Travellers are still feeling a compulsion to find 'that place' and get some answers. They are sure the data core they possess is necessary somehow but have no way to decode or break into it. Of course, they could just shrug and accept their new lives as wage-slaves to the Ardenite elite. If they do not find that acceptable they will need to start investigating. They have two main problems, both related. The Travellers need to get offworld and to do so they need to find someone who can get them access to the data core they possess.

## WORK AND LIFE IN MC4

There is a lot of uncertainty on Utoland at present. The Zhodani occupation has not caused major changes but many people fear it might. There are already tensions among the workforce and frightened people can get violent. The Travellers will witness the occasional confrontation or shouting match that has more to do with frustration and fear about the future than any immediate cause. This might escalate into fistfights or damage to property.

MC4 has not been locked down as such but travel to and from the capital is now subject to a permit system. Permits are obtainable from the complex administration but anyone wanting one needs to answer a great many questions which supposedly demonstrate a need to travel but mostly serve to put applicants off or give the administration a reason to refuse. A fee of Cr100 is payable upon application and not refundable. Naturally, some complex administration staff are using this as a scam to make money. The Zhodani occupation force has not implemented this system; it was the Ardenites who run Utoland. The occupation is just another excuse to restrict the workforce.

As a result of the uncertain times, decisions about hiring or starting new projects tend to be deferred if at all possible. Anyone the Travellers approach for work is willing to talk but will be vague about opportunities and time frames. 'Might have something for you in a week or two' is the most likely answer. The exception to this are jobs that need doing right away or very frequently. For example, everyone needs to eat so if there is a shortage of food-preparation or service personnel then someone will be hired immediately. The Travellers will be able to do no more than earn a living wage this way. Well-paid jobs are scarce at any time on Utoland and right now getting hired for one is near-impossible.

##### GETTING INFORMATION

Obtaining information is mostly a matter of talking to people. Marching up and demanding answers will not work very well for the Travellers but being generally sociable allows a conversation to be steered where they want it to go. Spending a bit of money on drinks and food may also help. Travellers might also consider taking one of the very basic jobs on offer for reasons other than remuneration. Bar staff can talk to customers whilst someone helping with a manual task may be able to talk to their workmates. Indeed, they may be unable to avoid their gripes and grumbles.

Some topics will come up over and over. Almost everyone is unhappy with working conditions and pay, and most want to leave Utoland. The Zhodani occupation has scared most people, although a few speculate that conditions might actually improve ‚Äì or at least the bosses will get taken down a peg or two. There are many gripes about the quality of the food or working conditions and the recent gouger disaster is a common topic of discussion.

If the Travellers want more specific information they will need to use Carouse or Streetwise skills to ask the right questions the right way and of the right people. The Travellers will be able to find out more about The Arden Society and its plans to exploit rather than develop Utoland, along with some fairly wild guesses about the number of Zhodani troops on planet. The level of success of their checks will indicate the quality of information available to the Travellers.

Typically, a check will result in the basics about a broad subject such as 'what is Utane like?', some specifics about a narrower subject like 'where would I find someone willing to deal in illicit goods?', or detailed information on something specific such as 'how do I obtain a movement permit without going through the usual process?'. The accuracy of the information may vary, however.

##### Information Quality Table

	Effect of Check Quality of Information
	-6 or worse The Travellers encounter someone who enjoys making stuff up and is good at it. The result
	may be amusingly inaccurate or more subtly misleading.
	-4 to -5 The information is wildly inaccurate but may still seem plausible.
	-3 to -1 The information is minimal or highly inaccurate.
	0 The information is vague and partial.
	1 to 3 The Travellers are presented with some basic and reasonably accurate information.
	4 to 5 The Travellers are presented with good, solid and almost completely accurate information.
	6 or more The Travellers somehow encountered an expert on the subject, who has current and complete
	information they are willing to share. They may want something in return.

In addition to whatever specifics the Travellers are asking about, they will gradually become aware of certain facts:

- Utoland has received a Zhodani occupation force.
- The mining company bosses have made big speeches about welcoming the Zhodani 'allies' on behalf of the Federation of Arden.
- The mining bosses, and therefore the de facto world government, seem to be collaborating with the Zhodani.
- The bosses have used the Zhodani occupation as an excuse to further tighten restrictions on the workers.
- The starport is locked down at present.
- There are some craft at the port. Their crews have been interned, except one. A request for information about its owners has been circulated and the crew are being urged to report to the starport for 'an interview'. The Travellers will realise that this is their shuttle.
- There are rumours of unrest in the capital but no-one really knows what is going on.

##### OBTAINING NECESSITIES

There is not much crime in MC4, largely due to a lack of money among the populace. With little to steal and no-one to sell it to there are few incentives to become a criminal. However, there are those who find ways to make an illicit profit. Mostly this is embezzlement or misappropriation of goods on a small scale. The complex has a few small-time crooks who steal or rob but most thievery is done by those paid to look after inventory. The supply situation is notoriously corrupt and few dealers get busted as they are useful to the higher-ups.

This situation might affect the Travellers in different ways. If they want a particular item and cannot afford it or it is unavailable through normal channels, they may be able to bribe, bargain or intimidate someone to get it for them. There are limits to what is available; in particular weapons. Only generic small arms and a few items misplaced by the EPS are available in MC4 and always at a very high price. Ammunition is as scarce as the actual weapons.

To discover more about the black market and underhand dealings, the Travellers will need to make discreet enquiries. Asking straight out gets a puzzled denial of any knowledge but talking around the subject will result in the Travellers finding out what everyone else already knows ‚Äì that there is indeed a black market, along with an idea of who to approach. This requires a day or so and a successful Average (8+) Streetwise check. Failure indicates the Travellers have aroused the suspicions of the criminals or the interest of the EPS.

If the Travellers proceed carefully they will eventually come across the name of Marija Ju, a supervisor at the complex rail terminal. She is widely supposed to be involved in the movement of illicit goods. Permits are not needed for the rail facility, although anyone without business there would have some explaining to do if they were caught wandering around. Marija is an administrator, so it should not be necessary to go into the actual rail yard itself. She can be found in the administrative offices during her working hours, or socialising in one of the bars near her accommodation afterwards. There will be witnesses around wherever the Travellers encounter Marija but that should not matter since she is entirely willing to talk to the Travellers.

Marija is not some great crime lord; she is simply an administrator who drifted into a little smuggling and sale of illicit goods. Her activities are suspected by her superiors and the EPS but thus far there has been no attempt to arrest her as doing so would not fit with the Ardenites' agenda. The Arden Society would rather a small amount of smuggling went on where they could keep track of it than having to undertake an investigation from scratch.

###### MARIJA JU

The Travellers may become aware of Marija in a variety of ways. One is asking around about necessities that are hard to obtain but it is possible they will be referred to her as a potential source of work or a way to get travel permits. It is also possible she hears about the Travellers and invites them to contact her, since she needs someone to solve a problem that has recently developed.

If the Travellers ask about the data core ‚Äì directly or in roundabout terms ‚Äì Marija says she does know of someone who might be able to help. She can also assist the Travellers in obtaining items they may need, for a suitable price. In fact, there may be a way the situation can be turned to mutual advantage. She has a contact in the capital who supplies a lot of the goods she needs and she is concerned he may have run into trouble. Marija does not want to use conventional communications as they may be compromised. If the Travellers are willing to seek out her contact and assist him with whatever difficulties he may be having, she will arrange to have the data core decoded by 'someone she knows about'.

Marija can solve the travel-restriction problem for the Travellers by hiring them as contractors. The snag is that they will actually have to do the job she assigns them and it is available only because absolutely nobody wants to do it. The cover story is that the rail operators are 'short-handed' and the Travellers were

brought in as consultants to get some outstanding tasks caught up. They are being paid from the maintenance contingency fund that Marija has control over. All this is more or less true, although anyone who knows about rail operations will smile wryly and secretly pity the fools who have been duped into taking on the task. As far as anyone can see, they are a bunch of clueless offworlders who have been tricked into volunteering for the worst job on Utoland.

The job is real and is long overdue. The entire rail network is supposed to be constantly monitored and inspected to avoid disasters involving trainloads of ore. The Arden Society are really not very concerned about casualties but lost revenue would be a problem and the expense of repairing tracks and rolling stock is best avoided. Of course, corners have been cut and responsibilities ignored and now there are problems with the rail network that urgently need fixing. It might be expected that the occupation would cause another delay but no-one will be surprised that the job has been assigned ‚Äì if there is someone willing to do it, the opportunity should be seized.

Thus the Travellers are enrolled on the personnel database and assigned blanket rail travel passes. This means they can ride any train along any line in connection with their mission, which is to survey the entire rail network and all its assets before recommending repairs and urgent maintenance. The task is mind-numbingly tedious and comprises several related activities:

- Emplacement of vibration sensors on various parts of a train and collection of data on smoothness of ride along the whole rail network. There is a phenomenal amount of data to be collected and compared to previous results, allowing the Travellers to build up a model of which parts of the track are excessively worn, subject to subsidence, or have other problems that need attention.
- Collection of vibration and stability data for all trains, allowing wear on locomotives and rolling stock to be evaluated and repaired.
- Installation and monitoring of cameras at front, rear and sides of trains to build up a visual picture of track conditions.
- Inspection of vehicles and support facilities, including evaluation-in-use of equipment such as filling chutes and associated systems.
- Direct inspection of tracks at randomly selected points throughout the rail network.
- Collation of all data and assignment of urgency categories to repairs and maintenance works.

This is a long, tedious and often filthy job which requires riding in ore trans and climbing over dirty equipment. It is mildly hazardous as well, although common sense and good working practices will reduce the risks to a minimum. The Travellers are expected to complete the task in 20 days and will be paid Cr500 each, half payable at commencement, half upon completion. Payment is in mining company scrip, which at least means the Travellers' money will not be tied up in the banking system. The Travellers can also obtain meals and minor supplies from the facilities of any railway installation.

This is a pretty terrible job but it solves the movement problem and facilitates the real task. Marija wants the Travellers to seek out Peler Kialuurma, a quartermaster for the Ursherer Mining Consortium, in the capital and deliver a small package to him. This will include a request to assist the Travellers in decoding their data core and getting into the starport when the time is right. Peler will expect the Travellers to assist him with whatever problem has interrupted his shipments of goods to Marija.

##### MARIJA JU

Marija Ju is an administrator in Utoland's rail system. She has climbed about as far as she can from her humble origins as an ordinary citizen and harbours a weary resentment towards The Arden Society. Since there is nothing she can do about it, she has accepted the situation and set about improving her lifestyle by smuggling goods along the rail system and supplying contraband to local dealers. She has been investigated several times by the EPS and correctly suspects they know all about her operation. However, she has learned to play the system. By remaining within tolerable limits Marija has become the devil they know and built herself a niche in the local economy. The occasional bribe has also helped.

In some ways Marija is a sad example of life on Utoland. Her aspirations are sufficiently small that the authorities let her get away with minor criminality. She thinks she is cleverly playing the system to better herself but in reality she has not escaped the control of The Arden Society. Indeed, by selling contraband at inflated prices she helps keep the workers poor whilst giving them what looks like an outlet for some of their frustrations.

Marija does not have thugs or bodyguards working for her; she does not need them. Sensible people recognise that robbing or harming the source of illicit goods will annoy everyone else who relies on her services and she lives and works somewhere with a solid EPS presence. Marija does sometimes need to remind people to pay for what she has obtained for them but there is always someone willing to be persuasive in return for a discount on their own shipment.

The railway inspection job will free the Travellers to move around but they will attract suspicion if they do not at least make a pretence of carrying out the task. The first stage is to inspect the facilities at MC4. There is really no way to get out of this; a team that ignored the most immediate part of the job would look highly suspicious. The Travellers will have to spend at least a couple of days measuring track bed subsidence and checking the signalling system works as it should.

The Travellers are dealing with a mid-tech railway system, in which there is little automation. Trains are manually driven and safety is a matter of the driver responding to trackside signals or instructions delivered by radio. This might seem horrifying to the Travellers if they are used to multiple-redundancy automated controls on a fully integrated network. If so, it is about to get worse ‚Äì they are going to have to drive their own train.

The train in question is a track inspection unit. It consists of a small diesel-electric locomotive normally used for shunting wagons, plus two small cars for the use of the inspection team. One contains instruments and tools for use in the field. The other is a mobile living area. Driving the locomotive is quite easy, merely being a matter of applying throttle and brakes. The difficult part is operating safely on a line used by ore trains. There are protocols to ensure safe working, mainly revolving around communication with the nearest signalling station. However, rail personnel might be surprised if the Travellers actually follow procedure. In a system where two trains in the same day is considered high volume traffic most operators are very relaxed about protocol. So long as the Travellers find out when the next train is scheduled they should be safe enough.

There is no set plan for how the inspection is to be carried out. So long as it is done, the order does not matter. Logically, the Travellers would survey the heavy-gauge line between settlements, auditing the local facilities at each as they arrive. They are not required to survey the light-gauge internal rail system of the capital ‚Äì and their train will not run on it ‚Äì but if they were to claim they were doing so nobody would think it implausible.

The Travellers' progress towards Utane will be slow if they make even a pretence of conducting the inspection. Frequent halts are necessary to check out suspected subsidence or faults in the rail system and the Travellers will quickly get the impression the rail system was built on the cheap and not properly maintained since. There is little chance their own light train will get into trouble but there are some sections where a heavily-laden ore train might put too much stress on the tracks. Without a background in mid-tech railroad engineering the Travellers cannot say for sure but can report their reservations if they are feeling diligent. They may also discover another reason why this job is so unpopular ‚Äì the people who own the railway do not want to hear about anything that will cost them money and are likely to act as if it is the Travellers' fault they will have to authorise repair work.

It will be necessary to move to one of the handful of sidings between MC4 and Utane when an ore train comes through. If the Travellers are careful all they need to do is to inform the controllers at each end of the line of where they are and when a train is due they will be instructed to proceed to a safe location. They could achieve the same effect by noting the schedule and engaging in a bit of forward planning. Travellers being who they are, if is possible they will forget about the ore trains, which may result in frantically running ahead of one towards the nearest siding. Such dangerous incompetence will earn the Travellers a chewing-out at least but they are ‚Äì supposedly ‚Äì doing a job nobody else wants, so firing them is an absolute last resort.

## HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

Upon arriving at Utane, the Travellers will be directed to a siding and more or less forgotten about. They are expected to live out of the survey train, with no provision for accommodation elsewhere, so will not arouse suspicion by doing so. They will be subject to a cursory security check when they leave the train but providing they behave like a bunch of railway employees they will not have to answer awkward questions. The Travellers have the right documentation and are doing something that makes sense. So long as they maintain the fa√ßade, people will tend to jump to the conclusion that they are legitimate.

# RIDING THE RAILS

Although the Travellers' train will not run on the light-gauge internal service, their status as railway personnel gives them free access to the whole network. Security personnel will check permits and tickets at each destination but since they are in possession of valid documentation the Travellers are more likely to encounter teasing about having the worst job on

Utoland than attempts to punch holes in their story. This does not mean they will not be stopped and questioned; Utoland is under occupation and already had a security problem. Such encounters can be resolved with a Routine (6+) Persuade or Streetwise check. The Travellers should realise that as long as they maintain their cover, they have the run of the planet.

The Travellers arrive in the main rail hub of Utane, from which they can access any of the districts except the starport and startown. The rail links to these are open but special permission is required. The Travellers might be able to claim they need to look at the rail system in those locations but this will attract far more scrutiny than any other areas of the city. It is also possible to move between districts by crossing the open ground between them, although there are fences and walls around some parts of the city.

The Travellers will be struck by the increased security presence in the city and an overall feeling of tension. There are additional checkpoints and patrols, and security personnel seem nervous. There is little sign of the Zhodani occupation force anywhere but the port, other than armoured soldiers flying a few metres above the streets in air/rafts (see page 116). There are no opportunities for interaction with the Zhodani for most people; only officials at the starport and the city's administrators have had any contact. Public announcements run every few minutes, reminding the populace that the city (and indeed the planet) is under occupation. This is accompanied by the usual 'keep calm and obey the law, and you have nothing to fear' statements.

There are plenty of rumours but no-one seems to have any concrete information. If the Travellers do manage to find out exactly what is going on they will discover that the Zhodani force landed, secured the port, then made a series of what can only be described as armed reconnaissance into the city over the course of about 36 hours. After this they holed up on the port and have remained there, issuing orders to the city administrators and occasionally summoning someone to the port in person. Those that do not attend are arrested by the local security force, presumably on the orders of the Zhodani.

The Zhodani force is content to act like a cork in a bottle to a great extent and for the time being at least it is convenient to work through the local administration. If necessary the occupation force can send troops to arrest someone if the EPS is not cooperating but so far it has not been done. It is notable that the Zhodani themselves are not spouting propaganda or trying to win over the populace. Theirs is a military mission; assimilation will come later.

Naturally, rumours flying around speak of a programme of telepathic infiltration and people being taken to 'adjustment camps' ‚Äì although there is no sign of any such thing happening. The crews of starships and spacecraft landed at the port are being held in what looks like quite benign internment but there are rumours these people are being tortured, brainwashed or taken out to the desert and shot. Everybody knows somebody who has met someone who has evidence of these happenings... or so they say. Overall, the atmosphere is one of fear and tension. Asking questions in this environment could be hazardous but the Travellers have no choice.

## THE UTANE BLACK MARKET

Peler Kialuurma is a major figure in the Utane black market, renowned for being able to get almost anything - at a suitably outrageous price. The Black Market Costs table indicates the markup Peler and other sellers place on various items, based on rarity and the risk he runs by providing them. There are items he simply cannot get and others he could but only for the right clients ‚Äì which the Travellers are not.

The Travellers are unlikely to have the cash to pay for much in the way of equipment or permits. Some negotiation is possible but the black marketeers have all the cards. Most marketeers are willing to trade work for credit against items and all of them are likely to need something done.

# THE CITY OF UTANE

###### CONTACTING PELER

Finding Peler Kialuurma looks easy enough on the face of it ‚Äì his address is in the public registry. However, it is in Managerial Enclave Two, which also houses the headquarters of the EPS. This is a highly secure area, with access strictly limited. The Travellers could get as far as its rail station using their usual cover story but after that they will have to persuade the security services they have a need to be in this part of town.

Further investigation of Peler indicates he has been appointed head of something calling itself the Committee for Offworld Relations. This may sound to the Travellers like some kind of Quisling collaboration group, which is correct. Essentially, Peler and some others have sensed an opportunity to gain advancement by pandering to the Zhodani. They are making progress, as the occupation commander prefers to deal with self-serving collaborators than local officials who may not be as cooperative. This does not suggest any shared ideology or sympathy on either side; it is simply more convenient to work with those who are eager to please, whatever their motivations.

Peler mostly remains in Managerial Enclave Two but journeys to the starport to receive instructions in person. His Zhodani masters do not think highly enough of him to send a grav vehicle, so he uses the rail system. Trains to the port are usually empty other than Peler and a couple of EPS bodyguards. The Travellers have access to the rail system records and will be able to follow Peler's movements easily enough. Their survey mission is a reasonable cover, although they will be closely questioned as to why they are using this part of the railway. If the Travellers play it right they should be able to 'accidentally' be on the same train as Peler during one of his journeys.

There are other ways to get access to Peler, of course. The Travellers could even just send him a message and ask to meet. That has its complications however, as the Travellers will have to justify the contact without saying 'we are trying to find out why you have stopped smuggling goods to our employer'. Talking around the subject might be required to get the message across subtly. A phrase like 'Marija Ju needs your help with a supply problem' sounds innocuous enough on the surface and has the virtue of being highly plausible.

Peler is reluctant to leave Managerial Enclave Two for a meeting but would be willing to do so if he sees an advantage. He is not under arrest, although he is usually in the presence of EPS personnel. His apparently pro- Zhodani stance is not going to make him popular, so he is being careful. Likewise, he has curtailed shipments of illicit goods whilst the situation stabilises. He assumes the Zhodani would be opposed to crime and embezzlement and does not want to harm his chances of being made planetary governor by getting caught.

In fact, Peler is incorrect in his assumptions. He will achieve temporary power but the Zhodani are highly unlikely to elevate him in the long run. They do not care about whether or not he is caught or prosecuted for his smuggling and black marketeering; what matters is that he is dishonest. He was appointed to a managerial role and, by Zhodani standards, is bound to fulfil that role to the best of his ability. His activities have already made him ineligible for any post under a Consulate government, let alone the top slot.

Peler's willingness to talk to the Travellers is based on self-interest, as might be expected. He is aware he is treading a dangerous path at present and that some of the other committee members are as determined to climb to the top of the heap as he is. He needs advantages and someone able to work outside his usual circle of contacts could be ideal; even if they totally fail to make contact, Peler may well notice them and reach out. A group of offworld workers able to move around freely despite there being a security lockdown in place is certainly interesting. The EPS might accept their story but Peler has dealt with Marija Ju for some time. This is the sort of thing she might do and the launching of a rail inspection at this particular moment seems suspicious to him.

###### PELER'S PLAN

Once contact is made, Peler will either arrange a meeting or agree to the Travellers' proposal for one. A suitable cover story is not hard to come up with ‚Äì perhaps the Travellers need to bring to his attention some important fact they have discovered about the rail network. Whatever the story, Peler has an agenda of his own. He will truthfully tell the Travellers that he has curtailed the shipments in order to cement his position under the occupation. He is less truthful about that position; according to him he is the de facto planetary leader and the only person who can keep the Zhodani from stomping down on Utoland.

Peler uses the Zhodani as a threat to obtain compliance from the locals and smooths out problems for the occupation force to keep them happy. He thinks he is in an excellent position and really believes he has a shot at being appointed governor. He has no antipathy for the Zhodani but no love of them either; to him they are just another card to be played. In some ways he is right about the occupation; the Zhodani will take whatever measures they have to in order to ensure compliance and security. By collaborating, Peler and his committee will lessen the effects of the occupation ‚Äì at least at first.

Peler is aware of the unrest in the city and is concerned by it. There are plenty of people who were unhappy before the Zhodani arrived and the present situation may cause some to act foolishly. At present Peler is unsure how best to make use of the opportunities beginning to present themselves. He therefore offers the Travellers a deal. He will assure Marija that deliveries will recommence once the present disruption settles down and in the meantime will get someone working on the data core. In return, the Travellers must assess the situation in Utane ‚Äì Peler does not see much beyond the rich peoples' perspective in the managerial enclave and is smart enough to realise this is not an accurate picture of what is really happening. He will also have some 'errands' for them to run. In return, he can get them into the starport.

The last is neither truth nor lie. Peler cannot guarantee access to the port but he is confident he will find a way. He already has a deal in place with some of the interned starship crews to get them back to their ships and figuring out how to do that will allow him to accommodate the Travellers as well. In the meantime he needs information and the Travellers are well placed to obtain it.

###### PELER KIALUURMA

Peler Kialuurma is a quartermaster-manager for the Ursherer Mining Consortium. He has advanced about as far as he will ever go in the service of the company and resents it greatly. His embezzlement and smuggling operations were a way of getting the company to give him what ‚Äì as he sees it ‚Äì he deserves from it and he has been sufficiently successful that he has amassed a personal fortune and web of contacts. He sees the Zhodani occupation as an opportunity to eliminate the Ardenites above him or to leapfrog over them to an elevated position. After that, he will have to find a way to get the Zhodani to do what he wants.

Peler is in possession of such an ego that he really thinks the Zhodani Consulate is going to bend to his will. His world-view is rather small, as the Travellers may come to realise, and he does not really understand what he is up against. He is thinking in terms of outwitting a complacent regime that does not care about minor corruption so long as the bottom line is not damaged, rather than a major interstellar power. As his confidence erodes in the face of reality he will become desperate, willing to take actions he would previously never have considered.

The plan forming in Peler's mind as he discovers the extent of unrest on Utoland seems workable to him. He will facilitate the revolution he sees coming, using it to take out the Ardenites above him, then step in as the head of the Committee for Offworld Relations to restore order and spare the populace from Zhodani retaliation. By playing both ends against one another he will emerge as the planetary leader he deserves to be. He will offer all manner of justifications for why he thinks this will work but ultimately he has reached the point where 'this will work because it has to'.

Peler wants the Travellers to evaluate the situation in Utane, which they can do whilst carrying out some 'errands' for him. The first is to pay a visit to what Peler describes as a 'client' in the New Town part of the city. This individual is one of many who owe Peler money, items or actions. Some seem to have decided their debts no longer matter now that the world is under occupation. Peler naturally wants them to complete their end of the deal. He does not really care how they are persuaded but would prefer a low-key approach if possible as it makes future dealings more likely and generates fewer long-term complications. Peler is quite clear that he does not mind if someone gets hurt so long as he gets what he is owed, but reminds the Travellers that a damaged worker cannot make money for anyone.

The Travellers are tasked with locating Moak Hei, an ore-crusher technician with a penchant for nice clothes. New arrivals often sell off their wardrobe when they get short of money and Moak likes to pick and choose the best outfits for himself and those he wants to impress. He has run up a debt of some Cr5000 to Peler, who would prefer to get some of the money now and keep Moak as a client ‚Äì albeit a difficult one ‚Äì but will settle for full payment and termination of their business relationship. Refusal is not acceptable as it makes Peler look ineffectual. Peler wants at least a token payment ‚Äì Cr300 at a minimum. He will be pleased if he gets more plus a promise of payment and does not lose Moak as a long-term client.

## NEW TOWN

There is nothing untoward about a group of railway workers entering New Town. Indeed, most people coming to Utane seek accommodation there. The Travellers will be challenged by security if they arrive by train but any plausible sounding response will see them waved through. The Travellers could also enter New Town on foot, by crossing the waste land between areas. This would seem suspicious if they were noticed, however.

New Town is not walled or fenced. Its structures are mostly one or two storeys high and grouped in clusters with a common semi-airlock entry point. These use air blowers to keep the 'outside' air out of the cluster of structures. The doors seal reasonably well when closed and dust that has fallen to the ground is regularly swept out. Few buildings have a proper airlock system as it is simply too expensive. Clusters are usually buildings of similar function; for example dwellings tend to be grouped together with separate retail or work-related structures.

There are people out and about between building clusters and a few free-standing structures. Security patrols are in evidence and most people the Travellers meet are wary or even hostile. Their attitude improves a little if the Travellers can show they are not connected with the occupation force but people are scared of Zhodani infiltrators, mind control operatives and all manner of other largely imaginary threats.

If the Travellers talk to people they will be struck by the level of fear and ignorance most have towards the Zhodani. Wild tales and rumours abound, and already there are those accusing others of being spies. Much of what is being said seems rather silly to educated starfarers, although saying so would be a risk. It is not that there is nothing to fear; quite the opposite. However, what is feared is mostly the product of imagination or perhaps propaganda. This is a backwater world with limited offworld contact and a poor education system; fertile ground for fear of the unknown.

Despite the circumstances, people are still going about their business. Shops are open and there are patrons in the bars. Streetwise Travellers may realise there is an unusual pattern to their movements, however. Some seem to be taking the long way around rather than crossing open ground. The reason why becomes apparent soon after the Travellers enter New Town.

A Zhodani military air/raft passes over the town headed north-east, then doubles back and begins quartering. It flies at most 10 metres above the highest buildings and sometimes descends to almost ground level. In addition to the pilot, an observer is using a hand-held scanning device and two combat-armoured troopers stand in the rear. One has a standard-issue Consular

# UNREST IN UTANE

Army laser carbine, the other a long-barrelled laser sniper rifle. The air/raft halts from time-to-time, then moves on. Then, without warning, the sniper raises his rifle to his shoulder and fires a single shot. At over 100 metres in a shallow downward angle, the bolt passes close to several bystanders before it hits someone crossing the street. The air/raft continues to patrol as people scatter for cover. The victim is dragged away, obviously dead. Observant Travellers might spot someone making off with an obviously heavy bag.

If the Travellers attempt to return fire they will be subject to lethal force and identified from then on as hostiles. The Referee may choose to warn them of this, either from their own recollections or a helpful stranger. Instant execution of this sort is considered acceptable by the Zhodani in the case of confirmed hostiles. Presumably, the EPS was told to find and arrest this person and failed to do so. Operations of this sort are justified in Zhodani military law under the principle of fair warning. It is possible that the locals will get used to this sort of thing and stop panicking but for the present it seems to most people on the ground that the Zhodani are just shooting random victims.

###### MOAK

Once the air/raft incident is over the Travellers will be able to find Moak. He is usually at a bar when he is not working. Moak is a big, strong individual and popular with his workmates and drinking buddies. If the Travellers take the approach of threatening him with a beating he will call their bluff and others will come to his aid. On the other hand, a polite reminder that he owes money might work, if the Travellers phrase it well.

Moak likes the clothes and goods Peler provides him with. If he stops paying for them he gets no more. An argument along these lines, backed up by a successful Persuade check, should convince Moak. He will offer a payment of Cr150 multiplied by the Effect of the Persuade check, on the understanding that he will sort out the rest of the debt as soon as practicable. It is entirely possible for the incident to end with the Travellers having a drink with Moak, who eagerly questions them about what new items Peler might have... or all involved might be headed for the hospital.

###### WORD AROUND TOWN

If the Travellers want to know more about the murder (as it is in the eyes of most locals) they witnessed, it is not hard to find people willing to talk about it. The problem is that everyone has their own ill-informed opinion. Most of these are along the lines that the Zhodani are carrying out terror killings to keep the populace frightened, although there are a few who think the Thought Police have identified individuals likely to cause trouble and sent soldiers to hunt them.

Travellers who want better information or sift through what people are saying will need to make an Average (8+) Investigate or Streetwise check. The most likely (and in fact correct) conclusion is that the killing was not random nor inspired by psionic powers. The individual killed, one Jared Kallig, is subject to a wanted notice on the datanet and a 'request for interview' by the Zhodani authorities. Although politely phrased, these requests are essentially a summons for someone to turn themselves in. Those who do not may be arrested but can be eliminated upon being identified by a military patrol. The Zhodani occupiers have a datanet site that more or less explicitly states this. It does not say why the occupation force wanted to talk to Kallig.

Jared Kallig is known to some people in New Town. He has had brushes with the EPS over minor offenses such as moving contraband between districts and unlawful movements around the rail system. This is of course just what he got caught for; those who know about such things can name him as a small-time courier for one of the Old Town criminal groups.

If the Travellers want to know what Kallig was carrying, they will have to investigate more thoroughly. Most people simply do not know and those who do are not telling. If the Travellers want to find an informant and induce them to talk they can find a few people who have dealt with Kallig. All tell the same story; until recently he moved small items for the crime groups or obtained them on behalf of people unwilling to go to Old Town. His latest run was not for any of his usual clients and nobody seems to know who he was meeting.

Whilst the Travellers are investigating or carrying out other activities in New Town, a clue surfaces in the form of a burst of automatic gunfire from a couple of streets away. This escalates soon after as an EPS patrol rushes to the area and starts looking for the gunman. More shots are fired and soon afterward a grav vehicle hurtles overhead, landing briefly before racing back towards EPS headquarters. The Zhodani patrol does not respond.

The Travellers may be able to puzzle out what has happened. Apparently someone had come into possession of a rattler ‚Äì a submachinegun ‚Äì and used it to carry out a robbery. This went bad, resulting in a fatality and the gunman attempted to make off. Caught by a security patrol, he attempted to shoot his way out and was killed. One EPS operative was critically injured and evacuated to the trauma unit at their headquarters. Shootings are not uncommon in Utane but blatant use of automatic weapons is most definitely unusual. The incident pulls additional EPS units into the area to conduct searches, although they are not inclined to say what they are looking for. It should be possible for smart Travellers to figure out that the EPS thinks there are more guns on the streets.

The security service is correct in its assumption. Kallig was carrying multiple weapons when he was killed. His bag was grabbed by an opportunist who was then ambushed by the intended recipient of the weapons. One of the guns was misplaced during the incident and ended up in the hands of a petty street criminal. The rest have disappeared. The fact this happened so soon after the Zhodani occupation began suggests someone is planning to resist.

###### RETURNING TO PELER

Peler is naturally intrigued by all this and has obtained information through other channels. The Economic Protection Service seems divided on the subject of resistance. There are some who see collaboration as the only way to survive and others who claim they would fight if victory seemed possible. Most are undecided or cowed by the Zhodani force's firepower. It is easy to imagine they will simply stay in their enclave and leave Utane alone. After all, what does the Zhodani Consulate want with a backwater like this?

Among the Ardenite elite, there is a belief that Utoland will be returned to the control of the Federation of Arden once the immediate need for occupation has passed. This is actually quite likely in the short term, although whether Arden and its possessions can remain independent is an open question. The elite therefore do not want anyone to rock the boat and have ordered a clampdown by the EPS on activities likely to provoke the Zhodani. Peler vocally supports this in public but privately hopes for a failed revolution which will clear the elite out from above him.

As for the Travellers' data core, Peler has come through for them. If plugged into any data device the Travellers can see it is nothing more than a passcode and configuration vault. If the Travellers can get aboard the ship it came from they should be able to take full command of it and in the meantime the device is 'open' for anyone to use. The Travellers can set security as they please.

There is, however, a problem. The individual who cracked it is Caroline Pinheiro, a crewmember aboard one of the ships currently interned in the port and a former member of the Imperial Navy. The crews were hurriedly interned but now the Zhodani are calling them in for 'interviews'. None of those who have attended so far have been harmed but it is likely telepaths may be present. If this individual is scanned the Zhodani will know all about the Travellers. The solution is to get her out of the city, which fits with Peler's plans anyway. He wants the Travellers to take Pinheiro to MC4 along with a shipment of goods for Marija and bring some items back with them. This will put Pinheiro out of reach of the Zhodani for a while.

##### GETTING INTO THE PORT

If the Travellers ask about how Peler can get them inside the port, he says there are multiple options. Which is best will depend upon circumstances. The simplest is to get permission for the Travellers to go to their shuttle, whereupon they can simply fly away. The port has no anti-starship weapons and there are no Zhodani warships in system as far as he knows, so if the Travellers can reach their shuttle they are home free. He thinks it may be possible to deceive the Zhodani, despite their telepathy. If the person requesting permission sincerely believes what they are saying, the Zhodani will be fooled. All that is required is to come up with a suitable reason. Peler admits he is open to suggestions on that front.

Another option is stealth. The port has a wall but it has never been well maintained. Unless the Zhodani have installed sensors they will still be relying on the same method as the EPS used to keep the port secure ‚Äì foot patrols. It may be possible to sneak into the port or gain entry by some deception then slip away and make for the shuttle. Peler thinks he can get the Travellers in by duping one of the Ardenite officials at the port into requesting their presence. The obvious cover would be something to do with the rail system. The Travellers would have to find a way to defeat telepathic scanning. The best way anyone knows is to avoid being scanned

- appearing mundane and unremarkable might keep the Travellers below the Zhodani radar.

The alternative is to take advantage of some distraction. If someone is planning to resist the occupation, that might be enough to create an opportunity to use speed or stealth to get inside. Peler suggests watching how events develop over the next few days. Something might suggest itself. This is all rather vague, but Peler is confident he can make it work. However, he does need time and probably a few items. Some of those will have to come from MC4, and the Travellers are the only ones who can fetch them. Peler will not say exactly what these items are, possibly giving the Travellers the impression he is still working on the details of his plan.

###### RETURNING TO MC4

Despite the recent incidents, the Travellers should not encounter too much trouble returning to MC4. They will have to explain their movements to EPS personnel but they have permits and legitimate orders to travel the rail system. There is no reason they would be suspected unless they draw attention to themselves. However, Caroline Pinheiro is a different matter. She is a known offworlder interned at Utane. She is not as yet wanted by the Zhodani but at the same time is not free to move around. During the hurried internment process, offworld crews were more or less dumped on the doorstep of Managerial Enclave Two with instructions they were to be treated with courtesy but not allowed to leave.

The does not have access to the automated recognition system used by Zhodani troops, nor do they have an integrated communications system ‚Äì they are, after all, little more than security guards for Ardenite holdings. Well forged documentation would allow Pinheiro to walk through a checkpoint as 'just another railway worker'. If this cannot be arranged the Travellers will have to try stealth. One option would be for most of them to return to the train and set out for MC4, whilst others accompany Pinheiro through the marginal land to scramble aboard out of sight of the rail hub.

There is little chance of running into an EPS patrol in the marginal land, though there are some people living there or operating small farms. This works to the Travellers' advantage; even if they are spotted by thermal sensors aboard a passing Zhodani air/raft they are likely to be mistaken for local people, and the Zhodani are not really interested in those unless they are too close to the port. The Travellers might scramble to hide from an air/raft, never realising its crew noted their presence and discounted them.

Once out of the city, the Travellers can proceed to MC4 at their leisure. They would be well advised to pretend they are carrying out their mission, just in case they attract attention, but providing they are sensible it will not be hard to get into MC4. Pinheiro can be smuggled in if she does not have any suitable documentation. Marija is pleased to learn that Peler intends to continue supplying her as she has numerous clients asking for goods. Peler's request will take a couple of days to put together, during which the Travellers can enjoy the rather limited facilities of MC4.

Peler has sent a one-use electronic message pad to Marija, so that no record of the transaction exists and no messages can be placed. This is wise, given what he is asking for. Most of the items are innocuous enough; medical kits from the MC4 stockpile and the like. However, the Travellers' train is loaded with two large crates stencilled with code numbers that imply they contain rail repair equipment. If the Travellers force them open ‚Äì which will be readily detected when they arrive ‚Äì they will discover they contain penetrator projectiles similar to those they encountered at Gouger Militte.

If the Travellers were to ask about this or demand to know what is in the crates, Marija tells them they are defective projectiles being returned to the works at Utane for refurbishment, quite safe to transport unless electronically and physically armed. The Travellers might even believe Marija's explanation that they are being covertly transferred in case someone tries to steal them. This transparent lie is partly a clumsy attempt to defeat psionic scanning, made by someone who does not know how telepathy works. Similar polite innuendo is used by Peler and others. Marija will not say what the projectiles are really for. That way, even if the Travellers were scanned they could not report the truth.

###### CAROLINE PINHEIRO

Formerly Petty Officer Second Class Pinheiro of the Imperial Navy, Caroline is just an ordinary spacer these days. She has no great love of the Imperium, though she dislikes the Zhodani in a vague sort of way. She wants to avoid interactions with them as she expects she will be interrogated by psions due to her former service. That is a possibility, though it will be a low priority for the Zhodani Consulate. Eventually, when the internees are properly processed, the occupiers may get around to seeing what intel they can get from a minor crewmember whose service ended a decade ago. That will not be much, but it does mean Pinheiro will become a prisoner rather than an internee. She would prefer to avoid that, though hiding out on Utoland is not much better.

Pinheiro is now a free trader crewmember, and has found herself in the occasional scrape. She is resourceful and clever, but rather out of place running around a mid-tech planet. Her favoured solution to most problems would be to reprogramme something; that is her forte, not skulking around in the bushes. She will not complain, since she sees the necessity, but is very much a fish out of water.

If the Travellers think to ask, Pinheiro can recall some of her contingency briefings from the navy. She will be able to identify the key feature of the Zhodani occupation force's behaviour ‚Äì the fact that it is solely concerned with military matters. If the Travellers are puzzled why the Zhodani ignore some incidents, Pinheiro can provide an explanation. This may lead to the insight that if the Travellers can look like a 'local problem' they may well be ignored whereas if they appear to be a direct threat they will be treated as battlefield hostiles.

Whilst the Travellers are at MC4, events begin to unfold at Utane which will create opportunities for them. The EPS has been cooperating very reluctantly up to this point, and the Zhodani commander is not satisfied; the Zhodani are concerned about resistance within the EPS and a threat from the general populace. They want the EPS to get on top of the situation, and that means finding some suspects and bringing them in for questioning.

The EPS launches raids against suspected and known criminal elements, including a deep foray into Old Town. This is a fiasco ‚Äì the lead elements are ambushed by hostiles who clearly knew they were coming. Some of the EPS force melted away or found reasons not to respond immediately to requests for assistance. The disaster was followed by a series of arrests within the ranks of the EPS, of personnel suspected of ignoring their orders. Most did so because they were unwilling to do the work of an occupying army, even against known criminals.

The Zhodani commander was not surprised by this turn of events; he had been trained for it. Whilst those who hesitated to obey his orders were brought to the starport for questioning, squads of armoured soldiers descended on Old Town. They met resistance, but handguns and light automatics against combat armour was a foregone conclusion. Anyone with a weapon was fired upon without warning and the survivors arrested. Known threats, such as those the EPS had gone after, were detained or eliminated. However, reluctance to cooperate extended to withholding information and as a result the strike was not successful in breaking resistance to the occupation. In fact, it had the opposite effect.

After the Zhodani retired to their base, rioting broke out across New Town and Old Town. There was some unrest in the managerial areas but it was largely contained and de-escalated ‚Äì for the time being at least. The depleted EPS was ordered out to quell the riots, provoking a crisis in the ranks. Most EPS personnel found reasons to take half-measures such as securing transport hubs or installations, whilst some openly joined the rioters. Those who remained were too few to make any difference and retired to safe locations after making a token attempt.

The Zhodani occupation force was not unduly concerned at this point; the riots would burn themselves out in time and any offensive action aimed at the port or startown could be repelled. They fitted squad support gauss guns to the pintle mounts on their air/rafts and fired on anyone approaching their enclave. Undoubtedly some of the targets were just people going about their business in the marginal land.

Everything changed when a series of projectiles was launched from somewhere in the northern processing works. These were penetrators of the same sort the Travellers are carrying. Most were targeted on Managerial Enclave One, with a handful aimed at Enclave Two. There were no missile defences in place and whilst one projectile was intercepted by a quick- thinking Zhodani missile launcher team, most struck their targets. Managerial Enclave One is in ruins, with hundreds dead and many more wounded. Enclave Two was hit by fewer projectiles but has numerous casualties.

The EPS force assigned to Managerial Enclave One was quickly overrun by a mob from Old Town. Most seem intent on looting everything they can whilst a minority are more targeted. These are either stripping items of value or taking captives according to some agenda of their own. The EPS is doing nothing to assist Enclave One. It is trying to defend the main rail hub and Managerial Enclave Two, and thus far has faced little direct threat on the ground.

## FACTIONS IN UTANE

As the Travellers approach Utane they become aware of broadcasts from the city. One is a warning by the EPS to stay indoors and wait for them to restore order. The other is from Peler, in his 'official' position as head of the Committee for Offworld Relations. It takes the form of an impassioned plea for everyone to stand down. The Ardenite government is not functioning as a result of the strikes on the dwellings of its leaders, so the COR has stepped in to take charge in the interim.

# ON THE BRINK

Peler warns that the Zhodani occupation force will definitely retaliate if it is attacked and may intervene anyway. If it does, its response will be robust and thorough... perhaps to the point of overkill. It would be much better to step back and avoid further violence. To that end, Peler is offering to discuss with the dissidents some form of resolution to their grievances in exchange for release of prisoners and a return to a non-violent posture. He promises he can persuade the Zhodani not to intervene providing he is permitted to negotiate with them on behalf of all Utolanders.

Peler is essentially claiming to be the planetary governor and using the threat of Zhodani intervention to get the dissidents to accept it. He hopes to get the Zhodani to accept him in that role in return for ending the inconvenient uprising. Given the circumstances, this might be the best possible outcome for the Utolanders. They should be able to negotiate an improvement in their circumstances and hopefully avoid being mercilessly crushed by the Zhodani. However, there will be problems getting everyone to accept that.

###### THE DISSIDENTS

The people of Utane have been oppressed by the Ardenites for decades. They are angry and fearful. Some of the violence that has occurred is simply the outpouring of this rage, although there are some genuine revolutionaries among them. Fear of the Zhodani is a two-edged sword in this case. Some feel the only option they have now is to drive the Zhodani off the planet, others are horrified at what might happen and urge total surrender. In between are frightened and angry people looking for a way out of the present chaos and, ideally, a path towards a better life.

The dissidents are poorly armed, with locally available small arms and a scattering of EPS weaponry. They have the advantage of knowing the city and currently control the Old and New Towns with some presence in Managerial Enclave One and the associated industrial area. They have fired all their projectiles and moved the launcher.

###### THE ARDEN SOCIETY

The projectiles launched by the dissidents were surprisingly ‚Äì indeed, suspiciously ‚Äì well aimed. A significant proportion of the Ardenite leaders were either killed in the attack or captured by dissidents soon afterward. Some of those were killed out of hand but few of the dissidents are hardcore enough to condone such actions. The effect of this attack was to paralyse the de facto government in Utane. There will be a reaction sooner or later from elsewhere on the planet but since most of the Ardenite leaders live on Arden and pay managers to handle their Utoland affairs, a coherent response is unlikely in the short term.

The surviving Arden Society representatives are mostly at Enclave Two, where some have been quietly detained by Peler's supporters and others are siding with him. In short, The Arden Society is out of the picture for now. This has possible long- term repercussions for Arden. If it loses control of the Utoland colony the Zhodani might be less willing to recognise its Federation and other worlds less likely to join it. How this plays out is beyond the scope of this adventure but the Travellers' decisions here may well lay the groundwork for events that shape the future of the Demilitarised Zone.

###### PELER AND THE EPS

Peler has so far achieved what he wanted, although not the way he planned it. He did not see the projectile attack coming and whilst it has resulted in the elimination of the senior Ardenites ‚Äì which he is pleased by ‚Äì he is worried about the Zhodani response. There is also a possibility the dissidents might launch a second strike against his own stronghold, especially since they are angry with the EPS which has its headquarters there.

The best option for Peler is to negotiate an end to the violence, which is what he always intended. He got what he wanted and now has the proverbial tiger by the tail. He is out of his depth but rather prone to self-delusion, to the point where he has convinced himself that he is winning. He may even be right but at present he has no strategy for what to do next beyond keeping control of what he has and attempting to cement his position through diplomacy.

###### THE ZHODANI OCCUPATION FORCE

The Zhodani do not much care what goes on outside their wall. They launched a strike to eliminate any immediate threat and gain intel. Initial analysis suggests the revolution is trivial and not aimed directly at them. This suits their agenda in the long run; if the locals dissipate their emotions and waste ammunition fighting one another there is less for the Zhodani to do. Ideally, they will come to be seen as a better alternative to chaos or domination by a faction that has an axe to grind.

The Zhodani occupation force will, for the most part, be content to defend its holdings. It will send grav-mobile patrols out to eliminate known hostiles or to discourage encroachment but is otherwise not involved in the current chaos. If the planetary government were to ask for assistance the Zhodani might send help but what passes for a government is paralysed. Whether Peler's faction constitutes an alternative depends on whether it suits the Zhodani agenda or not. The most likely policy for the occupation force is to watch and wait. If the situation appears to be stabilising they will let that happen and open relations with the winners. If not, they are likely to intervene on the side of the most legitimate- seeming faction. In short, they will pragmatically support whomever can bring the planet under control for them. The factions are unlikely to realise this; both the dissidents and Peler assume the Zhodani will support the Ardenites ‚Äì whether they are led by The Arden Society or Peler's faction.

###### ENTER THE TRAVELLERS

There are no obvious 'good' or 'bad' factions here. Everyone has their own agenda and reasons for pursuing it. Victory for each faction will have consequences for the people of Utoland. As for the Travellers, their agenda is to get off Utoland and back to their ship ‚Äì unless they choose to deviate from it. However, they may be able to exploit the situation to their advantage.

The Travellers are carrying a quantity of projectiles of the same sort used by the dissidents in their first strike. The dissident leaders know this, having been informed by Marija Ju. She did not tell the Travellers about this as she was unsure of their allegiance. The

dissidents have sent a squad out of the city to stop the Travellers' train, a risk, as they are horribly vulnerable to Zhodani air/raft-borne patrols. The dissidents over- estimate the risk since they do not know Zhodani policy but feel this move is necessary.

The Travellers will become aware of a hazard on the track, courtesy of the condition-monitoring equipment they have been so tediously using. There is rubble across the line, sufficient to possibly derail the train and atop it stand several dissident gunmen. They are waving at the train to stop. A couple, conspicuously unarmed, walk forward down the track to meet the train.

This is a pivotal moment in the adventure, which may decide how the remainder plays out. If the Travellers do not stop the gunmen will not fire on them. They scramble out of the way and hunker down, returning fire only if fired upon. Even then their shooting is either very bad or aimed at suppressing the Travellers rather than harming them. If the Travellers try to punch through the rail block they may be able to do so, depending on their ability to judge the correct speed and level of impact or push. A successful Average (8+) Drive check is needed to push through. Otherwise the most likely result at low speed is becoming stuck. Effect -6 or worse results in derailment.

If the train is stuck the Travellers will have to interact with the gunmen. They still do not initiate hostilities but will defend themselves if fired upon. They will try to convince the Travellers they are allies. If the Travellers are willing to talk the dissidents immediately begin clearing the track for them whilst their leader boards the train to explain the situation.

NOT STOPPING!

If the Travellers do not stop and talk they have two options. They might slam the train into reverse and escape southwards towards MC4. What they do then is up to them; their shuttle is still at the starport. They might sneak into the city on foot or make a run later. In this case, the gunmen may well have moved on as they cannot risk getting caught by a patrol. Either way, the Travellers will find themselves in the city without an immediate guide to the situation. They may end up joining the dissidents anyway, or could witness events unfolding around them and take advantage.

##### MEETING THE DISSIDENTS

If the Travellers talk they may be surprised to be welcomed by the dissidents, who seem to know they are coming. As with others, they are worried about telepathic interrogation so will not give straight answers to questions. They will imply someone at MC4 sent them a package but remain vague about who even if the Travellers mention a name. The dissidents will be open about the projectiles and their intention to use them against the EPS headquarters.

The Travellers have a choice here. If they side with, or appear to side with, the dissidents they will be welcomed so long as they do not oppose the use of the projectiles. Their leader, a middle-aged Utolander who goes by the pseudonym of Longstop, is happy to discuss the situation. Indeed, he is positively enthusiastic and really does believe the Utolanders can come out of this situation better off than before.

Longstop's position is that Arden has been oppressing his people for too long and that this is a real opportunity for change. Zhodani occupation is a problem for another time; first he and his allies must get control of Utane. Then they will be able to negotiate from a position of strength. If Arden wants ore out of Utoland it will have to pay for it at a fair price. If not, maybe the Zhodani are in the market for mineral wealth? The future will take care of itself if the dissidents act now. The Zhodani Consulate is a distant threat to Longstop, while the Ardenites are the oppressors of his people.

Longstop outlines the position; his faction holds the north-west of the city, more or less. That means Old Town, New Town and the north-western rail and processing complexes. The usual Ardenite overlords are silent, suggesting that many were eliminated or captured, although he does not know for sure. He does know there is a de facto government operating out of Managerial Complex Four under the leadership of some grifter named Kialuurma. He seems to have the loyalty of about half of the EPS. The remainder is trying to stay out of it or securing installations and trying to stay out of it.

The plan Longstop outlines is for the Travellers to simply proceed through the city to the north-eastern corner. He and his gunmen will hide in the train, which may be able to pass without interference. If not, they will have to bluff or fight their way through. Longstop sees no other way to get the projectiles to the improvised launcher. The dissidents are pinning their hopes on them; with such

powerful weapons they can force a surrender. After that, the dissidents' leaders will cut a deal with the Zhodani. There is an edge of desperation to all of this but the plan might actually work. However, the Travellers will need to get through the city, which includes passing right through the middle of the main rail hub.

###### MAKING THE RUN

If the Travellers agree, they can begin their run through the city. Some areas have no power and there are fires and smoke here and there. Most people are under cover as much as possible. There is gunfire, mostly intermittent shots rather than the sounds of a pitched battle. As the Travellers approach the rail hub they will see it is mostly deserted but there are a few EPS troopers. Almost comically, as they approach the main junction area, the signal turns red. This is followed by a radio call for the Travellers to halt.

Up ahead is a handful of EPS troopers positioned along a loading platform the Travellers will have to pass by. Some are kneeling behind cover, some standing. Their leader is waving his arms signalling the Travellers to stop. Longstop and his gunmen cock their weapons but stay out of sight. It will be obvious to the Travellers that a potential bloodbath is in the offing. There are various ways of preventing this, if the Travellers want. The simplest option is to keep moving and hope nobody opens fire.

If the Travellers simply keep moving with no attempt to control the situation the EPS troopers will open fire on 10+ on a straight 2D check. Their first shots will be intended as warnings but the concealed gunmen will immediately retaliate. The gunmen will open fire on 9+ on 2D, with the same result. Once combat is joined, the two sides will fire on one another until they are out of range.

Even if the Travellers do not intend to stop they can impose a measure of control on the situation by signalling the EPS troops in some way. This could be by radio or a pantomime of gestures from the train. The EPS squad are scared and confused, and do not want to have to shoot at anyone, so convincing them to do nothing requires only a Routine (6+) Persuade or Deception check. Other skills may apply depending on what the Travellers do. The gunmen may still shoot but can be persuaded not to with

a little more difficulty. A solid argument, such as pointing out the dissidents' cause is better served by slipping quietly by, accompanied by an Average (8+) Persuade check, will suffice.

If the Travellers do stop, the EPS team will want to question them and search the train. The gunmen will ambush them unless the Travellers persuade them not to. This requires an assurance that the Travellers can handle the situation and even so there are hotheads who may open fire anyway unless the Travellers have given them a good reason for trust. The Travellers will then need to do something to prevent the EPS team from searching the train. Bribery or a good excuse will suffice, or the Travellers might tell the truth quietly and suggest the EPS team just back off for their own good. An Average (8+) Deception or Persuade check will work, dropping to Routine (6+) if an incentive like a bribe or survival is offered.

If a fight breaks out, the Travellers can end it by driving away. If they stay and fight, one side at least will take significant casualties. The numbers on each side are not specified here so that the Referee can tailor the situation to the needs of the adventure; typically about five to seven personnel on each

side is about right. Other resolutions are possible, such as the Travellers finding a way to hand over the dissidents to the EPS and trying to join their faction. If so they will discover this group is actually on the fence and just going through the motions of protecting the rail hub to stay out of the way.

If the Travellers decide to press on to the north-west industrial area they should have few problems and will be able to join the dissidents there. Longstop introduces the Travellers as friends of the revolution and unveils the cargo of projectiles they have brought. They are offered weapons if they are willing to join the fight. These are basic, being either generic small arms or possibly a spacer weapon or two. See p127 for details of these weapons.

If the Travellers prefer to go to Managerial Enclave Two and rejoin Peler, this is a simple matter of resetting a track junction or two; Enclave Two is heavily secured but Peler's name will obtain entry. Peler will be pleased the Travellers brought the projectiles to him instead of the dissidents and will offer the Travellers weapons if they are willing to pledge allegiance to the Committee for Offworld Relations. These weapons will be EPS issue or spacer type guns.

At this point the Travellers will be with one faction or the other ‚Äì or perhaps they have chosen to remain independent and are somewhere else in the city. What happens next will give them an opportunity to escape from Utoland. They may of course choose not to, fighting loyally with their new allies, in which case they will have to find another method of escape.

###### LONGSTOP

Longstop is a tall young man with an obvious talent for leadership. His immediate followers are very loyal and committed to overthrowing the Ardenite regime. Indeed, perhaps too committed. The leadership among the dissidents is divided on exactly what to do for the best but they are wise enough to try not to antagonise the Zhodani. Longstop and his followers, along with some other groups, actually think they can defeat the occupation force. This belief stems from the fact they have little idea how much an advantage combat armour and military weapons give the Zhodani. All they see is a handful of people in vacc suits flying about in air/rafts. This impression will change quickly if the Zhodani begin to take the rebellion seriously.

For the time being, Longstop and others like him are gung-ho, with big dreams of independence from Arden and no real idea what that means. The Travellers may be horrified at how na√Øve these people are and try to talk them out of doing anything rash, but this is an uphill struggle for several reasons. Longstop and his people are living a dream at present; finally lashing out at their oppressors. In addition, Longstop himself is something of a narcissist. In this world of conflict he is someone at last and will spend the lives of his followers to avoid going back to just being another forgotten Utolander. Travellers who try to argue for a moderate approach will find Longstop hostile, questioning their loyalty and even asking if they are spies or enemy agents.

Longstop's determination will wane as casualties mount but he is driven by ego as well as rage at the injustice of his existence. It is quite possible he will make a last stand or desperate final charge rather than surrender and inspire others to go with him. This could be the making of a legend; the myth that leads Utoland to freedom in 30 years' time. More likely it will just be more pointless bloodshed in a revolution that never stood a chance.

The battle for Utoland goes ahead whether the Travellers take part or not. It may be a backdrop to their own actions or they may be at its forefront. There is no obvious starting point; fighting has been ongoing for some time and gradually escalates into a full-scale street battle. Historians will probably choose the North Bridge Incident as the logical place to begin the narrative, although at the time it is overshadowed by other events.

The North Bridge Incident takes place about three kilometres north of Utane, at a point where the northern rail line crosses a shallow ravine. A train headed down from the northern settlements, carrying EPS personnel and a few volunteers hoping to earn promotions or a ticket offworld, is on the bridge when dissidents detonate explosives packed around the supports. These are mining charges, emplaced by people with little knowledge of demolitions work and succeed in damaging rather than destroying the bridge.

At this moment, the dissidents' plan ‚Äì such as it was

- begins to unravel. They had hoped to shock the EPS with the loss of this force, perhaps bringing about negotiations. Instead the train struggles off the bridge and limps on for another kilometre or so. As it grinds to a halt, EPS troopers and volunteers disembark and begin a laborious advance towards the northern edge of the city. This is a threat to the dissidents' key weapon; their projectile launcher.

If the Travellers join the dissidents, news of the failed demolition arrives soon after they deliver the projectiles. There is a rush to get them unloaded and positioned ready for launch but nobody seems to be sure what they should be fired at. Some, like Longstop, suggest spreading them between Managerial Enclave Two and the starport, doing as much damage as possible in the hope a ground attack can take control of the port. Others are more restrained, voting for a limited attack on Enclave Two and a demand for surrender.

The Travellers may be able to provide some input here, if they are persuasive or have impressed the dissidents. They may be able to persuade the dissidents to use some of the projectiles in a manner that furthers the Travellers' agenda as well as their own. Hitting the starport buildings will cause casualties among the Zhodani and guarantee a vigorous response but blowing a few holes in the wall surrounding the port might send a message the dissidents are worth negotiating with whilst not provoking retaliation. Whether or not the Travellers believe this, they may be able to sell the idea.

Blasting holes in the port wall gives the Travellers a means of entry. However, the projectiles are not very accurate. The Travellers may be able to help with that if they have appropriate skills or experience. Someone with experience of remotely guided weapons or probes may be able to rig up a guidance mechanism to greatly improve accuracy. Another way to use the projectiles would be to improvise a ground launcher ‚Äì a tube and some basic electronics will suffice ‚Äì and use direct fire from close range. The projectiles could also be detonated as bombs, either to demolish a wall or as booby traps. Finally, lying one on the ground and igniting its propellant will send it hurtling randomly across the countryside. How useful this is in a military sense is debatable but it will certainly attract attention.

###### THE EPS RESPONSE

Fearing another projectile attack, the EPS launches an attack towards Old Town and ultimately the northern processing works. This is slow-moving and rather disorganised, with ad-hoc squads moving on foot across the waste land and into the town. Resistance is slight at first but soon the EPS becomes entangled in bitter street fighting in Old Town.

# THE BATTLE OF UTOLAND

If the Travellers are working with Peler and the EPS, they may be part of this endeavour or perhaps sent as infiltrators to locate and disable the projectile launcher before it can be used again. Even if the Travellers did not deliver additional missiles, the dissidents will be able to locate a few more and use them against the EPS HQ. This may result in a badly aimed bracket pattern taking out part of the starport wall.

The fight becomes bogged down, which is a real problem for Peler and his supporters. They have somewhat better training and firepower but the dissidents have heavy artillery which must be silenced. The situation remains fluid for a while, with the EPS making small gains. The Travellers might experience this in a variety of ways. They may be involved in the street fighting, either directly or as they try to evacuate casualties, cross a disputed area, or pursue whatever goals they have at that time.

As night falls, Old Town is lit by numerous fires and muzzle flashes, with the occasional streak of rocket exhaust as another projectile is launched. The fate of Utane and therefore Utoland, is as yet undecided but it seems the EPS is failing to break through. Ultimately that means defeat and governance of Utoland by the dissidents. Unless the Zhodani occupation force decides to take a hand....

###### THE ZHODANI RESPONSE

Officer of One Hundred Dliklpidl Ontdidkrete ‚Äì Captain Onkrete ‚Äì is charged with securing Utoland, which explicitly means the starport and implicitly whatever supporting infrastructure is required. He has no interest in who controls the primitive shanty-town that is Utane so long as it is capable of basic functions in support of the port. However, there is a limit to how long he can stand by and let the locals tear one another apart. It has suited his purposes to let the fighting run its course but at midnight he decides it is time to act.

The defensive element of Onkrete's force remains at the starport, whilst his security element is deployed forward. A little while after combat-armoured troopers begin advancing across along the rail line to the central hub, Onkrete issues a blanket order for all combatants to lay down their arms. Some get the message and

obey; most do not receive it or choose to ignore the command. There are those who are too hotly engaged to obey even if they want to. Onkrete does not care; anyone with a gun is now a hostile.

The Zhodani advance in their teams of 10, some of them with warbots. A Ten breaks off at the central rail hub to secure it. One advances towards Managerial Enclave Two. Another begins escorting noncombatants from the startown and marshalling them at the starport. Those who fear they are about to be executed flee into the night. The Zhodani let them go unless they are armed. Fools who try to evade the troops sent to protect them are not Onkrete's problem.

Now just two Tens plus a handful of air/rafts continue the advance. Onkrete is confident they are enough; they have combat armour and night vision equipment, against untrained civilians with pistols. Speakers mounted on the troopers' armour broadcast orders to throw down weapons and disperse. Anyone with a weapon is fired upon without warning and concussion grenades are liberally used.

Missile launcher teams have begun engaging projectiles from the starport. This is not what they were designed for, and performance is patchy, but some projectiles are intercepted. Someone takes exception to this and sends the next one at the starport. This changes everything. Up to this point Onkrete was intending to separate the combatants but now he has a planetary rebellion on his hands. EPS and dissident personnel continue shooting at one another but gradually both come to see the Zhodani as the enemy.

The devastation wrought in Old Town is incredible. Some structures are collapsed by concussion grenades; some are set on fire. Non-combatants flee in all directions. The Zhodani troopers are highly professional; the only noncombatants hit by laser fire are accidents. Highly trained soldiers with excellent targeting systems, trying very hard not to kill civilians, are largely successful. However, there are some fatalities and many more injuries.

Onkrete issues a call over the local comms net for anyone willing to assist in evacuation of casualties or rendering medical assistance. His soldiers will guarantee the safety of anyone responding. A couple

of Zhodani combat medics are doing their best but they are swamped. If the Travellers take the time to think about it, they will see Onkrete is really doing his best to save lives but at the same time is intent on ruthlessly putting down any resistance.

Zhodani combat armour is largely immune to small arms fire but there are still a few casualties. Most are due to secondary causes such as structural collapses but occasionally a group of hostiles manages to pour in enough firepower that someone gets a lucky shot. There is no front line here; the Zhodani force is driving through Old Town headed for the projectile launch point.

Onkrete intends to crunch his way through all resistance if necessary but has a more subtle plan in mind. Whilst attention is on his ground force, his air/ rafts will dash around the periphery of the city and enter the processing works from the north. Unless the Travellers oppose this, the operation will be a success. With the dissidents engaged by EPS forces to their north the launcher is more or less unguarded. It is the work of moments to land a small force, drive off the defenders and destroy the launcher.

However, this operation does not pass without incident. An air/raft clips a structure and goes out of control. The crew are injured in the crash but the vehicle remains flyable. As soon as the dissidents notice they will begin closing in, hoping to take hostages. The Travellers may intervene if they are close enough. What they do depends on their character and their agenda. They may be interested only in the air/raft, or may try to rescue the soldiers aboard it and fly them to safety. Alternatively, they may try to persuade the dissidents not to harm the injured Zhodani, which will require disarming the Zhodani themselves. These soldiers are hurt and in a desperate position. Most are incapacitated but one has dragged himself upright and is prepared to defend his comrades until help comes or he is overrun.

This incident will place the Travellers in possession of an air/raft which could be used to cross the starport wall and reach their shuttle. If its transponder is working it will be challenged but not initially fired upon.

The Travellers may be able to get to their ship before anyone realises the vehicle has been commandeered. Alternatively, if they signal the starport that they are bringing in wounded, they will be granted safe passage. Being honest and stating they are offworlders fleeing the fighting will result in permission to land at the port, although there will be wary soldiers from the defensive element of the occupation company waiting for them.

###### UTOLAND ENDGAME

The fight for Utoland is a foregone conclusion once the Zhodani joined in. By dawn, resistance has been broken and most of the surviving combatants rounded up. The offworld starship crews at Enclave Two are transferred to the starport 'for their own safety' ‚Äì this statement is actually true ‚Äì and the survivors of the Committee for Offworld Relations have been summoned as well.

Many expect savage reprisals but instead Captain Onkrete places the COR in a conference room with captured dissident leaders and instructs them to come up with a plan to mitigate the suffering and rebuild the town, and in the longer term find a way to restore order in Utane. Anyone who lays down their arms will be permitted to go back to their lives, although active enemies will be dealt with. Although he does not explicitly say so, Onkrete considers what happened last night a fair fight which the locals lost. If they accept that, he has no animosity towards them so long as they accept the situation.

There are those who will not. Longstop is among them, continuing to agitate for further resistance. Some elements of the EPS are in agreement, since the Zhodani fired on them, too. The Ardenite leadership want a restoration of the previous situation and resent the shifting of social order that will inevitably result. Most ordinary people just want to rebuild their lives and maybe become a little better off. How this plays out may or may not be influenced by the Travellers and indeed it could be some time before they find out what the end result was. In the meantime they have several chances to get off Utoland and a pressing need to do so.

Leaving Utoland requires getting to the ship's boat and taking control of it. Anyone with shipboard skills whose overlaid personality denies them will be confused to find they recognise control systems and know the procedures for using them. They also know the location of Rock Twelve, although only as a place they need to go. However, before they do so they have to get into the starport and reach their shuttle.

## SNEAKING IN

The starport is well secured by the defensive contingent of the occupation force but there is a battle going on and the situation is confused. It might be possible to sneak in either through a wall breach made by the dissidents' projectiles or a pre-existing secret entry point. The locals may know of a disused service tunnel or a way used by smugglers which can be exploited.

It is night during most of the battle but the occupation force has thermal sensors built into its combat armour and will see people moving around in the open. It may still be possible to sneak past by taking advantage of distractions; there are plenty of them but the most notable is the arrival of evacuees from the startown. The Zhodani have decided to move all offworlders to the starport, mainly out of concern for their welfare but also to keep them under control. Once the move is complete the troops assigned to escort the evacuees will join the fight for Old Town.

The Travellers might be able to take advantage of this distraction to sneak past. Alternatively they may be able to join the evacuees and simply walk in through the front gates. The guards' combat armour sensors can recognise individuals but only if they have been entered on the system. Typically this means a trooper triggering an alert flag or a recognition token at some point. At this point the Travellers may be known to the authorities but if they can prevent a sensor suite getting a good look at them they will be able to pass. Once inside, the evacuees are crowded into the starport buildings. It may be possible to slip away whilst everyone is distracted.

# LEAVING UTOLAND

## RUSHING IN

If the Travellers have taken control of an air/raft they can dash over the walls. They will not be fired upon if they have a Zhodani transponder, although they will be queried and then ordered to land close to the port buildings. If they still proceed towards the ships a squad will be sent to investigate and may open fire if they realise the Travellers are infiltrators. The Travellers may end up dashing through a storm of laser carbine bolts to reach their ship and make a hurried take off. Dashing on foot through a wall breach is more risky, although if the Travellers can create or take advantage of some distraction they may be able to get close before being spotted. The end result is similar to the situation with an air/raft.

## ASKING NICELY

If the Travellers come into contact with Captain Onkrete, whether by radio or directly, they could try asking for access to their shuttle. Perhaps surprisingly, this will be granted if the Travellers are not wanted as enemies of the Zhodani. There is nowhere in the system for them to go as far as Onkrete knows and perhaps their actions will shed light on the mysterious boat. In any case, it will be a few less offworlders to look after and right now he has bigger things than a handful of people to think about.

This is perhaps the least satisfying of the possible ways the Travellers could gain access to their boat but the adventure requires they get there. More interesting variants include bargaining, if the Travellers have brought in Zhodani wounded, or an agreement to pick up casualties. In this case a couple of soldiers will be sent with the Travellers to their boat and will have to be dealt with or evaded.

## LEAVING UTOLAND

The Travellers might come up with some entirely different method of getting to their ship; quite possibly a hugely convoluted plan or dubious deal with one of the local leaders. What is important is that having witnessed the fight for control of Utane the Travellers are able to launch their boat, break orbit and head for the location of... that thing they feel compelled to find.

###### BOARDING ROCK TWELVE

Once they get offworld and head towards Rock Twelve, they will find that it looks like an ordinary planetoid. It does not strike any memory chords, largely because they have never studied it from the outside. The ship's boat makes an automated approach, getting alarmingly close to the planetoid before a concealed cover slides away and reveals a docking space. This feels familiar to the Travellers.

Rock Twelve is dark and cold, with no power to its systems outside the bridge. Doors and valves stand open. Air is not being circulated and water has been pumped back to its storage tanks. Nothing that requires power works. The Travellers will recognise chambers as they enter them, along with personal effects and equipment, but are unsure why. They may begin to wonder if there is something else inside the ship with them, but they are alone. The Referee can play for as much tension as seems appropriate during the exploration of the ship, but sooner or later the Travellers will reach the bridge.

There is obviously a removable data core missing. Inserting the one the Travellers have will allow it to feed its codes into the computers of Rock Twelve. Systems begin a soft power-up almost immediately, and the Travellers will have command access. They can accelerate the powering up process if they like but this will increase emissions and make detection more likely.

Once the Travellers find the personality overlay machine, they will instantly recognise it. It can only be used by one Traveller at a time but all know that a session in the machine will reveal the answers they have been seeking. In the meantime they find the ship has sufficient fuel for a two-parsec jump which will take them to the Tremous Dex system. There, they will have to refuel before making the final transit to Extolay Naval base. Wise Travellers will want to arrive with sufficient fuel for another jump, just in case, which makes a refuelling in the 871-483 outsystem desirable. They have been out of the loop for a while and will now know much about the progress of the war, so would be well advised to tread carefully.

After removing their personality overlays, or being aboard Rock Twelve for a few days, the Travellers experience a feeling of disorientation and extremely vivid memories, or perhaps a weirdly lucid dream. They are recalling their participation in Operation Kasuesh, which will be played out as an adventure. The Travellers may experience other flashbacks later. Some of these will be bits and pieces of their own memories clashing with remnants of the overlaid personality, but it is possible the Travellers could experience something that happened to someone else who has used the overlay machine.

It is not possible to say whether events actually occurred as the Travellers 'remember' them. Most memories will be close to the truth but the personality overlay machine causes Travellers to fill in details from their imagination. One consequence of this is that a Traveller who dies or is maimed in a memory sequence may not have been so badly hurt. Travellers should not be allowed to 'game' this mechanic by getting out of impossible situations. A Traveller who vividly recalls being shot eight times yet is alive and well may be troubled by nightmares afterward, or may start asking some very deep questions. Are they actually who they think they are, or a replacement with an overlaid personality? Did the Zhodani reprogramme the Travellers to think the agent now impersonating their comrade is the real thing? The Referee can make use of this as necessary.

The Travellers will recall being asked to carry out a sensitive task ‚Äì or offered the chance to do it as an alternative to being punished for some misdeed they may or may not have committed. There was a period of hurried preparation then a dash across the DMZ in an Imperial Navy cruiser. The Travellers boarded a civilian vessel under their assumed identities and travelled to Ninjar. As an entry point to the Zhodani Consulate, Ninjar's orbital port has good security screening but the Travellers passed through without difficulty. They were even able to smuggle in some concealed weapons, although nothing more potent than a body pistol.

A quick search of the arrivals database showed a nondescript ship's boat with the right transponder code landed at the planetside port facility. Riket was obviously on-planet. The Travellers took a shuttle down and began looking for him. At that point their mission became a lot more complicated....

## NINJAR

Ninjar is a low-value world in economic and political terms, although it serves as a link between the cluster of worlds around Querion and the remainder of the Zhodani Consulate. Its extensive starport sees a great deal of through traffic, with a large Imperial trade mission handling most high-volume transactions between the Consulate and Imperial worlds to trailing.

The orbital port is also something of a fortress and acts as a base for multiple squadrons of system defence boats. The main defensive force is stationed at a separate base, away from the prying eyes of Imperial visitors to the port. The Consular Navy is always careful to keep a cruiser or two within sensor range of the highport as a remainder of the Consulate's naval power.

The mainworld is directly governed from the naval base, with most services provided by a civilian bureaucracy answering to the military governor. Society is as stratified as anywhere else, with nobles being the ruling class, intendants in the most important jobs and proles making up the bulk of the workforce. The need to be psionically talented in order to take certain posts does means that some talented people are disqualified for reasons unconnected with their professional competence. Social manipulation reduces disaffection, however. Travellers who are concerned about the injustice of a social system based on possession of psionics talents may find it interesting to compare with Imperial society. The Zhodani system restricts those who are not born with psionic abilities but is open about it; the Imperial version makes it extremely difficult for those born into families without wealth, noble titles and connections to advance beyond a certain point but is less forthright about the presence of a glass ceiling.

Most of the population are concentrated in a single city, also named Ninjar, with a few outlying settlements fulfilling specialist purposes. Around four million dwell in the city, which is rather drab and utilitarian by Imperial standards. Not all Zhodani cities are like this but Ninjar is more of a military outpost than a homeworld. Its structures are clustered under domes linked by transit tubes at ground level as well as above and below. Grav vehicles are common, often zipping over a building cluster from one high-level transit tube to another.

Technology is uniform at TL12, with most items available to everyone. Most have only what they need but every household has labour-saving devices. Electronic equipment is more utilitarian than in the Imperium, with devices typically providing only needed functions such as communication or mathematical calculations. Games and distractions are uncommon. The overall impression is that the poorer elements of society are better off than in the Imperium but even the most affluent proles have fewer possessions than an Imperial citizen. If wealth is measured in terms of possession or property, the proles of Ninjar are poorer than an average Imperial city.

Despite the obvious inequality between the classes and lack of consumer goods to keep the populace distracted, society is, for the most part, peaceable and content. There are security personnel here and there but very little crime or disruption. Imperial visitors are struck by how orderly and quiet everything is. There is no blaring music or garish advertising to attract attention and people are overwhelmingly considerate in their dealings with others. This can be comforting to some visitors and frightening to others. There is something just plain wrong about a starport concourse without the lights and sounds of consumerism vying for attention.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

###### THE CITY OF NINJAR

The city of Ninjar can be considered to have five main districts, each under one or more semi-opaque environment domes. Within each cluster the domes are linked by tubes. The terrain between them is little more than barren rock, with the occasional crater or dust lake for variety. There are no ground links between the districts; everything is moved by grav transport. Trucks and buses provide a reliable service between districts.

##### MILITARY DISTRICT (1) The military district is covered by the largest dome. It houses personnel and equipment belonging to both the system defence force and the army units stationed on Ninjar, and is off-limits to non-military personnel. The district has its own dedicated landing area (2), with shuttles and small starships constantly coming and going.

##### STARPORT (3) Ninjar's downport is much less impressive than its orbital facility. It consists of a large landing area with service bays recessed into the surface. Automated vehicles ‚Äì most of them wheeled ‚Äì convey personnel to the main port buildings (3a) and cargo to the warehousing and freight handling centre (3b). Ninjar does not receive large amounts of offworld goods and has virtually no exports. As a result, the civilian port and its associated facilities are far less busy than the military port.

THE GREAT DOME/IAVROPR (4)
The Great Dome, known in Zdetl as Iavropr, is constructed in an impact crater, with naturally occurring walls supporting its sides. It is the main food production centre of the city, with large expanses of hydroponic gardens and even some meadow space for livestock. Access is restricted to those who work or have legitimate business in the dome.

THE EARLY CLUSTER/ ZDABRIEVLJEBL (5)

The Early Cluster consists of six large domes and many more smaller ones, which originally housed the entire population of the city. As the population increased more domes were added, until the creation of new districts was required. The largest of the cluster's domes is still a food-production centre, although part of it has been given over to parkland and a small forest.

THE THREE DOMES/OFJDEVEPR (6)

The Three Domes is a newer residential district consisting of three linked environmental domes. Buildings inside the domes are similar to those elsewhere in the city, with noble, intendants and proles living in each. There are no noble- only enclaves on Ninjar; the entire population is integrated according to Zhodani norms. However, noble dwellings are rather obviously larger and more comfortable than the homes of proles.

THE SPECIALIST FACILITIES/EQRIE IANSHIESHE (7)

Specialist facilities are segregated into their own separate district, access to which is restricted. Facilities include the headquarters of the planetary security force, a confinement/re-education centre, disaster-relief depot and the world's main hospital. Districts have clinics but serious cases are transferred here for isolation and treatment. Co-location with the re-education centre is not coincidental.

THE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT/ISH NAZZDINBRAB (8)

Most of Ninjar's industry is concentrated in one large dome and some outlying smaller ones. Most of the output is for self-support, with virtually nothing exported. Vehicles are maintained and repaired here, tools manufactured and items necessary to maintaining the domes fabricated. Access is not restricted but few who do not live or work in this area would want to visit. As a result, Travellers wandering around will attract attention.

###### SEARCHING FOR RIKET

It should be obvious to the Travellers that they cannot simply charge in and grab Riket, even if they can locate him. They are going to need a plan to extract him. There is an obvious means of escape in the form of the ship's boat from Rock Twelve, currently sitting in a maintenance bay at the starport. The Travellers have been given access codes for the vessels, so all they need to do is find Riket, go to the boat and take off. It may turn out this is a rather strange definition of 'all'.

The Travellers are going to interact with numerous Zhodani citizens. They may be expecting brainwashed drones who endlessly repeat their programming but in fact the people the Travellers meet are anything but that. Interaction with nobles is unlikely during day-to-day activities but the Travellers may encounter intendants in senior positions. The average prole is

##### Ninjar

cheerful and hard-working, and very happy to help someone who asks for aid. Almost everyone likes their job or is fulfilled by it and there is almost no petty backbiting among colleagues. Travellers who look closely will see there are those who do not conform to this norm but they are very much in the minority.

Everyone dresses soberly, with considerable variation on basic themes but only within moderate limits. People are courteous in conversation, listening rather than talking over each other and have few other anti- social habits. The overall impression is of a clean and orderly living space, in which there are more people engaged in social activities than solo ones. For example, a typical prole is more likely to be taking part in a sporting activity or group singing than sitting at home watching vid dramas.

There is a definite wariness of outsiders, especially those who come from worlds where lying and thievery are commonplace ‚Äì the impression most Zhodani have of the Imperium ‚Äì but on the whole the Zhodani of Ninjar are pleasant to interact with. If asked, they do not venture bad opinions of their superiors or way of life, although some are carefully neutral in what they say.

Interactions with security personnel are similar in character. They are polite and professional but also well aware that outsiders commit vastly more crimes than their own people and remain vigilant at all times. They are careful to make sure that visitors are constantly reminded about their presence, usually a matter of being visible and occasionally walking up and offering helpful advice on what the local amenities are. The Travellers might wonder why the police keep approaching them to provide information on the best places to eat or be entertained. The truth is it is in part to observe their behaviour and reactions, and in part to remind the Travellers they are being watched.

These security personnel are unarmed, acting as observers more than enforcers. They have weapons and armed backup available, and there is a military base just minutes away, but the Zhodani mindset holds that it is better to remind people that enforcement is available than to have to use it. Intervention in the case of non-violent transgressions might take the form of a security officer informing the miscreants of their 'error' and fining them a ridiculously small amount of money or waiving the penalty entirely in the case of minor matters.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

The Travellers might be offered a 'social orientation' course, which sounds sinister but is in fact just a surprisingly informative and quite entertaining guide to how to avoid making 'errors' in day-to-day life. There is no psionic component to this course. Attendance is not mandatory in the case of very minor offences, although choosing not to attend is a reason for the authorities to become more suspicious. Mandatory attendance is imposed for repeat offenders ('serial-error-makers').

If the Travellers attend one of these courses they will find it quite relaxed, with a security service 'compliance facilitator' interacting with them and any locals present in a friendly manner. Anti-social and minor criminal behaviour is ridiculed in some cases, in a gentle 'what was that guy thinking? He must be so embarrassed!' sort of way. More serious offences are spoken of with pity for the perpetrator, who was clearly suffering to have carried out an anti-social act of this nature.

Travellers making a nuisance of themselves will be given a straight warning or arrested and deported. Serious criminals will be imprisoned awaiting a trial that is more an explanation of why they cannot be tolerated than an attempt to prove guilt. They will be shipped off to a specialist facility that deals with people too ill to function in a polite society. When they emerge they will have been re-educated and might have even been programmed to act as Zhodani agents. Truly irredeemable criminals are executed for the good of society and to end their own suffering. There is no malice or hate in such a deed, only regret that this troubled person could not be saved.

###### AT THE STARPORT

Like anyone else arriving from outside the Consulate, the Travellers will be questioned when they pass through the port security zone. Questions are politely phrased and not out of the ordinary:

- What is your name?
- What is your reason for entering the Zhodani
    Consulate?
- How long do you intend to stay on Ninjar?
- What are your plans upon leaving?

This is all standard stuff and the Travellers really should be prepared for it. Security staff at the port have no idea a major war is about to break out, although some of their superiors might have been told to watch for infiltrators more diligently than usual. Any plausible set

of responses will suffice. Simple and natural answers will be more convincing than a nervous attempt to talk the staff into letting the Traveller in. There is no routine telepathic scanning at the starport, although the Travellers may not realise that.

Once through customs the Travellers, like everyone else, will be free to enter the city and conduct their business. Their comms will be updated with a temporary 'visitor' tag which gives access to the datanets and electronic transactions. Without it, the Travellers cannot buy food or pass through the access points between domes. This tag does not give access to restricted areas. Anyone who claims they have lost their comms will be given a key fob- like device with the same function and directed to a nearby electronics vendor who has the latest Imperial models in stock as well as Zhodani ones.

###### SEEKING INFORMATION

Assuming they manage to stay out of trouble, the first thing the Travellers will need is information. They are in the Zhodani Consulate now but some things are reassuringly familiar ‚Äì at least until the Travellers look deeper. Datanet terminals allow the user to select Galanglic or Zdetl. Selecting Galanglic brings up an Imperial-style interface which permits visitor-level access to the nets. This provides common information in a readily digestible form which is just slightly different from the Imperial standard. Travellers with a background in sociology or psychology may realise this is due to a lack of product bias ‚Äì there is no clever embedded message or manipulative text intended to guide the user's thinking towards a product or corporation.

The Travellers may notice something odd about the datanet content without being able to enunciate it. If he is with them, Riket will point out as if it were obvious that the Zhodani do not embed advertising and product- placement in their information. Riket approves, saying this is less socially manipulative than an honest re- education programme.

If the Travellers can read Zdetl, or think to use the translation software on their comms, they are granted prole-level access. Intendent- and noble-level access are both greyed out unless the individual is identified as belonging to the relevant social class. The forbidden

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

levels of access are not concealed. A Zhodani citizen would say this is as it should be ‚Äì there is no need to conceal what everyone knows and it is right and proper that the higher echelons of society have access to the information quality they need and deserve.

Prole- or visitor-level access allows the Travellers to look over ship and shuttle arrivals but not who was on each. The Travellers will be aware that Riket's shuttle landed a few days ago but cannot find out any more than that without a higher level of access. Asking around is unlikely to produce much directly useful information, as the port is busy with people coming and going. Bribery will almost certainly fail and in any case there is still no information to be had. However, Travellers who ask the right questions may be directed to an individual named Zdetla, who takes an interest in offworlders. Zdetla lives in the Three Domes district and can be found most days in one of its small parks.

###### GETTING AROUND TOWN

There are regular grav buses between districts, requiring only the presentation of a visitor-tagged comm. Once within a district the Travellers can use the pedestrian link tubes between domes like anyone else. Access to restricted areas requires special permission, which is unlikely to be granted. The Travellers have no reason to access these areas and cannot rely on simple options such as bribery to obtain permission.

The only viable option would be to find and blackmail an official who has something to hide, or to create an elaborate deception where someone believed the Travellers needed access. This would be quite an undertaking but fortunately the Travellers do not need to enter these areas.

###### A DAY IN THE PARK

Zdetla can be found most days in a park, possibly in the company of several other locals. He is an artist and a poet, which might surprise some Travellers. Most of his days are spent at what could be described as an impromptu picnic, provided by whoever comes by. He chats with people, performs some of his poetry and paints. Zdetla's painting style is apparently slap-dash and not very competent, until he is almost finished. Even then, what he paints is a stylised and distorted image which is somehow reminiscent of the subject without being representative of them.

Likewise, Zdetla's poetry is overall not all that good, although he has moments of brilliance. His inspiration comes from the mundane stories he hears during interactions with friends and fans. Although poems about the antics of a household pet or the day someone tripped over a cleaning robot are hardly great works of fiction, they are amusing and performed well.

There is a deeper element within both Zdetla's words and his images. He is a very sensitive individual, though not psionic, and has a way of finding truths about someone as he creates. Most of his paintings show individuals who are content or trying to be, but there are a handful which seem oddly distorted. If asked about these, Zdetla confesses he wondered about that too. Some of the people he painted realised they were deeply troubled, as Zdetla once was. Most asked for re-education and of course received it. Zdetla has paintings of a couple afterward and in both cases the distortion is gone. He cannot explain why this is and says that neither can the Tavrchedl' operatives he asked about it. Their best explanation ‚Äì which is probably correct ‚Äì is that Zdetla has a natural eye for the little 'tells' people have and correlates them with his own experience of a troubled early life.

If the Travellers ask about people in the paintings, most are locals but one ‚Äì who has a particularly distorted aspect ‚Äì is a visitor. Zdetla knows him simply as Carlos and has painted him three times. Each time the image became more distorted. This is because Riket's personality overlay is beginning to downgrade. Zdetla does not know what he is painting but is becoming concerned about Riket's welfare. He has urged Riket to seek re-education but was refused.

Zdetla will not say much more without getting something in return. What he wants is stories; something to write poems about over the next few days. He will absolutely insist the Travellers tell him a tale about their lives. This might be awkward but Zdetla is expecting to be told about doing battle with the galley microwave and similar daily trials. The Travellers need not tell him about great events or exciting space adventures to get his attention. He will also want to paint them, which could be a problem. Their overlaid personalities are quite new but Zdetla's paintings may reveal the Travellers are 'distorted' somehow.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

This interaction takes place over a few hours, interspersed with locals coming and going, and a recital of a work-in-progress poem by Zdetla. The Travellers are introduced to several locals, all of whom are just regular folks living ordinary lives. Most work in the hydroponic gardens or the world's industrial centre, or as junior administrators. They have children, and pets, and domestic robots that do not always function as intended ‚Äì but are still better than having to do the job manually.

Vlabridl, Miepletlzhdobl, Qledreyo, Fians, Afrnostiapl, Rieqlzhefrsheizh, Chazhfetsjanz, Venshshtianszdenzh, Banshe and Tsiklaqlzhdav. These are the 'Zhos' or 'Joes' the Imperium is worried about. Just ordinary folks with ordinary lives and ‚Äì in almost all cases ‚Äì a glass that is slightly more than half full. The Travellers may look back on this moment later, when the fighting has begun, and wonder just who the enemy really is. Or they may despise and resent the noble class that re- educated these people into blindly following them.

For now, it would appear that the most important thing is to find Riket. That is surprisingly easy. A local named Jdablia says her friend is giving him lodgings. He writes a lot, often wandering around her apartment talking through his latest screed with her, or possibly himself. Apparently, he is a journalist of some kind who seems oddly fascinated with daily life. Anyway, Jdablia says she can go and fetch him, or give the Travellers the location. He is over in the next dome, just a short bus ride away....

###### ZDETLA

Zdetla is what he seems; a happy prole who has found his place in life. It was not always so. In his youth he was troubled by inappropriate aspirations. He wanted to be a musician but simply lacked the talent. His social advisor tried to help him find a different outlet but he became obsessed. He was disruptive to his team working in the hydroponic gardens and eventually began to steal items. After repeatedly refusing assistance he was arrested by the Tavrchedl'

- the 'Guardians of Our Morality', or 'thought police' as the Imperials call them.

The Tavrchedl' took Zdetla for evaluation and treatment, and it soon became apparent he was on a dangerous path. His thievery was escalating, despite having no use for most of what he took. It was obvious he was trying to fill a hole inside himself, a hole

If Zdetla is persuaded or given what he wants, he will reveal that 'Carlos' is a rather nosy fellow, given to fussing over minor details, who seems unable to fathom the mysteries of the local grav-bus timetable. Zdetla has written a poem about that. He does not know where Carlos is staying but can ask one of his friends to find out. Zdetla is genuinely concerned about 'Carlos' and asks the Travellers to make sure he seeks therapy for whatever is ailing him.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

created by too much Imperial media. Zdetl wanted to be a famous music star but had no talent. At the same time, he did have a creative soul and was unhappy working in the gardens. A course of psionic and psychological treatment put him on a better path.

Zdetla was re-educated to have smaller ambitions in the creative field and taught to paint by the nearest thing Ninjar had to an artist-in-residence. He developed a rather odd style but one that produced interesting results. Likewise, despite the best online courses available Zdetla became a mediocre poet at best. However, it was enough. Now he spends his days creating art and poetry, visited by his friends and the odd curious offworlder. He is a very minor celebrity but feels fulfilled.

The Travellers might be surprised (or perhaps horrified) to find that Zdetla considers his original aspirations as a sickness and talks about the people who re-educated him the same way someone else might speak of the surgeon who saved their life. His re-education was not brainwashing; it was therapy to help him let go of an unattainable aspiration that was making him miserable, combined with guidance on where better to channel his aspirations and training to help him achieve them. This may shed a different light on re-education, although it is possible to decide that 'they took away his right to be miserable and self-destructive'.

###### EXTRACTING RIKET

It may be that the biggest obstacle to extracting Riket... is Riket himself. His overlay persona wants to stay and study the locals for his big article, then head deeper into the Consulate for more data. His subconscious is having a wonderful time as well. So far, Zhodani society is everything he hoped it would be. Psionically enhanced social sciences have created a contented and productive society without the cacophony of cross-cutting agendas found in the Imperium ‚Äì at least, as far as Riket sees it. There is no rampant consumerism, no anti-social agenda pushed through music or entertainment. Everyone is happy and everything is so... orderly.

There is some basis to Riket's impression, although he is most definitely seeing what he wants to see and ignoring hints that not everything is as pleasant as it seems. However, the main problem is that he does not want to leave and can see no reason to do so. Telling him to come along with them will get the Travellers nowhere. They always have the option to

eliminate him if he will not cooperate. The Travellers may or may not be willing to do that but whatever they decide will have repercussions in the future. Ideally, from the Imperial standpoint, they will find a way to convince him to leave with them.

Talking Riket round will not be easy and should not be accomplished with a single skill check. The Travellers may make a logical case or appeal to his emotions, although in that case they are up against the fact that he is living his dream at present. Zdetla's paintings will help here, if the Travellers can figure out that they represent an increasingly dark and troubled psyche. There is no reason the Travellers cannot use parts of the truth, perhaps telling Riket he is a secret Imperial agent who has been brainwashed by the Zhodani and they are the extraction team. Telling him about the personality overlay is risky, since he may be scanned whilst thinking about it.

Intimidation is also an option. Neither Riket's own personality nor his overlay is particularly brave, so threats will work ‚Äì at least in the short term. Again, he will be thinking about his fear and may be scanned, or may attempt to escape from the Travellers if it seems viable. Trickery is a better option, perhaps convincing Riket he needs to show the Travellers something in his ship. This could help fool any telepaths at the starport, since Riket may sincerely believe he is just popping back to the ship with his new friends to get a few items he needs for his next round of observations. If he believes this is the situation and the Travellers connive for him to be the one scanned, they may be able to just walk out the front door.

If Riket chooses to leave at least semi-willingly, he and the Travellers could take a grav-bus back to the starport and fly away. It really is that simple, although the Travellers may find a way to overcomplicate matters. An unwilling Riket, or escape after killing him, represents a greater level of complexity. He will have to be smuggled into the starport, or else the Travellers will have to make a dash to their ship. Both are possible if the Travellers are bold and determined.

Smuggling an unwilling Riket will probably involve drugging him in some way. The Travellers may have thought to bring something suitable but if not a Very Difficult (12+) Medical or Science (chemistry) check will permit them to throw together a dose from what is available. They will need some laboratory equipment, which will have to be jury-rigged from whatever they can lay their hands on. Riket will suffer 1D damage per point of negative Effect, with each dice of damage

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

being applied after an interval of 2D minutes. Further pharmachemical experimentation may be required to keep him alive if the first drug has bad results. The check to determine if the drug is safe should be made when it is administered.

Alternative methods of keeping Riket quiet are more basic and direct, such as bashing him over the head and hoping he remains unconscious long enough to reach the ship but does not suffer ill effects. A carefully judged blow with an improvised cosh would work. If Riket is caught unawares, he will be rendered unconscious on a successful Difficult (10+) Melee check, again suffering 1D damage per point of negative Effect. How long he remains out is difficult to predict using such direct methods. He might come round at a most inopportune time.

Other options include giving Riket something to make him feel unwell without rendering him unconscious. This is tricky; if the illness seems too severe he will be whisked away to hospital by the local authorities and in any case a medical check might be required at the starport or some other point of contact with the security services. After all, offworlders do occasionally bring unpleasant contagions with them.

The Travellers are likely to have to blag their way through security checkpoints, perhaps smuggling Riket or transporting him in an 'unwell' state. If they are telepathically scanned, any lies they tell will be revealed. However, it is sometimes possible to fool the person scanning. The ability to read surface thoughts is just that ‚Äì the user can 'hear' and 'feel' the thoughts uppermost in the Traveller's mind. An intendant making a cursory check may move on before anything deeper is revealed, especially if there are distractions such as clumsy Travellers knocking things over during the scan.

To deceive an attempt to read surface thoughts the Traveller may make an opposed check using their Deception against the psion's Telepathy, with DMs for distractions and if the reading is rushed. The trick is to keep innocuous thoughts in mind without it seeming like the Traveller is doing so deliberately. This takes a certain amount of mental discipline, although it can happen inadvertently if someone is focused on a task or suddenly distracted. Zhodani generally find it distasteful to be in the grubby minds of outsiders and may not notice intentions concealed under a fa√ßade of looking forward to tonight's meal or being apprehensive about some filthy Zho mind-reader brainwashing the Traveller.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

It will be possible to use deception to get through the port. The alternative is to obtain grav transport and dash to the ship. This is a bit brute-force and will result in the Travellers' ship being pursued. Of course, since this is a memory sequence they obviously got away but the Travellers might recall being shot down over the starport then being aboard Rock Twelve with no explanation of the discrepancy. That might make an interesting future adventure, as the Travellers try to figure out what really happened.

###### A DISTRACTION

The Travellers may receive some unintentional help from the locals and from the Zhodani authorities themselves. The monitoring and re-education programme is not infallible and some citizens become adept at hiding their anti-social thoughts. There are not all that many telepaths monitoring the populace, so those who understand their patterns and areas of operation can avoid being scanned for long periods. Scans are fleeting and routine unless there is an alert triggered by other circumstances such as erratic behaviour reported by a concerned neighbour.

Although the Imperials think there are telepaths scanning everyone all the time in the Consulate, this is simply not the case. Routine scanning is tiring, tedious work best compared to driving around in an unmarked traffic enforcement vehicle. The chances of being picked up on a routine scan are higher in sensitive areas but ordinarily the chances of being scanned are no greater than encountering that enforcement vehicle. If the individual's thoughts are innocuous at the time of the scan, they will escape notice in the

same manner that someone who tends to drive too fast may sometimes meet an enforcement vehicle at a time when they are not misbehaving. Some people speed routinely and get lucky, never encountering enforcement. Others make one transgression and get caught. So it is with telepathic monitoring.

In this case, the brothers Vebrvrenzhi and Detsdriabr Zhdrdii are a tragic example of how some people go so far off the rails that they start avoiding the services set up to help them. The Zhdrdii brothers have a difficult and toxic relationship, frequently falling out yet needing one another's support. Some years ago they were traumatised by the sudden deaths of their parents in a grav vehicle accident and although therapy was applied they did not fully heal from their psychological injuries.

Over time, the brothers developed anti-social and self-centred ways of thinking which led them to commit minor crimes. They benefited from the proceeds and gradually escalated, coming to believe they had something to lose by being 'caught' and re-educated. In short, they were so mentally ill that they actually enjoyed being criminals and have worked to conceal their nature for some time. However, as the Zhodani authorities well know, this is a path to self-destruction. Just a few hours ago the brothers became angry and mildly assaulted a fellow citizen. A security officer stepped in to give them some advice about the errors they were making and they beat her savagely.

Although the Zhdrdii brothers were villains, they are mourned and pitied rather than hated ‚Äì at least officially. Everyone affected by the incident is offered guidance and an assessment to see if therapy is needed. This offer is extended to offworlders. If the Travellers get the chance, they will observe that most people go along with the 'pitied not hated' attitude but it is not as prevalent as the authorities seem to think.

###### LEAVING NINJAR

However they do it, the Travellers must get to the ship's boat and thence to Rock Twelve, ideally with Riket in tow. If they do something dramatic, the Zhdrdii situation gives them a head start but they may end up in a dramatic grav-vehicle chase through the city anyway. A more subtle approach requires deception and misdirection, and quite possibly incapacitating Riket.

The Travellers will remember the rest... transferring Riket to an Imperial cruiser or reporting his death. Setting course for Extolay and diverting to Utoland. Riket's fate might be important to the course of the war that is about to unfold around the Travellers, so the Referee should keep a note of what happened to him.

The Zhdrdii brothers may have still been redeemable at that point but instead of wisely seeking therapy they fled, assaulting another security officer who came to stop them. They hijacked a grav-bus and entered the Three Domes district, exchanging gunfire with security officers who tried to stop them. For the past hours a discreet manhunt has been taking place, with the Zhdrdii brothers finally run to ground near the Travellers' location. The Travellers may become aware of this when armed security personnel begin disembarking from air/rafts and ushering people out of the park. The Travellers may panic and think they are the target but at this point they are just bystanders to be protected.

There is a general rush to get to safety, with security officers guiding anyone who will take notice of them. The rush is orderly after a fashion but still disruptive. The Travellers have an opportunity to slip away with Riket if they choose to take it. As for the Zhdrdii brothers, their tale has a sad ending that can only be partly mitigated by using it as an example to others. They had strayed so far from the path of conventional morality that they were willing to kill in order to avoid being returned to it. The security officers did their best to capture the brothers alive and save them but it was too late. They were forced to shoot to kill in order to save innocent lives.

**_FlashBack: operatIon kasuesh_**

The Travellers will probably choose to pass through the Tremous Dex system on the way to Extolay.

Tremous Dex is a barely inhabited rockball of a world, with only a trace atmosphere and a little surface ice that can be cracked for fuel. Most shipping ignores the downport and stops over at the large orbital facility. Run by the Tremous Dex Starport Corporation, the port mainly serves the jump-2 route between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate.

There is no general population on-planet other than starport workers and their families, and only a little industry geared mainly to reducing the need for imported spares and components. Despite the lack of a local economy, Tremous Dex is prosperous due to the amount of trade conducted at the highport and provision of services to passing ships.

Like most systems of the Demilitarised Zone, Tremous Dex is of little economic importance and significant mainly as a possible refuelling point for warships operating in the region. The orbital starport has been occupied by Zhodani troops but does not appear to be damaged. It is broadcasting a continuous beacon signal stating it is a possession of the Zhodani

Consulate and that neutral ships are welcome. It can be presumed that Imperial-registered ships will be interned but this is not explicitly stated. The port has been assigned a destroyer as guardship.

The system has one gas giant which could provide convenient refuelling. It might be expected that the Zhodani would monitor or defend the giant but their resources are stretched thin. In any case, the Travellers have struck lucky. There is a second Zhodani ship in the system, another destroyer, but it is not in a position to interfere with the Travellers as it is currently being pursued by an Imperial warship, the light cruiser Elupemir, detached from Admiral Pael's fleet to conduct raiding operations in the DMZ.

None of the warships are trying to hide. The Zhodani destroyer previously stationed at the gas giant is racing in-system to join her consort from the starport. Meanwhile, the Elupemir is slowing her pursuit. She turns about and returns to the gas giant to conduct a hurried refuelling. This gives the Zhodani forces the chance to come after her but gives the Imperial ship full tanks to escape or continue her mission.

## INS elupemIr

If the Travellers attempt refuelling at the same time as the Elupemir, their fuel shuttle will be detected. However, its transponder contains a code identifying it as an Imperial Naval Intelligence ship, which is noted by the cruiser's commander. If the Travellers maintain radio silence the cruiser will not attempt to communicate other than by making a tight-beam data dump. This contains a basic situation report stating that the Zhodani have initiated a major conflict and that Regina has been heavily attacked but was holding out when Elupemir left. The data dump vaguely states that Admiral Pael is conducting counter-offensive operations in the DMZ. At the time the Elupemir left Regina it was not known that Extolay was under attack and news of its fall would arrive well after the fleet deployed.

If the Travellers want to transfer to the Elupemir her commander advises against it. Rock Twelve is a useful asset and should be taken back to base. Besides, the Travellers' possessions and their ship, if they have one, are all at Extolay. Elupemir will be in the DMZ for

a while yet, so the Travellers will not get home any quicker and run the risk of being killed in a space battle. The Travellers are requested to carry a dump of the cruiser's logs to Extolay and thence to Regina. This is heavily encrypted so the Travellers will not immediately be able to read it but they are crewing an intelligence ship which has the ability to access the data eventually. This will enable the Travellers to build up a picture of Admiral Pael's daring raid, if they are interested.

If the Travellers get a visual on the cruiser, they see she has damage. There are pits and craters all over her hull, with the mangled wreckage of weapon mounts here and there. She creates a hot-gas contrail as she skims fuel, her aerodynamic hull marred by jutting structural members and twisted hull plate. There is a grandeur to her, battle-scarred but still in the fight, that the Travellers may remember poignantly when they learn she never returned from her mission.

Refuelling over, Elupemir accelerates to meet the Zhodani destroyers. Two heavy destroyers against an Imperial light cruiser is an unequal match but still a dangerous one. The destroyers are 10,000 ton ships; inferior in technology but larger than Imperial equivalents. They are constrained by a need to remain between the cruiser and starport, allowing Elupemir to dictate the terms of the engagement. Her captain bores in aggressively, trying to close the range and forcing the Zhodani to accelerate back towards the mainworld. This results in a stern-chase engagement with the range steadily closing. Elupemir batters one destroyer until it is forced to jump out, then turns her fire on the other. She is hurting, venting water and air but still battleworthy at the last point the Travellers can track her. Chances are she will win this engagement and still be in a condition to continue her mission. Meanwhile, the Travellers are clear to refuel and move on.

En route to Extolay the Travellers start to feel strange again. Soon they are experiencing another memory event. This one is slightly different to the last, as they are recalling events they never witnessed in the first place. Others have used the personality overlay device in the past and left imprints upon it. These are surfacing in a rather confused manner.

The Travellers find themselves in an ornate conference chamber. Several obviously very important people are present. The Travellers recognise Duchess Delphine of Mora at the head of the conference table. She is serenely ignoring everyone as others argue across the real-wood table. The issue at hand seems to be something to do with redeploying part of the Corridor Sector Strategic Reserve Fleet to the Deneb sector. The Travellers' viewpoint keeps shifting, as if they are seeing events from the perspective of one person, then another. The Travellers may come to realise they are seeing not the real events but the perceptions of someone who was there for some of what happened, with details filled in by inference and imagination.

There are charts and diagrams, showing fleet strengths and logistics capabilities. The topic under discussion is the 1105 Fleet Deployment Schedule, which the Travellers may know never went ahead. Yet here they see the proposal laid out as if it is a done deal. Duchess Delphine applauds the move, stating that it will increase security in the Spinward Marches, yet after only a few sentences she is saying the fleet should be based a little further forward, at Mora. She offers to find the funds to create a new naval depot here in her home system, a bigger and better facility than the de facto depot at Macene.

Others say the move will antagonise the Zhodani and perhaps provoke war. Viscount Iim Davide Urast of New Rome loudly proclaims that is nonsense; the Zhodani are planning an attack through Glisten ‚Äì which happens to be the location of his fief ‚Äì and more ships are needed to deter or repel it. Never mind Mora,

# FLASHBACK: FLEET REFORM

base the new fleet at Glisten! Duchess Delphine gives him a hard stare and he qualifies this; base some of the new fleet at Glisten. It is clear that his faction, known as Forward The Imperium!, is aligned with the Duchess' own Mora Foremost group.

Others push for a deployment further coreward, creating a larger reserve at Macene or placing additional battle squadrons along the Zhodani border. This is dismissed as a return to the old 'crust' strategy which would risk major forces being overrun in the first days of a Zhodani offensive. Again Duchess Delphine pushes for Mora as the hub ‚Äì far enough back to avoid immediate defeat but ready to deal with whatever happens to spinward or coreward. There are also economic considerations, she says. Jobs will be created in supporting industries, with serious-money contracts for local firms. Mora is the logical centre for all this and from it she will spread prosperity across the Marches.

Duchess Delphine presents another measure; redeployment of the heavy defences over certain fortress worlds. Regina, Rhylanor and the like are well enough defended, she argues. Let them donate a heavy monitor or battle rider to nearby unprotected worlds. A battle rider over every mainworld! Serving as a highly visible deterrent these vessels will also provide economic advantages, in terms of navy salaries spent in port and contracts with local service providers. If the navy is spending money, let everyone have a share in it!

The scene shifts. The Travellers are in an audience chamber, less ornate than the one at Mora. A man recognisable as Duke Norris of Regina gestures furiously, as if they had just delivered bad news. It is foolishness, he says, and must be opposed. The fortress worlds must be defended and that means concentrating heavy units rather than scattering them across the whole sector. Delphine is currying favour by promising heavy defences to worlds that cannot support them. At best she is throwing away money; at worst, warships.

Norris reveals his suspicions. These movements benefit the Zhodani by weakening the fortress worlds. If they punch through, they will drive on Macene and Rhylanor, and Mora is lost in that case anyway. The fortress worlds must be held, so that the fleet can find the decisive point and blunt the enemy offensive. Yes, Delphine says he is worrying too much about protecting his home on Regina but he is thinking in terms of external strategy whilst she is using naval strategy as a tool to further her claim to the Archducal throne.

'I have sent to His Imperial Majesty for assistance,' Norris says, 'and I have ordered an investigation into possible Zhodani influences on these plans. Delphine is not a Zhodani sympathiser but she sees the wrong picture. Perhaps she has been influenced. We will find out who is responsible for that and deal with them. In the meantime, I have a task for you.'

##### FLEET REDEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE

These events refer to the controversy surrounding the 1105 Fleet Redeployment Schedule and associated restructuring of defence over the fortress worlds of the Spinward Marches. Zhodani influence was suspected in the derailing of the former and the decision, narrowly averted, to undertake a redeployment of defences that would have left the fortress worlds dangerously exposed to attack.

There was never any suggestion that Duchess Delphine of Mora was acting on behalf of the Zhodani Consulate; her motive was to consolidate her own power. However, the move would have been disastrous. The Travellers have just learned that Duke Norris sent an agent posing as a Zhodani spy to convince the Provincial Governor that the defensive redeployment was going ahead. Using the overlay machine, this agent was able to deceive the Zhodani and return home safely. Their identity is not known but their deeds may have changed the course of the war.

The Travellers may experience other flashbacks that shed light on the reasons for the events unfolding around them... but that is a tale for another day.

The scene shifts again. This time it is the command bridge of a Zhodani battleship. The Travellers stand before a grandly attired noble... perhaps Provincial Governor Dlafl Shtalijtlas himself? He speaks, slowly and with great weight. 'You have done well, as was expected. The defensive redeployment will begin soon and their fleet reserve will remain in Corridor. It is as we hoped. You may go.'

The scene shifts once more. The Travellers are in a machine of some kind... the personality overlay machine. Duke Norris is present, standing back to let the technicians do their work. 'Do you think they bought it?' he asks bluntly.

'Yes,' the Travellers hear themselves answer. 'Yes, Your Grace.'

The 871-438 system is the Travellers' logical final refuelling stop on the way to Extolay. They could instead make a second jump-2 and arrive at the base with dry tanks, in which case going through Tionale might seem like a viable option. However, Tionale has a Class C starport and is slightly less unimportant than 873-438. Encountering a Zhodani warship is less likely at 873-438, even if the Travellers decide not to refuel.

871-438 is an uninhabited rockball lying just off the Spinward Main. It is not on the way to anywhere for jump-1 ships and is routinely bypassed, with some jump-2 vessels conducting gas giant refuelling whilst plying between Extolay and Tremous Dex. Some sources state that the system has two planetoid belts but this is disputed by official navigation charts. There are two very sparse regions of planetoids which might be optimistically described as belts but neither has been found to have resources worth exploiting.

The system has a gas giant, which could be used for refuelling. It might be monitored by the Zhodani however, making it more viable to find an ice asteroid and take longer refuelling, but reducing the chance of detection to virtually nil. In the event, there is no Zhodani presence in system when the Travellers arrive, although they may detect debris that suggests there was an exchange of fire at some point.

Whilst they are conducting refuelling operations, the Travellers are alerted to multiple jump emergences near the gas giant. If they are using their fuel shuttle they have time to get it back aboard and pretend to be a small moonlet. A convoy of Zhodani supply ships has emerged from jump, with a full battle squadron as escort. A battleship and three fleet cruisers, plus several fleet destroyers, take up defensive positions whilst the transports refuel. The warships also take their turn in a long evolution that takes a couple of days. If the Travellers are at the gas giant this will be rather fraught but no Zhodani ships go near the planetoids.

The Travellers will not be detected so long as they lie low and behave like a rock. If they want to jump away and are in the planetoids, their jump might be detected but there is no chance of a ship reaching them in time to prevent it. Attempting to escape from the gas giant is more tricky. A low-powered acceleration will cause Rock Twelve to spiral outward as it orbits the gas giant, which is unlikely to be noticed at first. This requires a successful Average (8+) Pilot check. However, sooner or later the automatic hazard plotting aboard the Zhodani warships will indicate that one of the giant's moonlets is not where it should be. A destroyer will be sent to check.

At this point the Travellers will have to make an emergency jump or hope the Zhodani fail to realise Rock Twelve is not what she seems. They will be jumping from within the 100-diameter limit and risk damage to their drive or even a misjump but there is no way they can shoot their way out or race away. Clever Travellers might come up with an alternative solution, such as accelerating inwards for a slingshot manoeuvre that takes advantage of cover from the giant's moons. Such creativity should be rewarded by the Referee.

The Travellers' ultimate goal should be the Extolay naval base but the system is now under Zhodani occupation.

Extolay is a strategically important world on the Spinward Main, sometimes referred to as the Gatekeeper of the Marches. It is heavily urbanised, importing large quantities of raw materials and producing industrial goods for sale. As a result its port is very busy in normal times, with most Imperial trade ships turning around and heading back down the Spinward Main and fewer heading coreward towards Regina and ultimately Jewell. A relatively small percentage continue out into the DMZ towards Zhodani space.

Extolay's naval base was relatively small, serving mainly to support patrol and flag-showing operations along the neutral part of the Spinward Main. The system was heavily fortified, with several large monitors and battle riders in addition to heavy planetary defences, and with heavy elements of the sector fleet based at Regina two parsecs away the system was assumed to be secure.

On 222-1107, that assumption was proven wrong. The Zhodani 47th Fleet ‚Äì a Fleet of the First Class ‚Äì entered the system, broadcast a declaration of war and accelerated towards the naval base. The Zhodani force threw its full weight against Extolay, other than its raider element which pushed into Lanth and Regina to exploit the advantage of surprise. The defenders were caught by complete surprise, enabling the Zhodani to put heavy defensive units under fire whilst they were still out of position and unsupported.

The Zhodani could muster 19 battle squadrons, each consisting of a battleship, three fleet cruisers and up to 12 fleet destroyers, but the fight was not entirely one-sided. Whilst the jump-capable forces based at Extolay were on a peacetime footing, in-system defences were more prepared ‚Äì and it was these that were the backbone of the defence. Some vessels were at their moorings, some stood down for maintenance, but the majority of major units were crewed and active. They were not concentrated, however.

Some fell victim to the pitiless mathematics of thrust and vector. With no chance of joining forces with other ships or receiving assistance they died hard, some vessels refusing to surrender even when battered to a wreck. Their sacrifice bought time for other monitors and riders to concentrate, for system defence boats to launch from their bases and tenders, and for the patrol force to rush ships to space.

Contingency crewing protocols sent crewmembers to the most-ready ship that needed someone with their skills. A cruiser went to space with a destroyer's captain in command; her gunnery officer led a destroyer crew. Some ships never left their moorings but the naval base scrambled a response in an impressively short time. Under the guns of the base these ships and boats formed up and charged towards the Zhodani fleet. Riders and monitors joined them. The counterattack was clumsy but gallant... and it never stood a chance.

The Zhodani fleet was trained to a hair, confident and well organised. Its commanders benefited from telepathic communications and years of rehearsing for this very scenario. This was the Zhodani Consular Navy at its very finest and it quickly repulsed the Imperial force. Falling back on its base, the Imperial fleet sent couriers to Regina for help ‚Äì not knowing that Regina was also under heavy attack. The Zhodani commanders did not pause to let their enemies regroup; they ordered the fleet to close the base and destroy its defences.

The Zhodani force took losses of course but the outcome was a foregone conclusion. Within hours of the first shots being fired, Zhodani troops were securing the surviving shipyards and command centres of the naval bases. A handful of vessels, mostly gutted by their crews to protect sensitive technologies and information, were captured. Some jump-capable ships escaped, headed for Regina, and elements of the system defence force pulled back from the base to begin a campaign of harassment.

Fleet of the First Class 47 detached one of its elements, a Fleet of the Second Class brought up to full strength by transfers from the other, for a feint towards Rhylanor. The remainder of the force secured the naval base, hunted down the surviving defenders and began reducing the planetary defences of Extolay. On 222-1107 the Zhodani 3rd Assault Fleet arrived, bearing news of a repulse at Regina. Four days later it began landing troops on Extolay. Progress on the ground was slow due to heavy resistance and difficult conditions in Extolay's cities. It is likely the Travellers will arrive at Extolay during this process.

###### THE TRAVELLERS ARRIVE

When the Travellers arrive at Extolay, the world is under siege. In addition to elements of Fleet of the First Class 47, almost the entirety of Assault Fleet of the First Class 3 is present. The overall force nominally numbers 10 battle squadrons, each with a battleship and three fleet cruisers. There are also over 100 fleet destroyers, in addition to the assault transports and support ships. Additional battle and cruiser squadrons are detached to secure nearby systems, whilst a full Fleet of the Second Class is detached from the 47th Fleet for operations in the direction of Rhylanor.

This is a huge force, although some of its squadrons are understrength and many of its ships are damaged. The worst of those were formed into 'retreat squadrons' for mutual protection and sent back toward Cronor. Other vessels made repairs using their own resources and a few are in dock at the captured naval base. Zhodani ground troops are in possession of parts of Extolay itself but there are still defiant transmissions emanating from the planet's cities.

If the Travellers' possessions (and their ship, if they have one) were at the naval base there would be no chance of retrieving them. However, the intelligence services are secretive even among their own people. Vessels like Rock Twelve operate out of a remote part of the system's planetoid belt, supported by stations carved out of innocuous-seeming rock. The Travellers' possessions (and ship) will be there.

Reaching the station in a system full of Zhodani warships would be impossible under most conditions but the Zhodani are focused on securing the naval base and the mainworld, and are more concerned with the possibility of an attack by a battle fleet than one insignificant rock which seems to be out of place. If the Travellers proceed slowly and carefully they will be able to drift through the belt undetected. Along the way they will notice small craft here and there, Zhodani vessels carrying out the rather tedious task of mapping the belt and looking for concealed ships or stations.

The Travellers' sensors show a couple of Zhodani fleet destroyers in their part of the belt. They are not close to the Travellers' destination but they do have shuttles out, laboriously scanning each rock over a certain size, perhaps looking for system defence monitors. These are sometimes constructed using a planetoid as a hull, partly for cheapness but also to gain the benefit of concealment. The Travellers may sympathise with those given the job; if the small craft find one their crews will be annihilated for certain.

_TIMELINE OF THE WAR_

The Zhodani will achieve final victory on Extolay on 279-1107, according to the timeline of the Fifth Frontier War. This date may vary in your campaign, of course, or the fall of Extolay might be completely prevented. The Fifth Frontier War sourcebook states that Extolay never actually surrenders; senior government officials are smuggled offworld before it falls completely. Perhaps the Travellers might be involved in that?

Intelligence Station Miidurki is an automated support base for ships like Rock Twelve. It also services more conventional vessels operating in a similar role. Stations of this sort are sometimes used to isolate prisoners until they can be properly interrogated and upon occasion are used as ersatz prisons for particularly important or dangerous captives. People who mysteriously disappear may sometimes find themselves held in a place like this, where no-one outside the intelligence services ever goes.

Carved out of a planetoid, the station has no drives. It has chambers on two main levels, with a considerable depth of rock between them that contains hollows which have been put to use by the installation's creators. The station was designed to be crewed from time-to-time, with long dormant periods in between. Primary access between the levels is by way of a central elevator/nexus chamber, although there are also utility conduits and direct access points between certain areas of the installation.

The Travellers will be able to enter through either set of boat bays or the weapon mounts. They may be surprised to discover that they have full security access to most station systems, although not to confidential records. The station's basic functions such as life support, lighting and the like are operating in automated mode, and there are two people aboard. The Travellers will not immediately be aware of this unless they ask the station's monitoring system.

If the Travellers do ask, they are informed that Petty Officer Second Class Masoumeh Khatoon, Imperial Navy Reserve and Able Spacehand Qua Davis, Imperial Navy are aboard the station. They are not part of the installation's crew. Khatoon and Davis can be located at any time by the monitoring system but they do not have access to it so cannot ask about the Travellers. They know the station has been boarded and are currently trying to sneak a look at who it is.

If the Travellers make themselves known using the intercom, Khatoon and Davis will cautiously approach them providing the Travellers can make assurances that they are not Zhodani boarders. Otherwise the two will try to remain hidden until they can find a way off the station.

## UPPER LEVEL

The upper level is primarily given over to accommodation and utilities, along with the station's armament.

##### DOCKING BAYS (1) 

The upper level has concealed docking bays for 100- ton fuel shuttles. These can be used by smaller craft as well but are primarily intended to deliver fuel directly to the installation's tanks. A small amount of spares are kept in this area, along with emergency vacc suits.

##### FUEL CAVERN (2) 

A natural cavern in the planetoid has been lined with hull plating and turned into a fuel storage chamber. There is processing equipment which both refines fuel and keeps it from deteriorating when the station is not in use.

##### MISSILE BAYS (3) 

The installation has two small missile bays concealed in its surface. Only a handful of missiles are present, as these are considered something of a white elephant added to the design without consideration of its intended role. It is probable that the designers thought the installation might be useful as a system defence platform but its remote location makes this unlikely.

##### MAIN REACTOR AND LIFE SUPPORT (4) 

The installation's main power supply is protected by a heavily insulated chamber to mask its emissions and designed to operate for long periods without oversight. The installation's life support machinery is also concentrated in this chamber.

# INTELLIGENCE STATION MIIDURKI 

##### ACCOMMODATION (5)

The personnel accommodation area consists of staterooms, common areas, a galley and mess, plus a small recreation chamber. There are no personal effects here and most of the staterooms have not been used recently. However, two show signs of occupation. It will be possible to deduce that naval or perhaps marine personnel are using the staterooms; beds are neatly made and everything is stowed 'just so'. Other than a couple of sets of generic clothing clearly broken out of stores there is nothing of note in the tiny storage areas. The galley, likewise, has been used in a disciplined fashion and kept very tidy.

##### COMMAND SUITE (6) 

The installation's command and control systems are run from this suite, which also houses computer equipment. There are more rooms than currently needed, with some standing empty.

##### STORES (7) 

The installation's stores are filled with mundane items such as boots, uniforms, vacc suit emergency kits and all the freeze-dried ration packs a spacer could ever want to eat. There is nothing in this chamber connected with intelligence work; it is the installation's stock of day-to-day operating supplies.

##### CENTRAL ELEVATOR (8) 

The elevator shaft runs though both levels and the area in between. It is surrounded by a marshalling chamber where cargo can be loaded onto the large platform and personnel can board the smaller one.

###### LOWER LEVEL

The installation's lower level contains its intelligence- operation functions. It can be accessed directly from the shuttle bays or the access hatch for the antenna array.

##### SHUTTLE BAYS (1)

A cluster of bays can accommodate one craft of up to 100 tons displacement in addition to several smaller boats. The bays lead into a typical support and maintenance area.

##### FUEL CAVERN (2)

Much of this level is taken up by a large fuel reserve stored in a natural cavern. There is far more fuel than the station would ever need, in order to support ships headed out on intelligence missions.

##### OPERATIONS SUITE (3)

The installation's main operations suite contains conference rooms, offices and a very large amount of computer equipment. It is capable of supporting an analysis team and/or preparing a field team for their mission.

##### SECURE ACCOMMODATION (4)

'Secure accommodation' is a euphemism for holding cells and interrogation chambers. Most are set up for humans but there are variable-environment cells which could be used for almost any species. There are four bodies in one of these, which has been set up for extreme cold conditions. All the corpses wear the remains of Imperial Navy vacc suits and appear to have died from injuries of a sort common in space combat ‚Äì electrocution, burns or spallation from the hull.

##### MISSION STORES (5)

The installation's mission stores include clothing and domestic items from a variety of Tech Levels and cultures, along with equipment such as bug detectors and small computers specialised for encryption-cracking. The armoury contains several snub pistols as well as 'stealth' weapons such as body pistols. There are also more specialised items, including psionic decoys.

##### SECONDARY FUEL (6) A smaller natural cavern has been turned into an auxiliary fuel storage area in much the same way as the main one.

##### STORAGE CAVERN (7) A natural cavern has been slightly modified by smoothing off the floor and turned into a storage area. There are hundreds of boxes, mostly containing clothing and culturally-appropriate personal electronic devices from numerous cultures. Boxes are numbered and there is a surprisingly accurate inventory held on the main station computer. Any

Traveller who wants a set of TL2 hiking boots or the TL6 equivalent of a personal comm can find one... eventually... but there are no weapons or items of value other than boxes and boxes of low- denomination local currency from several worlds.

If the Travellers have a ship, it will be in the large docking bay (10) and their possessions will be aboard it. If not, their possessions will be neatly boxed up and stowed in this cavern, along with the personal items of people who will probably not be coming back from their missions.

##### ELEVATOR SHAFT (8) The elevator shaft gives access right through the installation.

##### ANTENNAE AND COMMUNICATIONS (9) The station has an extensive array of antennae concealed just under its surface. They are monitored from a dedicated communications suite, which also has an access tunnel to the surface to permit manual inspection and maintenance on the main cluster.

##### LARGE DOCKING BAY (10) Another natural cavern in the planetoid, also accessible from the outside, has been capped with a disguised door and turned into a bay capable of accepting up to 1,200 tons of ships. It currently holds a small starship and what remains of System Defence Boat Extolay 57-579. The boat has heavy battle damage. If the Travellers possessed a spacecraft before the adventure began, it is here. If not, there will be a small vessel suitable to be crewed by the Travellers, most likely a nondescript far trader or subsidised merchant used to covertly transport intelligence operatives but the Referee can substitute another vessel if desired.

###### SYSTEM DEFENCE BOAT extolay 57-579

The SDB is a standard TL15 model (see page 175 of High Guard) used by the Imperial Navy and many member worlds. It was part of the flotilla assigned to the Extolay naval base and like many others put to space with a crew assembled from the first qualified personnel to reach the launch bays. Normally the command of a sublieutenant and leader of an eight- boat squadron, Extolay 57-579 went out under the

command of Petty Officer Second Class Khatoon and joined a scratch force assisting the planetoid monitor Extolay Ramirez. Most of the boats were destroyed or heavily damaged before Extolay Ramirez succumbed to intense Zhodani firepower. Khatoon managed to guide his critically damaged craft clear of the fight using fragments blasted off the monitor as cover.

With most of the crew dead and his boat in a sinking condition, Khatoon searched for a ship or installation that could take survivors or even repair his boat. The other survivor, Able Spacehand Qua Davis, had made supply runs in the past to a 'don't ask' station in the planetoid belt. They were able to coax their dying vessel just far enough and whilst the installation did not respond to communications, the docking bay cover responded to a transponder squawk.

Since they arrived, the survivors have been trying to jury-rig their boat and get an idea of how bad the situation is in the system. Unlike the Travellers, they cannot access the station's communication or command systems. It provides life support and they can take anything they want from non-secured stores, but they cannot get into the armoury or access anything sensitive. They were able to repurpose an environment controlled cell as a freezer for their dead comrades but thus far their attempts to fix the SDB have come to nothing. Its drive has failed, the power plant is heavily damaged and most control systems have been destroyed. Some parts might be salvaged but making this boat fly again, let alone fight, is an impossibility. Likewise, the survivors have not managed to access the other ship present in the station. The Travellers will be able to even if it is not theirs, as they can use the station's systems to override the ship's security and grant them crew status.

###### IMPERIAL NAVY SURVIVORS

Petty Officer Second Class Khatoon served a term in the Imperial Navy a lifetime ago, serving honourably but without distinction aboard tankers and supply ships. He mustered out with a useful set of skills and embarked on a career aboard a succession of small trading vessels. His pay was augmented by a stipend granted in return for remaining on the reserve list, which came with the inconvenience of a mandatory five-year recertification and refresher course. By sheer bad luck, Khatoon was halfway through what he intended to be his last refresher before retirement when the Zhodani attacked. He found himself directed to the boat bays, boarded an SDB and did his best.

Khatoon's best was pretty good; sufficiently so that his boat survived when the rest of the squadron did not. He and Davis made it but were unable to save the rest of the crew, which troubles him deeply. Khatoon is the senior Imperial Navy presence on the station and is duty bound to take command, yet he does not want to. He will find an excuse to defer to strong personalities among the Travellers even if this is a breach of regulations, although he will not betray his oath to the Imperium.

Although experienced, Khatoon is wise rather than smart. He does not make big leaps of logic and will deal with what is in front of him rather than looking at the big picture. However, he will realise how valuable the installation might be to the Zhodani and will advocate destroying all data storage if the station is boarded. In addition he will paint a bleak picture of the situation and press for a prompt departure.

Able Spacehand Qua Davis is at the other end of the experience spectrum. Halfway through her first term in the navy, she was assigned to system defence boats protecting the Extolay naval base. Operating in a small team suited her better than being part of a large crew and she was content with her posting. The attack shocked her as much as everyone else and since it began she has been functioning more or less on autopilot. Like Khatoon, she is just dealing with what is in front of her without thought to the bigger picture, but for a different reason. She is in the habit of following orders and completing her tasks rather than trying to figure out the wider situation. Davis is content to follow Khatoon's lead but since the battle he has not been providing leadership which frustrates her.

The Travellers can get aboard the intelligence station by a variety of means. There are two sets of boat bays and access can also be gained through the missile bays or the antenna cluster hatch. The large docking bay will open if a craft with an Imperial transponder approaches but the wrecked SDB creates an obstacle the Travellers will have to carefully manoeuvre around. Once inside, the Travellers will be able to explore the station for a time if they desire. They will encounter the two survivors at some point, which could be awkward if the Travellers do not appear to be Imperial Navy personnel.

They have authorisation to be on the station, since they are for the time being part of its intelligence- operations team. They have a 'living and working' level of access, which does not include confidential records and intelligence-analysis data but does allow them to operate most internal systems. The Travellers have control over the station's communications system but not its weapons.

If the Travellers want access to the restricted systems they will have to find a way to do it. The missile bays can be switched to local control, which would allow the Travellers to launch weapons and track targets. Anyone with Gunner (capital) 1+ will know how to do this. Others will have to figure it out, which will require an Average (8+) Gunner check or some creative problem-solving.

Records and data are more difficult to access. This requires command-level authorisation from an Imperial Naval Intelligence officer, either remotely or in person. The Travellers will not be able to obtain this, although they might manage to physically remove data storage units and find a way to crack them later. There is a problem with this; all sensitive data is stored in secure modules surrounded by enough incendiaries to melt them to slag. Attempting to remove a data core without the correct codes will trigger a meltdown. This can also be done on command by someone with the right level of authority ‚Äì which the Travellers do not have.

There are three sensitive-data storage units. One is in the command suite, one in the communications chamber and one hidden behind an innocuous-looking access panel in the elevator shaft. Travellers with a naval background will be familiar with the 'main and

two backups' system and may think to look for the third data core but finding it will be a matter of logic or extremely detailed searching. Travellers with Engineer or Mechanic skills may be able to puzzle out where the builders would put the installation's secure data storage.

It is possible to make the incendiaries safe by disarming them. The Travellers would have to first get through the surrounding armoured box, which contains sensors designed to trigger the incendiary devices if an attempt is made. Triggering one set of incendiaries will not set off the others but a command to detonate will initiate all three. If the Travellers proceed extremely delicately they may be able to drill through the casing and get at the detonation circuitry. A Difficult (10+) Explosives check is necessary to disarm the charges.

Alternatively, inventive Travellers might find another way. There may be a backdoor into the incendiaries' programming, or some other weakness that can be exploited. It may be possible to douse the system in liquid nitrogen before detonation, reducing the damage caused. As always, creative problem-solving should be rewarded. If matters reach the point where the Travellers want to destroy the data, they can do so by causing damage to the armoured casing, which will trigger the bombs. However, they will need to find all three.

## PROXIMITY ALERT

After the Travellers have had time to explore a little and perhaps interact with the survivors, the station's tracking system alerts the Travellers that there are craft approaching. They are still a few minutes out but have altered their vector to close the station. Sensor data indicates there are at least two Zhodani shuttles headed for the installation, with others possibly following. The nearest fleet destroyer has also changed course, although it is several hours away.

There can be no doubt that the Zhodani have detected something unusual about the planetoid and intend to investigate. The installation is not so well disguised as Rock Twelve and will be recognised as a concealed station once the boats get close enough. The destroyer has sufficient firepower to blast the installation to pieces

# STATE OF WAR

but more importantly it will be able to send over a sufficient force to take control of it. The Travellers would seem to have led the Zhodani to the intelligence station. They may or may not care very much about that.

The Travellers could board their ship or return to Rock Twelve and leave immediately. If so, they will be detected and pursued by the destroyer but have enough of a lead to reach a safe jump point. The Zhodani will take possession of the station and learn a great deal from its collected data. Again, the Travellers may or may not care about that but it will have consequences for the course of the war. The navy survivors will advocate removing or destroying sensitive data and equipment before abandoning the station.

If the Travellers want to do this they will have to buy time. There are several options; the incoming small craft might be engaged with weapons aboard the station, the Travellers' ship, or Rock Twelve. This is not guaranteed to succeed, of course. It might also be possible to push the crippled SDB out of the docking bay and use its last reserves of power to shoot at the incoming shuttles. This is likely to be a suicide mission, and neither of the survivors is prepared to do it, but a remote-piloting system could be jury-rigged by skilled and clever Travellers.

The Travellers may be able to ambush the shuttles, although they will begin to evade as soon as they detect incoming fire. This will slow their approach even if they are not destroyed but there are others following them. Once the Travellers have opened fire they are guaranteed to meet an overwhelming response from the destroyer once it gets into range.

Whether or not the Travellers fire on the shuttles will determine the nature of their approach. If they are not fired upon they land directly on the planetoid's surface after a flyby to seek an entry point. If the shuttles are under attack they instead begin
'dropping' vacc-suited personnel. These personnel will arrive more scattered than if a direct landing were made and some may be injured. However, there will soon be a force of Zhodani troops on the surface of the planetoid ‚Äì and they will find a way inside.

###### STAND BY TO REPEL BOARDERS!

If the Travellers have potent weaponry from their ship, the personnel landing on the planetoid will include at least some combat-armoured troops. If they are using pistols and submachineguns, the Travellers will

instead face vacc-suited naval ratings armed with laser carbines. The boarders can get in at several points and Zhodani doctrine calls for multiple penetrations of a hostile vessel. The Travellers may find themselves trapped between hostile forces but they do have the advantage of being able to track the intruders.

The most likely situation is a series of encounters with a handful of Zhodani, possibly even solo personnel. If the Travellers want to destroy the data or remove it ‚Äì or anything else ‚Äì from the station, they will have to do so in the face of opposition. The Zhodani are trained for shipboard actions, although naval ratings are mostly just ordinary crewmembers and not well skilled in such combat. They may make mistakes or panic, just like anyone else. Actual troops will be much more competent.

At this point the Travellers have to escape. They cannot defend the station against the numbers that can be sent against them and their window is closing. These final scenes of the adventure should be a scramble to grab what the Travellers want and get out. Confusion is inevitable; people may get cut off or left behind, or a way out may be blocked by enemy troops. The Travellers might end up going out of a missile bay access hatch and around the surface of the planetoid to reach the large docking bay.

All manner of diversions and stratagems are possible for the Travellers. Missiles from the bays might be used to rig booby-traps, or the SDB's guns could be set to fire through the docking bay entrance. The Travellers might abandon the navy survivors, or help them and in return be presented with an unexpected solution to a problem. Perhaps Khatoon decides to be a hero after all, heading back into the station to find and detonate the third data vault. Will the Travellers aid him or take advantage of the convenient distraction?

###### ESCAPE!

At some point, the Travellers will need to get off the station and away from Extolay. They may have slipped away early in Rock Twelve, quietly coasting out to a jump point, or they might make a last-second dash in their ship, under the guns of the enemy destroyer. What they leave behind is lost to them but there are greater implications depending on what the Zhodani capture.

The station itself is of little value, although something could be learned from its technical systems if they are intact. If any of the data vaults survived, the Zhodani will find and eventually crack them. When they do, they will learn a great deal about Imperial intelligence operations in the region and more importantly will learn what the Imperials know about their own. This could have far-reaching repercussions.

The Travellers may never know how important their actions at the station could be. They can prevent a huge cache of intelligence data falling into Zhodani hands, or might totally fail to realise it is even there. This could be a significant moment in the course of the Fifth Fronter War, although for now the Travellers may be content just to escape. Where they go is entirely up to them, although Regina seems like a sensible destination. Whatever they choose to do, the Travellers must do it in the middle of a war zone. There are many adventures ahead....

The Zhodani military uses an open-topped light grav vehicle for patrol and security work. It has two seats up front for the driver and an observer, with the rear of the vehicle designed to be configured as necessary. When carrying supplies or cargo, capacity is 3,000 kilograms. However, the vehicle is more commonly deployed as a patrol and reconnaissance platform with two or three personnel carried in the rear, along with some loose cargo. Up to six people can be carried if the vehicle is fitted with seats but fighting from the vehicle becomes very difficult in this case.

A central pintle mount is fitted but does not carry armament as standard. In weapons-carrier configuration a VRG gauss gun is standard but this is not deemed necessary on Utoland. More commonly two troopers stand in the rear compartment, observing the population and intervening if necessary. Intervention in this case means lethal force in the form of weapons fire from a hovering vehicle; the Zhodani would not send just a couple of troopers into a hostile situation.

The hull and windscreen are lightly armoured and capable of defeating small arms fire from beyond 100 metres. The underside is more heavily protected as befits the vehicle's likely role. The open design is useful for deploying patrols but vulnerable to fire from tall buildings or grenades lobbed into the payload compartment but this is considered an acceptable compromise.

    TRAITS ‚Äî

Rock Twelve is an Imperial intelligence-gathering vessel constructed out of and disguised as a planetoid. Its operations normally fall into the category of 'honestly covert' in that the vessel attempts to hide or avoid attracting attention rather than pretending to be something it is not. Typical operations involve floating in a star system for months on end collecting passive sensor data, then slipping quietly away. It is not fast, manoeuvrable or glamorous but it can go places other ships simply cannot.

Covert observation missions require a great deal of patience and crew resilience. Approaches to a target location can be circuitous and may require low movement which can frustrate some crews. It is then necessary to remain silent for days or weeks at a time before crawling away once more. Crew fatigue can be alleviated by swapping crews aboard a support vessel in the nearest safe location, with a 'transit crew' replacing the 'on-station crew'.

Rock Twelve is very lightly armed, with two concealed turrets each mounting a pulse laser and missile rack. The latter is more commonly used for launching long- duration listening probes than combat. Indeed, a covert vessel that has to engage in battle has failed its mission. Defence is provided by anonymity. With low- powered drives and an emissions absorption grid, Rock Twelve gives away little to show she is anything other than a floating chunk of rock.

A layer of radar-absorbent 'stealth' materials around inhabited sections of the hull further reduce emissions and present the appearance of a solid object. All living spaces are covered by separate Gaasha cages, devices intended to interfere with psionic scanning within the vessel. They are not normally used, as their field would be more likely to attract attention from psions scanning for anomalies in the area, unless the vessel has obviously been detected. Instead, psionic shield helmets are worn while psionic detection is possible.

# ROCK TWELVE

##### FUEL SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY (1) 

The fuel shuttle docks tail-first and is accessed by way of a gantry running around the outside of the bay. Storage lockers for rarely-used items line the inner side of the gantry, containing tools and spares for maintaining small craft and vacc suits, along with shipboard systems that rarely require maintenance. There may be a weapon or two hidden in concealed compartments among these lockers.

SHIP'S BOAT DOCKING AREA (2) 

The ship's boat dock is generally similar to the fuel shuttle bay. Personnel access to the ship is normally by way of a gantry around the side of the bay leading to the main airlock (2a). An automated transfer system (2b) allows stores to be moved directly to the cargo area.

##### TURRET ONE (3) 

Turret One is recessed into the rock of the planetoid hull at the end of a short corridor. It can be entered for manual operations but is normally fired from the bridge. A locker nearby holds up to 15 missiles. Usually no more than a handful are combat weapons, with the remainder being long-duration listening probes on a standard missile bus. All missiles are commercially available 'civilian' models with nothing to trace them back to Imperial authorities.

##### TURRET TWO (4) Turret Two is almost identical to Turret One but accessed by a corridor leading off the bridge.

##### CARGO SPACE (5) The small cargo space is usually stacked with boxes and racks of containers holding everything from galley supplies to weapon components. Part of the cargo space is set up as a bulk wardrobe area, with outfits ready for crewmembers going planetside. There is also a small workshop capable of supporting electronic and mechanical projects.

##### ROCK TWELVE COVERT OBSERVATION VESSEL

Rock Twelve is hollowed out of an irregular planetoid, roughly twice as long as it is wide or high. From the outside it resembles a typical planetoid and even close examination might miss the concealed docking bays and pop-up turrets. Crew access is by way of the ship's boat. It might be possible to transfer personnel from a vessel close by onto the surface of the planetoid and thence inside, but this process is laborious. Docking with other craft is not possible.

Internal structures and corridors are bored into solid rock, then lined with standard starship materials. Perhaps the only obvious sign this is a planetoid's interior rather than a purpose-built starship is the lack of viewports. Each cluster of chambers is surrounded by a Gaasha Cage, which nullifies psionic activity when activated.

##### Rock Twelve Crew Deck

##### MAIN ACCOMMODATION COMPLEX (6) The main accommodation complex consists of eight standard cabins, plus a small recreation and dining area.

##### SECURE ACCOMMODATION COMPLEX (7) The secure accommodation complex consists of four cabins, two briefing/interrogation rooms and a small medical bay. The personality overlay device is located in one of the briefing rooms. There is also a small brig for use on the rare occasions someone is grabbed by the crew. This is not the sort of mission such a ship would normally be tasked with but intelligence work can be full of surprises.

##### ARMOURY (8) The ship's armoury also acts as a security station controlling access to the bridge and command stations. It is usually kept stocked with a variety of nondescript small arms to suit whatever persona covert operatives may be using.

##### INTELLIGENCE CHAMBER (9) The intelligence chamber also contains most of the ship's main computer suite. It can receive and collate data from distant sensor drones as well as more directly obtained information. There is a large database available for comparison and correlation, which cannot be accessed outside this chamber. The dedicated intelligence databanks can be incinerated with the input of an emergency code.

##### BRIDGE (10) The bridge is rather basic, with no features out of the ordinary. Much of the time it is a monitoring station only, with the ship lying quietly off the local shipping lanes. The vessel has sufficient virtual crew capacity to be remotely operated or left powered-down for an extended period.

##### FUEL ALPHA ROCK TWELVE FUEL SHUTTLE

A custom design built to be specific to the needs of Rock Twelve, Fuel Alpha exists only to keep the covert observation ship refuelled. It is not physically disguised, so relies on stealth to avoid detection. Even if spotted, the fuel shuttle might not attract attention in a system with a lot of traffic. Decisions surrounding fuel are tough ones; on the one hand the observation vessel absolutely needs fuel but on the other fuelling operations are the weakest link in the stealth chain. This is offset by the ability of the shuttle to act as a second fuel tank. It can fully fuel Rock Twelve in a backwater system, then refill its own tanks. Providing the target system is within two parsecs this allows Rock Twelve to arrive with sufficient fuel to slip away again without having to conduct skimming operations in a heavily patrolled system.

Fuel Alpha is constructed as a nondescript cylinder, with a combined drive/control chamber right aft. Other than some facilities for crew comfort adjoining the control area, the vessel has few other systems. It is possible to access the small forward crew chamber by way of a tunnel through the fuel tanks ‚Äì rarely used in flight but it can serve as an emergency control position. When docked, this area serves as a secondary monitoring position when running diagnostics on the shuttle's fuel and drive systems. The shuttle's main and really only purpose is to bring 240 tons of jump fuel, plus some additional for the power plant, to Rock Twelve. It can do so automatically, with no crew aboard, although it is normal for someone to at least monitor the shuttle as it operates.

##### FB-220011 ROCK TWELVE SHIP'S BOAT

Rock Twelve is equipped with a passenger/cargo ship's boat of standard design. It fits a 30-ton docking bay and would not look out of place in any docking area. There are no sensitive systems or secret compartments aboard this craft; even dismantling it would find nothing out of the ordinary. This is quite deliberate. The vessel's transponder can be reprogrammed using equipment aboard Rock Twelve, which is highly illegal but the transponder itself is standard. The acceleration benches can be removed to create a cargo-hauler or add equipment.

The boat is necessary for personnel transportation and cargo loading but sometimes plays a different role. Upon occasion a covert observation vessel may be used as a platform for direct operations. This may require a quiet insertion of personnel to a planet's surface, or simply landing at a starport like any other shuttle, although this works best when lax port officials do not ask where the shuttle came from. In better-run systems insertion might be made at some backwater outpost, with personnel travelling aboard legitimate in- system traffic under a suitable cover identity.

The following weapons and equipment may be encountered in the course of the adventure. Equivalents are likely to exist elsewhere, possibly with different features or design elements.

## HIGH GUARD

Concealed Docking Space: Hangars and docking spaces can be concealed by making them look like the rest of a ship's hull or a planetoid's outer surface. This is usually accomplished with a hinged or sliding cover and doubles the cost of the hangar or docking space.

Low Emission Drives: Low-emission manoeuvre drives are an advanced technology, as outlined on page 70 of High Guard. Low-emission drives are designed to reduce the detectability of a vessel by causing its drive emissions to fade into the backdrop of cosmic radiation and clutter from other sources. There is not much that can be done to prevent detection at close range but a more distant ship may be able to sneak away without its drive signature alerting enemies to its location. Each low emissions advantage imposes DM-1 on sensor attempts to detect the vessel from Medium range or greater.

## ARDENITE SECURITY EQUIPMENT

The security forces on Utoland are typically armed with a handgun and smoothbore longarm capable of delivering an array of ammunition. The handgun is a typical self-loading pistol in most ways, other than being burst-capable. It uses an 8.3x17mm round unique to Arden, making it difficult for unauthorised personnel to obtain ammunition, at least through official channels. However, ammunition can be produced by anyone with the correct equipment and supplies.

# WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

The longarm is often referred to as a shotgun but it is more commonly loaded with a less-lethal baton round. Penetrating slugs are also available for heavy combat. The weapon's accurate range is short but this is not usually a drawback as security weapons tend to be used indoors or in relatively small open spaces. In Ardenite service, the smoothbore is designated ASS-11 (Arden Security Smoothbore, 11mm calibre), leading to the phrase 'grab your ass' as an indication that conflict is imminent.

The ASS-11 has a bullpup configuration with a downward loading/ejector port and an internal six- round magazine. A bolt cutoff allows a single shell to be loaded directly to the breech whilst retaining a full magazine of a different ammunition type. Alternatively the magazine can be manually loaded with shells either individually or using stripper clips of three.

_LO-PEN TRAIT_

Some weapons perform very poorly against armour or fail to penetrate hard surfaces. This can be desirable, such as when ammunition is intended for use on a small indoor firing range or inside spacecraft. A low-penetration round is unlikely to punch a hole in a cabling conduit and wreck the ship's control systems. Weapons with Lo-Pen have a score, typically 2 or 3. This is a multiple to be applied to the target's armour, if any. Thus a Lo-Pen 3 weapon striking a flak jacket with Protection +5 would treat it as Protection +15; penetration is highly unlikely. Low-velocity firearms and pellet-firing weapons typically have this trait.

The handgun is carried with two spare magazines and only has lethal ammunition available. Typically longarms are carried with baton rounds, which do not penetrate well. This serves to protect machinery from stray shots. Standard security loadout is 12 shells, usually a mix of eight baton and four penetrators. Additional longarm ammunition would be issued for heavy combat situations. A standard security baton is also carried in 'hard' configuration.

###### GAASHA CAGE

A variant on psionic shield helmet technology, the Gaasha cage generates low-level electrical pulses which cause interference at the same frequencies as human brainwave patterns. The cage is similar in concept to a Faraday cage but instead of preventing electromagnetic interference with sensitive equipment it protects anything encased within from psionic effects. A psion trying to scan into or out of the cage with telepathy or other psionic senses will perceive nothing but static but will be aware that the cage is in operation.

The cage takes the form of a set of conductive rods and mesh which must be set up on the walls of a room or other structure. This takes several hours; longer if the cage is to be concealed. The normal use for a Gaasha cage is to protect conference rooms and briefing areas from psionic eavesdropping but it can also be used to torment a psionically sensitive individual by confining them in the cage and setting interference to its maximum intensity. A Gaasha cage will also prevent teleportation into or out of the screened area.

At long ranges it is not possible for a telepath or other psion to determine if the interference they sense is being deliberately caused or is coming from machinery such as a powering-up jump drive. A Gaasha cage costs Cr31250 to cover one displacement ton, assuming the design schematics can be obtained. Most people do not know these devices exist, let alone where to find the technology.

Security personnel wear a dark grey duty uniform which is resistant to minor threats such as small blades (equating to Protection +2). A rigid chest protector, shin and forearm guards and a helmet bring this up to Protection +5. A typical loadout is sidearm-only in 'soft' uniform, with sidearm and longarm carried when 'hard'

- local slang for adding the rigid armour.

###### GENERIC SMALL ARMS

Weaponry aboard Rock Twelve will either be sanitised such that its origins are untraceable, or generic items produced in the neutral worlds of the demilitarised zone. Weapons may be old and battered but serviceable, in keeping with a cover identity as drifter- workers, or brand new and a little ostentatious for use when posing as diplomats and traders.

GAP-9: There are many handguns that fall under the heading of a GAP-9. The term is derived from Generic Autopistol, 9mm. Weapons are chambered for '9mm Terran', a 9x19mm cartridge said to have originated somewhere on Old Earth. GAP-9s typically have a capacity of 10‚Äì16 rounds and ballistic properties are good when balanced against recoil.

Spacer Ten: The Spacer Ten is a generic self-loading pistol design produced under licence and illegally copied on several worlds. It uses a short 10x15mm round with slightly inferior ballistic properties to the 9x19mm favoured elsewhere but with lower recoil. There are no external projections to snag on a vacc suit or clothing and overall dimensions are small. The weapon has an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves, a de-cocking lever and grip safety but no manual safety devices.

Rattler: The 'Rattler' is a cheap but reliable submachinegun chambered for the same 10x15mm round as the Spacer Ten. It is a common shipboard security weapon with a very high rate of fire, optimised for close quarters fighting in confined spaces. Configuration is standard, with the magazine inserted in front of the trigger assembly. The skeletonised folding stock can be turned 90 degrees to create an elbow hook for one-handed shooting. A standard 28-round combat magazine is normally used but a 64-round double-C extended magazine is available.

##### SPACER TEN

##### RATTLER

###### PSIONIC DECOY

The psionic decoy is a grenade-like device that, when triggered, creates an electronic analogue of a telepathic person crying out for help. At least, it is supposed to. Some decoys do not work at all, some act like stun grenades to any telepath nearby and some do little more than create an unintelligible burst of telepathic static lasting a few seconds. This technology is very much in its infancy and is totally unreliable. When one is used, roll on the Psionic Decoy table.

###### WORKER RIG

The standard working dress for most miners and support personnel consists of a dirty orange coverall

- it may vary in shade from near-yellow to almost-red depending on age and quality ‚Äì with heavy boots, knee protectors and gloves that seal to the wrists. An articulated chest and spine protector carries attachments for tools and equipment, along with rechargeable batteries that can power integral or plug-in tools. All worker rigs have shoulder-mounted lights and a distress beacon.

A face mask with goggles and an integral filter will suffice for use in the tainted atmosphere of Utoland but active mining sites tend to be very dusty. Most workers use a belt-mounted blower unit which takes in air at the belt and filters it before forcing it into the mask with a small fan. This is less tiring than using an inert filter, although of course recharges have to be paid for. Head protection is mandatory for working outside and usually takes the form of a visored helmet with breathing mask built in or a half-visored one to be used with standard filter masks.

**Psionic Decoy**

2D Effect 2‚Äì4 The device does nothing useful. 5‚Äì6 The device creates a burst of telepathic static lasting 2D rounds. This will draw the attention of any telepaths within 50m in much the same way that a strange buzzing sound from the next room might provoke curiosity. 7‚Äì8 The device produces a 50m pulse that feels (to a telepath) like someone inarticulately crying for help. 9‚Äì11 The device produces an intense burst of telepathic interference, potentially stunning any psionically receptive individual within 6m for 1D rounds. An Average (8+) Telepath check (PSI) is required to avoid this. Psions without the Telepathy skill must make an Average (9+) PSI check. 12 The device produces an oddly specific telepathic message or effect, purely by accident. It might make a nearby telepath burst out laughing or become disorientated for a few seconds.

Anyone wearing a worker rig will have a basic tool set, additional light sources and other minor but useful items about their person. Travellers do not have to specify each object beforehand; if it is reasonable they would have it, then they do. All worker rigs have attachment points for cables, allowing safe climbing or lowering without the need to locate the correct equipment. The same attachments are sometimes used for casualty evacuation.

###### ZHODANI MILITARY EQUIPMENT

The occupation company is armed similarly to a front- line rifle unit. The personal weapon issued to most personnel is a TL14 Consular Army Model Laser Carbine, broadly similar to TL11 models common throughout Charted Space, with a few refinements made possible by high technology construction. The weapon uses advanced beam-collimation technology to permit a short overall length whilst keeping a good effective range. This also makes the Zhodani carbine less susceptible to rain and other atmospheric effects.

Army-model carbines use a three-pulse burst, though they can be switched to fire single shots at need. The internal powerpack is in the weapon's stock, creating a light front end which can be brought up and onto target quickly. It is good for 100 bursts, or 120 if single-shot mode is used. This allows the carbine to be used independently of combat armour. An integral cable connects to a vacc suit or combat armour, enabling the weapon to draw on external power if needed. Belt-mounted powerpacks are commonly used by ground troops, feeding into the integral power supply, keeping it topped up. The same cable can connect to a large power storage unit or the output ports of a starship or vehicle. When plugged into combat armour the weapon uses the heads-up sighting system integral to the helmet.

Some personnel are assigned as marksmen and equipped with a long-barrelled laser rifle. Although harder to use in small spaces and when disembarking from vehicles, the Consular Army Model Laser Marksman Rifle is powerful and accurate at long ranges for a laser weapon. Its integral powerpack is good for 20 shots but is normally supplemented with external power. This may come from a feed on a vehicle or a portable power storage unit.

Officers are typically armed with a TL14 laser pistol. It has a short barrel as such weapons go and even with advanced beam collimation its effective range is short. This suits Zhodani doctrine ‚Äì unless immediately threatened, an officer should be leading and directing rather than shorting. The powerpack is in the handgrip and is good for 50 shots, each of which is a three- pulse burst. An emergency setting can be triggered, in which the energy for 10 shots is expended in a series of intense rapid pulses which can overheat and damage the barrel. Unusually for handguns, Consular Army Model Laser Pistols have a skeletonised folding rear support. When extended this locks around the user's forearm to provide additional support and makes it nearly impossible to pull the weapon out of the user's hand. The cuff also carries a connecting cable for an external power supply and is commonly connected to combat armour.

External power packs include a small belt-mounted unit capable of providing 100 shots to a carbine or pistol, or 60 to a rifle. A larger portable unit weighing six kilograms can be carried in a small backpack or dumped out of a vehicle for ground troops to use. These devices have multiple cable connectors and are also used in emergency response situations. A portable powerpack will supply low-draw systems like radios and lights for a long period and is good for 2,500 shots with a carbine or pistol, or 1,800 with a laser rifle.

The concussion grenades used by Zhodani ground troops have tactical applications in combat but may also be used by security forces as a final warning before opening fire. Dazed attackers are easy to round up for questioning. Whenever the use of concussion grenades on 'innocent protestors' is questioned, the Zhodani are genuinely puzzled. The protestors fulfilled their end of the
'bargain' creating the requirement for a robust response and the occupation force did what it said it would. No apologies are ever made and the policy will not change.

Zhodani Trooper combat armour is identical in function to the TL12 combat armour found on page 98 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. Officer Combat Armour is similar but considerably lighter, substituting carbon- tube weave for the smart plastic of the Trooper armour. This is further enhanced with a specialised computer weave and communications system, with an installed Computer/3. This runs Intellect/1 and Expert (electronics (comms)) 2 software, assisting officers with unit coordination and control on the battlefield.

The following information is readily available at most data terminals, although the exact wording may vary if there are local considerations such as bias against certain nobles, governments or business groups. Library data represents what is commonly known, not the whole truth. Some entries are entirely false, although this is rare. Such data tends to get weeded out by routine fact- checking, although there are some persistent myths and falsehoods that just will not go away.

Atran Extraction: Atran Extraction specialises in surface mining, typically using open-cast methods. The firm is notorious for reneging on agreements to limit ecological damage or fill in the scar left by mining once it has finished. Token efforts are usually the most that can be expected unless the owner of the exploited land has powerful legal assets. On the other hand, Atran does treat its workers better than the other mining concerns operating on Utoland.

Demilitarised Zone: As a result of previous treaties, a chain of worlds running from Algebaster and Stave to Digitis and 871-438 is designated a demilitarised zone where Zhodani and Imperial warships can operate but undertake only limited intervention in the affairs of nearby worlds. Major fleet movements are forbidden and treaties require notification of movement involving more than a modest tonnage of military vessels. These stipulations were ignored by the Zhodani Consulate, which used the DMZ to move fleets into striking distance of Regina and Extolay. Having initially bypassed the DMZ, the Consulate intends to gradually secure it with minor forces or by using the Federation of Arden as a proxy.

Federation of Arden: The 'Federation of Arden' may or may not be a political entity, depending on who is consulted. Its basis is in a complex history beginning with colonisation of Arden and nearby worlds during the Long Night. There are records of what might be termed a pocket empire centred on Arden but these are questionable as they exist only on Arden itself. It is probable that the colonised worlds remained in contact using colony ships but entered a technological decline resulting in the loss of starflight later in the Long Night.

The population of these worlds lost touch with their Vilani heritage over the centuries and are recorded as being 'neobarbarians' by the first explorers from the Third Imperium to discover them. That term can have many meanings and does not necessarily indicate low technology or a lack of civilised values. Settlers from the expanding Imperium are known to have reached Arden around 290, although details on how well they were integrated are sketchy. Arden joined the Imperium after the First Frontier War but became independent after the Third.

Ever since independence, in 986, Arden has been reinventing itself in two ways. It promotes its port as a neutral location for contact between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. Some of this is official but more commonly Arden acts as a back-channel conduit for diplomacy and host for contact at a lower level. This typically means cross-border trade, not all of a legal nature.

The other reinvention is as the head of the 'Federation of Arden', whose existence is debatable. It is not officially recognised by the Imperium, the Consulate, nor most of the governments Arden claims are members, and indeed the nature of the Federation seems to change depending on the current agenda. At present the Federation is presented as a framework of trade agreements and assistance treaties with no political requirements, although Arden likes to present the Federation as a political bloc when it thinks it can get away with the statement.

It may be that the Federation of Arden remains a political fiction but it is unofficially recognised by some business groups and shipping lines. Arden has manoeuvred itself into a position where it can negotiate on behalf of 'Federation members' who are given incentives not to dispute the arrangement. This is costing Arden a great deal of money but seems to be working. Each new client that recognises Arden as first among equals in its little corner of space is a step towards the creation of a formal polity.

# LIBRARY DATA

One policy currently being pursued is the acquisition of starships, including low-cost patrol ships to increase security and create the impression of a political union that can defend itself. Most, however, are trade vessels which are mostly assigned to regular runs among 'member' worlds or to special projects. There is big money on offer by the standards of independent shipbuilders. Imperial megacorporations have not been so keen ‚Äì Arden is small fry by their standards and does not appear to favour suppliers with close ties to any of the major powers.

At the time of this adventure, the Federation of Arden has been formally recognised by the Zhodani Consulate and is attempting to secure control over surrounding worlds.

Khigur and Andrews Incorporated: Khigur and Andrews is a general mining and minerals corporation with a preference for shaft or tunnel mining on-planet or in a planetoid field. Its asteroid mining arm is smaller but more prestigious than its on-planet holdings and receives a higher grade of personnel. Being 'dropped' to a ground-mining installation is a common punishment for incompetence or disruptive activities like trying to start a union. Attitudes towards welfare and safety vary between the two arms, with the space-mining community generally being highly professional and well looked after, whilst ground-borers have a bad reputation for avoidable accidents. There are suspicions that it is the firm's management and policies, rather than the workforce, to blame for this poor safety record.

Riverland Wall: The Riverland Wall is a popular term for the chain of Zhodani-held worlds extending from Cronor into the Jewell subsector. The 'wall' contains several naval installations and is heavily patrolled, with cruiser and battle squadrons in reserve. In wartime, the systems of the wall would serve as a tripwire or breakwater for Imperial forces but its political and strategic value is much greater than this.

Few civilian ships are capable of more than jump-2, making it necessary to go 'across the wall' or take a long detour in order to get from Imperial space to the systems coreward of Riverland. This does not stop naval vessels and diplomatic couriers jumping over Zhodani-held systems but it does reduce the amount of Imperial trade ships and independent vessels operating in the area. This in turn limits Imperial cultural and political influence, and makes it difficult to infiltrate intelligence-gathering vessels posing as legitimate traders.

It is possible to cross the wall, calling at the Zhodani- held ports along the way but it serves as a partial barrier and a means to monitor Imperial shipping. Imperial-registered vessels are routinely inspected ‚Äì often quite closely ‚Äì which both deters many shipping operators and creates an opportunity to discover any covert mission the vessel may be engaged in.

The Narval-Nerewhon transit is the only option for jump- 2 capable vessels whose captains do not want to pass through Zhodani space for whatever reason. This forces the vessel to make a long haul through backwater systems with little economic value and where piracy has at times been common. In recent years, the Imperial Navy has taken to jumping ships across the wall to police these systems and the Zhodani have responded by clamping down on piracy in the region.

The naval bases of the Riverland Wall were used as jumping-off points for the Riverland Campaign, in which massed Zhodani fleets attempted to encircle the Jewell Salient and capture a large area of Imperial space, including several major naval bases. At the time of this adventure, there is heavy fighting in the region but some memories stored in the overlay machine are from a time of tense peace before the war.

Tavrchedl': The Tavrchedl' or 'Guardians of Our Morality', are sometimes referred to as the Thought Police by Imperials. They do have operatives who psionically monitor for the intention to commit a crime but much of what they do is standard observation and investigation. Reports and referrals are often

received from citizens or the offenders themselves and it is believed by many outsiders that Zhodani citizens are taught to think of them as a health service rather than police.

Most interactions result in minor consequences such as advice or referral to a training and social orientation course but the Tavrchedl' are known to take people away for re-education. This is thought to involve psionic processes as well as psychological conditioning. Most Imperials find the idea of the Tavrchedl' to be deeply sinister and suggest that the only reason Zhodani find them acceptable is that they have already been brainwashed.

Ursherer Mining Consortium (UMC): The Ursherer Mining Consortium is owned by some of the richest members of The Arden Society and is widely considered one of the driving forces in the creation of the Federation of Arden. UMC does wholly operate some of its mining sites but generally finds it preferable to subcontract the actual extraction of minerals. The firm invests in infrastructure and facilities which smaller companies cannot afford, allowing small mining firms to get established and grow but always at the price of economic dominance by UMC. In the case of Utoland, UMC is the world government in all but name, with administration of the planet run more or less as a subsidiary.

There is no big cash payoff in Flashpoints. The Travellers are rewarded by getting their possessions and personalities back, and more importantly by witnessing great events. Perhaps they are able to guide some of those events, at least to an extent. This is the real reward in a roleplaying game; having an adventure in which the Travellers are captains of their own fate.

The Travellers may end up in possession of Rock Twelve and the personality overlay machine, which is an extremely powerful tool if they are clever enough to make good use of it. There are other ways the Travellers can benefit from their adventures. For example, they could take the data Rock Twelve has obtained to one side or the other; maybe even both. The intelligence services would pay well for close observations of enemy vessels or combat between them. The Imperial authorities will reclaim Rock Twelve if they find out the Travellers have it but of course it is a covert-operations ship. Smart Travellers may be able to stay off the Imperial radar and keep the vessel.

The most devastating thing the Travellers could do is to tell the Zhodani about the personality overlay machine, or give them a working example. If the claim it exists is taken seriously, the Travellers will be psionically scanned to see if they are telling the truth. Just knowing personality overlay is possible gives the Zhodani an immense advantage in exposing Imperial intelligence operatives. If they get a working machine they may be able to figure out how to bypass the overlaid personality on a routine basis, making the process useless to the Imperials.

Such an action will result in Imperial intelligence operations being seriously compromised, with many agents killed or captured. The Zhodani would handsomely reward those who made this possible, showering them with gifts and public adulation.

Concrete proof the device exists and works would be worth a million Credits per Traveller. Handing over the device nets the Travellers the same, plus the use of a small Zhodani starship with upkeep paid for anywhere in the Consulate. The Travellers would also be given identification documents stating they are good and loyal friends to the Consulate. These will garner them respect and access in Zhodani-controlled areas similar to that awarded to highly decorated military veterans. Of course, the Travellers would be hunted by Imperial assets and are unlikely to be popular amongst ordinary citizens if word gets out but the choice is theirs.

After the adventure is over, the Travellers must decide what to do next. They might go to Regina, which is under attack, or continue their journeys elsewhere. The Referee can use the personality overlay machine to run other adventures; the Travellers have flashbacks from other overlay personalities and pseudo-remember what happened. This could be used to run very different styles of adventure as a change of pace. Most pseudo-memories are rather serious but the Travellers might find themselves in a sort of cartoon universe or a nightmare they must find a way out of. These flashbacks can be used by the Referee to show the Travellers historical events leading to their present circumstances.

The Travellers may eventually discover that INS Elupemir does not return from her mission. They are in possession of footage of her action at Tremous Dex, which would be of interest to naval historians and the intelligence services. Families of crewmembers might be grateful for information on her last sightings and may take some comfort in seeing their loved ones' ship in victorious combat. Her eventual fate remains unknown for many years... unless the Travellers choose to go looking for her.

Subsequent events are, as always, at the discretion of the Referee and the Travellers.
