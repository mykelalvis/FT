Heraldia is a trinary system with three red dwarf stars, the largest of which is in distant circumbinary orbit around the smaller two, which orbit each other around a common center of mass. There are two key worlds in the system: Heraldia and Gyga. Heraldia orbits Uli-Beta, the second largest star in the system, while the gas giant Gyga orbits Uli-Alpha, the largest of the three red dwarves.

Heraldia was once a strategically important world of the Interstellar Confederacy and bore the brunt of the assault from the Sylean Federation during the war between the two powers. To avoid the long end-around through Velpare, Sylean squadrons often entered the fray at Heraldia. Confederacy forces were stretched thin trying to defend both Heraldia and Gyga. The battles around Gyga left dozens of wrecks behind, most of which have plummeted into the gas giant's gravity well over the centuries. The few that remain have been preserved and converted into war memorials and tourist attractions. Heraldia itself also bears the scars of the war. Its atmosphere was tainted with fallout from the orbital bombardment of its cities and its hydrosphere was virtually eliminated, leaving the world a desert wasteland. Heraldians were forced into domed and subterranean structures to survive the intense stellar radiation from the system's three suns. Life is hard on Heraldia but even after 1,200 years the descendants of those who fought here have a solemn pride in their ancestry.

Many worlds celebrate war-time glories but few do so with the fervour of Heraldia. Just about every particle accelerator burn, nuclear crater, blasted grav tank and wrecked structure has been marked as a historical site. At the extremes, the dropped plasma rifles and suits of combat armor worn by key war heroes have been preserved under transparent plasteel right where they fell in action. Heraldians chafe at the suggestion that they have gone overboard worshipping the sites of their ancestors' sacrifices. Martyrdom is big business on Heraldia and the world attracts millions of tourists each year. During peak months, the tourist population outnumbers the planet's permanent residents.
