Information about the Zhodani is hard to come by and not always reliable, but it seems they arrived on their homeworld ([[Zhdant]]) about 300,000 years ago. They were brought from [[Terra]] by the [[Ancients]], who settled them and undertook a range of incomprehensible acts including remodelling mountains and cutting, then refilling, ocean trenches. They also reportedly built a city on the moon of [[Zhdant]].

Soon afterwards, perhaps as little as a few hundred years, [[Zhdant]] came under severe orbital bombardment. It is thought that the Ancient cities and other sites were destroyed using several hundred megatons of nuclear explosives, as well as deadfall ordnance (objects dropped from orbit as kinetic weapons) and other unidentified weapons. Modern [[Zhodani]] are descended from a few tens of thousands of survivors, who were cast back to barbarism. There are no records of survivors among the Ancients.


They are currently governed as/by the [[Zhodani Consulate]].


> [!note]+ Creating Zhodani Travellers
> -- From [[Behind the Claw]]
> Viewed with fear by other races, the Zhodani are believed to harbour powerful psionic talents within a terrible and oppressive society.
>
> Organised into three social classes (nobles, intendants and proles), the Zhodani are humans who have developed and embraced a psionic potential that encompasses every level of their society.
>
> ### Characteristics
>
> Zhodani Travellers have no modifiers applied to their characteristics. However, every Zhodani is tested as a child for psionic potential and so has a PSI characteristic rolled for using 2D as with any other characteristic, before any others are rolled for.
>
> A Zhodani Traveller with PSI 9+ increases their SOC to 10 if it is lower than 10, as proles with high psionic potential are automatically elevated to intendants.  Furthermore, education is not encouraged among proles and EDU can never be higher than SOC. If a Zhodani Traveller has SOC 10+, increase their EDU to 8 if it is lower than 8.

> ### Psionic Training
>
> Zhodani undergo [[TravellerCore#Psionics|psionic training]] before they begin a career (effectively before their first term).
>
> ### Careers
>
> The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Zhodani: Agent, Army, Entertainer, Merchant, Navy, Scholar.
>
> More Zhodani careers will be added to Traveller in the future.
