[[Droyne]] can be encountered all over [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], although not commonly. There are a few communities on various worlds, mostly in isolated areas, and several ships that move around according to whatever agenda they may have.

There are two Droyne-owned worlds in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]; [[Candory]] and [[Andor]]. Both lie close together in the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]], where only jump-3 ships can reach them, and both are interdicted by strong [[Imperial Navy]] squadrons for reasons that are classified. Most believe the interdiction is related to [[Droyne]] use of [[psionics]], which is disapproved of by the [[Imperium]]. Authorities decline to comment when asked.

Droyne ships come and go from these two worlds and are sometimes sighted in ports across [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and beyond. There is also some civilian access, mainly to trade ships with special permits in place. However the [[Droyne]] themselves, like those living in small enclaves on various worlds in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], do not seem to be very interested in outside contact.

It is possible to visit the same Droyne _oytrip_ (community) on several occasions and receive a different reception each time. The Droyne do not explain themselves to outsiders and are something of a mystery, even to the experts who study them. To the average Traveller, they are incomprehensible.
