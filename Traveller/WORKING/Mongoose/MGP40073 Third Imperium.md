# INTRODUCTION

The Third Imperium is the primary empire of Charted
Space, spread out over a vast region of space,
consisting of all or part of 28 sectors, an empire of over
11,000 worlds inhabited by over 18 trillion sophonts of
various human and alien races.

Many Travellers are familiar with the Spinward
Marches and its neighboring sectors, Deneb, the
Trojan Reach and Reft. These sectors are on the
frontier, located ‘behind the Claw’ of the Great Rift,
a massive region devoid of stars that separates the
domain from the heart of the Imperium. While the
Marches are mostly Imperial territory, they are far
from the Imperial core. Others may be familiar with
the Solomani Rim, the origin sector of Humaniti. A
little more than a century ago, the Imperium fought
the greatest war in its 1,000-year history against
the Solomani, conquering a quarter of its territory
including Terra itself. In modern times, the Imperium
remains in Solomani space as an occupying force.

Core sector, the seat of empire, is a far different place.
These are the hallowed grounds where the Third
Imperium was born from the ashes of the Long Night.
The drama of Imperial history has played out in this
storied sector and it has the scars to show for it. Core
has endured dynastic crises, betrayals, assassinations,
a civil war that nearly tore it apart and the agony of
defeat in war. It has also experienced rebirth, survival,
astrographic and economic growth, the ascendance
of dozens of Emperors, technological advancement
and the joy of victory over worthy foes. The crucible of
time has burned away the utopian dreams of its first

Emperor and yet his Imperium lives on. At its heart, the
Imperium was intended to be a sprawling free-trade
zone, its worlds free to chart their own fates within well-
defended borders. This it has achieved. The Imperium
has proven to be a worthy successor to the previous
great empires.

The Imperium is an immense polity with a complex
history. Within these pages, Referees and Travellers
alike will find a detailed history of the Imperium and
descriptions of its military forces, the feudal nobility
who administer its worlds, the megacorporations that
dominate its economy and other aspects of Imperial
society. Also contained herein is a complete description
of Core sector, the heart of the Imperium and the
location of its grandiose capital. Core is a remarkably
diverse and turbulent place where Travellers will find
abundant opportunities for adventure.

Amid all of the history, world data and background
information, there are new playable alien and minor
human races, weapons and gear, vehicles and
starships. All of these can be used to add colour and
detail to any Traveller campaign.

Who Should Read This Book
The Third Imperium is written primarily with the Referee
in mind. All of the information contained herein can be
used by the Referee to run an adventure or campaign
anywhere in Imperial space but most especially Core
sector. Most of its world, starship and equipment
descriptions do not include spoilers that will ruin the

enjoyment of a gaming session for Travellers. However,
it does contain some secrets, patron encounters and
other elements, which the Referee might prefer to keep
from the Travellers to enhance their enjoyment of the
game. Nevertheless, the book does have volumes of
information that Travellers might enjoy reading and
allowing them to obtain this knowledge before a gaming
session might enhance their experience and prevent the
Referee from having to narrate the various bits of history,
library data and other factoids. For Travellers who want
to read _The Third Imperium_ , most of the sections leading
up to Core sector are safe territory. Avoid reading any
patron encounters or NPC descriptions so that the
Referee may use them. Most of the world descriptions in
the Core sector section are safe to read as well but there
are secrets and interesting facts sprinkled within those
pages that Referees might want to surprise Travellers
with. Consult the Referee before delving into the various
subsector and world descriptions.

Conventions
This book uses a number of conventions that require
explanation. The Third Imperium refers to the third great
human empire, which has now lasted for over 1,
years. Its predecessors were the Ziru Sirka and the
Rule of Man, now nominally called the First and Second
Imperiums, respectively. In the Vilani language, Ziru
Sirka means Grand Empire of the Stars. This empire
lasted for many thousands of years, predating Terran
starflight by several millennia. The Rule of Man was its
successor state, established by Terran conquerors who
defeated the decaying Ziru Sirka during the Interstellar
Wars. The Terrans and their progeny eventually came
to call themselves Solomani, a name that invoked their
star of origin but also reflected that after a few centuries
they hailed from many worlds and were no longer just
Terrans. The Third Imperium is often simply called the
Imperium since it refers to the current human empire.

In _Traveller_ , Humaniti consists of a broad panoply of
subspecies. It is believed that an alien race known
as the Ancients came to Terra approximately 300,
years ago, took samples of _homo sapiens_ and spread
them throughout Charted Space. In some cases, these
humans were genetically engineered to survive on
alien worlds or to serve the Ancients in some capacity.
In others, they were left to evolve on their own, subtly
affected by the unique environments of their various
worlds. The entirety of the human species and its
myriad subspecies is called Humaniti. The Solomani,
Vilani and Zhodani are the three human subspecies
that developed jump drive technology independently,
earning them Major Race status. Other human
subspecies are Minor Races.

Charted Space refers to the interstellar region that is
inhabited by Humaniti and hundreds of alien races.
The entire region is, in fact, only a small portion of the
Sagittarian Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Vast expanses
of uncharted and only recently explored space lie
beyond its borders. Charted Space is divided into
distinct regions and polities. The generally accepted
measurement of space is the parsec, approximately
3.26 light years in distance. Astrocartographers have
divided Charted Space into regions called sectors,
which are 40 parsecs long by 32 parsecs wide. Sectors
are subdivided into 16 subsectors, each of which
encompass an area 10 parsecs long by eight wide.
The entirety of Charted Space contains 128 sectors
and over 80,000 stars, many of which are orbited
by inhabited worlds. The Imperium later created
subdivides of its territories called domains, each of
which includes four sectors, but this was a political
division, not an astrographic one.

Galactic directions are sometimes referenced in this
book. There are four directions on maps of Charted
Space. Coreward is in the direction of the galactic
core or the top of the map. Rimward is in the direction
of the galactic rim or the bottom of the map. Spinward
indicates the direction in which the galaxy is spinning
or the left of the map. Finally, trailing indicates the
direction in which the spiral arm is extended or the
right of the map.

While there are hundreds of alien races, there are
only six that are considered to be Major Races. These
are Humaniti, Aslan, Vargr, K’kree, Hivers and Droyne.
Hundreds of Minor alien races, most of which have
been gifted jump technology by the Major Races over
the centuries, also travel the stars but none have large
interstellar empires that measure up to those of the
Major Races.

Each of the Major Races has its own dating system
but this book uses that of Humaniti, specifically the
Imperial Calendar. The Imperium measures time in
years, which consist of 365 days of 24 hours each.
The first day of the year is called Holiday and the
remainder of the year is divided into seven-day
weeks, whose days are called Wonday, Tuday,
Thirday, Forday, Fiday, Sixday and Senday. The
current year is 1105, the 1,105th year of the Third
Imperium. Historical records referring to events
that occurred before the Imperium was founded are
shown as negative numbers. For example, Cleon I,
the first Emperor of the Third Imperium, was born in
the year -57.

Introduction

# IMPERIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The Third Imperium covers a broad expanse of space
that includes distinct regions, peoples and cultures.
However, there are certain norms and standards
consistent across Imperial space. The first of these is
language. While many human and alien races speak
their own native languages, Galanglic is the official
language of the Imperium. Galanglic is descended from
Terran English but has changed significantly in the
millennia since Terrans first took to the stars.

The governments of Imperial worlds are independent.
There is no uniform Imperial style of government
or guidelines for how to govern a world. However,
the Imperial bureaucracy is present on most of its
worlds, run by the nobility. Nobles serve as Imperial
administrators, collecting taxes, interfacing with other
Imperial agencies such as the navy and scouts, and
making sure that the worlds of the Imperium abide by
its laws. Each world also has its own legal system;
the laws of each world can be very different. Some
worlds have highly codified, stringent legal systems on
which it is quite easy for Travellers to run afoul of the
law. Others have few or no laws at all. The Imperium
does not impede upon the laws of its worlds unless
they conflict with Imperial law. Imperial law is mostly
vague, allowing the Emperor to alter it depending on
circumstances but some Imperial laws are immutable.

The Imperial Credit, or simply the Credit, is the
currency of the Imperium. There may be some
instances in which barter or local currencies exist on
various worlds but the currency of interstellar trade and
commerce is the Credit.

The Imperium is a diverse and cosmopolitan place. It
is home to two Major Races, dozens of Minor Races
and to many individuals from among the other Major
Races who have immigrated to the Imperium from
their own polities. Generally speaking, the Imperium
is a welcoming and accepting place for all of them.
There are xenophobic cultures that might take issue
with foreign humans or aliens on their worlds, usually
backwaters and low-population worlds that see little
interstellar traffic that are less accustomed to the
diverse nature of the Imperium surrounding them. Even
in the heart of the Imperium, pockets of such worlds

exist. Likewise, Travellers might witness isolated acts
of racism and intolerance here and there but overall the
varied array of human and alien races are accepted
as part of life in the Imperium. There is mutual respect
and tolerance between most sophonts who see little
difference between each other regardless of the
fact that many Minor Races look and behave quite
differently from the human majority.

Imperial culture is varied and its worlds can be quite
different from one another, even those only a few
parsecs apart. Religion, fashion, sport, entertainment
and other aspects of culture differ from world-to-world.
Imperial worlds do have some things in common: trade
and the presence of the Imperial military and nobility.
Each of these institutions imports ideas, styles of
dress and cultural norms that are often mimicked by
the societies of Imperial worlds, especially those more
open to interstellar culture. Imperial culture is also
defined by its contrasts with neighboring human and
alien polities. For example, the Zhodani embrace the
use of psionics but they are anathema in the Imperium.
Likewise, the stark differences seen in Aslan, Vargr and
other alien cultures contrast with Imperial culture, more
sharply defining it.

Trade
Trade is the lifeblood of the Imperium. At its heart, the
Third Imperium is a federation of worlds unified by
free trade and open communication. The first Emperor
established the empire based on the notion that free
trade would enrich its citizens and bring civilization to its
worlds. The history of the Imperium has proved him right.

The majority of trade revenue is earned by
megacorporate and sector-wide merchant lines that run
freight operations along the major trade routes. These
routes primarily serve worlds with high populations
and other factors that give them importance. Trade
goods are transported aboard megafreighters in the
multi-10,000-ton range. However, the trade routes only
serve 10 percent of Imperial worlds. The remaining 90
percent get their goods from subsector merchant lines,
interface lines and tramp traders.

The tramp trader is the bottom rung of the food chain
but operating such a ship is a romanticised enterprise.
The captains of tramp traders are their own bosses,
plying interstellar space in Type-A free traders or
Type-A2 far traders, picking up small freight and mail
lots when possible, carrying and serving passengers,
and speculating on cargoes that may or may not be in
demand at the next port. It is a difficult life, made more
so by the constant need for an influx of Credits to pay
the starship mortgage. Most of them would not have it
any other way. Tramp traders do not have to leave the
trade routes to do well. In spite of the fact that the big
merchant lines gobble up most of the business, there
is work to be had by small traders. There are many
niche and underserved markets hidden away on the
worlds of the trade routes. Most tramp traders spend
time on the main routes and veer off them when profits
beckon elsewhere.

Secondary routes and stellar clusters are also served
by the tramp trader community but many of these
attract mid-sized lines, which appoint subsidized
merchant starships to serve them on an experimental
basis. The most popular spacecraft for such trade
missions is the 400-ton Type-R subsidized merchant,
affectionately called the ‘fat trader’ or ‘subby’ by people
in the business. If running a subsidized merchant
reveals that profits are there to be had, an interface or
subsector line will eventually invest in a secondary or
cluster route, turning its worlds into regular stops.

Trade is not always solely motivated by immediate
profits. In the early days of the Imperium, even when
the distance travelled between worlds was too great
for trade to be immediately profitable, technological
exchange proved to be beneficial for both parties.
Many of the early Imperial trade missions were run
at a loss, with the intention of seeding the routes to
distant worlds with outposts and colonies. By exporting
technology to distant worlds, early traders gave them
the means to start producing high-tech goods of their
own. Eventually, such societies made technological
advancements and learned to produce things that
the worlds at the heart of the Imperium could use.
As the populations and economies of the worlds in
between began to rise and Imperial borders expanded,
the distant worlds that the Imperium had invested in
became valued trading partners.

An ancillary benefit of trade missions was cultural
exchange. Visiting distant worlds enabled Imperial
traders to establish common ground with peoples and
cultures that had not been a part of interstellar society
for centuries. The day would come when they would
be asked to join the empire. The less foreign and alien
the Imperium seemed, the more likely these worlds
would be willing to become full-fledged members. Such
missions are still undertaken along the frontiers of the
Imperium, although there are far fewer unincorporated
worlds in Charted Space in modern times.

Imperial Society and Culture

TRAVELLER

The spirit of free trade on the frontiers lives on with the
exploratory trade companies. Spinward Marches-based
corporations like Barracai Technum and McClellan
Factors operate armed Leviathan -class merchant
cruisers in the backwaters and beyond their borders.
These spacecraft are over 1,000 tons in size and
designed to travel into potentially hazardous regions in
order to establish contacts with new trading partners.
Merchant cruisers have relatively small cargo holds,
in which they carry wares from civilised space meant
to serve as enticements to join the trade community.
Frontier trade also attracts interest from the intelligence
community. Merchants operating on the fringe garner
the attention of various agencies that want information
about what is happening beyond Imperial borders.

Developmental trade missions and burgeoning new
routes are not limited to the frontiers. Old routes
closer to the heart of the Imperium frequently die
out and new ones take their place. It often depends
on which of the big industrial worlds are producing
the top products at a given time. When a middling
or struggling industrial world suddenly makes a
breakthrough, or just lucks into a market that becomes
hot, traffic shifts to accommodate the trend. There
are big profits to be made for merchants who read
the tea leaves correctly and beat everyone else to
new markets. The trends are always shifting and the
most successful traders are those who catch the wave
before their competitors see it coming.

Technology
The Imperium benefits from the highest technology
in Charted Space. They are in rare company, having
achieved TL15. Only the K’kree of the Two Thousand
Worlds, Hive Federation and some polities of the
Vargr Extents have matched this level of achievement.
The Aslan Hierate, Zhodani Consulate and Solomani
Confederation are standardised on a slightly lower Tech
Level of 14. The single level of advantage is significant,
with TL15 granting the ability to manufacture jump-
drives, significantly more output from fusion power
plants and many other innovations.

Imperial scientific agencies, the military and
corporations are pushing the envelope to the next
Tech Level. A few worlds have already achieved the
next technological milestone. The industrial world
of Vincennes in Deneb, the research station at
Pashus also in Deneb and the tech-focused colony at
Gannvair in Fornast have each risen to TL16. At this
level, independent artificial intelligence, antimatter

energy production, brain transplants, miniaturization
of previous technologies and resultant improvements
in communications and weapons technologies
become available.

Imperial culture embraces the judicious use of artificial
intelligence to produce wondrous technologies and
manage massive populations in the tens of billions.
There are numerous safeguards in place to ensure
the safety of this technology but innovation is always
being pushed to the limit. At the Imperial Naval Base
on Celetron, there are experiments under way to
create the first fully autonomous starships. The Ye-
lu system has taken it a step further by automating
an entire world. The Saregon system has foregone
traditional government and allowed an AI computer
to govern billions of sophonts. The fear of unbridled
technology persists but the pressure to remove
constraints is strong.

While there is always a race to reach new heights of
technology, the Imperium is a diverse society whose
primary cultural influences come from the Vilani and
Solomani. Dating back to the age of the Ziru Sirka,
the Vilani have preached caution in the development
and use of technology; meanwhile the Solomani
have always emphasised continuous innovation and
advancement. The two are at cross purposes but their
divergent philosophies have found ways to coexist.
Both Vland and Terra are at the Imperium’s maximum
Tech Level of 15. Despite the constant drumbeat of
progress, the Imperium does exercise caution in key
fields of research and development in an effort to keep
technological development under control and prevent
potentially dangerous technologies from proliferating
across Imperial borders.

Law
There are three types of law in Imperial space:
•  Planetary law – Each world is empowered to
author its own laws that establish everything
from the enforcement of petty infractions to
high crimes like murder, kidnapping, extortion
and theft.
•  Subsector law – The primary purpose of
subsector law is to ensure that star systems
do not exert undue oppression or cruelty upon
one another. To an extensive degree, star
systems are allowed to influence and control
each other but when it impedes economic
growth, threatens trade or opposes the
interests of the Imperium, subsector-level
authorities may intervene.
Imperial Society and Culture

•  Imperial law – Crimes such as treason, revolt,
tax evasion and undue violence between
worlds using weapons of mass destruction
invokes Imperial law, enforced by Imperial
military forces.

Few Imperial laws are codified, with most left
deliberately vague. The Imperium is an immense polity
with widespread and diverse populations. What works
in the spinward region of the empire might not apply to
trailing or for that matter between two worlds that are a
few parsecs apart.

There is a significant grey area in Imperial law when
it comes to the rules of war. Simply put, the Imperium
allows belligerent forces to engage in war with one
another provided they do not break the immutable
Imperial laws, free trade is not impeded, and undue
cruelty or oppression is not inflicted on one side or
the other. Imperial law may also be invoked if a war
between nations or worlds escalates and threatens
to spread to a larger cluster of systems or an entire
subsector. Other than that, war is considered to be
a necessary outlet for aggression that should not
be suppressed. Doing so can create an even worse
situation in which a drawn-out cycle of terrorism,
sabotage, assassination, insurrection and subterfuge
create a long-term problem. While wars inevitably
result in an unfortunate loss of life and a great deal
of property damage, they can sometimes produce
solutions in far less time with fewer casualties and a
reduced negative effect on the local economy. The
Imperium is quick to point out that this allowance is
not an endorsement of war. Quite the opposite. The
nobility does what it can to create diplomatic channels
and mediation between opposed sides. Should a
conflict escalate to war, it is not above the Imperium
to pick sides. Assistance to one side or the other
may sometimes be granted when it is deemed in the
empire’s best interests.

Solomani and Vilani
The majority of Imperial citizens are human and come
from a variety of subspecies but the most prevalent are
the Vilani and Solomani. The Vilani, who came from
Vland, discovered jump drive technology thousands
of years before Terra and built the largest interstellar
empire in the history of Charted Space. Just as that
empire began to falter, the Terrans aggressively came
onto the scene and swept the Ziru Sirka away during
the Interstellar Wars. Having become an interstellar
people themselves, the descendants of the Terrans
became known as the Solomani, meaning ‘men of Sol’.

The Vilani and Solomani have slight physical
differences despite having evolved on different worlds
for hundreds of thousands of years but culturally
they are quite different. Because of the challenges
posed by living on a world that was not their own, the
Vilani became a conservative people who favored
cautious resource management and tradition over
unbridled innovation. Conversely, the Solomani were
more aggressive, uninhibited in their advancement of
science and technology. After the Solomani conquered
the Ziru Sirka and declared the Rule of Man, the
two human subspecies and their cultures became
irrevocably intertwined.

After thousands of years of coexistence, Vilani and
Solomani have found common ground. Social and
physical intermixing has created a hybrid in which
tenets of both cultures are present. The divisions
between them are as evident as they have always
been but they have learned to cooperate, leveraging
advantages of both cultures to make a better Imperium.
This is not to say that conflicts do not arise. Situations
inevitably come up in which Vilani and Solomani
values directly clash with one another. However, such
occurrences are increasingly rare.

It is difficult to say which culture holds greater sway in
modern times. The Vilani had thousands of years to
perfect the art of building and maintaining an empire,
while the Solomani had only a few brief centuries of
experience before they inherited all of Vilani space. The
Solomani had little inkling of what to do next after they
won the Interstellar Wars. Solomani culture was thin
gruel compared with the ancient and highly structured
Vilani civilization. The Rule of Man raped and looted the
First Imperium but were ultimately made students of its
conservative, empire-building ways. To paraphrase the
ancient Terran poet, Horace, ‘Captive Vland captured
her rude conqueror’.

While the Vilani certainly knew a lot about empire
building, the Solomani knew how to give an empire
some teeth. Their embrace of technology and
innovation enabled Humaniti to reach heretofore
unseen levels of technological advancement and
the security that it provides. As Humaniti began to
encounter and conflict with the other Major Races,
it is doubtful it could have survived with the arbitrary
constraints placed upon technological development by
the Vilani.

Despite all of this, there remain several forbidden
realms of technology where the old Vilani caution
creeps in. Foremost among these is artificial

intelligence. The war machines that were left on Vland
by the Ancients, destructive automatons that posed an
existential threat to humans, left their indelible mark
on the culture. The Vilani were driven to reach beyond
their world but also chastened by a history in which
technology was a thing to be feared.

Psionics
The first widespread use of psionics was recorded
during the Long Night, when isolated worlds and pocket
empires validated the practice. Some worlds were even
led by psions or governments that employed them in
advisory roles.

The practice of psionics was mostly viewed as an oddity
in the Third Imperium, despite their growing usage and
acceptance during the first centuries of Imperial history.
Psionic institutes and programs at universities taught
psionically talented individuals how to use their abilities
to read minds, move matter and instantly teleport from
place-to-place. These programs reached a peak in
popularity from about 650 to the mid-700s. However,
a series of psionic scandals rocked the Imperium
in the late 700s, resulting in the public turning upon
psionics and those who used them. The Psionics
Suppressions of the early 800s repressed the use of
psionics and revoked the charters of nearly all psionic
institutes. Psionics became illegal in Imperial space and
practitioners were forced underground.

In the modern era, psionics are still illegal but two
institutes remain in service, one on Wypoc in the
Spinward Marches and the other on Terra. These
institutes purportedly focus on the study of psionic
phenomena to ensure the safety of Imperial citizens
from external forces and foreign states that use them.

Cultural Zones
The Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium
was published in Imperial year 0, claiming that all of
the territory held by the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man
combined was the rightful domain of the Third Imperium.
Using the Warrant for Restoration as its justification,
the Imperium expanded its borders and consolidated its
interior during the Pacification Campaigns.

The Third Imperium managed to integrate most of the
worlds previously held by its predecessors. This was
not accomplished without making sacrifices; inevitably,
the Imperium encountered peoples and cultures
reluctant to join. Circumstances dictated the methods
by which they were coerced.

The Domain of Antares proved to be difficult to conquer
during the Pacification Campaigns and the subsequent
Julian War gained the Imperium no additional ground.
Concessions had to be made to bring the region on
board. A collection of worlds known as the League of
Antares was established as a cultural region in order to
placate the most resistant forces in the domain.

Likewise, in the far-flung Corridor, Gushemege
and Dagudashaag sectors, the Lancian and Amec
Protectorate cultural regions were granted to preserve
distinct cultures that had developed during the nearly
two millennia of the Long Night. The Luriani Cultural
Association was similar. Of all the human Minor Races,
the amphibious Luriani proved to be the most difficult to
assimilate. The Imperium managed to bring them into
the fold over time and granting them their own cultural
region was a necessity.

Not all of the cultural regions were granted as
concessions. Some were established to reward loyal
service to the Imperium. The Vegan Autonomous
District was given as a boon to the alien Vegans,
whose aid to the Imperium was instrumental in its
victory during the Solomani Rim War. The Sylean
Worlds were established to honor the contributions
of the Syleans, whose cultural principles and personal
sacrifices were a crucial part of the foundation upon
which the Imperium was built and maintained.

Additional cultural regions have been proposed
for the Geonee, Suerrat, Darmine and Chanestin.
Outliers in the Imperial nobility have even proposed
the recruitment of polities such as the Darrian
Confederation and Sword Worlds under the auspices
of cultural region grants.

The problem with establishing too many cultural
regions is that it eventually begs the question
of why have an Imperium at all. The entirety of
Imperial space could be subdivided into dozens,
if not hundreds, of distinct cultural regions, each
with their own laws, religions and traditions. In
such a scenario, the Imperium would be reduced
to a loose confederation of worlds. While some
idealists dream of such a thing coming to pass, the
astrographic implications are not kind. The Imperium
is surrounded by the empires of Major Races and
two great human polities: the Zhodani Consulate and
Solomani Confederation. Were the Imperium to allow
itself to be split into myriad cultural regions, it could
become easy prey for its neighbors. The cultural
region controversy is one of the defining issues of
the modern age, one which Emperor Strephon and
Imperial Society and Culture the Moot struggle with on a daily basis.

Interstellar Relations
The Imperium has a complex array of relationships with
the polities on and just beyond its borders. Treaties,
armistices and pacts have guaranteed peace with most
of its neighbors but there remains some enmity with
some of them.

The Zhodani and their Outworld Coalitions have gone
to war with the Imperium four times, the first of which
began in 589 and the most recent one ending in 1084.
In the interim between each war, relations with the
Zhodani have been frigid. The Zhodani believe the
Imperium is encroaching upon their borders and the
Imperium distrusts the Zhodani due to their use of
psionics. It is doubtful that the two sides will ever have
an amicable relationship.

The Julian Protectorate has gone to war with the
Imperium twice, once in the Julian War, which began
in 175, and again over three centuries later in the
Hidden War. Since its founding, the Imperium has laid
claim to the sectors held by the Julian Protectorate
based on the principles established in the Warrant
for the Restoration of the Imperium. However, the
confederated states of the Protectorate have no
intention of joining, nor has the Imperium expressed
any desire to reignite the flames of the only major war it
has ever lost.

Perhaps the greatest threat to peace lies on the
border with the Solomani Confederation. The majority
of Solomani space was integrated into the Imperium
centuries ago but relations declined and Empress
Margaret I was forced to give the region its autonomy.
The Solomani eventually declared full independence,
calling their new state the Solomani Confederation.
After a 12-year war, the two sides signed an armistice
but not before the Imperium had driven a deep wedge
into Solomani space, capturing Terra in the process.
Even after over a century of peace, the Solomani are
smouldering for a rematch but the powerful Imperium
poses a daunting opponent.

The Imperium has a history of conflict with two of the
Major Races – the Aslan and Vargr – and no major
conflicts with the K’kree, Hivers or Droyne. Of the
Major Races, the Imperium shares a border with only
the Vargr Extents. There are comfortable buffer zones
with the rest, most of which contain collections of
independent polities.

The Aslan are an expansionist race united by a
philosophy based on honor, which they call fteir in
their native language of Trokh. During the Long Night,
the Aslan and various human polities fought a series
of Border Wars, which ended in the year 380 with the
signing of the Peace of Ftahalr. Among its tenets, this
treaty provides for a 30-parsec-wide gap between
Imperial and Aslan space. While no major war has
been fought between the two species since the treaty
was signed, the two polities are now in close proximity
to one another in the Trojan Reach. The Aslan continue
to encroach into neutral territory and Imperial Navy
forces in the region are preparing for the worst should a
concerted invasion occur but the two remain peaceable
with one another... for now.

The Imperium has a much more complicated
relationship with the Vargr that dates back to the
era before the Long Night. The Vargr were a major
impediment to the coreward expansion of the Ziru
Sirka; in fact, constant raiding by Vargr corsairs was
a contributing factor to the fall of the First Imperium.
They continued to be a problem for the Rule of Man.
The Third Imperium has gone to war with various
Vargr polities during the Pacification Campaigns,
Julian War, Vargr Campaigns and all four Frontier
Wars. Despite a long history of conflict between the
two races, there are more Vargr Imperial citizens than
any other alien Major Race.

The Imperium maintains relationships with its
neighbors by exchanging embassies with them. The
Imperium has no embassies in the Zhodani Consulate,
Solomani Confederation nor the Julian Protectorate,
but every other interstellar state on the periphery of
the Imperium has at least one embassy. Ambassadors
are typically selected from the ranks of honor nobles
or the diplomatic corps, with a great deal of crossover
between the two.

The Vargr and Aslan present unique challenges for
the diplomatic corps. It would not be practical to send
ambassadors to all of the myriad Vargr states, so only
the most important ones are chosen. The Imperium
is careful to select ambassadors who are seen as
charismatic in the eyes of the Vargr. Ambassadors
are often recalled when a state falters or subsides
in importance, a common event in Vargr space.
Fortunately, the Vargr accept boons and slights much
better than most. The Vargr also have a greater innate
respect for alien cultures. Plurality and variety in the
Vargr Extents lends itself to easier acceptance of
foreign societies.

Imperial Society and Culture

The challenge posed by the easily offended Aslan is
quite the opposite. The Imperium sends a separate
ambassador to each of the 29 Tlaukhu clans, no matter
where they rank in the Hierate. Additional embassies
have been established in Aslan space on interface
worlds and regions of importance.

While the Imperium has no embassy in Zhodani space,
and nor do the Zhodani have one in the Imperium, both
meet on Quar, a neutral Imperial client state located in
the gap between the two polities, in the Cronor of the
Spinward Marches.

Most Solomani worlds refuse to allow the Imperium
an embassy on the grounds that they have
never recognized the existence of the Solomani
Confederation. The Imperium steadfastly refers to the
region as either the Solomani Autonomous Region or
the Solomani Sphere. However, the moderate Boötean
Federation often holds summit meetings between
the two sides on its capital at Hamilcar. Likewise, the
Imperium has invited members of the Solomani Party
and various factions from the Confederation to meet at
the Imperial Centre of Peace and Diplomacy on Terra.

Imperial embassies focus on evangelising their core
values: free trade, peaceable relations and the tenets
of Imperial law. Cultural exchanges and political
conferences are common occurrences. Embassies
are also used for clandestine communication and
espionage functions, although both sides either play
down or deny this to be true.

Ultimately, the Imperium wants trading partners, not
enemies. The empire was founded on the principles
of free trade and the benefits derived from commerce
between worlds. Conflict and war, especially on an
interstellar scale, are expensive activities that the
Imperium works hard to avoid. When war is required,
the Imperial doctrine is to defeat enemy navies and
occupy their worlds, suing for peace after victory
is (hopefully) achieved. Overly destructive orbital
bombardments and the use of weapons of mass
destruction are generally avoided in modern times,
although the Imperium has not outwardly prohibited
such actions and maintains immense arsenals of
nuclear, chemical and other destructive weapons.

Internal Relations
The Imperium is currently at peace, but it is impossible
to keep 11,000 worlds happy all the time. Friction
occurs between sectors of the Imperium, subsectors

of each sector and often between worlds. In the latter
case, squabbles can result in armed conflict, which
are usually resolved by the parties involved without
Imperial interference.

Internal conflicts are localised as best they can
be. Armed conflicts between blocs of worlds or
subsectors are forbidden; such things can easily get
out of hand. The Imperium has suffered one major
revolt, many minor revolts and one civil war over the
course of its history and it acts quickly and decisively
to ensure such things do not happen again.

Rival nobles have conflicts with one another from time to
time but must be careful not to let things escalate lest a
superior noble or even the Emperor becomes involved.
Noble patents and fiefs are not distributed equitably, nor
are worlds or lands granted under enfeoffment always
equivalent in value or prestige. It is not uncommon
for nobles to become envious of each other’s fiefs.
Conflicts are usually resolved through official channels,
but some degree of skulduggery sometimes happens.
Rival nobles are not permitted to declare war on one
another, but they can and sometimes do manipulate
the governments under their administrations into doing
so. Noble conflicts can become personal, sometimes
quite literally. The practice of duelling between individual
nobles is frowned upon, but nonetheless occurs from
time to time.

There are a few hot spots in the Imperium worthy of
mention. The Domain of Deneb has always been a
hotbed for conflict. The duchies of Deneb are highly
contentious with one another and the Spinward
Marches has always felt a bit neglected by Capital. To
express their grievances, not one but two of its Grand
Admirals travelled to Capital during the Civil War to
claim the throne by force. The League of Antares has
always had a strong independent streak. The region
changed hands multiple times during the Pacification
Campaigns and Julian War. Likewise, the Domain of
Ilelish remains a troubled region where a widespread
revolt once had to be put down.

Keeping the Imperium together is a constant
challenge. While the Emperors and the Moot have
done essentially what they set out to do – build a
massive empire based on free trade and the defence
of the space between its worlds – there are many
more issues to deal with. Maintaining unity has
always been the bane of the Emperor’s role and he
must be vigilant lest it slip from his grasp.

# IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

The Imperial military consists of four services: the navy,
marines, army and scout service. Each of the services
has a distinct role in the defence and maintenance of
the empire.

Many would argue that the Imperial Navy is the most
important of the services. It is the glue that holds the
Imperium together, responsible for the defence of its
borders and the enforcement of Imperial law.

The marines are an adjunct to the navy, serving as its
ship’s troops. Starship battles alone do not always win
wars. When the Imperium attacks terrestrial targets, the
marines are its primary assault force the shock troops
who descend from space to establish a landing zone
for other military forces.

The army is the lifeblood of the Imperial military. Each
world recruits its own army from the native population.
When called upon, these planetary armies unite into
a cohesive military force, and may be deployed to
conquered planets where they restore order and keep
the peace.

Without the scouts, the Imperium could not exist in its
current form. The bold explorers of the Scout Service
recontacted hundreds of isolated worlds and pocket
empires during and after the Long Night, and paved
the way for their integration into the Imperium. Today
they continue to survey the Imperium’s many member
worlds, explore outside the Imperium to further its
knowledge and maintain the communications links vital
to maintaining the Imperium itself.

Each of the services are described in greater detail in
the following sections.

Imperial Navy
The Imperium is a union of over 11,000 worlds. The
sectors of the Imperium extend over far too wide
an expanse for the government to exert centralised
authority over its entirety. The Emperor primarily uses
two tools to manage the empire: the nobility and the
Imperial Navy. The feudal structure of the nobility is the
administrative nervous system of the Imperium. The
Imperial Navy patrols its borders and interior, enforces

Imperial law and ensures the secure flow of commerce
between its worlds. In short, the navy’s jobs are to
defend the Imperium from external enemies, rid it of
internal threats such as pirates and smugglers, and
protect the worlds of the Imperium from each other
when necessary.

The Imperial Navy is a vast interstellar military force
with bases spread throughout Imperial space. Most
sectors have a Naval Depot, a dedicated star system
where the navy’s starships are built and serviced.
Generally speaking, the Imperial Navy reserves its
larger ships – carriers, battleships, dreadnoughts
and so forth – for the defence of a sector against
external threats. The navy also maintains numbered
and colonial fleets in most subsectors. Colonial fleets
are smaller and usually composed of ships that would
otherwise have been sent to the breaker yard. These
fleets serve as a reserve and may be called upon to
serve in a variety of capacities when the numbered
fleets are otherwise engaged. Numbered fleets are
also called subsector fleets. Subsectors are feudal
subdivisions of Imperial sectors and subsector navies
are to some degree instruments of the nobility that
manage a given subsector. Numbered subsector
navies give structure to the greater Imperial Navy and
their ships are called upon to serve their respective
sector fleets as needed. Subsector fleets are mostly
composed of destroyer escorts, destroyers, cruisers
and various auxiliary spacecraft. Subsector navies may

the ships of the line and doing whatever is
necessary to keep the mission going.

have larger and older ships of the line in their service
but typically only on a provisional or temporary basis
from the parent Imperial Navy.

Planetary navies are significantly more diverse in
nature and purpose. In principle, a planetary navy
is any collection of spacecraft designated for the
defence of a single world or star system. This includes
system defence boats, fighters, armed traders and
other spacecraft that the system has procured for
its defence. The possession of a planetary navy is a
function of technology and means. Simply put, planets
with the necessary technology and a shipyard capable
of producing spacecraft are more likely to have one.
However, there are worlds of low technology with
no shipyards that nevertheless manage to import a
planetary navy. Generally speaking, systems of TL8+
and a starport of Class C or better have planetary
navies and those below may import one with the means
available to them.

SQUADRON AND FLEET ORGANISATION
The basic unit of the Imperial Navy is the squadron.
There are 3–10 ships in a squadron. This number
refers primarily to capital ships – destroyers, cruisers,
carriers and battleships – auxiliary, support and scout
spacecraft. Squadrons are organised into fleets, most
of which comprise between 3–10 squadrons. Therefore,
a typical fleet includes 50–100 starships. An average
Imperial sector has 1,000 ships in its subsector fleets.

Imperial Military Forces

TRAVELLER

The sector fleet is composed of the largest, most
powerful ships – the heavy carriers, battle tenders,
battleships and dreadnoughts.

The squadrons of the Imperial fleets are supported
by thousands of auxiliary craft, including destroyers,
destroyer escorts, close escorts, frigates, corvettes
and many other specialized spacecraft. In peacetime,
squadrons may be split into task forces or patrols in
order to cover several worlds in a single star system
but in wartime, squadrons rarely split up. They maintain
tight formation in order to deliver the most powerful
attacks possible.

NAVY BASES AND DEPOTS
The Imperial Navy maintains a system of bases
and depots. Bases include repair and maintenance
facilities, resupply stations, administrative offices and
housing for personnel who are on shore duty, being
transferred between ships or spending time in port
while their ships are serviced. Generally speaking,
planetside naval bases service ships of 1,000 tons
or less while larger ships are seen only at orbital
facilities. Navy bases are common in Imperial space,
typically with several in each subsector on selected
worlds with Class A or B starports.

Depots are allocated one per sector with two
exceptions. Delphi sector has two and the Spinward
Marches has none. Depots provide extensive repair
and construction facilities and can service large
portions of the fleet at any given time. Depots always
feature Class A starports since shipyards must be
present. Rarely restricted to a single world, most depots
utilise multiple planets in a single star system. They
are secure facilities and generally inhabited by naval
personnel and civilian contractors only. New starship
prototypes are often being built and tested at depots,
so access is highly restricted. One must be a member
of the navy or have special permission to enter a depot
system. For a complete description of Core sector
Depot, located in the Mekee subsector, see page 144.

IMPERIAL QUARANTINE AGENCY
The Quarantine Agency is a semi-autonomous
force integrated into the Imperial Navy. Its primary
role is to protect the empire from internal threats by
quarantining worlds.

Early in Imperial history, the Quarantine Agency was
an independent service with its own fleet of ships but it
was eventually thought more cost-effective to make it a

branch of the navy. At its height, the agency commanded
approximately 10 percent of the navy’s ships but that
number has since dwindled. With increasing technology
and automation, fleet elements can easily be annexed
by the agency as needed and assigned to handle
whatever mission needs to be done.

The Quarantine Agency was at one time more or less
equally divided into military and administrative offices
but in modern times the balance has shifted to the
administrative side.

During the early centuries of Imperial history, the
Quarantine Agency was involved in many operations
that required the ‘cleansing’ of entire worlds. If a world
was determined to be an existential threat to the
empire, naval elements interdicted the affected planet
and then bombarded it with capital ship armaments
and large bolides if a planetoid belt or similar resources
were present.

The Imperium has improved its ability to interdict worlds
over the centuries and cleansing operations are now
few and far between. However, the vigilant Quarantine
Agency keeps a watchful eye on all of Imperial space
and is always prepared to run a cleansing operation
should one be deemed necessary.

QUARANTINE AGENCY TRAVELLERS
The Quarantine Agency has a parallel structure
within the Imperial Navy with the same ranks,
although the maximum achievable rank
is commodore. Travellers can be created
by simply having a career in the navy and
declaring that their service was in the
Quarantine Agency.

The agency has an administrative branch
as well. Individuals who serve in the agency
often spend time in both branches. Service in
the administrative branch may be achieved
by serving terms in the Citizen (corporate) or
Noble (administrator) career. While the two
branches are intertwined, their ranks are not
interchangeable. When transferring from one
branch to the other, the Traveller’s rank returns
to 0 in the new branch, effectively starting a
new career.

Imperial Marines
The Imperial Marines are the primary shipborne fighting
force of the Imperium. The marines are steeped
in tradition, having served admirably since year 0.
Imperial Marines are instantly recognizable by their
distinctive combat armor and battle dress. Likewise,
their dress uniform with its maroon tunic, white trousers
and shiny black boots tends to stand out in a crowd.
Marines who have taken part in a jump (orbital assault)
operation wear the drop slash, a small vertical piece of
cloth on the back of the collar, black on field fatigues
and red on the dress uniform tunic.

Historically, marines were an amphibious fighting
force transported into combat zones by a wet navy.
While star marines are not carried aboard ocean-going
ships – although they can be, if necessary – Imperial
Marine units are carried on most naval spacecraft. The
purpose of a marine fighting force is essentially to finish
the job when naval force alone cannot do so. The first
stage of most wars is carried out between starships
but even after one side has defeated the other, the
losing side does not always surrender. Sometimes
an orbital assault is required on a planet, asteroid or
other terrestrial target to finish the job. Marines may
be involved in both stages of such a conflict, first by
raiding enemy spacecraft during a starship battle and
second by serving as jump troops.

Raids are challenging. Taking an enemy starship,
even one that has been disabled, can be a dangerous
undertaking. Marine boarding parties stay in tight
communication with each other and maintain precise
spacing and coordination. Raiding marines arm
themselves with a cutlass, snub pistol, accelerator rifle
or laser carbine and a selection of appropriate hand
grenades. ACRs, gauss rifles and other long guns are
to be avoided since they are difficult to use in the tight
confines of a starship. Raiding a starship is a leap into
the great unknown. The crew might be prepared to
surrender or might be armed to the teeth and intent
on repelling boarders. Marines are always ready to
fight their way into a ship but must also be prepared
to fight their way back out if necessary. As a famous
marine once said, ‘there’s no such thing as retreat but
sometimes you can shoot in all directions’.

Jump troops drop from space with re-entry
capsules, ablative shields, deployment shuttles or other
means in order to spearhead an assault. For more
information about re-entry capsules, see page 46 of
High Guard. After a successful landing, the marines
usually give way to the army, who come in to secure
strategic targets and occupy worlds. In some cases,
marines stay to help. As the saying goes, ‘All marines
are riflemen’ and they are capable infantry.

IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

Marines are organised in regiments of 3,500 for lift
infantry deployments or Marine Expeditionary Forces
(MEFs) of 2,000 for jump-troop operations. MEFs
are austere units that include just enough support
personnel to enable the unit to operate independently
after a drop. The subordinate organizational structure
is the same as the army, except that squads are
called sections.

Powerful noble houses often maintain their own private
marine corps, called lift infantry regiments. For more
information on these, see Lift Infantry Regiments on
page 32.

**BRANCHES OF THE MARINES**
The _Traveller Core Rulebook_ includes three branch
assignments for Travellers in the marines: support, star
marine and ground assault.

Support includes quartermasters, combat engineers,
medics, cavalry and staff. These are the marines who
run the raids, manage the drops and run the command
post during a lift operation. They are also the corpsmen,
the combat medics who patch the infantry back up and
ship them out or put them back into service. Marine units
are accustomed to absorbing a high casualty rate. A
qualified support team is the glue that keeps a regiment
or MEF running after the attrition of war takes its toll. It
should be noted that support staff are equally trained
and capable of picking up a rifle and donning a suit of
combat armor when called upon to do so.

Star marines and ground assault are two sides of the
same coin: infantry. Star marines focus on raiding and
other shipborne operations and ground assault focus on
lift-infantry and jump-troop operations. To some extent,
marines from both branches are interchangeable. They
have similar skills and are trained on the same weapons
and gear for the most part. However, where star
marines rely on instinct, small arms and precise training
regimens, ground assault marines are more skilled in the
use of heavy weapons, military tactics and coordinating
operations with naval transport or marine armor units.

**ENCOUNTERS WITH THE IMPERIAL MARINES**
Running into the Imperial Marines usually means that
the Travellers are somewhere they should not be. If
marines are encountered, they may have either just
completed a mission or are in the process of completing
one. Being caught in the middle of a marine deployment
can be dangerous. Marines performing a jump-troop
operation are a sight to see. Should a group of Travellers
find themselves on a world under siege, the sight of
thousands of ground assault marines dropping from

space could make for an exciting environment. However,
once they hit the ground, the Travellers should make
certain that they do not get caught between the marines
and their target.

Travellers in possession of a starship may also
encounter marines when they are subjected to an
inspection. Most inspections are carried out by planetary
navies, some of whom maintain their own marines.
If the Travellers find themselves being boarded by
Imperial Marines, it typically means they have found
themselves in a critical location or situation. When
visiting worlds that have key Imperial assets – for
example, Capital, Reference or Depot – Travellers are
likely to be subjected to an Imperial Marine inspection.
The Travellers might also encounter the marines after
inadvertently wandering into a star system that is on
high alert. For example, the navy and marines may have
been called upon to quell a revolt or interdict a world.
Depending on the severity of the situation, all ships that
visit the system might be inspected. In such a situation,
the Travellers might want to make certain that they are
not carrying anything in their cargo hold that could be
construed as contraband.

A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY
Patron: Sergeant Laon Kantil, Imperial Marines
103 rd Provisional Expeditionary Force
Mission: After coming out of jump at the
100-diameter limit, the Travellers’ ship is hailed
by a naval cutter, which demands they stand
down and prepare for boarding. The Travellers
might be rattled by the aggressiveness of the
orders they are given. The cutter docks with
their ship and they are subjected to a thorough
inspection by a section of Imperial Marines.
After (hopefully) finding nothing amiss, marine
Sergeant Kantil meets with the Travellers to
extend his apologies. Their ship was identified
on a list of possible smugglers; apparently, a
criminal operation on a nearby world has found a
way to ‘spoof’ transponder codes and has been

IMPERIAL MARINE ASSAULT BATTLE DRESS
Imperial Marine battle dress maintains its distinctive
look at all Tech Levels. The suit described here is
the top-of-the-line model worn by most marines in
the Core sector and other important regions of the
Imperium. While it contains 20 slots for customization,
most of them are filled with the standard equipment
shown here.

The armor is equipped with the TL15 electronics
suite, which includes Computer /3, Eye Protection,
Geiger Counter, IR Goggles, Light Intensifier Goggles,
PRIS Binoculars, Radio Transceiver (5,000km range),
and a Scope.

* Total cost of assault battledress with the standard
gear is Cr764000.

The following gear is standard on the assault battle dress:

The remaining two slots are typically left open for field modifications. Common uses are the installation of a second
fuel cell or integrated tool kit.

**DISPOSABLE RE-ENTRY KIT**
Sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s escape
pod’, disposable re-entry kits are a suitable backup
tool for jump troops who do not have access to a
reentry capsule or other means of conducting an orbital
assault. The kit consists of an ablative shield, harness,
stabilizer tripod, lightweight chemical thrust adjuster
and basic flight computer, all of which are disposable.
The ablative shield is made of a polymer foam that
absorbs heat during re-entry. At higher Tech Levels,
the material becomes more durable and reliable. The
flight computer is attached to the stabilizer and assists
the user with adjustments during descent. The harness
buckles the user in for the ride.

The user supplies their own vacc suit, combat armor,
battle dress or other vacuum-sealed environment suit
with a life support system. Users must make certain they
have enough air in their tanks for the drop. The denser
the atmosphere, the longer the duration of the descent.

Some kits include a parachute that deploys once a
suitable atmosphere is present. Others require the
user to bring an appropriate in-atmosphere locomotion
system; for example, a chemical rocket pack or
grav belt. Disposable re-entry kits are popular with
extreme sports enthusiasts, some of whom hold drop
competitions in which time to landing, landing zone
accuracy and other factors are scored.

**Making a drop with a portable re-entry kit:** Difficult (10+) Flyer (any) check (variable timeframe, DEX). The
timeframe varies with atmosphere type. If the Atmosphere code is 5 or below, it is 2D x 10 minutes; if 6–7, it is
D3 hours; and if 8–9 it is D6 hours to complete the drop. The Referee may adjust the drop difficulty to account for
other factors. For example, if the Traveller is dropping into a region in which a tropical storm is brewing, the in-
atmosphere portion of the drop might warrant a higher level of difficulty.

Imperial Army
The armies of the Imperium are much like planetary
navies. Each world maintains its own army based on its
population, available technology and individual needs.
However, unlike planetary navies, armies are expected
to contribute to the greater Imperial Army, sharing
certain methodologies, technological standards, tactics
and traditions.

Left to their own devices, the worlds of the Imperium
do not always make the most logical decisions when
it comes to building an army. Some worlds overbuild
theirs and others underestimate the need for one,
either fielding an army that ultimately proves to be
insufficient or, in some cases, having no army at
all. This environment produces a broad spectrum of
military solutions. Some worlds with no army have an
arrangement with one that does, thereby gaining a
portion of its soldiers for their own defence. Others rely
on mercenary forces. Some simply do without one,
passively benefitting from ‘herd immunity’ by being
among neighbors who have them.

The primary reason to have an army is to defend
one’s world, although many worlds, especially those
far from Imperial borders, do not see the need for one
in the civilised Imperium. This can be a mistake since
the Imperium does allow limited conquest to occur
between worlds. Those who have an army are not
given any form of largesse by the Imperium. Other than
the obvious security it provides, the benefits of having
an army are ephemeral. A world with an army can be
proud that it provides for its own defence and that of its
subsector by contributing to the Imperial Army. Worlds
endowed with armies have greater prestige simply
because they have demonstrated the ability to create
one. Such worlds are seen as valuable citizens of the
Imperium who contribute to its defence and become de
facto members of a martial community.

Worlds of the Imperium are likely to have armies
composed of the units described in the Unit Organization
table. The larger the population of the world, the more
likely the structure will resemble standard units. Smaller
worlds (those with a Population code of 5 or less) may
have less structure or they may have a militia instead.
Militias may be organised in the same manner as
traditional military units but not all of them are.

Unit Organization
Unit Description Unit Commander
Fire Team The fire team is the basic unit of the army and is exclusive to the infantry. Corporal
Squad Called a section by the marines, includes two or three fire teams (8–15

Branches of the Army
The _Traveller Core Rulebook_ includes three branch
assignments for Travellers in the army: infantry, cavalry
and support.

Infantry are the ground pounders, the poor souls who
endure the brunt of war more than any other branch.
Historically, infantry soldiers are required to take
and occupy enemy territory, often suffering horrific
casualties in the process. This does not change at
higher Tech Levels. What does change is the mode
of transportation. At low Tech Levels, infantry are
expected to walk from place to place, sometimes
alongside armored vehicles once TL4–7 is reached.
At TL6–8, infantry are transported in trucks, armored
personnel carriers (APCs) and other vehicles, but
ultimately they find themselves in the same place; out
in the open, hopefully in a foxhole with a rifle in hand,
defending whatever territory their army has taken. At
higher Tech Levels, gravitic transportation becomes
available. At TL8–9, half of all vehicles are likely to be
gravitic. By TL10+, gravitic APCs are standard and
become better armed and armored as
technology advances.

Personal armor improves with technology as well. At
lower Tech Levels, infantry soldiers will be unarmored
or at best lightly armored. By TL8, more effective
armor, weaponry and communications devices become
available. At TL10+, combat armor becomes available
for commandos and other specialized troops and at
TL12+ it becomes standard for most infantry.

Weaponry also varies with Tech Level. The standard
TL12 infantry soldier is armed with a gauss rifle, a
sidearm and an appropriate selection of grenades. At
least one fire team in each squad or platoon is equipped
with heavy weaponry, usually a tripod-mounted machine
gun or VRF gauss weapon but alternatives are available.

Two subsets of infantry are lift infantry and jump troops.
Lift infantry are soldiers in gravitic vehicles. Jump
troops are dropped from orbit in specialized pods
or with the aid of an ablative shield to plunge safely
through atmosphere. Once on the ground, they are the
vanguard of a larger assault force and often dropped in
zones where they are to eliminate strategic targets or
secure landing zones for the remainder of the army. Lift
infantry are typically equipped with combat armor and
light weaponry. Jump troops in the army are special
forces as opposed to the marines, all of whom are
trained for such operations. Notably, jump-trained army
units post ‘drop wings’ on their uniforms while marines
retain a space for wings but do not post them since all
marines are jump troops.

For a selection of armor and weaponry used by the
army, refer to the Central Supply Catalogue and the
Field Catalogue.

Cavalry on low-tech worlds are animal-mounted troops,
riding horses, kians or other effective warsteeds.
However, when in reference to the high-tech Imperial
Army, cavalry refers specifically to soldiers who fight in
fast, cross-country vehicles. At low- to mid-tech, cavalry
operate small vehicles, trucks, halftracks, APCs and
tanks. At higher Tech Levels, gravitic vehicles become
standard. At the upper end of a cavalry unit are the
tankers who operate armored fighting vehicles (AFVs),
armed with a deadly array of weaponry designed to kill
infantry and destroy other vehicles and tanks.

Support roles are many and varied in a high-tech
army, including artillery, combat engineers, medics
and staff. Artillery are trained in the use of the army’s
field weapons. At low- to mid-Tech Levels, artillery
is composed of large-calibre slug-throwing weapons
that fire explosive munitions. As Tech Levels increase,
artillery includes multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) and
energy weapons that inflict massive amounts of damage

to enemy structures and personnel alike. Artillery is often
referred to as simply ‘the killer’ for its astounding ability
to suppress mobility and inflict casualties.

BUILDING IMPERIAL ARMY UNITS
The concept of an empire-wide army did not take
hold until the advent of the Third Imperium. The
Sylean Federation had no unified army to speak of,
instead allowing each of its worlds to raise its own
army independently. While the Syleans did occupy
worlds, notably during their war with the Interstellar
Confederacy, individual armies were placed under
the joint control of the president and Grand Senate of
Sylea. Likewise, the Rule of Man applied a haphazard
strategy, using armies from hundreds of worlds to
pacify and occupy the worlds that it conquered from the
Ziru Sirka. These methods were examined by the Third
Imperium from a historical perspective and each was
found lacking.

The Imperium intended to become a far greater and
more expansive empire than its predecessors. If the
Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium was to be
realised – which claimed possession of all worlds held
by the previous human empires – then a more unified
structure would be needed. Cleon Zhunastu believed
that free trade and defence of the space between
its worlds would be the glue that held the Imperium
together. Despite his objection to the use of force to
coerce worlds into accepting Imperial membership, he
realised that an Imperial Army would be required. Not
every world in Charted Space could be expected to
accept the Imperium’s offer and there would come a
day when it would be unacceptable, even dangerous,
to have islands of independence in the midst of
the empire. Furthermore, once the Imperium was
established, revolts and insurrections would inevitably
have to be put down from time-to-time.

In many ways, the Sylean model was merely improved
upon. Individual worlds are still encouraged to raise
their own armies but the joint-command structure at
Capital, and subordinate commands in each sector
and subsector, have a much more active role in the
maintenance, standardization and training of planetary
armies. Imperial Army units are configured at the
subsector level. Individual worlds provide regiments
that are organised into divisions during deployments
and, if necessary, subsector divisions can be further
organised into corps and whole armies if a larger
deployment is necessary. Subsector-level Imperial
Army units have been mobilised many times, usually

to put down revolts or fight small wars. Sector-wide
corps have only been organised into an army on one
occasion: the Solomani Rim War.

The armies of individual worlds are organised within
the Imperial Army as either attached or contributed
formations. Attached formations are armies that do
not regularly train with those of other worlds. As such,
they may have distinctive tactics, cultures, uniforms,
equipment and Tech Levels. When integrated into
an Imperial Army division, attached formations are
generally segregated from units that are built from
contributed formations. Likewise, attached formations
are given suitable assignments for units that do not
regularly ‘play for the team’. Contributed formations
regularly train with one another and have an array of
standards that make it easy to mix and match troops
from multiple worlds into a cohesive subsector or
sector army.

Configuring subsector Imperial Army divisions has its
challenges. While some worlds have armies that are
large enough to handle an interstellar deployment on
their own, this practice is frowned upon. Allowing the
army of a single world to occupy another sends the
wrong message, even when putting down a revolt.
Furthermore, armies are effectively subcultures of
worlds. As such, each has a unique persona and
characteristics. Deploying the army of one world

MESON REBELLION
A recent example of an interstellar deployment
was the Meson Rebellion in 1032 on Khikaba
in Lishun. After Imperial Navy squadrons
secured the system and Imperial Marine lift
infantry secured a landing zone, an Imperial
Army division, composed of regiments from
Biaz Ven, Iksha and Surli, was deployed to the
system mainworld to secure it. The garrison
remains on Khikaba to this day and each of the
regiments involved rotates troops into and out
of the operational theatre. Counterinsurgency
personnel were brought in to perform
inspections of various sites and ensure that no
items of TL9+ reach the planet. In the case of
this deployment, the regiment from low-tech
Surli were trained in the use of TL12 weapons,
the standard for the deployment.

IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

to another can result in a clash of cultures. For
this reason, most Imperial Army deployments are
composed of contributed formations from several
worlds, transforming them into members of the
homogenised Imperial Army.

Clashing cultures are not the only factors to contend
with when assembling a subsector army out of
contributed formations. The Imperium has a broad
range of population and Tech Levels. There are high-
tech worlds with large populations, low-tech worlds with
medium populations, mid-tech worlds with middling
populations and every other combination in between.
The Tech Level differences between armies can be
significant. In the Core sector alone, there are massive
disparities. For example, the high-population world of
Shiirand has an army of 34 million soldiers, all of whom
use TL7 equipment. Meanwhile, three parsecs away,
the army of Ushra has 105 million soldiers armed to a
much higher TL12 standard. The Imperium mitigates
this imbalance with joint training exercises. Several
battalions of Shiirand’s army are regularly deployed
to Ushra to train with weapons and vehicles of higher

Population Imperial Army Presence
4 or below No independent army unless Government code is 6 (see below). A militia may be present or the
world might be defended by a detachment from a nearby world that has a higher population.
5 Militia or Imperial Army present. Worlds with Population 5 are on the dividing line. Some will
have a large militia and others a small army. If the world has an army, it may be part of the
Imperial Army.
6 or higher Imperial Army present. If Government code is 6, the world may have a captive government or
military rule.

Government Imperial Army Presence
6 If the world is a colony, it may have no military at all, or might have a militia or Imperial Army
unit present. If the world has a captive government or military rule, the Imperial Army or an
army of a neighboring world occupies the world.
7 Balkanised worlds are variable. Some have nation states at odds with each other may have
a larger military presence than is normal. Others are peaceable and do not have an elevated
military presence. In either case, balkanised worlds with Population 6+ are expected to
contribute forces to the Imperial Army at the subsector level as normal.
A or higher More complex forms of government are often bolstered by or require the presence of a larger
military. Oligarchies, dictatorships and autocracies are usually enforced by a large army.

Law Level Imperial Army Presence
9 or below Standard Imperial Army presence.
A or higher Higher Law Levels may indicate the presence of a larger, more invasive army. However, a high
Law Level almost certainly indicates the presence of a larger, more intrusive police force. In some
cases, the two go hand-in-hand.

technology. Likewise, soldiers in Ushra’s army might be
rotated to TL14 Alekvadin to learn how to use man-
portable fusion weapons in a separate cross-training
program. It is not cost-effective for every soldier
in a multi-million-sophont army to be shipped out to
multiple worlds over the course of a military career.
To help remedy this situation, soldiers who have been
trained on weapons, vehicles and gear from higher-
tech worlds are usually assigned the task of training
their own soldiers in the use of the same equipment.
Ultimately, a lower-tech army returns to its standard
equipment but chances are that most of the soldiers in
a subsector army have been exposed to high-tech gear
at some point during their careers. Therefore, when
called upon to serve in an interstellar deployment, the
soldiers of any world’s army are generally proficient at
the technological standard that is provided.

ENCOUNTERS WITH THE IMPERIAL ARMY
The Imperial Army is almost everywhere in the
Imperium. Use a world’s Universal World Profile as a
guide with the following caveats. Note that this applies
strictly to worlds within the boundaries of the Imperium.

Imperial Military Forces

TRAVELLER

Soldiers of the Imperial Army are a common sight on
many Imperial worlds but are most visible on worlds
with Population 5+, Government 6 or A and higher and
a Law Level of A or higher. Worlds with Government
6 are governed by a colony, captive government or
military rule. A colony world is likely to have a militia
but a world with a captive government or military rule
often has an occupying army present. In some cases, a
high-ranking officer in the Imperial Army is the military
governor of the world, although the role may be held by
an officer of the Imperial Navy or an appointed civilian
administrator who serves as a proxy for the military.
A world under military rule is sometimes governed
by a nearby star system, which may install a local
representative to administer it.

A LITTLE PIECE OF HOME
Patron: Captain Qilaria Odom, Requisitions
Officer, 467th Infantry.
Mission: The garrison at Adkhi/Core has
been present for decades, quelling an
insurgency from Chanestin separatists. The
467 th is composed of three regiments out of
the Saregon subsector. The regiments hail
from Arvlaa Gam, Gaen Luum and Khuir.
Due to high-priority police actions on Igla and
Shakiiga, the garrison on Adkhi has had its tour
extended and the troops are getting restless.
Captain Odom wants to boost their morale
by giving them a little taste of home. Military
budgets are tight but Odom has been given
a reasonable discretionary fund to acquire
foods, entertainment products and other goods
from each of the regiment’s homeworlds.
The Travellers are hired to pick up 30 tons of
freight and an additional 20 tons of goods (the
portions from each world to be determined
by the Referee) that will give these homesick
soldiers something to be excited about. The 20
tons of speculative cargo is at the discretion
of the Travellers but should reflect the unique
cultures of each world.
Reward: Standard freight fees and
speculative cargo revenue plus future
contracts with the army if the goods are well
received by the troops.

Worlds with other government types may also have
offworld Imperial Army units present. A captive
government is not required. Sometimes it is deemed
expedient to delegate defence to a more willing and
capable partner. For example, Duuka in Core is an
agricultural world with a population of 600,000. The
world has no military of its own but has a small Imperial
Army presence from nearby Mish, a high-population,
industrialised world that relies upon Duuka for
foodstuffs and other agricultural products.

Lift Infantry Regiments

and the Imperial Guard
Lift infantry regiments or ‘Huscarles’ are the private
armies of the Imperial nobility. The greatest of
these armies is the Imperial Guard, composed of 11
regiments of crack troops and other support units.

LIFT INFANTRY REGIMENTS
Largely a conceit of the Civil War era, powerful noble
houses established personal bodyguard regiments,
some of which were later converted into regular
Imperial Army units. Perhaps the most famous of these
is the 4518th Imperial Lift Infantry Regiment, the Duke
of Regina’s Own Huscarles. This unit was initially
assembled for the protection of Baron Caranda of
Regina, who modified the force into a fighting unit. The
Huscarles were used to quell dissent among the worlds
of the Marches after Arbellatra Alkhalikoi ascended
to the role of Imperial Regent. They also fought in all
subsequent Frontier Wars as contributed formations of
the Imperial Army.

In the modern era, many noble houses retain similar
units which have varying degrees of utility and battle-
readiness. Based on the precedent set by the 4518th,
these units are called household troops or simply
Huscarles. These private regiments may be established
as attached or contributed formations of the Imperial
Army but the Emperor has stated his preference that
they be of the latter. If the peerage is to keep private
military forces, it is best they are seen as team players
when it comes to serving the empire. Nevertheless,
some nobles maintain regiments as strictly attached
formations for various reasons.

It may seem contrary or even seditious to have private
military forces in the Imperium but it is allowed for a
number of reasons. At their best, lift infantry regiments
set the standard for other army units. Because the
armies of Imperial worlds are organised independently,
standards are virtually impossible to enforce. As the
armies of the peerage, Huscarles have access to
Imperial technology, which they may train local forces
to use. They operate as agents and advocates for the
greater Imperial Army, proffering tactical and training
standards that might otherwise not exist on worlds
that are far from the Core. Their presence is also a
not-so-subtle reminder to the citizens of the Imperium
that should they fail to comply with Imperial law, the
noble bureaucracy can be transformed into a tool of
enforcement when called upon to do so.

There are places in the Imperium where the nobility
is much more at odds with one another but nobles
are strictly forbidden to directly engage each other
in private wars with their Huscarles regiments. In
contentious sectors like Deneb, opposed noble
houses sometimes push the envelope. Most are
careful not to directly do battle with each other, but
their Huscarles may sometimes be found on the same
battlefield in direct opposition to each other with proxy
forces formed from local armies and mercenaries
doing the actual fighting.

For more information on Huscarles, refer to the article
on the 4518th Lift Infantry in Journal of the Travellers’
Aid Society Volume 2.

THE IMPERIAL GUARD
The greatest of all household troops are the Emperor’s
Imperial Guard. Headquartered on Capital, the Imperial
Guard are responsible for the defence of the Imperial
Palace and its Emperor. The Guard was officially
founded by Emperor Cleon I in the year 52 when it
consisted of just one regiment, the hallowed Sylean
Guard. However, the Guard claims that its history
extends back to the Rule of Man, whose Emperor was
also defended by a force known as the Imperial Guard.

Imperial Guard forces inhabit a broad, multi-level
section near the crown of the spherical palace, where
they are trained and housed. The Imperial Guard is
designed to reflect the diversity of the Imperium and
includes nine lift-infantry regiments (one from each
Imperial Domain plus the Aslan and Marine regiments),
as well as artillery and cavalry regiments.

•  The Sylean Guard
•  The Vilani Guard
•  The Gateway Guard
•  The Ilelish Guard
•  The Antares Guard
•  The Imperial Artillery
•  The Household Cavalry
•  The Spinward Marches Guard
•  The Marine Guard (also known as the Marine
Escort Service)
•  The Aslan Guard
•  The Solomani Guard

Adjuncts to the Guard are the Imperial Marine Escort
Force, the Scout Service Protection Detail and the
Imperial Navy Escort Squadron. The primary duty of
the Marine Escort Force is to serve aboard the Pax
Imperii , the 10,000-ton yacht that serves as the flagship
of the Emperor’s personal fleet. Members of the

Imperial Guard and its supporting forces are bestowed
the honor of membership in the Knightly Order of the
Emperor’s Guard.

The Imperial Guard are regularly seen by the public
when performing the popular changing of the guard
ceremony in the parade grounds directly below the
Grand Palace of Arbellatra. However, they are much
more than ceremonial troops. Guard members are
hand selected from the ranks of the Imperial Army
and Marines for their martial talents and distinguished
service. While most serve on Capital, Imperial
Guard regiments have been assigned combat roles
throughout history and deployed far and wide in
service to the Imperium. Some of their more famous
actions include an inspiring deployment to fight in the
Vargr Campaigns, multiple Frontier War deployments,
the fight to the death by the Aslan regiment in defence
of Empress Jacqueline against Grand Admiral Olav
and the palace coup that led to the ascendance of
Emperor Gavin.

Serving in the Imperial Guard
Travellers serving in Army or Marine careers may
attempt to join the Imperial Guard. Most applications
to the Guard occur mid-service, after the Traveller
has already served one or more terms. Service in the
Guard has the following prerequisites:
•  Currently serving in the Army or Marines
•  STR or END 10+
•  Vacc Suit 1 or higher
•  Received a promotion in the term just prior
to application
•  No Mishaps have been incurred during the
Traveller’s career

**Qualification:** 11+.
DM+1 if STR 10+. DM+1 if END 10+. DM+1 if SOC 9+.

A Traveller may attempt only one qualification roll for
service in the Imperial Guard. Failure indicates that the
Traveller was not accepted or washed out during the
qualification trials and has been banned from future
qualification attempts.

The first term served in the Guard is spent in training. In
addition to the skill that is normally received, Travellers
obtain one additional skill from the Imperial Guard
Service Skills table.

The Traveller may remain in the Imperial Guard if
advancement is successful; otherwise, the Traveller
leaves the Imperial Guard and may resume their career
in the Army or Marines. Exceptions to the rule are the
Marine Escort Service and the Aslan Guard. Members
of these units may remain in the Guard for the duration
of their careers regardless of whether they successfully
advance in each term.

Travellers who serve two or more terms in the Imperial
Guard receive DM+1 on all non-cash Benefit rolls and
may automatically choose TAS Membership as one
of their Benefits. In addition, the value of any material
Benefit received (e.g., Gun, Blade, Implant) may be
up to twice the value listed in the Benefit’s description.
The Traveller also receives SOC+2 from having served
in the most hallowed and decorated service of the
Imperial military forces.

Imperial Military Forces

_Pax Imperii_ is the Imperial family’s 10,000-ton yacht.
This spacecraft is one of a kind and serves as both a
luxurious conveyance for the Emperor and a mobile
platform to travel with friends, fellow heads of state
and other esteemed visitors under the protective
presence of the Imperial Marine Escort Service.
_Pax Imperii_ travels with the Naval Escort Squadron,
which consists of three _Sylean_ -class battleships, an
_Antiama_ -class fleet carrier, a flight of _Sloan_ -class
fleet escorts and several jump-6 couriers for rapid
transmission of information.

The _Pax Imperii_ has many features, none more
impressive than its common areas. The 40-ton crew
commons are pedestrian but the 440-ton commons
for the Imperial family and their guests is highly
configurable. Before each voyage, a team that reports
to the Emperor’s private secretary uses specialized
software to program the commons configuration. The
space is apportioned based on who the guests are,
what the purpose of the voyage is and, of course,
what the Emperor wants. For example, if the Emperor
is travelling with members of the Moot and visiting
dignitaries from various worlds, the common area might
be configured into a ballroom, a formal dining area, a
card room, a tearoom and a conference center. The
common area is adjacent to the multi-environment

**PAX IMPERII**

area in the event that alien visitors are present who
require an exotic atmosphere, high-pressure or aquatic
environment, or other adjustments.

Configuring the common area requires a task check
of varying difficulty, depending on the
configuration requested.

Configure the common area for Princess Iphegenia’s
16 th Birthday Party Bash: Average (8+) Electronics
(remote ops) check (1D hours, SOC).

Configuring the common area for a summit conference
that involves multiple regional powers, including
several alien dignitaries. A task chain is required. First,
design the common area for the conference: Difficult
(10+) Diplomat check (2D hours, SOC); followed by
the implementation, configure the common area for
the conference: Difficult (10+) Electronics (remote
ops) check (2D hours, EDU + the effect of the
Diplomat check).

The deck architecture of Pax Imperii is designed to
make its guests feel at home. The crew sections are
sequestered so that visitors are unlikely to see them
unless they are taken on a tour of the ship. The Marine
Escort barracks are located above and below the
Emperor’s quarters and near the configurable commons.

PROJECT SHORTBOW
As the Major Races began to reach out to
the stars and build interstellar polities, most
established the seat of empire in a single star
system, usually on a single world. A capital might
be placed on the surface of a system mainworld,
the moon of a gas giant, a large hollowed out
asteroid or even an orbital habitat. Such a capital
is vulnerable to destruction by a large impactor.
A bolide of significant size – perhaps only 10 or
more kilometers in diameter – could be hurtled at
such a target at high – even relativistic – speeds
with cataclysmic effects. To prevent such a thing
from happening, the Short Baseline Observation
Window (a.k.a., Project Shortbow) program
was created.

Project Shortbow is administered and staffed
by a secret agency of the Imperial Academy of
Science and Medicine in concert with the Imperial
Navy Science Division. The technology created
by the project is essentially a collection of sensor
devices and an immense telescopic array that
watches for potentially hostile anomalies that
might be directed towards Capital. Similar, less
expansive systems exist on other Imperial worlds
of great import, including Reference and the
majority of Imperial Depots.

Shortbow is not a fool-proof system. Space is
immense and it is nigh impossible to see all
possible dangers; however, the technological
aspect of the project is merely one component.
Imperial Naval Intelligence has a veritable army of
operatives who keep a watchful eye on dissident
groups and other potential bad actors. If detected,
it is better to nip such problems in the bud rather
than waiting to let them mount a viable threat.

Imperial Interstellar

Scout Service
The Scout Service is a fabled institution whose
origins predate the Third Imperium. Scouts in the
Sylean Federation were mostly freelance explorers
who sold their data to the highest bidder until their
services were organised under the aegis of the Sylean
Federation Scout Service. The Scout Service was
restructured and renamed the Imperial Interstellar
Scout Service in the year 0.

The modern Scout Service has three branches:
Communications, Survey and Exploration. The
primary responsibility of the Communications branch
is the operation and maintenance of the Imperial
X-Boat Network, which provides communication
services for the entire Imperium. X-boats are small
starships with jump-4 capability that jump from system
-to-system, transmitting mail and other data between
Imperial worlds. With no maneuver drives of their
own, x-boats are serviced by x-boat tenders, which
are stationed in every system to which x-boats travel.
A reserve of Type-S scout/couriers are also present
to transfer information to worlds that are off the main
x-boat routes.

The Survey branch is responsible for scientific
data collection and stellar cartography (also called
astrocartography). Survey scouts are the unsung
heroes of the service, recording the stellar and
planetology data of each system, working their way
from the primary star to the Oort cloud and measuring
for subtle changes on subsequent visits. Survey goes
beyond Imperial borders to record data from foreign or
unincorporated star systems.

IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

Exploration is often seen as the most glamourous
branch of the Scout Service but it is also the most
dangerous. More scouts serving in Exploration are lost
than from any other branch. Exploration scouts are
sent into charted but unexplored systems, their mission
to perform cursory surveys and close examinations of
planetary bodies if irregularities or anomalies are found.
They may also be called upon to perform contact
and liaison missions if sophonts are encountered.
Newly discovered sophonts are often left alone if
the Scout Service determines that a species should
be allowed to develop at its own pace and without
Imperial interference. Worlds with such populations
are sometimes interdicted. Such missions may last
centuries or even millennia if necessary.

The one thing all three branches have in common is
the Type-S scout, the modern version of which is the
_Suleiman_ -class. The Communications branch uses
them to transport information to worlds that are off the
x-boat routes, keeping them in the loop and ensuring
that every Imperial world has access to current
information. The Survey and Exploration branches use

Survey Branch Mission Types
Survey Class Description
Class I Conducted from a distance of 1–2 parsecs, determines the basic stellar and planetary data of
a star system. Duration: 1 day.
Class II In-system survey of primary and subsequent stars and all planetary bodies of notable size.
Duration: 1 week.
Class III Detailed examination of notable planetary bodies. Landing parties launched when necessary.
Duration: 10 weeks.
Class IV Detailed survey of system mainworld and other habitable zone bodies. Probes and landing
parties launched to confirm data. Duration: 30 weeks.
Class V Detailed probes and surveys of all planetary bodies in a star system, including landing parties
to confirm data. Duration: 5–10 years.

them as utility starships, performing any number of
necessary tasks. Type-S scouts are sometimes named
by their crews but officially they only have call signs:
a single letter (C for Communications, S for Survey or
E for Exploration), six numerical digits followed by a
hyphen and a random letter. Survey scouts also use
the Donosev -class survey scout ship, a 400-ton ship
with more advanced sensors, which enables them to
collect the detailed data required.

The Scout Service is overseen by Administration
and Operations offices that report to each branch.
Administration is responsible for the upkeep of the
service, making sure that it has the starships, small
craft, vehicles, gear and other resources that it needs
to do its many jobs. Administration also recruits new
members to the service, often from far-flung worlds of
the Imperium. The IISS, more than any other military
service, is known for its diversity and inclusion policies.
The service actively recruits alien sophonts from all
Imperial worlds – and sometimes those beyond its
borders – and is known for providing or even devising
special equipment to accommodate those from exotic

Imperial Military Forces

TRAVELLER

environments. Subordinate to Administration are
the Technical Services and Detached Duty offices.
Technical Services are called upon to solve complex
technical problems or fix damaged scout ships and
other equipment. Scouts from each branch are
expected to be technically competent and repair their
own gear if possible, so Technical Services are only
called upon for the most difficult jobs. The Detached
Duty office maintains and assigns the service’s
immense fleet of retired starships. They also keep
track of the ex-scouts to which these ships have been
assigned. The phrase ‘Once a scout, always a scout’ is
the credo of Detached Duty who track down and assign
missions to scouts who have been blessed with the
possession of a hardy scout/courier for their own use.

The Operations division of each branch – called ‘Ops’
by members of the service – evaluates and assigns all
scout missions. Jobs in Operations are often thought
to be mundane; they are, in fact, anything but. Ops
assignments are often on frontier worlds, backwaters
and other underserved places where the IISS has
deployed a base. Ops personnel are always linked
with one of the three primary branches and sometimes
manage to put themselves in danger when evaluating
whether a mission is required. Ops also includes the
vaunted Security division, which protects valuable
service assets and engages in espionage activities.

While the scouts are often viewed as only a scientific
service or perhaps ‘paramilitary’ at best, they do put
themselves in harm’s way and also provide some
distinctly military services. The Scout Service Imperial
Protection Detail has served the Emperor for centuries,
operating as a lightly armed secret service whose sole
job it is to prevent an assassination from taking place,
sacrificing their lives if necessary.

SCOUT BASES AND WAY STATIONS
The IISS maintains a system of bases and way
stations. Scout bases include administrative centres
and repair and maintenance facilities for scout vessels.
Scout bases may be located on worlds with a Class D
or better starport but are most common on worlds with
lower starport levels. Many of these worlds are found
in low-tech, out-of-the-way star systems. Scout bases
may be located in orbital or planetary facilities since the
majority of scout ships are in the sub-1,000-ton range.

Way stations provide support, repair and maintenance
for the vast Imperial X-Boat Network and training and
personnel services for the entire IISS. Way stations are

found only on worlds with Class A or B starports. There
are typically two to four way stations per sector with as
many as nine in the more populous, centrally located
sectors of the Imperium.

Mercenary Forces
The worlds of the Imperium are rife with opportunities
for the mercenary soldier. Despite its vastness,
great wealth and the power of its military forces, the
Imperium cannot be everywhere at once, nor does it
try to be. Its worlds are free to raise their own armies
and govern themselves as they wish, provided they
do not break Imperial laws. As such, conflicts develop
between rival forces on individual worlds and, in some
cases, between worlds in neighboring star systems.
The Imperium rarely gets involved in these dustups
unless they threaten the regional economy or passage
of free trade. To a certain extent, the Imperium actually
supports the notion of small, contained wars as a
necessary outlet for social and political pressures.
Suppressing conflicts can cause greater problems
than simply allowing them to progress naturally. This is
where the soldier for hire comes into play.

Mercenary forces have found active employment in
all sectors of the Imperium. A common misconception
is that mercenaries are less common closer to the
Imperial Core, which is far from the case. The types
of tickets available on the frontier may differ from
those in the interior but the uneven landscape of
the Imperium is fallow ground for dissension and
conflict. When conflicts escalate to war, parties with
the means may hire mercenaries to achieve specific
objectives, secure their territory or assets from real or
perceived threats, train militias and armies in the use
of modern weaponry and, in many cases, simply to
fight alongside their own armies.

Conflicts between nations and worlds are not the only
venues where mercenaries find gainful employment.
Corporations and megacorporations frequently hire
them. Security contracts are given to reputable
mercenary units to protect key personnel, industrial
facilities, prototypes being transferred between
corporate sites and similar jobs. Corporations
sometimes engage each other in more direct conflict
as well. As long as such conflicts do not boil over and
affect the Imperial economy in a noticeable way, they
are often allowed to occur.

The mercenary services market varies widely. At the
lower end, some are barely more than vagabonds
with a few combat skills who hire on as paid killers.
IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

Independent contractors with a higher degree of
professionalism sell their skills to more reputable
clients and often hire on with a bonded mercenary
company. Mercenary companies vary widely as
well. Some are generalists who take on a variety of
contracts, others specialize in fields like shipboard
defence, security, commando operations, mobile
armor and field training. The size of these companies
varies, with some as small as a fire team and others
battalion-sized or larger.

running detailed mercenary campaigns, refer to the

Deep Dive
**Security, Platoon. Cr100000 per month plus salaries
and bonus. Ongoing.**
Zirgamsa Ruaka Corporation (ZRC) is a resource-
extraction firm focused on obtaining materials for the
starship manufacturing industry. ZRC is a well-funded
firm whose lead investor is Achenaar Antilles, the
sector-wide merchant line. ZRC is headquartered on
Gaen Luum/Core and has a limited-term contract to
develop a previously untouched undersea lanthanum
lode on Arvlaa Gam. Arvlaa Gam does not have
the resources or technology to access the lode and
requires the assistance of its high-tech neighbor.
After the term of their contract has expired, ZRC must
terminate the extraction operation and leave the gear
behind for a consortium of local firms to continue
working the mine.

Arvlaa Gam is administered by Saregon but its people
are largely left to govern themselves. The power
vacuum sometimes creates conflicts between industrial
concerns on the planet. A conglomeration of mining
firms confidentially established the contract with ZRC,
going over the heads of its own miners’ union. The
project was intended to be confidential but there was
a leak. ZRC considered scuttling the operation but
a lanthanum shortage in the Shesh belt made them
decide to go through with it in spite of the risks. The
union and excluded companies have expressed their
displeasure that the mine was being developed without
their involvement by an offworld agency. The union and
some of the excluded mining companies have vowed to
oppose the operation, violently if necessary.

ZRC needs a platoon-sized mercenary unit to provide
security for a multiple-phase ticket. They are offering
Cr100000 per month plus standard salaries for the unit
for the duration of the ticket. An additional bonus of
Cr50000 will be given if none of ZRC’s equipment is
damaged by the opposition.

REFEREE’S INFORMATION
There are a number of issues at play here. On the
surface, a ragtag group of miners should pose no
threat to a well-trained and equipped platoon of
mercenaries. However, what neither ZRC nor the
mercenaries know is that the lanthanum acquired has
already been pre-sold to a subsidiary of Achenaar
Antilles. Tukera Lines, which is in heated competition
for routes in the Saregon subsector, has gotten word
of this operation through its corporate intelligence
arm. Tukera has surreptitiously equipped the miners
with high-tech weapons and equipment from offworld.
While most of the miners are not well-trained in the
use of the equipment, merely having it makes them
more dangerous than expected. In addition, Tukera
operatives are providing support and intelligence to
the miners.

MISSION PHASES
The first phase of the mission is to secure the starport
on Gaen Luum while mining equipment and vehicles
are loaded onto Achenaar Antilles freighters. The
Arvlaa Gam Miners’ Union is not thought to have the
resources or reach to sabotage the mission at this
point but ZRC is a somewhat paranoid company and
does not want to take chances.

The second phase is the arrival on Arvlaa Gam and
transit to the work site. The platoon is split into two
sections for this phase. One accompanies part of
the expedition to the coastal city of Madinudadi,
where ZRC is to rent several submersibles and other
watercraft for use at the work site. The second section
reports directly to the work site where survey and
initial set-up is performed, including the construction
of a floating structure where the ZRC miners,
personnel and mercenaries will be housed for the
duration of the operation.

The third phase is to make sure that the operation
is secure for its duration. ZRC suggests setting up
listening posts in the region.

TRAVELLER

The final phase is to provide cover for ZRC during the
return jump to Gaen Luum.

THE MINERS’ UNION
The union are a rough-and-tumble bunch, many of
whom are former soldiers. They are not in the business
of fighting wars but Arvlaa Gam is a tough world and its
laissez-faire industrial sector is not above fighting over
resources. In short, an assault on the mercenaries will
not be the first time they have engaged in combat. They
are not nearly as organised as a qualified mercenary
unit but underestimating their abilities would be unwise.
Their morale is initially high but drops quickly if they
encounter setbacks.

THE OPPOSITION
The goal of the miner’s union is to disrupt the ZRC
operation on Arvlaa Gam and to prevent it from
extracting lanthanum from the mine. If they can
accomplish this with sabotage, thereby avoiding armed
conflict, they will do so. However, if the mercenaries
do their jobs well, and they prevent the miners’ union
from accomplishing their goals, the union will become
increasingly frustrated, eventually resorting to a more
direct approach.

If the Travellers do not set up listening posts or some
other form of surveillance, they are likely to be taken by
surprise. Thanks to Tukera, the miners are equipped
with high-tech submersibles, surface watercraft and
weapons with which they intend to attack the ZRC

mining platform, killing anyone who resists and
imprisoning the others, possibly to ransom them back
to ZRC. The attack is likely to be multi-faceted, with the
mercenaries forced to defend multiple sites at once.

TICKET SUCCESS INDICATORS
This ticket has the following success criteria:
1: CRITICAL: Secure the mining platform, mining
equipment and protect all ZRC personnel from attack.
2: IMPORTANT: Prevent sabotage to all ZRC gear
during deployment and departure.
3: ROUTINE: Determine in advance whether an attack
is planned and by whom.
4: ROUTINE: Keep the ZRC staff informed with daily
briefings and situation reports.

One Critical, one Important and two Routine objectives
give a maximum TSI of 11. The Travellers must run
an airtight security operation to achieve all of these
objectives. Simply going to and from Arvlaa Gam and
waiting for someone to attack is likely to result in a
lower score.

Intelligence Services
There are intelligence agencies at all levels of
Imperial government. Much as worlds are allowed
to govern themselves, they are also allowed to
gather their own intelligence provided they do not
act against the interests of the Imperium itself.
Likewise, members of the Imperial bureaucracy at
the planetary, subsector, sector and sometimes even
the domain level operate networks of agents who
perform surveillance activities, engage in espionage,
analyse collected data and use the obtained
information to inform their decisions.

Intelligence agencies assume many forms from
immense bureaucratic organizations down to small
cabals of informers. The Imperial Army, Scout
Service and Navy each have intelligence-gathering
arms. Army Intelligence is primarily concerned with
gathering strategic information about the worlds of
the Imperium and those of its potential enemies.
Internally, Army Intelligence keeps track of political
movements, insurrections, terrorist groups and
others whom they may be called upon to oppose.
They also keep up-to-date cartographic information
on all Imperial worlds and those of foreign polities
near Imperial borders.

IMPERIAL MILITARY FORCES

**IMPERIAL NAVAL INTELLIGENCE**
Perhaps the best-known spy agency is Imperial
Naval Intelligence (INI). The INI has officers posted
to most Imperial Navy bases. The vast majority of
INI officers are administrators who use the navy’s
considerable reach to surveil and collect data on
everything from current events on Imperial worlds,
interplanetary incidents, interstellar anomalies,
potential threats to the Imperium, conflicts between
rival corporate entities and merchant activity at all
levels, from megacoporate freighters down to the
interface lines. It is considerably more difficult to
track the activities of tramp traders but the INI has
been known to investigate suspected smugglers,
pirates and other suspected malcontents among the
free trader community from time-to-time.

INI administrators are given broad discretionary
powers, including the ability to hire and train
agents. Mid-level INI officers, often called ‘minders’,
are permitted to build intelligence networks with
certain guidelines and limitations. These networks
are composed of smaller units called cells, which
typically include 4–12 individual agents. Cells are
carefully cultivated and managed by their minders
and a given cell might not even be aware of
another’s existence within the same organization
or that of another minder. Minders are careful to
prevent their cells from working at cross purposes or
inadvertently interfering with each other’s missions.
The technology available to INI administrators makes
managing a complex array of cells relatively trivial
but care must be taken nonetheless.

**IISS INTELLIGENCE**
The Scout Service also maintains an intelligence
service, which is subordinate to its Security division.
Unlike the navy, where INI officers manage a network
of intelligence agents, in the scouts agents are part
of the standard IISS framework. The scouts have
a much looser hierarchy than the navy and their
intelligence services reflect that. Agents do not
receive specialized training, instead using the skills
they have acquired in their chosen branch to carry
out espionage and intelligence-gathering duties.

While there is no official structure such as that in the
INI, members of IISS Intelligence often build networks
of cells that resemble those of the navy. Their primary
recruits are retired scouts, particularly those assigned
scout ships by the Detached Duty division. Obligated
by the Scout Service to serve when called upon to
do so, detached duty scouts and their ships make

ON HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY’S SECRET SERVICE
Most INI officers stay in administrative roles and
operatives are rarely drawn from long-term career
ranks of the navy itself. However, naval officers
can and do become field agents on occasion.
These agents have their naval rank frozen
for the duration of their service as intelligence
operatives. Many are outfitted with augments that
prevent them from being able to give up state
secrets or key data regarding the movement or
operation of Imperial Navy vessels.

Travellers may be created who have served in
both INI administration or field operative roles.
Travellers in INI administration must be officers

However, skills received from the Line/Crew table
are replaced with the following:

To become an INI field agent, the Traveller must
first serve at least one term in the Navy career,
then successfully qualify for the Agent career,
selecting the intelligence assignment. Failure to
qualify indicates that the Traveller’s request to
receive a field agent posting has been denied.
Terms served as a field agent are carried out as a
separate career. However, if the Traveller opts to
transfer back into the Navy administration role, no
roll is required; the Traveller simply resumes the
following term in line/crew, as before, returning
to the rank held previously. The Traveller may
also opt to transfer to another branch in the
Navy career as normal. When mustering out, the
Traveller may make all rolls on the Navy Benefits
tables or may split the rolls between the two
careers based on terms served in each.

excellent spies. Scouts who run the networks are not
called minders as they are in the INI but do have a
number of less-official nicknames, some of which are
a little derisive. Den mother, trail boss and cat herder
are some of the more popular ones.

Agents in the Scout Service are often seen as ‘the
foreign office’ whereas INI agents operate within the
Imperium most of the time. Many scouts, especially
those in the Exploration branch, have travelled beyond
Imperial borders, giving them a greater understanding
of alien cultures and foreign polities. As such, they
often make better operatives for missions outside of the
Imperium; intelligence agents from the scouts are often
recruited by INI minders when they require an agent
with foreign expertise.

The Agent
Patron : INI Minder, Lt. Nimath Tence, who might
be a Contact or Ally of one of the Travellers but
at the very least he has selected them on good
authority that they are a trustworthy group loyal to
the Imperium.
Location: Rorpa Din/Chant.
Pre-requisites: This patron encounter is based
on Marc Miller’s Traveller novel, Agent of the
Imperium. Ideally, the Traveller who installs the
Angin wafer will have read the book in order to
play the role of Jonathan Bland, the Decider.
Requirement : One Traveller in the group must
have a wafer jack and neural link.
Equipment : One Angin wafer.
Mission : After one of the Travellers installs the
Angin wafer, he becomes Jonathan Bland for the
duration of the patron encounter and subsequent
adventure. Bland will go through his standard
operating procedure, first asking the group,
‘Who is senior?’ and then proceeding to conduct
the operation, applying Rules 1–6 of the Agent
Standing Orders, as described in Agent of the
Imperium. Lt. Tence informs him that a group
of insurgents has allegedly infiltrated the proxy
government of Rorpa Din, which is administered
offworld by the government of Traa. While the

organization of the insurgents is unknown, it is
believed they have obtained nuclear weapons
that they intend to use to attack either against
Rorpa Din itself or some of the most populous
asteroids of the Traa system. Lt. Tence had
a cell of agents monitoring the insurgents’
activities and they found out what was going
on. Unfortunately, he has lost contact with
the members of his cell and fears the worst.
Because there is a perceived threat to a
world of the Imperium and no viable Imperial
authority present, Lt. Tence opted to use the
Angin wafer to find out what he should do next.
Reward : Cr100000 per Traveller and possible
future agent assignments for the group.

## THE NOBILITY

There are three ways to become a member of the
Imperial nobility. The first is simply the passage of
noble patent through heredity, the second comes from
something good happening – an honor grant – and
the third implies that something bad has occurred,
resulting in revocation of title and subsequent
reinstatement or reassignment.

The most common passage of noble title occurs
through heredity. While there are no assurances that
the offspring of an effective and honorable noble will
serve with the same level of distinction, hereditary
passage of title provides stability, especially given the
immense breadth of the Imperium. Noble titles are
usually passed on to the firstborn heir, sometimes with
preference for the firstborn male or female but there
are no rules that govern this and nobles may ultimately
decide for themselves whom among their heirs receives
the patent. Many nobles have more than one title
and liberally distribute them among their heirs, which
can cause discord if there are no established rules of
heredity in place.

Honor nobles are given their titles as a reward for
achievements, including military victories, success in
business or accomplishments in academia. Titles for
honor nobles include knight, baronet, baron and, on
rare occasions, marquis. Noble patents for knights,
barons and marquises are granted by the Emperor but
baronets are traditionally granted only by archdukes.
Noble patents are granted twice per year, once on
Holiday (the first day of the year) and again on the
Emperor’s birthday. Most honor patents do not lead
to enfeoffment (land acquisition). The title of marquis
is an exception as it typically includes a fief but
landless marquises are not unknown. When a fief is not
immediately granted, a marquis patent typically implies
that one may follow. Indeed, a march – the name of a
land grant given to a marquis – is often dangled as an
enticement for further good service.

Bad behaviour among the peerage is not unknown and
can result in the suspension or revocation of a noble
patent by the Emperor or the Moot. However, for the
sake of stability, wayward nobles or at least their heirs
are often reinstated later. Although nobles swear fealty
and a pledge of honor to the Emperor, transgressions
do occur from time-to-time; treason, kidnapping,

extortion and other crimes are common cause for
patent revocation. The Imperial feudal system is
intended to prevent such things from happening
but not every archduke watches their dukes like a
hawk, nor does every duke keep a close eye on their
counts and so forth. The temptation to defy Imperial
law or the dictates of one’s superiors is apparently
too great to resist for some among the noble ranks.
There are times when such resistance is justified.
For example, a count may refuse to follow the orders
of an incompetent duke and actually pursue the
revocation of his superior through various channels.
History has shown that such bids are rarely successful
unless incontrovertible evidence of incompetence or
other malfeasance is provided. The system favors
hierarchical order and stability and the Moot does not
tolerate insubordination lightly.

The highest rate of revocation is at the knight level
but all manner of titles have been stripped including
that of duke. Revocation is not levied lightly and often
preceded by a suspension, especially when a lesser
violation has occurred. Suspensions can last years
or even decades, depending on the seriousness of
the infraction and follows when the noble in question
refuses to make amends or shows no remorse for the
actions that caused the suspension. A contrite noble
can usually get their title back at the Emperor’s mercy.
Even if there is a lack of contrition on the part of the
offender, if the remainder of their family continues
to serve the Imperium in good will, reinstatement
often follows and the patent is reassigned to a more
cooperative member of the family. This is most likely
to occur when the family in question has a great deal
of power. For example, it is difficult for the Emperor to
deny a family that also chairs a megacorporation or has
flag-rank naval officers.

There are times when the revoked noble and their
family are so steeped in corruption or dishonor
that the Emperor or the Moot has no choice but to
permanently revoke the patent. In this case, the patent
is reassigned to a noble of the next tier, resulting in a
promotion to the vacant rank. While this is rare, when
it does happen, contention for the patent can be quite
fierce and the Imperial Navy may be called upon to
ensure a peaceful transition of power.

TRAVELLER

In addition to the more formal appellations listed above,
‘Your Grace’ or ‘Your Majesty’ may be used in reference
to nobles ranked Baron or above. For Knights, simply
‘My Lord’ or ‘Madam’ will suffice.

It should be noted that the Imperium is a vast place and
there is a great deal of variation among its worlds. In
some societies, noble titles may be conflated to convey
immense importance (for example, ‘Your Most Illustrious
and Accomplished Eminence’) while on more egalitarian
worlds, such appellations are often done away with
altogether. Variety is the spice of life and Travellers
are likely to encounter many different situations when
it comes to the nobility and their acceptance – or lack
thereof – by the worlds over which they preside.

Noble Ranks
SOC Noble Title Appellation Fief
10 Gentleman
or Lady

Sir or Madam. If in service to a knight, some
append their name with the suffix, esquire or
simply esq.

None.

11 Knight Sir or Lord. Some female recipients use Dame. None for honor nobles. Up to 100km^2
for rank nobles on their homeworld only.
12 Baronet Baronet followed by the family name. None for honor nobles. Up to 100km^2
for rank nobles on their homeworld only.
12 Baron The Right Honorable Baron (or Baroness),
followed by the family name, which is preceded
by haut, hault or von. For example, Baron Jarem
haut-Devereux.

None for honor nobles. Up to 100km^2
for rank nobles on any world of the
Imperium.

13 Marquis Illustrious Sir for honor nobles, Your Excellency
for rank nobles, followed by the rank and world
name over which the marquis (or marquess)
presides. For example, Your Excellency, the
Marquis Ankod. Note that a marquess is a female
marquis while a marquioness is a female married
to the marquis or marquess who holds the title.

Typically none for honor nobles. For
rank nobles, a large fief on a world with
a Class A or B starport or an entire world
of any starport type.

14 Viscount or
Count

The Right Honorable Count (or Countess),
followed by the name of the most prestigious
world over which the count presides. For
example, the Right Honorable Count Ganad.

One powerful star system or 2–3
systems of various power and prestige.

15 Duke Your Grace, followed by the prefix ‘of’ and the
name of the subsector or sector over which the
Duke (or Duchess) presides. For example, Your
Grace, the Duke of Aramis.

One subsector or, in the case of the
Sector Duke, an entire sector.

16 Archduke Your Grace, followed by the name of the domain
over which the Duke (or Duchess) presides. For
example, Your Grace, the Archduke of Ilelish.

One domain (four sectors).

17 Emperor Your Imperial Majesty. One empire.

The Emperor may award noble patents of all ranks
but those ranked marquis and above are members of
the peerage and may only receive a patent from the
Emperor. Knights and baronets may be granted patents
by archdukes but only within their domains. This
enables the archdukes to build allegiances within their
domains without the aid of the Emperor.

RANKS WITHIN THE RANKS
Noble rank and the origin of patent are only half the
story. There is a complex hierarchy within the nobility
guided as much by tradition as the letter of the law.
Honor nobles have lower status than rank nobles,
especially when the rank noble gained the title
hereditarily instead of through service. For example,

The Nobility

the greatest sculptor in all of the Core may have been
granted an honor barony as a reward for his great
works, some of which even adorn the Hall of Wisdom
in the Grand Palace of Arbellatra. At court, this noble,
despite all of his grand achievements, is considered
to be below a ranked baron whose family has held the
middling world of Siduka for generations. Heredity,
patent longevity and enfeoffment always outrank
honor achievements, no matter how lofty.

Some rank nobles have higher status than other rank
nobles as well, based on the concept of precedence.
Precedence indicates the length of time that a noble
family has held a patent. The older the patent, the
greater the prestige. Loyal noble families who have
maintained good standing with the Emperor may have
held a patent for generations or even centuries. Holding
such a patent confers great responsibilities. Rank noble
patents almost universally include a fief, which may be
anywhere from a few hundred square kilometers on
a single world to a whole planet, multiple planets, an
entire subsector and so on.

Merely holding land is not enough to maintain prestige
when one’s family holds a patent of high precedence.
This is where the concept of high nobility comes into
play. The great noble families carry a responsibility of
service to the Imperium and typically hold positions
within the bureaucracy, diplomatic roles, judicial
positions and business or military leadership roles.
Political roles are not out of the question but generally
speaking, governance is left to individual worlds.

**THE MOOT**
The high nobility serve the Imperium by sending
representatives to the Moot, the highest bureaucratic
body of the nobility in the Imperium. Members of the
Moot are all nobles ranked baron or higher, although
many send proxies to represent them. The noble
families are encouraged to send representatives from
their respective families, which most do, but some
appoint a third party. Those who truly want to wield
power either attend in person or send the heir to their
noble patent.

The Moot have essentially one power; to dissolve the
Imperium. This responsibility is not taken lightly but has
been entertained from time-to-time over the course of
Imperial history. During the Civil War, the chaotic reign
of Cleon III and other times of crisis, members of the
Moot threatened to use the power of dissolution. In
practice, use of this power brings the opposed sides

together to compromise but in theory it could actually
result in the breakup of the Imperium should things get
bad enough. It is a powerful but dangerous tool and its
usage is not to be taken lightly.

Although dissolution is the Moot’s only actual ability,
this does not mean that it is the only thing the nobility
discusses within the chambers of the Moot Spire.
All manner of subjects pertaining to the Imperium
are discussed and high-ranking members of the
Moot frequently meet with and advise the Emperor.
While the Emperor is the only executive authority
in the Imperium, he takes the advice of the Moot
seriously. The Emperor is not all-knowing and cannot
be expected to be clued into everything that is
happening in his empire. He is given daily briefs about
events happening throughout the Imperium but such
information is often factual, unemotional and lacks
context. For accurate, more nuanced information, he
must rely upon his nobles, each of whom can give him
a detailed account about what is actually happening in
each of the Imperium’s sectors, right down to events
on individual worlds if need be. The de facto leader of
the Moot is the Chancellor, a high noble drawn from
its ranks whom the Emperor feels he can trust. The
Chancellorship is a much sought-after position and is
usually a lifetime appointment.

The Moot Spire is a 1.75 kilometer tall structure located
a mere 4.25 kilometer from the Emperor’s palace.
Symbolically, the peak of the spire is allowed to rise
above the crown of the Grand Palace except on one
day; when a new Emperor is appointed. On that day,
the subterranean gravitic compensators raise the
altitude of the place so that its crown is 100m above
the peak of the Moot Spire, indicating the ‘Emperor
Ascendant’. More information about the Moot Spire is
provided in the description of Capital on page 155.

ORDERS OF KNIGHTHOOD
Among the most lively institutions within the nobility are
its many orders of knighthood. Upon achieving the rank
of knight, recipients of the title are granted membership
in one of the Imperium’s dozens of orders. The most
common orders are those of each domain: The Order
of Antares, the Order of Gateway, the Order of Sol, the
Order of Sylea and the Order of Vland. Assignment to
each of these orders is conferred by the Archduke of
each domain. The Domain of Deneb does not have an
order of its own because it has no Archduke. However,
the knights of this frontier region have done what they
can to make up for that by establishing several private
orders, some of which are quite exclusive.

The Nobility

TRAVELLER

Many orders have been established to represent
certain goals, responsibilities and achievements.
Military veterans who achieve knighthood become
members of the Order of the Sword. Ex-scouts and
other deep-space explorers are granted membership
in the Order of the Arrow. Knights who achieved their
rank by accomplishment in the sciences become
members of the Order of Fusion. The Order of the
Emperor’s Guard is by nature a rather exclusive order
since membership is only granted to soldiers who
serve in the ranks of the Guard. There are also orders
for loyal alien citizens who have been made knights,
including the Order of Hlyuea for Aslan and the Order
of Gvadakoung for Vargr, both of which were founded
by Empress Arbellatra.

There are also many secret orders of knighthood,
established for various purposes. Secret orders usually
have a noble sponsor among the peerage whose
responsibilities are clandestine in nature and therefore
not revealed to the public. Many former Imperial
intelligence operatives belong to secret orders and are
sometimes called upon for their expertise in confidential
matters. They may even be asked to accept secret
missions in service to high-ranking members of the
peerage or the Emperor himself.

Perhaps the most prestigious order of all is the Order
of Starship and Crown, which has only a few hundred
members. The knights of this order pledge a special
oath of loyalty to the Emperor and have committed
themselves to do his bidding no matter the request
and often taking on special missions in service to the
throne. Knights of this order proudly wear its logo on
a badge or tabard, which depicts an iconic starship
surrounded by a ring (representing the crown) in gold
on a black background.

Membership in an order confers several benefits that
are similar to those who possess a Travellers’ Aid
Society membership. Knights of a certain domain
can often obtain free high passage aboard starships
provided they travel within the realm of their title.
Worlds with a Class A starport and Population 6+ often
have hostels that exclusively serve the knighthood
community, sometimes only those of certain orders.
Membership in an order provides a ready pool of
potential contacts and patrons for knighted Travellers.
Meeting or simply coming into contact with other
members of one’s order might also result in a request
for assistance. When another knight of the order
asks for help, it is expected that their fellow knight
will comply. To do otherwise risks damage to one’s
reputation and possibly expulsion from the order.

The bonds of fellowship that develop between
the knights of an order create ready pools of able
noblemen for the peerage to access. Relatively few
knights have fiefs to manage and are therefore seen
as resources by higher ranking nobles. Groups of
knights from an order – or in some cases, the entire
available membership – may be called upon from
time-to-time by a baron or higher to accomplish a task
in service to the Imperium. The peerage knows and
trusts knighted women and men, all of whom have
sworn their loyalty to the Emperor. Much like a plea
for help from a fellow knight of one’s order, requests
from the peerage are defied or resisted at one’s peril.
Despite the responsibilities entailed, many knights
enjoy their noble rank and do not desire promotion.
Higher noble ranks confer levels of responsibility that
many do not desire. While the call to service may
come at any time, knights of the Imperium are seen
as the errant knights of old, brave and chivalrous
Travellers who wander between the stars, searching
for adventure in the service of the Emperor.

POLITICAL ROLES
The Imperial bureaucracy and the nobles who serve
within it manage the 11,000 worlds of the Imperium.
The practice of enfeoffment grants them land holds of
various sizes. Nobles rent and tax the land under their
purview but ultimately it still belongs to the Emperor
and can be taken back at his whim. For the most part,
noble patents do not indicate actual rulership of worlds,
subsectors or sectors over which nobles preside. As
mentioned elsewhere, the Imperium largely governs the
space between worlds and not the worlds themselves.
That task falls mostly upon the people who live there,
many of whom are citizens of civilizations that have
been present for centuries, if not millennia.

The Nobility

The role of the noble is to maintain an aloof presence,
be a caretaker for the Emperor but not one who
interferes in the daily governance of worlds other than
to ensure that the flow of trade is unimpeded and
citizens do not violate Imperial law. Should the latter
occur, the noble has little direct power to influence
a preferable outcome. While some nobles maintain
household troops – some of whom are so well geared
that they could indeed take over a small planet – the
primary recourse of the noble is to call upon the
diplomatic corps or, if necessary, the Imperial military to
resolve conflicts.

There are, of course, circumstances in which nobles do
take a role in government. When civilian governments
collapse, are in a state of transition or the world simply
has so few inhabitants that there is little need for a
complex governmental structure, members of the nobility
may be called upon to lead. Most who do so take only
an interim role with the provision that should the civilian
inhabitants of the world eventually strive for self-rule, the
noble shall step aside and let them form the government
of their choice. When this happens, there is usually a
peaceful transition but there have been a few incidents
in which nobles have been reluctant to concede power.
This can occur for a number of reasons: the noble is
using the land for resource extraction or other forms
of wealth generation and does not want to risk local
interference; the new government-in-waiting has bad
relations with the noble or possibly even the Imperium at
large; or the noble in question simply enjoys the power
of rulership and does not want to give it up. Regardless
of the reason, Imperial law is clear: civilian governments
should be given the right of self-determination and
any fiction that dictates otherwise must ultimately be
removed. Like so many Imperial laws, the rules are left
vague in order to prevent the Emperor from being bound
by precedent but nobles who resist this tradition do so at
their peril and that of their noble patent. Nobles reluctant
to give up power have found themselves on the wrong
side of an Imperial Marines invasion whereupon their
regime is put down in cursory fashion and rule is granted
to the locals.

**NOBLESSE OBLIGE**
The primary responsibility of the Imperial nobility is
to serve as an adhesive that keeps worlds together.
Nobles are expected to exhibit loyalty to the Emperor
with honor as their guiding principle. Keeping the
whole thing together requires an extensive bureaucracy
and the nobility are the lattice upon which this is built.

To some extent the nobility are the watchdogs of
the Emperor. Imperial law has a few fully defined
tenets and a broad array of traditions that the nobility
must interpret and enforce. Most Imperial laws
are deliberately vague to prevent them from being
subjected to precedent and to keep local governments
from designing loopholes to evade them. The Imperium
is a large polity and legal arguments cannot easily be
conducted across its broad expanse. For example, it
is broadly known that impeding free trade is a violation
of Imperial law. When the government of a world takes
issue with the trade practices of a neighboring world
and uses its planetary navy to create a blockade or
enforce an embargo upon the offending world, the
local nobility must ascertain whether or not free trade
is ultimately being impeded or served. More often than
not, the task of the nobility is to do absolutely nothing.
The Imperium tries to avoid becoming involved in local
affairs unless they threaten to spill over into the greater
interstellar community.

The nobility must often walk a fine line. A noble who
takes sides or gets involved too early in a conflict runs
the risk of becoming intrusive or, worse, autocratic. On
the other hand, if a noble waits too long to intercede
on behalf of the Imperium and things get out of hand,
thereby requiring the involvement of the Imperial Navy
or establishing military rule on one or more planets, the
peerage and perhaps even the Emperor himself may
question whether or not the noble could have done
something earlier in the crisis.

Many nobles take a rather technocratic approach,
using data collected by the x-boat network, high-tech
surveillance equipment and reports collected from
subordinate members of the peerage and the orders
of knighthood. Others take a more hands-on approach
to find the pulse of the worlds of their fiefs, travelling
from system-to-system, intermixing with the people
and relying on intuition more than impersonal computer
algorithms. There is no right or wrong way to go about
the business of managing the worlds of the Imperium.
The proof is in the pudding. All the Emperor wants are
results. How a rank noble manages their worlds is of
little importance as long as the outcome is satisfactory.
All that matters is the continued stability and progress
of the Imperium.

The Nobility

TRAVELLER

THE NOBILITY OF CORE
The Core peerage includes some of the oldest families
of the Imperium. Many have held their patents for
centuries and some even trace their origins all the way
back to the beginning of the Third Imperium. Some
lay claim to patents that originated during the Sylean
Federation as well but such assertions are for the most
part mere braggadocio. Imperial history quite stridently
insists there are no noble patents that precede Year 0
even if many of the families who received patents were
power brokers in the preceding state.

There is a great deal of variation among the Core
peerage. At the end of the Long Night, the sector that
is now Core had two other significant pocket empires,
half a dozen smaller ones and many independent
worlds that had somehow found the means to survive.
Such worlds invariably had leadership structures in
place when the Sylean Federation, and later the Third
Imperium, came knocking on their doors. When the
Imperium was young, it used noble patents to bribe,
cajole and diplomatically entice worlds into the Imperial
fold. Promises of wealth from free trade and access to
high technology was enough to get most of them on
board. Barren worlds – those which had never been
inhabited or at best were the site of colonies that had
died out millennia ago – and dead worlds – those which
had civilizations that died out during the Long Night

* were distributed as fiefs to honor nobles, thereby
promoting them into the rank nobility. Worlds resistant
to Imperial authority were dealt with in a number of
ways. Some were forcibly taken, some convinced to
join via diplomacy and some given the leisure to join
whenever they were ready with the caveat that the
Emperor’s patience was not infinite. Stragglers were
also integrated into the Imperium, even if only at the
bureaucratic level, and distributed as provisional fiefs.
Recipients of such fiefs were often disappointed since
they and their families were unable to realise any
wealth from their holdings for decades if not centuries.

The Core peerage is thus a melting pot of unique
dynastic traditions. The august Sylean nobles are
dignified and efficient, exhibiting little of the hubris seen
elsewhere. Many Vilani nobles trace their heritage
all the way back to the First Imperium, a practice
which – perhaps surprisingly – is encouraged by the
Emperor. The nobles from the long-defunct Interstellar
Confederacy are chided for their provincial accents and
culture. The Chanestin nobles are the haughtiest of

the bunch and look down their noses at the rest of the
peerage. Nobles from Core’s most powerful industrial
subsectors attempt to lord it over their less well-heeled
peers but are given short shrift by those with older
dynastic heritage. A nouveau elite among the peerage
has emerged on worlds with burgeoning economies.
There are alien nobles as well with fiefs granted to
a few Vargr, Bwap and Ssienjhiovla nobles, among
others. The list goes on and there is a seemingly
infinite amount of variation among them. The one thing
they all have in common is the distinct pride that they
are the primary nobility of the entire Imperium, looked
upon with envy by their peers from other sectors.
Despite their differences, the Core peerage is an
effective bureaucratic body and manages to get along
well for the most part. Those problems that do arise
are typically caused by territorial disputes or patent
revocations, each of which can cause a dynastic crisis.

Dynastic crises are magnets for conflict, which
is anathema to an Imperium that seeks stability
throughout its territory. It behoves the Emperor and
the peerage to resolve such conflicts as quickly
and efficiently as possible but there are often
circumstances that prevent them from doing so.
Vacant and suspended patents are not simply filled by
the next rank noble, at least not initially. When a noble
has been suspended or has had their patent revoked,
the tradition is to let the patent lie fallow for a time and
to give either the offending noble or their heirs time to
make amends. Meanwhile, the peerage must assume
responsibility for the fief. This is done by dividing
territory among lesser nobles and sometimes by
appointing one of them regent or custodian of the fief,
a caretaker who assumes the role until the Emperor
passes final judgment on what is to be done with
the patent. Such times are rife with double dealing,
espionage, subterfuge and other shenanigans. The
Imperium may send spies to observe the dealings of
the offending family. The subordinates of a revoked
noble vie and jockey for position to assume the role
and fief of their former superior. Proxy wars and other
brushfire conflicts might even be stirred up. If things
get out of hand – which they often do – the Imperial
Navy is dispatched to keep things under control.
However, martial law is rarely imposed. The Emperor
allows the peerage to sort out its own problems to
a great extent; he merely keeps a watchful eye on
events to ensure the method they choose to resolve
their problems do not reflect poorly on the Imperium
or, more importantly, himself.

The Nobility

**THE IMPERIAL FAMILY**
The Emperor and his immediate family sit atop the
noble peerage, laying claim to thousands of oaths of
fealty. In 1105, Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi sits
upon the Iridium Throne. He is attended by his wife, the
Empress Iolanthe and daughter, the Crown Princess
Ciencia Iphegenia.

Each member of the Imperial Family is dedicated to
their roles as servants of the Imperium and despite
divergent interests, have managed to find common
ground in their respective works. The Emperor is
preoccupied with the preservation and consolidation
of the Imperium and has recently taken an interest
in its security as well. The Empress has become an
advocate for the cultural diversity of the Imperium,
which on its surface would seem to be opposed to her
husband’s efforts to bring its people closer together.
In fact, the two work quite well hand in hand, with the
Emperor taking the role of wise but heavy-handed ruler
when necessary, while his wife assures the cultures
of the realm that all have a place in its advancement.
Meanwhile, the bright Crown Princess has become the
patron of the IISS, spending a great deal of her time
visiting its bases, promoting its services and ensuring
that the best technology and resources are made
available to its personnel. Ciencia Iphegenia spends
much of her time away from Capital in the Reference
system, where she studies at the University of
Aadkhien and works closely with the scouts’ top brass.

Following the death of his father, Emperor Strephon
was crowned the 43rd Emperor of the Third Imperium
on 014-1071 at the tender age of 21. As the oldest
child of Paulo and Elbet Alkhalikoi, Strephon was
groomed for the role since birth. Being prepared to rule
the most powerful human empire ever created shortly
after reaching adulthood is a tall order for anyone but
Strephon managed it surprisingly well, exhibiting grace
and aplomb at every turn.

The first great challenge of Strephon’s reign was the
Fourth Frontier War. The war, conducted entirely within
the confines of the Spinward Marches, was over in a
mere 16 months. The Imperium made modest territorial
gains, which Strephon leveraged to portray himself as
a capable and victorious war-time leader. The war also
marked the beginning of a long friendship between
Strephon and Duke Norris of Regina. 'The war exposed
the vulnerability of the Domain of Deneb. The Emperor
recognizes that the Imperium must be better prepared
for inevitable future Frontier Wars. His reputation and
standing depends upon it.

The Fourth Frontier War woke Strephon up to the
reality that the Imperium was becoming too broad and
unwieldy. Its disparate sectors are too far apart for
communication to be practical. In defiance of the Moot,
Strephon re-established the domains and appointed
archdukes to most of them to enhance the Imperium’s
abilities to respond to crises such as those seen in the
Domain of Deneb whose borders with the Zhodani,
Vargr and the upstart Sword Worlds were a constant
source of trouble.

The Chancellor of the Moot, a strong believer in
the efficacy of psychohistory, advised Strephon to
take heed of Ilelish, where one revolt was put down
centuries earlier and which could very well be the
source of renewed unrest. In an attempt to pre-
emptively address such problems, the Emperor has
recently appointed one of his closest friends, Dulinor
Astrin Ilethian, as Archduke of the Domain of Ilelish
in an effort to forestall any problems from the highly
developed and industrialised province.

Emperor Strephon travels Core and its neighboring
sectors frequently, mostly on official business. He
has also recently become involved in several highly
secretive enterprises, which have something to do with
the security of Capital and the Imperium at large.

When he can, the Emperor likes to get away to the
northern seas of Capital, the reserve world of Crompton
or even the stark desolation of Onon, depending on his
mood. As he has gotten older, the Emperor has found
that the crown weighs upon him more heavily. The
Imperium has become a difficult to manage and very
complex affair and there are times that he just needs to
get away to get his thoughts straight.

The Empress Iolanthe is descended from a prominent
Vilani family and the daughter of the senior duke of the
Gushemege sector. Iolanthe married Strephon in 1079
after a brief courtship. Their union was an arranged
pairing, designed to infuse the Alkhalikoi Dynasty with
some much-needed Vilani blood.

Iolanthe travels a great deal and has become an
advocate for the Imperial cultural regions. Her
pilgrimages thus far have taken her to the Vegan
Autonomous Region, the Lancian Cultural Region,

the Amec Protectorate, the League of Antares and
the Luriani Cultural Association. Locally, she travels
amongst the Sylean Worlds frequently, partaking in
many ceremonies and festivals that celebrate Sylean
heritage. While Iolanthe has no Sylean blood to speak
of, as Empress of an Imperium that owes a great debt
to the Syleans, she feels it is her responsibility and
great honor to support and foster their culture.

The Empress has been quiet so far on whether or not
she supports the notion of a Chanestin cultural region.
The Chanestin worlds are a source of internecine
strife in the Core, so she is careful not to stir the pot
by advocating one way or the other. She does express
great admiration for the historical achievements of
the Chanestin people and actively engages in fund-
raising activities to preserve their unique and ancient
architectural monuments, some of which are now
nearly 3,000 years old.

As the daughter of Emperor Strephon and Empress
Iolanthe, Ciencia Iphegenia is the Grand Princess of
the Imperium. As heir to the Iridium Throne, Ciencia
has been educated from birth to eventually assume the
mantle of authority, much like her father did before her.
She shares her mother’s keen intellect and has been
imbued with a strong sense of duty to the Imperium by
her father.

Ciencia developed a remarkable interest in the
sciences early in childhood, memorising all of the
constellations and component stars visible from Capital
by the age of five. Her aptitudes in the realms of the
space sciences have many historians likening her
to her ancestor, Arbellatra Alkhalikoi, who became a
naval captain at the age of 16. After graduating from
the prestigious Karbiili School on Capital at the age of
10, Ciencia joined the Scout Service and completed
basic training at the age of 12. She has since become
the leading patron of the IISS and travels frequently to
Core scout bases and their operational headquarters
at Reference where she also attends courses at the
University of Aadkhien. Whether or not she becomes
the ‘Arbellatra of the Scout Service’ remains to be seen
but there is ample reason to believe she will have an
illustrious career with the IISS, possibly following it up
with a stint at one or more of the Imperial Research
Stations before she eventually sits upon the throne.

IMPERIAL WARRANTS
Imperial warrants are instructions printed on physical
or encrypted electronic Imperial stationery from the
Emperor, an archduke or a duke and given to trusted
agents of the Imperium. These instructions endow the
recipient with the will of the Emperor or high nobility
and supercede all other powers. Warrants typically
assign a mission of great importance and are often
issued in times of crisis when going through official
channels is not considered to be a viable option.
Emperor Strephon has been known to use Imperial
Warrants on occasion, often invoking the assistance
clause of Imperial Edict 97 in the process.

IMPERIAL EDICT 97
Imperial Edict 97 is the 34-page document that
enables the use of Imperial warrants. Its most
dramatic clause instructs the recipient to assist the
bearer of an Imperial warrant with all the power that
one can bring to bear.

Used by the Imperial family to send messages, make
appointments and to issue commands, Imperial
stationery is presented in physical and electronic
format. Its physical form is infused with subatomic
particles that may be read by official scanning
devices, which are extremely difficult to forge. The
electronic version of the stationery is encrypted
with TL15 computer technology and is equally hard
to replicate. Reception of a message on Imperial
stationery is akin to the spoken word of the Emperor
and is considered to be a high honor.

Notable and famous correspondence on Imperial
stationery has found its way into the antiquities
market and many pieces are owned by private
collectors, some of which are on display at various
museums in Imperial space. The value of such
pieces varies immensely depending on their age,
the significance of events described and from whom
they were issued. Some of the pieces issued by
Empress Arbellatra have been sold at auction for
millions of Credits.

Synthesising Imperial stationery and forging a
message from the Emperor : Impossible (16+)
Deception check (1D days, INT). Oppose with
an Electronics (computers) check to confirm its

### CORPORATIONS AND MEGACORPORATIONS

Doing business in the Imperium can be highly
profitable. With a few aberrations, its history has been
one long steady climb to wealth and prosperity. Built
upon the twin pillars of free trade and self-defence,
with little in the way of laws or regulations to guide
the actions of individual worlds or the companies that
do business on them, the environment is ideal for
competition. The few regulatory agencies that do exist
are there primarily to ensure that corporations do not
violate Imperial law or sovereignty.

Most corporations of the Imperium are restricted to a
single world or small number of worlds within a few
parsecs of each other. Very successful corporations
can dominate the market in a large expanse of a sector
or sometimes the entire sector. Only a precious few
corporations can be said to be pan-Imperial. These are
known as the megacorporations.

Megacorporations are truly massive in scope, with
offices, factories, research-and-development facilities
and administration centres spread throughout Imperial
space and often beyond its borders. Most are run like
any other company, including corporate officers, boards
of directors and multiple levels of management. The
main difference is that these companies cover such a
broad area that top executives are only responsible for
strategic decisions and long-term planning with the bulk
of day-to-day decisions made by regional managers
who are empowered at the level of a chief executive

officer at smaller corporations. The distance between
branch offices and the time required for communication
necessitates this level of autonomy.

Megacorporate operations are so diverse and
widespread that subsidiaries may find themselves
inadvertently competing with each other. Sometimes
this is even desirable if doing so adversely affects a
competitor in another market. Megacorporations are
exorbitantly wealthy, with capital and assets distributed
throughout Imperial space. Most are simply too large to
be traded on a single exchange; therefore, their stock
is divided into regional financial centres with overall
value published on an intermittent basis, limited by the
speed of interstellar communications. Data is carried
in encrypted storage blocks on the x-boat network but
most of the megacorporations maintain courier fleets to
carry more sensitive data.

The oldest megacorporations are the three dominant
Vilani bureaux: Makhidkarun, Sharurshid and Naasirka.
In the Ziru Sirka era, the bureaux were responsible
for the governance of vast regions of space. Naasirka
governed its spinward sectors, Sharurshid the trailing
sectors and Makhidkarun dominated the coreward
region of the empire. The central region and various
tributaries were run by a mix of the three along with
smaller contenders. After the fall of the Ziru Sirka, the
bureaux were gradually transformed into bona fide
megacorporations, each with a massive sphere of
influence and accumulated wealth.

MEGACORPORATE COURIER
CLASS:INTELL

Despite the excellent record of the x-boat network,
many megacorporate officers do not trust the scouts
to carry their most sensitive information. The _Intell_ -
class courier is designed to carry encrypted data,
small prototypes and other essential capital between
star systems quickly and efficiently. The design
substitutes a secure vault in lieu of a cargo hold.

Megacorporate offices are spread out across
Imperial space and this ship can bridge the gap
quickly with its jump-5 capability. State-of-the-art
virtual crew software enables the ship to operate as
a drone, with no crew at all if desired. A small bridge

and staterooms are provided to accommodate a
skeleton crew in case corporate officers are not
comfortable with an AI carrying sensitive data and
cargo across multiple sectors. Eight low berths
are included to ship key personnel from one
megacorporate office to another or to provide a
rotating 1- to 2-person crew.

The class is named for important Imperial financial
centres and famous corporate events and
transactions. Intell is the largest city on Capital and
its primary business and financial center.

### HISTORY OF THE THIRD IMPERIUM

The Third Imperium is the self-appointed successor of
two previous empires that existed thousands of years
ago. The first of these was the Vilani Grand Empire of
the Stars or Ziru Sirka as they called it in their native
language. With their homeworld and capital at Vland,
the Ziru Sirka became the largest interstellar empire
in history. The Vilani were descended from humans
who were originally taken from Terra approximately
300,000 years ago by an alien race who are now
called the Ancients. The Ancients mysteriously
disappeared from the galactic scene but the Vilani
lived on and discovered jump drive technology in
-9235, nearly seven millennia before their Terran
counterparts. They engaged in a long, largely
unopposed expansion into the stars, first exploring
and trading, and then consolidating and conquering
the sophonts they encountered. Vilani culture adhered
to a strict caste system that focused on tradition,
conservatism and the cautious use of technology. The
Ziru Sirka reached its apex in approximately -3500
when it was composed of 15,000 star systems spread
across 27 sectors of space.

After thousands of years, the Vilani had begun to
struggle with the management of their vast empire
and it was in decline by -3000. They had divided
it among agencies called Bureaux, each of which
promulgated the Vilani caste system and methods
of government. The fact that the Vilani had only
achieved jump-2 technology meant that travel and
communication was slow and ponderous. By -2500

the Vilani could no longer secure their frontier from
the barbarian states beyond their borders, including
the Vargr to coreward and the Terrans to rimward.
They first encountered Terran explorers in -2422 at
a remote mining outpost on Barnard, a mere two
parsecs from Terra. The first meetings between the
Vilani and Terrans were peaceful. The Vilani had
already encountered and integrated many human
Minor Races during the expansion of their empire
and they assumed the Terrans were simply another
such race. However, first contact was a monumental
affair for the Terrans, who had never encountered
extra-terrestrial life before and were especially
shocked when they encountered other humans with
subtle physical differences.

A mere 23 years after the first meeting between
the Terrans and Vilani, the first of a series of wars
broke out between them that became known as the
Interstellar Wars. After realising the massive size and
industrial base of their enemy, the Terrans engaged
in a program of technological development and
population expansion. Despite the immensity and
breadth of the Vilani Imperium, the Terrans soon
discovered that they faced a decaying empire, one
with little hope of standing up to a motivated, rapidly
advancing opponent. Unlike the Vilani, the Terrans
had no qualms about technology. In fact, it became
an existential imperative for the Terrans to advance
as quickly as possible in order to oppose the massive
Vilani Imperium.

TRAVELLER

The Interstellar Wars were a mixed affair. The
Terrans encountered pockets of strong resistance as
they branched out into Vilani territory but they also
discovered just how decayed and unstable the Ziru
Sirka had become, especially on its rimward frontier.
Many Vilani worlds willingly submitted to Terran
authority; some were even eager to join them. Others
looked upon the Terrans as interlopers or invaders
but were not given sufficient resources by the central
government to fight back against Terran aggression.
The Terrans worked their way through Vilani space,
fighting when they had to and annexing worlds when
they did not. After 200 years, the depleted Ziru Sirka
surrendered to the Terrans and the Second Imperium
was born. The Terrans referred to this empire as The
Rule of Man.

The Terrans were accustomed to democratic
government but it soon became clear that they would
have to change their thinking when it came to the
administration of a widespread interstellar empire.
The commander-in-chief of Terran military forces,
Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, broke with Terran High
Command and took personal control of the Empire.
Rather than letting it be run from Terra with all its
politics and rivalries, Hiroshi moved the capital to
Hub (now called Kaggushus) in the Massilia sector.
When announcing this to the empire in a speech in
High Vilani, Hiroshi introduced himself and his people
for the first time as the ‘Solomani’. After 200 years of
expansion, the invaders were no longer strictly ‘Terran’
anymore. Generations had been born on conquered
and colonized worlds. Many were newly made clones
or the descendants of clones who had been mass
produced in an effort to achieve greater parity with the
Vilani. The Terrans had also uplifted many species
native to their homeworld in a desperate effort to fill
vacant roles in their military and on their starships.
The word ‘Solomani’ reflected their origin in the Sol
system but was inclusive of those who had not been
born on Terra itself. Although Hiroshi never declared
himself Emperor, his son accepted the title and was
crowned Emperor Hiroshi II, posthumously declaring
his father to have been Hiroshi I.

The Rule of Man was a tumultuous time. The Terran
Navy had spread out far and wide to absorb the
entirety of the Ziru Sirka. While officers of flag rank
were tasked with governing the most prestigious
worlds, junior officers were often left in charge of

backwaters and remote outposts. The Terrans and
Vilani began to intermix and new societies developed
that featured elements of both cultures. Over the
course of their expansion, the Solomani came into
contact with numerous human subspecies, all of
whom had also been transplanted to various worlds
by the Ancients. They adopted the collective name
Humaniti to encompass all human races that had
been found.

The Vilani managed their empire through ancient
and established tradition, and the arrival of the
Solomani with their new ideas and concepts of
personal freedom destroyed those traditions. Without
that reliance on the old ways, the Solomani had no
ability to manage such an enormous empire and the
Rule of Man collapsed in less than five centuries, a
mere blink of an eye in the long history of Humaniti.
Historians cite -1776 as the beginning of the end
when the Central Treasury on Hub refused to
honor a monetary issue from the branch treasury
of Antares. This caused a general collapse of the
financial system and the government’s ability to make
or control policy. The last claimant to the throne of
the Rule of Man made their capital on Sylea in the
Core sector.

The onset of what became known as the Long Night
brought about a decline in interstellar trade, diplomacy
and communication. This resulted in a sharp decline in
technology on many worlds and populations that could
not be maintained without a constant flow of supplies
either emigrated to worlds that could sustain them or
simply died off. Solitary worlds and small polities of a few
worlds were scattered throughout Charted Space with
huge expanses of barren star systems between them.
Most worlds lost the capacity to build jump drives and
became isolated islands in the vast reaches of space.
Citizens of many worlds lived their entire lives without
the ability to reach out to neighboring stars, some of
which were only a parsec away. The Long Night was
also a dangerous time. Pirates and reavers roamed
space, preying upon defenceless worlds and attacking
the few remaining starships that dared to travel between
the stars. Over a 1,000 years passed before the lights of
interstellar civilization began to re-emerge. The brightest
of these lights shone on Sylea, the world that was the
last vestige of the previous empire. Even as darkness
descended, Sylea had established itself as the last world
of the Rule of Man. When the curtain finally began to lift,
it was Sylea that once again led the way.

History of the Third Imperium

**THE THREE IMPERIUMS**
In reality, there has only ever been a _Third_
Imperium. Its predecessors, the Ziru Sirka and Rule
of Man were never referred to as ‘imperiums’ during
the eras in which they existed but using the terms
First, Second and Third Imperium simplifies the
terminology and makes for a convenient narrative.

The First Imperium was the Ziru Sirka or ‘Grand
Empire of the Stars’ of the Vilani. After the Terrans
defeated the Vilani in the Interstellar Wars, the
victorious successor state has been given several
names over the course of history. Terran Admiral
Hiroshi Estigarribia declared it to be the Rule of
Man, which was meant to emphasise the common
heritage of Humaniti whether they be of Solomani,
Vilani or other origin. Many academics still use the
term since it is indeed the title that the conquerors
gave to themselves, adding validity to the old adage
that ‘History is told by the victors’.

Over time, this term was politicised and Rule of
Man became the Solomani-supremacist name
of choice. Extremists among them attempted to
instil a revisionist history in which the name was
not in fact intended to establish unity between
the various human subspecies but to convey the
superiority of the conquerors. There have been

rallies and demonstrations in Solomani space that
rather unrealistically clamour for the reinstatement
of the Rule of Man based on specious arguments
that the Solomani-dominated state was never
officially dissolved.

The disparaging term Ramshackle Empire was
invented during the Long Night, replacing the Rule of
Man for those who blamed the empire for ushering
in the fall of interstellar civilization. For those who
wish neither to celebrate nor denigrate the short-lived
human empire, the neutral term Second Imperium
was adopted in reference to the fact that it was the
successor to the nominal First Imperium.

In more recent centuries, Solomani rabble
rousing has caused an academic schism of sorts,
resulting in the adoption of Ramshackle Empire
as the go-to for many academics in Imperial
space. While this derisive term does little to
fully convey the events that occurred during the
pre-Long Night era, it does get the point across
that Solomani rule was often authoritarian and
unwelcome. History has not shined a kind light on
this brief era and usage of the term Ramshackle
Empire has gained steam as a result. In modern
times one finds all three terms used, often
resulting in heated debate.

The Sylean Federation
The Long Night was a long and grievous affair that
marked the end of large-scale interstellar civilization,
the complete breakdown of communication between
star systems and a descent into barbarism. Charted
Space became a lawless place where pirates and
reavers roamed and took what they wanted without
consequences. Despite the darkness of the era,
civilization managed to eke out a perilous existence,
first on thousands of isolated worlds and eventually
among dozens of ‘pocket empires’, small collections
of worlds that had somehow managed to maintain –
or, in some cases, reobtain – jump drive technology,
enabling them to establish tenuous links between

each other. These pocket empires were a shadow
of the great empires of the past but nonetheless
managed to keep the fragile flame of interstellar
civilization alive.

In the Core sector, there were three prominent
pocket empires, several smaller ones and scores
of isolated worlds that had managed to survive.
The three dominant polities of the sector were the
Sylean Federation, the Interstellar Confederacy and
the Chanestin Kingdom. Of the three, the Syleans
were the most ambitious, the ones who had plans to
restore the greatness of Humaniti.

History of the Third Imperium

When the Long Night descended upon Sylea, the
world had an eclectic mix of ethnicities. Sylea was
one of many worlds in Charted Space to host a
human Minor Race (for more about the Syleans,
see Sylean Travellers on page 171). Vilani colonists
had settled and intermixed with the Syleans starting
in approximately -9100. The Syleans were largely
ignored and marginalised by the Vilani. After
thousands of years of intermixing, there were few
pureblood Syleans remaining but some isolated
communities had maintained complete genetic purity.
Vilani culture had come to dominate the world and
oppress its indigenous population during the era of
the Ziru Sirka but Syleans still engaged in traditional
cultural activities and practiced their own religions,
often in secret. The arrival of the Solomani during
the Rule of Man heralded a revival of Sylean culture.
The Solomani elevated Syleans to positions of power
on their homeworld after thousands of years of
oppression. Unbeknownst to the Solomani, this would
pave the way for great things to come. After the Long
Night began, the revival of Sylean culture took many
centuries to fully flower but eventually became a key
component in the rise of the Sylean Federation and its
successor state, the Third Imperium.

By -900, Sylea was one of a handful of worlds that
had regained some semblance of pre-Long Night
technology. The Syleans had reacquired fusion
power and ascended to TL9. With a small number of
starships, they began to reach out to star systems
around them in an effort to restore diplomatic
relations, communication and most importantly, trade.
Sylea was run by a majority-Solomani monarchy
during much of the Long Night, but by -650 the
people threw off the yoke of authoritarian rule. Under
pressure from its feudal nobility, Queen Rowena
abdicated the throne. The monarchy was replaced
by the Sylean Grand Senate and a president in the
executive role.

Sylean scouts began to travel to a growing circle of
star systems. By -500, the Sylean Federation had
come to include 18 systems. After much debate, the
Grand Senate determined it was time to reach out to
other pocket empires as well. Dozens of expeditions
were formed, the most ambitious of which made it to
far-off Vland in -495. Vland had also begun to travel
to neighboring systems and did not take kindly to the
Sylean intruders, initially expelling them from Vilani

space. Undeterred, the Syleans sent more missions
to Vland and, with careful diplomacy, established a
trade corridor with the Vilani in -480. Travel between
Sylea and Vland was perilous during this era. The
route was riddled with craven pirates, dead worlds and
xenophobic remnant civilizations. Even so, it gave the
Syleans confidence that they might one day rebuild
some semblance of interstellar civilization.

As the Sylean Federation grew, senators from frontier
worlds pressed for continued expansion. These
worlds enjoyed the benefits of being members of
the Federation but were exposed to the dangers of
uncivilised space just beyond its borders. In -384,
this caused a rift in the Grand Senate, creating two
factions: the Democrats and the Expansionists. The
former wanted to preserve and cultivate what Sylea
had created thus far and the latter wanted to continue
to build upon it, expanding ever outward to worlds
with which contact had been lost during the Long
Night. By the mid -350s a third faction developed:
the Industrialists, who sought a more equitable
distribution of the Federation’s growing wealth. Things
were changing rapidly and the Grand Senate and its
president struggled to keep up with the pace.

Up to this point, Sylean scout and naval fleets were
a ragtag bunch of starships, cobbled together by
fledgling manufacturing firms. The ship-building firm
Gesellschaft feur Sternschiffbau AG – abbreviated as
GSbAG or ‘Gas Bag’ as it is popularly known – was
financed by a group of wealthy senators and quickly
rose to the top of the ship construction industry.
GSbAG’s contract to build Federation Navy ships in
-334 cemented its position, making it a near monopoly.

Sylea’s rapidly advancing industrial concerns carried
them to Tech Level 11. Its starships acquired jump-2
capability, extending the Federation’s reach. Sylean
scouts discovered that their growing empire was
not alone in the Core sector when they visited the
Heraldia system in -301 and encountered ships
from the Interstellar Confederacy. The Syleans
desperately wanted access to the spinward trade
routes, but the Interstellar Confederacy was not
prepared to willingly give them up or share them.
The two empires engaged in occasional skirmishes
and wars for three centuries before the Confederacy
ultimately fell to Sylean forces.

History of the Third Imperium

_THE INTERSTELLAR_

CONFEDERACY
In the Bunkeria and Cemplas subsectors of Core,
there were a string of worlds known collectively as
the Great Spiral that managed to survive the Long
Night relatively intact. Not every world along this
string had made it through unscathed but over time,
outposts and small starports were built on ‘gap
worlds’ so that eventually they had a serviceable
jump-1 main established.

In -684, a politician from Sketola by the name of Rom
Debeshuut united the worlds of the Great Spiral into
the Interstellar Confederacy. The primary goal of
this union was to restore interstellar trade, provide
for mutual self-defence and preserve the technology
of the four or five systems that had achieved TL12.
The leaders of the Interstellar Confederacy ‘met as
equals’ in a Grand Senate on Sketola.

In -623, after expanding to 32 star systems, the
Interstellar Confederacy abruptly stopped accepting
new members. The senators determined this was
the maximum number that they could manage
and that taking on more systems would have a
deleterious effect on their ability to retain the Tech
Levels that they had so assiduously built.

The Interstellar Confederacy first encountered
scouts from the Sylean Federation in -301.
Relations started poorly and the two quickly became
enemies. Initially, the conflicts between them were
limited to commerce raiding but by -260, they
engaged in open war. In one of the war’s more
famous battles, a Sylean naval squadron routed
the Confederacy Navy at Velpare in -258 but failed
to occupy the planet after an ill-advised and poorly
executed siege. The Confederacy was humbled by
the defeat but the inability of the Syleans to take the
world itself prevented them from gaining a strong
foothold in the region.

In -239 the Confederacy suffered a civil war. Rebel
forces from its spinward arm conquered the capital
at Sketola and held it for two years before loyalists
were able to take it back. They tried to recover
from this self-inflicted wound but the damage was
done. A broken and demoralised Confederacy
faced a rapidly expanding Sylean Federation. The
Confederacy was ultimately done in by internal
divisions and an unwillingness to expand its
membership when it had the opportunity to do so.

Loyalist forces resisted the Syleans for another
century but it became a matter of when, not if, the
Confederacy would eventually collapse. Intense
battles were fought on Velpare and Heraldia in
-201 but after both fell to the Syleans, resistance
crumbled on many more of their worlds in the
following decades. By -100, the Sylean Federation
had acquired all the systems to trailing of Ye-lu.
Finally, in the year -1, the exhausted forces of the
remaining Confederacy worlds surrendered to the
Sylean Federation. That it took almost another
century after the fall of Velpare for the Confederacy
to completely collapse is a testament to its then
superior technology and the obstinacy of its worlds.

The artefacts and culture of the Interstellar
Confederacy live on in current times. The former
Confederacy worlds of Bunkeria and Cemplas
proudly celebrate their history and its famous
personalities. Perhaps the greatest living remnant
of the Confederacy is the Achenaar Antilles Line, a
merchant firm founded on F’rnow in -567 by Rualto
Achenaar and Jofan Antilles. In modern times, the
corporation remains a highly successful sector-wide
line, which has fared well against larger competitors.

_THE INTERSTELLAR CONFEDERACY_

TRAVELLER

THE CHANESTIN KINGDOM
When the Long Night fell, travel between star
systems came to a halt throughout most of civilised
space. Many worlds died out if they could not
sustain themselves without the benefit of interstellar
trade. Self-sufficient worlds were often able to
survive. With its placid K-type main sequence
primary star, standard atmosphere and bountiful
resources, Keshi was one such place.

Keshi was a rich agricultural world during the era
of the Ziru Sirka and was heavily colonized by
the Solomani after the Interstellar Wars. After the
Rule of Man collapsed, Keshi retained a fleet of
starships and huge stockpiles of materiel, which
helped it to fare better than its neighbors. In the
year -1300, Keshi was ruled by King Brzeszcze,
who used his aging fleet of starships to conquer
the systems around him. After several generations,
the Chanestin Kingdom had amassed an empire
of 25 worlds, all of which were within five parsecs
of Keshi. Once conquered, these worlds were not
excessively oppressed unless they resisted the
authority of the King.

Even as it grew increasingly incapable of
maintaining its fleet of starships, the Chanestin
Kingdom managed to govern its empire for over
1,000 years before being contacted by outsiders.
Unlike the Interstellar Confederacy, the Chanestin
people were not plagued by divisiveness
but likewise they were not blessed with the
Confederacy’s advanced technology.

The Sylean Federation established contact with
Chanestin Kingdom border worlds in -108 and
followed up by sending a flotilla of merchant ships
in -107 to establish trade ties. The ruling monarch,
Queen Nayarit, accepted the cargoes that the
merchants brought with them but had the entire
expedition executed for inciting its people with
seditious ideas. The Sylean Federation responded
by sending warships and a war broke out between
the two polities that lasted nearly a century.

By the time the Syleans had contacted them,
the highest available technology on the
Chanestin worlds was TL9 and they had been
reduced to a single operating jump-capable
starship. Unfortunately for the Syleans, they had
inadvertently given the Chanestin the tools needed
to revive their ailing navy. The Chanestin kept
the starships of the merchants whom they had
executed, armed the stolen ships and put them into
service as their own. They also reverse engineered
the technology to begin the arduous task of building
a new fleet of warships. The Chanestin Kingdom
recognized the Sylean Federation for the existential
threat that it was and invested every iota of their
energy into the preservation of their millennium-
old empire. Within a few short years, they had the
makings of a fleet and went on the offensive against
the Syleans.

After exhausting themselves in a war that lasted 63
years, the two sides signed an armistice in -44 to
prevent further bloodshed but by -25, the Kingdom
realised that their technology was becoming
increasingly inferior to that of the Syleans and they
grew desperate. Chanestin naval forces launched a
series of deep attacks into Sylean space, including
one that made it all the way to Shudushaam. In
-3, the Sylean Federation had resolved to call
upon its full military might in the conflict and finally
defeated the Chanestin Kingdom two years after the
declaration of the Third Imperium.

The feudal structure of the Chanestin Kingdom was
nullified and cooperative members of its nobility
were offered Imperial noble patents to placate them.
The once-proud Kingdom was integrated into the
Imperium and so began a painful, centuries-long
period of cultural and economic decline for their
once-proud worlds.

_HISTORICAL MAP OF THE CHANESTIN KINGDOM_

TRAVELLER

While the conflict with the Interstellar Confederacy
might best have been described as a war of attrition,
the war with the Chanestin Kingdom presented a very
different challenge for the Syleans. The Chanestin
were much more unified. The Syleans learned valuable
lessons in both conflicts, which would fuel their later
military endeavors.

Despite the problems encountered in the Core, the
Sylean Federation did not stand by idly patrolling their
own sector during this era. Federation scouts were
sent in all directions to re-establish contact with other
worlds and pocket empires that had weathered the
Long Night. During the last century of Federation rule,
its scouts had extended Sylea’s reach 30–40 parsecs
in all directions. The corridor to Vland, now called the
Annililik Run, was a long and dangerous route, used
by only the boldest of traders. Piracy plagued all of
the major trade routes, a problem which would soon
expose the Sylean Federation’s weaknesses.

While it had yet to develop a supporting bureaucracy
or official structure, the prototype of the modern scout
service began to surface in approximately -100;
previously, most scouting was performed by freelancers
and entrepreneurial ventures. Scout crews were
given contracts by the Federation government and
various corporations for the information they obtained.

Some crews focused strictly on data collection;
surveying territory, updating maps and recontacting
lost civilizations. Others worked the commercial side,
seeking natural resources to exploit, trade partners for
Sylean corporations and scoping out future industrial
sites. The two sides would not come together until
a few decades later in -29 when President Cleon
Zhunastu declared the formation of the Sylean
Federation Scout Service (SFSS). The service was
divided into four branches: Administration, Technical
Services, Operations and Exploration. The SFSS was
the precursor of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service,
which was formed in year 0 of the Third Imperium.

The SFSS had a short tenure before being replaced
by the IISS but the timing could not have been better
for its replacement. The marriage of exploratory and
mercantile services was not a happy one. The SFSS
was plagued by corruption and scandal for most of
its three decades. Too many special interests had
gotten involved in the planning of missions. Far too
often the data and security needs of the Federation
took a back seat to the desires of corporations with
deep pockets. Missions of a purely exploratory nature
were postponed if there were possible trade ties to be
had in a different region. When the IISS was formed,
commercial interests were struck from the Scout
Service’s list of responsibilities and handed over to
individual corporations.

History of the Third Imperium

The Day They Arrived
When the first ship appeared in the sky, the people of Port
Khanuum could tell there was something different about
it. Our world, Kirbarus, had been raided by pirates from
somewhere in Massilia many times but the fishermen
setting sail could tell at first glance that this was no pirate
ship. It was sleek, colourful, well-maintained and shiny.
Pirate ships were always barely holding up, with their dull,
scarred hulls and engines sputtering as they came in to
exact their toll from us. With few defensive weapons of
our own, the laser turrets on a pirate ship could be applied
with devastating results like lightning bolts hurled down
upon us from a spiteful god.

No, this ship was different. It landed on the flat
plains just outside the city near the marsh, taking
care to avoid damaging crops in the fields. The crew
wore uniforms and came out unarmed, filter masks
protecting them from our atmospheric taint. They
walked the two kilometers from the field to the town
center where they asked to speak to Port Khanuum’s
leaders. They brought gifts with them: portable fusion
power cells that could provide enough energy for an
entire province. We had returned to using fossil fuels
with a few nuclear fission plants on the coast of the
southern continent. Only in textbooks did our young
students learn about a forgotten age of fusion power
and the spacecraft that once connected worlds with
their ability to jump from star-to-star. We were among
the lucky worlds with a semi-breathable atmosphere,
genetically engineered crops and enough people to
work the land. Most of our resources were applied to
filtering out contaminants in our water and eliminating
pests that threatened our crops.

Before too long we were reunited with the star
systems around us, our agricultural goods shipped
from world-to-world, helping to revive struggling
populations and resurrecting those whose colonies
had completely died out after the Rule of Man ended.
The profits we made from selling produce and other
wares were used to purchase freighters of our own.
We felt like we were waking up from a 1,000-year-long
dream. Soon we proudly called ourselves members
of the Sylean Federation. Our world was forever
changed the day they arrived.

Cleon Zhunastu
As the Federation extended its reach to 30 or so
parsecs in all directions from Sylea, acquiring an
increasing number of member systems, the strain of
interstellar government began to show. Just as it was

for the Federation’s much larger predecessors, it was
becoming clear that centralised governments were poor
at managing large expanses of space. The limiting factor
was the reach of the jump drive, just as it had always
been. Information was limited to the speed of jump,
which made it impossible to govern from any distance
beyond a few parsecs.

The Sylean Federation had achieved a uniform TL11
and its industries were rapidly pushing towards TL12.
Jump-2 was the standard for Sylean military ships with a
smattering of jump-3 prototype spacecraft in operation.
Decisions made by the Grand Senate were carried by
fast couriers but by the time their instructions reached the
frontier, circumstances had often changed. This made
dealing with the piracy crisis increasingly difficult. The
Federation was built upon the concept of establishing
free trade between member worlds but rampant piracy
threatened to destroy everything they had built. The
Federation had built an impressive navy but there simply
were not enough squadrons to defend worlds that were
more than a few parsecs from Sylea. Arguments between
the Democrats and Expansionists paralysed the Grand
Senate. Several presidents were deposed for their failure
to handle the problem. It was clear that something had to
be done but no one in a position of leadership was willing
to make big changes until Cleon Zhunastu came along.

Cleon was born to a noble father, Grand Duke Felix
Zhunastu of Sylea and his Vilani consort, Denkhumi.
The Zhunastu family were exorbitantly wealthy,
having achieved great success in the fields of energy
production and spacecraft manufacturing. Cleon’s
Uncle Aldin was an ingenious engineer in the field
of fusion energy systems. Fusion power plants had
existed before the Long Night but most worlds had
lost the ability to manufacture them. Aldin’s patented
designs improved upon existing fusion technology and
were implemented in a line of products called Fusion
Plus (F+). F+ plants were small, tidy and energy
efficient, easily transportable for sale and installation
in distant star systems.

As the Grand Duke of Sylea, Felix Zhunastu dreamed
that the Sylean Federation would one day become
an enormous trade empire, one which would create
wealth for all of its citizens. Felix’s hands were tied
by politics during his reign but he could foresee a
time when that would change. He groomed Cleon
to be ready for that day and set plans in motion that
would ensure his legacy. Felix manipulated the Grand
Senate to grant the president broad and expansive
powers and used the Zhunastu family fortune to
acquire several key corporations that he merged into a
single corporate entity: Zhunastu Industries.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

SECRETS OF THE ZHUNASTU DYNASTY
The ageless story of the Zhunastu dynasty has transcended into the realm of myth. There is little doubt that
the family was a talented bunch but some aspects of their story are shrouded in mystery.

They became the masters of the Sylean Federation, yet had little if any Sylean blood in their heritage.
They used technology to overcome their rivals, yet for a time they were not even the most technologically
advanced empire in their own sector. The Zhunastus had an uncanny ability to overcome every obstacle
in their path with a clear and methodical approach. They were undeterred by setbacks and always
seemed prepared with a contingency plan when things went awry. Many historians believe that they used
two tools to overcome challenges that got in their way: psychohistory and psionics.

Felix Zhunastu had long been a disciple of psychohistory, the use of mathematics to predict the mass
movements and future history of Humaniti. The larger the sampling, the better psychohistory works, or
so goes the conventional wisdom. Vilani psychohistorians predicted the long, drawn-out fall of the Ziru
Sirka. Solomani psychohistorians saw the demise of the Rule of Man coming like a high-speed freight
train. These were enormous empires with populations in the trillions. The Sylean Federation was a tiny
polity in comparison, yet its leaders increasingly leaned on psychohistory as their empire grew in size
and population. This was at least one of the reasons for the Syleans’ eagerness to reunite with Vland. By
reconnecting with the capital of the old empire, the Syleans increased their sample size immensely, making
psychohistorical predictions much more accurate. By the time Cleon took the role of Grand Duke upon his
father’s death, the Federation and its allies had achieved a certain critical mass, providing an increasing
level of clarity and accuracy in their psychohistorical predictions.

While there is no direct proof, most believe that the Zhunastus also employed psions in key roles of their
political and corporate organizations. There is little reason to believe the Zhunastus themselves had psionic
talent but both Sylea and Rhylea (then called Udmum) hosted reputable psionic clubs and university
programs. The top psionic talents of the era were recruited by the noble families to serve as aides and
spies. There were laws preventing unlawful telepathic and clairvoyant intrusion, which necessitated the
development of counter-psionics: psions trained to detect and prosecute violations. Psionics gave the
nobility and corporate community unprecedented advantages over their competition. Rumor has it that the
Zhunastus even had a precog on their payroll, a rare talent indeed.

In -32 Cleon returned from a long journey during
which he had visited Antares, Amdukan and finally
Vland, where he stayed for over a year to study at the
Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin (AAB), the Vilani
‘repository of all knowledge’. In a public statement,
Cleon expressed admiration for the world’s history
and customs. While studying at the AAB, he published
a dissertation: ‘The Vilani Imperative: Lessons of the
Shudusham Concords’. Within the Core sector in the
year -112, terrorists detonated a bomb on a courier
robot that killed the premier of Fornol and several
Sylean nobles while aboard the Empire’s Banner ,
a Sylean warship. The incident nearly caused a

civil war. Cleon’s scholarly paper hypothesised that
the Shudusham Concords, which limited the use of
weaponry on robots, were evidence of the enduring
Vilani legacy in the modern Core. Cautious and limited
use of technology were tenets of Vilani philosophy and
Cleon won his hosts over with a spirited statement of
their shared heritage.

Felix Zhunastu died in -30, leaving a young but wise-
beyond-his-years Cleon as his heir. Cleon assumed the
mantle of Grand Duke, president of the Grand Senate
and chairman of Zhunastu Industries at the tender age
of 27. He did not waste time making his mark.
History of the Third Imperium

Cleon kept a close eye on the family business but
appointed his Uncle Aldin as chief executive officer to
perform the day-to-day management of the company.
During Cleon’s first year as president of the Grand
Senate, the Syleans began to actively recruit more
worlds to the Federation. The recruitment drive was
anchored by Vland, which committed its worlds.
Stronger diplomatic and trade ties between Sylea and
Vland had been developing for centuries and Cleon’s
presence and scholarly work at the AAB was the
decisive factor in the Vilani decision to join. In a public
statement on Sylea, Cleon expressed his gratitude for
their trust and vowed to leave Vilani social institutions
intact. The union of the Sylean and Vilani polities was a
coup of major proportions. It conveyed the inevitability
of the growing Sylean trade federation, served as
a valuable recruiting tool and gave the citizens of
the Federation the sense that they were a part of
something much bigger than themselves.

Not content to sit on his laurels, Cleon became the
renaissance man of his times, engaging in politics,
business and diplomacy with equal verve. One of his
first acts was to reform the Scout Service. While the
agency had been one of the linchpins of the expansion
effort, noble and corporate influence had corrupted
it. Instead of extending the reach of the Federation, it
had become a tool of the wealthy. High-ranking nobles
and business leaders were effectively selecting the
Scout Service’s missions and sanctioning only those
which served their narrow business interests. While
developing trade routes was certainly a key goal,
Cleon felt that the Scout Service must be focused
on survey and exploration for their own sake and set
up a bureaucracy to give the agency independence.
This would be the first of many reforms that helped
the Scout Service become the institution that it is in
modern times.

A big test for the growing Sylean Federation was
solving the piracy crisis. Piracy had become an
epidemic, hindering the growth of the Federation and
threatening its membership drive. Zhunastu Industries
built a squadron of light carriers and sublight gunships,
fitted them with F+ plants and sent them to the frontier.
They struck a major blow at the Azimuth system where
they destroyed a particularly notorious pirate. While the
destruction of one pirate ship did not end the crisis, it
was a major public relations victory for the Federation.
It gave the frontier worlds the confidence that the
Federation was going to help them.

Cleon’s actions during the pre-Imperial era were
often maddening to his peers. One week he would be
working on diplomatic relations with the monarch of

Adguu Uun, the next he would be off to Nimluin to be
present for Zhunastu Industries’ latest factory opening
and then back to Capital to discuss the future of the
Federation. Historical records of the era make him
appear to be a madman but when one steps back to
look at the big picture, it was almost as if Cleon already
knew what would happen in the year 0, the year that
the Third Imperium was founded.

Obviously, Cleon was just one man and there was
only so much he could do. Over time, he learned
to delegate authority to women and men whom
he deemed trustworthy, dutiful and honorable,
characteristics that he looked for in others throughout
his life. Cleon had a vision that he was striving towards
with single-minded focus and sought others who
shared his dream to build a great and lasting empire.

Year 0
Cleon spent the last years of the Sylean Federation
building and consolidating power. He established
allegiances with trusted corporate executives and
members of the nobility. The SFSS continued to
extend the Federation’s reach and Zhunastu Industries
peddled F+ technology to member and satellite worlds
in an effort to draw them into the fold. On Sylea,
those who worked with Cleon saw their fortunes
grow immensely. GSbAG, which had long held a
favorable relationship with the Zhunastus, became
the Federation’s primary military contractor, building
warships for the growing navy and freighters for its
expanding merchant lines.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

Cleon broke ground on the first Grand Palace of the
Imperium. The project was completed in two years. It
was an ugly building that looked more like a fortress
than a stately manor but this was intentional. Its
pyramidal structure and few entrances were designed
to make it easier to defend should it come under
siege. The palace and its Emperor would have to
survive the tumultuous early years of a new empire.
Cleon was leery of leaks and initially coy about the
exact nature of his grand plans. Only a select group of
close confidantes knew the whole picture. The Sylean
Federation was going big. Imperial scouts had by this
time encountered dozens of pocket empires. Cleon
foresaw a future in which there was a place for all of
them under the umbrella of a new and powerful empire,
one which transcended all that had come before.

Cleon’s final act as president and Grand Duke of
Sylea was to issue the Warrant for the Restoration
of the Imperium. This document declared that the
Sylean Federation and its associated worlds would
transform into the Third Imperium on the first day
of the following year. The warrant claimed that the
Third Imperium would one day include all worlds
that had once been under the Ziru Sirka and Rule of
Man. Precedence, tradition and history would guide
the hand of this new Imperium in its quest to restore
civilization to Charted Space.

The Warrant for Restoration did not meet with universal
approval. For 650 years, the power structure of the
Sylean Federation had calcified. Not everyone was
so keen to give it up. Thirteen of the worlds closest
to Sylea initially rejected the warrant. Cleon and his
closest supporters worked vehemently to gain their
support and within a few months had brought five of the
13 back into the fold. Shortly after the founding of the
Third Imperium three of these worlds flip-flopped once
again and nullified their Imperial memberships. These
systems became known as the Wayward Worlds.
Fortunately for Cleon he still had the votes in the Grand
Senate to carry out his plan, if only barely. On the last
day of the 650th year of the Sylean Federation, the
Grand Senate ratified the Warrant for Restoration and
declared Cleon the first Emperor of the Third Imperium.
He was crowned Cleon I on the first day of Imperial
year 0 and Sylea was renamed Capital. No longer was
it just the provincial capital of a pocket empire. Capital
aspired to become the center of the greatest interstellar
empire in human history.

The Emperor of the Third Imperium was given
sweeping powers, far more than the leader of Sylea’s
Grand Senate or its president and a feudal nobility was
established that would become an extension of the
Emperor’s will. Members of the nobility were granted
patents that established their titles. Many would be
granted fiefs to administer. Nobles would serve at the
Emperor’s leisure and could have their patents revoked
if they did not perform to expectations.

The Grand Senate was dissolved and replaced by the
Imperial Moot, a deliberative body composed of the
appointed nobles. The Moot was given two powers: the
ability to confirm the ascendance of a new Emperor
and dissolve the Imperium. Many of its members
were former Senators. Others were corporate officers,
military leaders and other esteemed individuals who
proved their loyalty and commitment to the new
Imperium. Provisional fiefs were assigned to the new
nobility. These would be altered and consolidated in the
months and years ahead as the Imperium took shape.

The Moot convened on Capital in state offices
separate from the Imperial Grand Palace. In addition
to its primary powers, the Moot served in an advisory
role to the Emperor. A senior member of the Moot
was selected to serve as Chancellor. This position
had special privileges and access to the Emperor.
A primary facet of the new Imperium was that its
high nobles – primarily its dukes and eventually its
archdukes – would have broad powers and oversight
over their respective regions. The previous human
empires fell because they became too large to
manage. The Third Imperium sought to address
this shortcoming by sharing the responsibility with a
trusted hierarchy of noble bureaucrats.

The Imperial Guard was formed to protect the Emperor
on Capital. At first its only regiment was the Sylean
Guard but many more regiments would be added over
time. The Federation Navy became the Imperial Navy,
whose role was to defend the space between worlds
and enforce Imperial law. The Imperial Marines were
established, the powerful shipborne assault force
of the navy. Articles were drafted for the creation of
an Imperial Army as well. This would require a sea
change in military thinking. Previously the armies of
Federation worlds were independent entities. The
armies of Imperial worlds would retain some degree of
independence but they would engage in joint training
exercises, observe certain uniform and equipment
standards and share strategic objectives.

History of the Third Imperium

The SFSS became the Imperial Interstellar Scout
Service (IISS). The organization was still in flux in
the early years of Imperial rule. With corporate and
noble influences effectively rooted out, the IISS
became a neutral arm of the Imperial government.
The branches that were most corrupted – Operations
and Administration – were defunded, leaving the less
political Exploration and Technical Services branches
intact but now bereft of an administrative umbrella
and therefore responsible for their own administration.
The new IISS had essentially cut off its diseased
appendages, leaving only those in place whose motives
were deemed to be pure. Members of Operations
and Administration who had acquitted themselves
honorably were given new roles in the pared down,
more efficient service. These changes had an extreme
effect on scout culture. A flat, less stratified structure
began to take shape, one in which even the lowliest
scout had a voice. The flat structure of the Scout
Service would soon be reflected in its fleet of starships
as well. The venerable _Iiken_ -class scout/courier was
adopted as the ship of choice, a small, durable, multi-
faceted and most of all economical spacecraft that
could be operated by a light crew (one individual if
necessary) and which could perform most of the jobs
the scouts needed done: communications, survey and
exploration. The wedge-shaped design of the ship had
withstood the test of time, dating back to the era of the
Ziru Sirka. The modern Type-S scout/courier uses a
nearly identical form factor with subtle changes.

The Fledgling Imperium
At the dawn of the Third Imperium, its territory included
most of the Core and Vland sectors with islands of
independence throughout but Cleon had set his sights
on a far greater empire. Despite the fact that upon its
birth the Imperium was effectively at war – the conflict
with the Chanestin Kingdom was in its final throes and
the rebellious Santry Cluster was being pacified by the
Imperial Marines – it never wavered from its designs
upon all of the territory formerly held by the Ziru Sirka
and Rule of Man.

Having such lofty aspirations is commendable but
actually achieving them another thing altogether.
Cleon’s method was to kill them with kindness. After the
residents of each world were contacted – by the scouts
or otherwise – Imperial merchants would attempt to
trade with them in order to show the value that the
Imperium could bring to their lives. If they consented to
join, they were promised the whole package: free trade,
defence by the Imperial Navy, assignment of a noble to
serve as an intermediary and so on. If they balked, the

Imperium would simply move on to the next world and
leave the ungrateful ones in the dust. Cleon believed
that most worlds would join up and those that did not
would eventually come to their senses. What he did not
count on was how much patience it would require to
see this process through.

The early years of the nascent empire were marked
by the second great expansion and an attempt to
consolidate territory already held. The effort to draw
the more reluctant worlds into the fold would require
an impressive value proposition, visible evidence that
joining the Imperium was worthwhile. Like any new
venture, it would take time to show a profit. Planetary
rulers had to understand that there might not be a
big payoff during their lifetimes. The reward would
be to see the explosive growth of the empire and a
future made bright by burgeoning trade. Cleon spent
most of his time on Capital during this era, justifying
the existence of the Imperium to a divided Moot and
carefully cultivating his political relationships. The
success of this monumental venture was by no means
a certainty at this point. The forces stacked against
it were considerable, some of which were banal and
others more nefarious. Worlds that had been bypassed
and yet committed to the Imperium represented a
subtle if persistent threat.

A constant battle that Cleon had to fight with the
Imperial court was a tendency towards conservatism
in the worlds close to Capital. As the space between
the Core worlds became increasingly safe and its trade
routes more lucrative, there was less of a desire to
take chances lest they ‘tip the apple cart’. The only way
Cleon could combat this tendency was by extending
Imperial borders ever outward.

By the year 20, the Imperium encompassed a good
portion of the Antares, Dagudashaag, Ilelish and
Massilia sectors, adding to the wide swath of stars
it had already acquired along the path to Vland. The
membership of the Moot was expanded to incorporate
the new barons, marquises, counts and dukes
assigned to these territories. Local administrative
control was given to new members of the peerage,
providing an acid test for the Emperor’s distributed
management model.

Pirates and reavers still roamed much of Imperial
space, especially along the frontier, but regional control
of naval forces made it possible to squelch malcontents
quickly and efficiently. It would be an exaggeration to
say that trade flourished in the frontiers immediately
thereafter but it became increasingly apparent that

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

it would over time. They had only to look at the Core
worlds to see the proof. The Wayward Worlds and
their ilk began to see the signs of progress passing
them by at jump speed. Traders who had established
connections to the Imperium’s growing system of
links and branches were the first to reap the benefits
of Imperial expansion. Many of the worlds that had
resisted joining thus far came to their senses and
applied for membership.

With a growing number of worlds joining the Imperium,
Emperor Cleon declared in the year 17 that Imperial
citizenship would be granted to all sophonts within
Imperial borders, not just humans. There is some
debate among academics about the timing of Cleon’s
declaration. Scouts had begun to make contact with
worlds as far as the Ley and Gateway sectors, and
there were rumors of missions to the uncharted
territories across the Great Rift and recontact with
Mother Terra to rimward. With so many distant regions
being integrated into the Imperium, most historians
believe the declaration was simply a hearty welcome
to any and all alien species who were being asked
to join. To a great extent this was certainly true.
However, there is a movement among academia who
also believe it was a harbinger of what was to come.
As an avid practitioner of psychohistory, Cleon may
well have foreseen the difficulties that would arise
with the incorporation of Antares, in part because the
culture of the region included Vargr. Cleon could have
made the Declaration of 17 with the Vargr of Antares
in mind, whom he hoped to recruit along with their
human cohorts.

While Cleon never did take a wife, he did produce
an heir with his consort, Medi Ahn Thon, a woman of
mostly Sylean heritage whose family were wealthy
industrialists from Zimiin (now Knabbib). His son, who
would one day take the crown as Cleon II, was born
in the year 21 and was Cleon’s only offspring. Unlike
his father Felix before him, Cleon the elder did little
to apprentice his son for the leadership role that he
would eventually be asked to take. He left the boy’s
education in the hands of his tutors and university
professors. Bereft of a strong father figure, young
Cleon turned to Artemsus Lentuli, Chancellor of the
Moot and his father’s most trusted advisor. Artemsus
was the son of Djugashvili Lentuli, who had served
as Cleon’s intelligence chief in the first years of the
Imperium. The younger Lentuli had already lived an

eventful life and was famous for helping to fight off a
pirate attack on one of his family’s ships at the age of

17. He went on to have a distinguished career in the
newly created Imperial Navy, followed by a stint as a
diplomat for the Moot.

As Chancellor, Artemsus sought to integrate the
worlds that had thus far resisted incorporation into the
Imperium. He coined the term ‘Quarantine Worlds’,
likening them to viruses or parasites, which must either
be treated or cut off from the interstellar community of
the Imperium. Quarantine Worlds reaped the benefits
of membership in the Imperium without paying taxes or
contributing to its defence. Artemsus claimed that the
Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium justified his
actions. He employed the Imperial bureaucracy (a.k.a.,
the nobility) as his agents to draw Quarantine Worlds
into the fold with diplomacy where possible but with
force if necessary.

With the dream of the Third Imperium in only its
nascent stages, Cleon I died in the year 53. His son
was crowned Cleon II but quickly decided that he was
unfit for the role. After an ignominious year on the
throne, during which he became known as ‘Cleon the
Weak’, he abdicated without an heir, expressing his
preference that his highly capable Chancellor should
become Emperor. The brief but eventful Zhunastu
Dynasty had come to an end – for now – to be
succeeded by the first of the Lentuli Line. As for young
Cleon, he continued to serve the Imperium faithfully,
spending a great deal of time on the frontier where he
helped Artemsus to integrate Quarantine Worlds.

The Pacification Campaigns and

the Spinward Frontier
Once crowned, Artemsus adopted a decidedly more
aggressive approach to realising the Warrant for
Restoration. He initiated the Pacification Campaigns, a
massive effort to integrate the Quarantine Worlds and
all of the worlds that had been held by the previous
empires. In preparation, Artemsus divided the Imperium
into five domains: Sylea, Antares, Vland, Ilelish and
Gateway. In each domain except Sylea, he appointed
an archduke from the ranks of the subsector dukes.
The archduke of the Domain of Sylea was also the
Emperor. Each of these archdukes was responsible for
the integration of their respective Quarantine Worlds
and inclusion of historically held regions of space. As
Archduke of Sylea, Artemsus led by example.

History of the Third Imperium

_THE PACIFICATION_

_CAMPAIGNS_
The Pacification Campaigns were the first great test
of the Third Imperium’s approach to government. The
archdukes were given broad powers to ‘pacify’ their
worlds. Unlike the traditional approach used by the
Vilani bureaux or the chaotic management style of the
Rule of Man, Artemsus’ archdukes were given clear
guidelines and then told to get the job done. They were
not forced to wait for a central authority figure to tell
them what to do each step of the way. The archdukes’
methods met with varying results.

The guidelines that the archdukes were given
encouraged multiple levels of diplomacy before
considering the use of military force. Firstly, they were
to present the benefits of Imperial membership with the
implication that joining was not really a choice; it was
required. If there was resistance, they were to seek
out sympathetic members of the population, arm them
and encourage them to rise up in revolution. Should
the locals fail in this capacity, directed coups and
assassinations were to be considered. If all of the above
failed the full military power of the Imperium might then
be brought to bear. Ultimately the Emperor would brook
no dissent. One way or another, the Quarantine Worlds
and the regions claimed by the Warrant for Restoration
_would_ be integrated... whether they liked it or not.

The Archduke of Gateway was exempted from the
Pacification Campaigns. While their day would
certainly come, Gateway was simply too recently
settled and unruly for any attempt at pacification to be
successful. Even so, the archduke managed to get
himself killed in battle with the Luriani, an amphibian
human Minor Race based in Ley Sector. The Luriani
were subsequently pacified but did not join the
Imperium until 202.

The Emperor had yet to appoint an Archduke of Sol
but plans to do so were in the offing. By the year 100

* about halfway through the Pacification Campaigns
* Imperial scouts were making first contact with the
worlds of the Solomani Rim. They discovered that the
sector had five powerful pocket empires: the Arcturus
Federation, the Easter Concord, the Vegan Polity, the
Dingir League and the Old Earth Union. A softer touch
would be required to draw the Solomani Rim into the
Imperium, one which Artemsus himself would devise.
Gaining the favor of such a well-established region of
space would require a longer game to be played.

THE ANTARES CAMPAIGN
Conquering the Quarantine Worlds of Lishun and
Antares was difficult due to the proximity of the Vargr
Extents. Quarantines and blockades were routinely
flouted by the Vargr who supplied resistant human
worlds with virtually whatever they needed. Whatever

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

the Vargr could not provide from the Extents, they
obtained by pirating Imperial merchant ships and
then fenced the stolen goods at a premium on the
Quarantine Worlds. After decades of frustration, the
Imperium went to war in these sectors, conquering the
pockets of resistance in Lishun during the early 80s
but meeting with stiff resistance in Antares. With some
difficulty, the Imperial military conquered the rimward
portion of the sector including the much sought-after
Antares Cluster. Despite the territorial gains it had
made, the Antares Campaigns were considered to be
an abject failure. The inability to establish a firm grasp
on Lishun and Antares prevented the Imperium from
obtaining a beachhead from which it could conquer the
Windhorn, Meshan, Mendan and Amdukan sectors,
each of which had been partially or entirely in the
possession of the Ziru Sirka.

THE ILELISH CAMPAIGN
The Archduke of Ilelish had a remarkably easy job
to do during the Pacification Campaigns; most of the
worlds in the domain were amenable to integration.
Ilelish (the system) was the homeworld of the
Suerrat, a human Minor Race that had established
an independent empire using sublight gravitic drives
before being gifted jump technology by the Vilani.
The sector population was approximately 60 percent
Suerrat at the time of the campaigns. Ilelish had many
pocket empires of various sizes and Tech Levels that
recognized the benefits of Imperial membership. Many
of these worlds had fond historical memories of the
Rule of Man and eagerly welcomed the return of a
broad interstellar power with all the benefits it entailed.
Furthermore, Ilelish had begun to realise the threat
posed by the burgeoning Aslan Hierate to spinward
and sought the aid of the Imperial Navy to defend its
borders. Ironically, Ilelish would be the source of a
great deal of strife for the Imperium in the following
centuries but at this time they were happy to become
a part of it.

THE VILANI CAMPAIGN
Archduke Lukgirigaasa of Vland easily integrated
most of the Dagudashaag sector, much of which
already benefited from Imperial largesse. The trade
corridor developed between Sylea and Vland in the
previous centuries had already touched many of
the sector’s worlds and slowly drawn them into the

fold over time. Any worlds that continued to resist
Imperial authority were given simple demonstrations
of the benefits of membership followed by equally
convincing demonstrations of the military force
that could be brought to bear should they decline.
Archduke Lukgirigaasa, it appeared, was quite
good at demonstrations of force but proven to be
sorely lacking when actually called upon to use it.
The Imperium met stiff resistance in the spinward
portion of the sector and in neighboring Gushemege
where the Lancian culture held sway. Most of the
inhabitants of this region had little knowledge of the
state of affairs outside their realm and had built a
modest interstellar empire of their own. The Lancians
resisted integration and marshalled enough forces to
rout Imperial squadrons during the Battle of Aakgar.
When word got to Artemsus, he retired Lukgirigaasa,
replacing him with the dour Archduke Im Derisumir
whose years of conflict with the Vargr on the coreward
frontier of Vland had steeled him to the realities
of war. In typical Vilani fashion, the new archduke
regrouped, reinforced his fleets and retaliated with
brutal efficiency. The Lancians were brought into the
Imperium by force. Stiff pockets of resistance were
eradicated with orbital bombardments, cleansing
many worlds of their entire populations. Despite the
extreme methods employed, the end result was the
full integration of all worlds in the domain.

THE SYLEAN CAMPAIGN
The archduke of the Domain of Sylea is also the
Emperor, so Artemsus himself was responsible for
the pacification and integration of Core, Fornast and
Delphi. As the architect of the Pacification Campaigns,
Artemsus brought the full range of Imperial powers to
bear upon these worlds with great success. Artemsus
used diplomacy wherever possible but quickly
accelerated the methods used to inciting coups d’état
and revolutions, establishing blockades, threatening
orbital bombardment and – when necessary –
invading and occupying. Core was entirely integrated
into the Third Imperium by the year 111 and significant
portions of Fornast and Delphi were acquired as well.
It was crucial to the future of the Imperium that the
Emperor’s own domain be effectively pacified and
Artemsus made certain that it was. A further goal of
the Sylean Campaign was to pacify the worlds of
Massilia but it would be centuries before that sector
was fully integrated.

History of the Third Imperium

The Pacification Campaigns were not met with
universal praise. There were many who dissented,
some of whom were members of the Moot. The most
famous of these was Zuan Kerr, the statesman who
had almost single-handedly brought the hostile Ershur
subsector in Massilia into the Imperium by going to
its worlds, living among its people and cultivating
diplomatic ties with them. Kerr opposed the use of
force as a method of coercion, preferring instead the
peaceful approach that had been fostered by Cleon
I. Alas, Kerr died in 67, paving the way for Artemsus’
campaigns to begin. It was a testament to Kerr’s
influence that it took Artemsus another decade to win
the Moot over. However, following the violence of the
Pacification Campaigns, Kerr would again become a
pivotal figure, even posthumously, among those who
did not wish to see the Imperium take the path of a
belligerent conqueror. Kerr’s erudite pleas against
the injudicious use of violence changed the way the
Imperium approached conflicts.

While Artemsus was in the process of executing the
Pacification Campaigns, he never took his attention
from the goal of continued expansion. By any means
possible, Artemsus intended to prosecute the Warrant
for Restoration. The failure of the Antares Campaign
to integrate the coreward sectors of the First Imperium
was a public relations disaster. Fortunately for
Artemsus, he had another advantage.

Just as the Pacification Campaigns had begun, several
expeditions had made their way through the Great
Rift into Deneb and what would one day be called the
Spinward Marches. Previous attempts to gain entry to
the region via the coreward portion of Corridor met with
disaster for various reasons, not least of which were

plundering Vargr corsairs. More successful attempts
were made by crossing the Rift via Ishirdu. The Great
Rift was a vast obstacle to expansion into the region,
but innovation and persistence on the part of the
explorers made it happen. In the year 60, an expedition
funded by the megacorporation Ling Standard Products
established a colony on Mora from which dozens of
other colonial expeditions would spring.

The Emperor was eager to get the IISS involved and
sent several scout fleets across the Rift, each of which
contained 10 or more of the Scout Service’s Iiken -class
scout/couriers. Just as in the days of old, when the Ziru
Sirka was expanding its borders, these ships travelled
far and wide, collecting survey data of the entire region
that would one day become the Domain of Deneb.
To celebrate their heroic efforts, Emperor Artemsus
founded the Order of the Arrow in 62, which was only
open to distinguished members of the Scout Service.

The scouts and other intrepid explorers who crossed
the Rift discovered that Deneb and the Spinward
Marches were largely uninhabited but not all of its
worlds were virgin territory. There were several
interstellar polities already there, including the Sword
Worlds, Darrian Confederation and Zhodani Consulate.
There were records of the latter but it had been
thousands of years since they had last been contacted.
By 75, Imperial scouts, colonial expeditions and
corporate-sponsored enterprises had expanded deep
into the Marches and established a colony on Regina.
Early expeditions also discovered isolated civilizations
on many individual worlds, including dozens in the
Trojan Reach that had once been members of the
highly advanced Sindalian Empire, which had imploded
in an apocalyptic civil war during the Long Night.
History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

The stories out of Deneb were a welcome distraction
from the failures of the Antares Pacification Campaign.
If the new Imperium could not acquire all of the
sectors claimed by the Warrant of Restoration, at
least it was in the process of trailblazing a new and
largely uninhabited region of space. The Domain of
Deneb captured the imaginations of the citizens of the
Imperium. The notion that there were uncharted worlds
to spinward being made ready for expansion gave
people hope for the future.

For a time, the two narratives ran concurrently. On
one side, the Imperium was assiduously working to
reacquire all systems held by the previous empires,
however unrealistic that goal may have been. On the
other, the Imperium explored new worlds, reinventing
itself and becoming something entirely new. It was time
for things to change. Artemsus abruptly called an end
to the Pacification Campaigns in the year 120.

Terra Mater
Scarcely noticed during all the hubbub of the times,
a noble by the name of Magis Sergei haut-Devroe
completed an extensive research project on the origins
of Humaniti. One of the great mysteries of Charted
Space was the seemingly simultaneous appearance
of human species on dozens of worlds. Haut-Devroe
travelled extensively throughout the Imperium,
performing exhaustive research of the fossil records of
many worlds and examined Humaniti’s place in their
respective ecosystems. After eliminating Urunishu in
Antares as a candidate, it became clear to haut-Devroe
and his team that Terra was clearly the homeworld
of all human species. He published The Solomani
Hypothesis: The True Origin of Mankind on Kaggushus
in the Massilia sector in 102, perhaps expecting to rock
the foundations of the galaxy. Instead, his monumental
discovery was initially ignored and later met with tepid
acceptance when it was presented to the broader
audience of the Imperium in 114. To be fair, it was not
the first time Terra had been suggested as the origin
world of Humaniti. The Terrans themselves presented
convincing evidence during the Rule of Man; however,
the ubiquity of the Vilani and racial pride of the 40 or so
other human races prevented universal acceptance.

Haut-Devroe proposed that a mysterious alien race
called the Ancients took human and canine samples
from Terra in approximately -300,000, genetically
engineered many of them and seeded them among
the worlds of Charted Space. The disappearance

of the Ancients was a mystery to researchers who
ascertained they had destroyed themselves in an
enormous Final War, although the disposition of the
winners was never determined. Researchers theorized
they may have gone extinct or left Charted Space.
The Ancients disappeared from the galactic scene in
approximately -290,000, leaving only ruins and altered
races behind.

Despite the nonchalance with which the Solomani
Hypothesis was received, Emperor Artemsus took it
very seriously. The IISS had only recently recontacted
the empires of the Solomani Rim and it was readily
apparent that incorporating the origin sector of
Humaniti would not be accomplished by a pacification
campaign. The five pocket empires of the Solomani
Rim were each powerful in their own right with separate
navies, complex political and economic relationships
and old cultures that had weathered the Long Night
much better than most such states. Each of the four
had retained jump technology and were impeded from
expanding into the Imperial Core by the much more
severe collapse of the worlds coreward of the Rim.

There was some trepidation on Artemsus’ part that
if not handled carefully, the Solomani empires could
unite in some way before membership in the Imperium
was even offered. Many of the worlds of the new
Imperium had humans of Solomani descent and might
find membership in a competitive Solomani empire
more appealing. Artemsus spent the post-Pacification
Campaign years letting the dust settle, consolidating
commercial relationships with the newly minted
member worlds of the Imperium and reaching out
across unintegrated territory to begin the process of
finding common ground with the Solomani.

Despite acceptance of the Solomani Hypothesis being
far from universal, the influence of Solomani nobles
in the fledgling Imperium was strong. Many petitioned
Artemsus to immediately establish stronger ties with
the Solomani Rim and Terra. Artemsus felt it was far too
early to bring Terra on board. The Third Imperium was
still young and the integration of the alleged homeworld
of Humaniti might have disruptive political effects.

Artemsus died in the year 166 at the age of 183, an
impressive number for most humans but typical for the
Lentuli line. His son succeeded him and was crowned
Martin I. Artemsus had been careful not to neglect
his son as had Cleon I before him. Martin was fully
indoctrinated in his father’s philosophy and strategies
for establishing a greater Imperium, perhaps to excess.

History of the Third Imperium

The Julian War
It must have been frustrating for Emperor Martin to
have spent his entire life being prepared for the role
of Emperor only to have his father live for 183 years.
Martin’s destiny was put on hold until he had reached
the age of 154. To put that in perspective, Martin had
more than a century _after_ retiring from a distinguished
military career to think about what he might do as
Emperor before being allowed to actually do it. To make
matters worse, once Martin finally did pick a fight, about
a decade into his reign, he chose a nemesis who deftly
outmaneuverd him and proved to be his superior in
just about every way.

Martin was obsessed with the failure of the Antares
Pacification Campaign. Still smarting after half a
century, he was adamant in his belief that a second
attempt would succeed where the first had failed. With
great effort and a significant expenditure of political and
military capital, Martin spurred the Archduke of Antares
to launch what became known as the Julian War.

The Julian War had been a long time coming. Julian
Menderes, the patriarch of the hallowed Menderes
Corporation, was named Regent of the Asimikigir
Confederation and rallied the disparate states of
Mendan and Amdukan into an alliance that became
known as the Julian Protectorate. These disconnected
interstellar states found common cause in their desire
to repel the Imperium. The Vargr of the region had been
slaves to humans for centuries but were given their
freedom by the progressive Asimikigir Confederation.
Rumors that the Imperium was enslaving and killing
Vargr in far-off Corridor motivated the Vargr of Antares
to fight them.

After the Pacification Campaigns ended, the Julian
Protectorate frustrated and delayed Imperial action
for over 50 years. The delaying action gave the
Protectorate time to build the Star Legion, a unified
defence force whose primary purpose was to fend off
the Imperium.

The Imperium launched its first attacks in 175,
determined to strike a demoralising blow to the Julian
Protectorate early in the conflict. The Imperial Admiralty
believed that the Protectorate would be overwhelmed
by the sheer power and destructive capabilities that
its navy brought to bear. The fleet was organised
in two columns, one of which drove towards Lasla

in Mendan and the other towards the much more
ambitious target of Asimikigir in Amdukan, the capital
of Julian Menderes’ state of origin. Within three years,
it appeared as if the Imperium had accomplished
its goals, with most of Mendan and Amdukan under
Imperial control and the Lasla system as its base of
operations. The second fleet was driving towards
Asimikigir when things took a surprising turn. A Star
Legion fleet, reinforced by squadrons from the Vargr
Extents pushed back against the Asimikigir offensive,
resulting in a period of retrenchment for both sides that
lasted until 183.

Just as the Imperium was prepared to resume
hostilities, Julian Protectorate and Vargr fleets launched
a two-pronged attack of their own, one of which
thrust headlong into the Antares and Lishun sectors,
lacerating the flank of the Imperial column. The other
fleet crossed the Empty Quarter Rift and struck from
behind the Imperial fleet into Antares and Ley. The Star
Legion destroyed the poorly defended naval depots in
both sectors, crippling the Imperium’s chances. The
Imperium was forced to retreat in order to defend the
gains they had paid for so dearly during the Pacification
Campaigns. With memories of the Antares Campaign
still fresh in their minds, the worlds of the Antares
Cluster revolted against the Imperium and the Star
Legion liberated them.

Emperor Martin was forced to sue for peace. The
Treaty of Antares was signed in 191, resulting in a
significant loss of territory. Powerless to do otherwise,
the Imperium granted the League of Antares
autonomous status. The Star Legion forces withdrew
from Lishun and Ley but the Imperium had lost more
than half of the Antares sector. The Imperium withdrew
from the region, defeated and demoralised.

Martin failed to anticipate the ability of the Julian
Protectorate to draw upon the resources of the Vargr
Extents and underestimated the abilities of their navy.
He also failed to understand how important charisma
is in Vargr society. Julian Menderes was a charismatic
leader, one admired by humans and Vargr alike. It
would be simplistic to say that the Vargr were also
stirred to action by millennia of mistreatment but this
was certainly also a factor. This was not the last time
the Imperium would have to deal with the Vargr but
when they did, they were determined not to repeat the
mistakes of the Julian War.

Greener Pastures
Colonization efforts in the Domain of Deneb saw a
significant uptick after the Imperium lost the Julian
War. If the Imperium could not have Meshan,
Mendan and Amdukan, perhaps the acquisition of
Deneb and the Spinward Marches would restore
Imperial honor and pride.

While Charted Space is far too broad a place
for events on one side to affect those hundreds
of parsecs away, on Capital the Emperor and
his court wanted to weave a narrative that cast
the Imperium in a favorable light. The defeated
fleets returned home to lick their wounds, rebuild
the depots of Antares and Lishun and defend the
empire from a growing list of enemies.

Emperor Martin I died in 195 a broken man.
He had waited a lifetime to guide the Imperium
towards its manifest destiny only to be soundly
defeated. His son was crowned Martin II the
same year and decided it was time to change
the narrative. In spite of the bloody Pacification
Campaigns and their aftermath, the Imperium
had become more unified. While the Imperial
Navy had been off making war in Antares, the
interior of the Imperium was consolidating and
its economy was improving. Cleon’s dream was
coming true despite there being a few missteps
along the way. It was time to guide the young
empire to its next phase.

Outreach and Growth
Despite the unmitigated disaster that was the Julian
War, the foundations of the Imperium were not shaken.
There were no cries for the Emperor’s head and no
discussion in the Moot about dissolving the Imperium.
In fact, quite the opposite. Trade had begun to
flourish, the piracy threat within Imperial borders was
dissipating and the Imperial Navy started to take shape
as the ubiquitous force that it is today. Capital became
secure and the wealth of the Imperial family, the
nobles of the Moot and megacorporate leaders grew
exponentially. Any feelings of malaise were quickly
swept away by wealth and security.

After Martin II ascended to the Iridium Throne, his first
act was to approve the design for a new palace on
Capital, one which did not reflect the fortress mentality
of Cleon I. While Cleon had to fight to preserve the
fledgling empire, his successors enjoyed the benefits
of leading an Imperium that was clearly on the rise.
Martin II was a well-travelled man and, like his father
and grandfather before him, he had the longevity of
the Lentuli line. He was 142 years old when he was
crowned Emperor and would reign for 49 years. The
new palace was a grand structure with tall spires and
glistening domes that invoked the medieval castles
of Solomani fairy tales. It was supported on grav
pylons 500 meters above the Imperial Park, the most
ambitious structure of its kind to date. The Emperor
moved into the palace with great fanfare on Holiday of
the year 200 as the citizens of the Imperium celebrated
the bicentennial of Cleon’s grand experiment.

Imperial scouts and members of the diplomatic core
had by this time established relations with all five
pocket empires of the Solomani Rim. While they
were not yet ready to join the Imperium, the Arcturus
Federation, Easter Concord, Vegan Polity, Dingir
League and Old Earth Union began to trade amongst
each other, creating a wealthy microcosm of the
Imperium itself. Imperial traders and corporations
began to set up shop in the sector and established
trade routes to the remote region.

With the Solomani situation seemingly resolved, the
Imperium pre-emptively reached out to the Aslan
Hierate, signing the Peace of Dark Nebula in 212.
This treaty brought a temporary end to the Aslan
Border Wars, which had gone on for over 1,000 years,
deep into the Long Night. The treaty might have held
indefinitely if not for later incursions by colonists
from the Old Earth Union. Nevertheless, the treaty
was honored for 90 years, bringing a much-needed
respite to the war-torn region between human and
Aslan space.

The colonies of the Spinward Marches, had grown and
expanded to include more star systems, bumping up
against and, in some cases, pushing out the previous
inhabitants. The growing importance of the region
had become clear and the Emperor was resolved
to improve access to the frontier sectors ‘behind the
Claw’. Transporting the needed materiel across the
Great Rift through the Ishirdu system had become
impractical and it was time for the Imperium to establish
a more easily traversable route. A confrontation with the
Vargr in Vland and Corridor was imminent.

History of the Third Imperium

The Vargr Campaigns
Previous attempts to get to Deneb through Corridor
met with disaster. Scout and colonial missions into the
region were lost, presumably destroyed by the Vargr,
who had been a problem in the region even during the
reign of the Ziru Sirka. They had snapped up many
star systems in coreward Corridor, Vland and Lishun.
The Vargr are nothing if not mercurial and while they
had held the region for millennia, the dominant powers
shifted many times during the Rule of Man and the
Long Night.

Imperial Navy fleets were deployed to the border of
the Vargr Extents by Martin II in 220 without fanfare.
The initial goal was simple: carve a path through the
coreward Corridor sector and secure it. The Imperium
had learned a lot about fighting the Vargr during the
Julian War. They were highly influenced by charismatic
leaders and would quickly give up on a cause or
change sides when a leader was shown to have failed
or when a superior leader took their place. The primary
method of cutting a swath through Corridor was simply
to use naval force but the Imperium also learned to
divide and conquer the disparate Vargr polities that
occupied the region, often pitting them against each
other. When one leader lost face, Imperial forces went
for the jugular before another more apt leader could
take his place.

There were two opposed forces at work in the early
part of the Vargr Campaigns. The first was the bad
memories of the Imperium’s most recent wars. Martin II
desperately wanted to avoid the ignominy suffered by
his grandfather and father for their involvement in the
Pacification Campaigns and Julian War, respectively.
Second was the involvement of the Vilani. When in
possession of superior forces, the Vilani tendency was
to annihilate an opponent, scouring worlds of all life if
necessary. The fleet elements that carried out the Vargr
Campaigns were largely drawn from Vland and Lishun
because of their proximity to Corridor and the majority
of their officers and crews were pureblood Vilani. Martin
was careful to mitigate their destructive tendencies by
adding squadrons from the Core fleets.

The initial thrust of the Vargr Campaigns was to cut a
narrow channel into Corridor along the coreward edge
of the Great Rift. Where the opportunity presented
itself, the fleet would turn slightly more to coreward and
cut off low- to medium-population Vargr factions from
their rimward holdings. The Imperial fleets were aided
by astrography and superior firepower. The Corridor
channel was bordered by the Great Rift to rimward and

the Windhorn Rift to coreward. There was nowhere for
the weaker Vargr forces to run, no safe haven to which
they could retreat and regroup. Fight or flight were their
only options.

Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) had a key role in the
operation as well, assessing the political situation
between the various Vargr states present, making
contact with them and establishing allegiances when
possible. Naval officers who negotiated well and were
seen to be of ‘high charisma’ successfully recruited
many of these small polities and colonies, especially
those that were oppressed by larger Vargr states or
bands of corsairs. These Vargr served as translators
and agents for the Imperial juggernaut as it snaked
its way through the sector. Segregated Vargr worlds
were offered Imperial membership as a boon for their
cooperation under the precedent of the Proclamation
of 17. Many of their leaders eagerly accepted the offers
while others did so only reluctantly. Those who resisted
were ferreted out by the INI and imprisoned, deported
or executed, depending on the circumstances.

By 230, a serviceable – if hazardous – route had been
carved through Corridor, enabling the Imperium to
transport much-needed supplies to the colonies. In
time, the path was broadened and secured until most
of the sector was integrated. The Imperium was keen
to avoid making the mistakes they had made during
the Julian War, which had the effect of slowing things
down. The process was slow but inexorable, taking
one or two star systems at a time and then providing
incentives for Imperial citizens to repopulate vacated
worlds, expanding outward until their borders pushed
up against the larger Vargr polities. Settlements
became colonies and colonies grew to become
independent governments. While the standard
narrative of the era depicts the Imperium blasting their
way through, it was in fact also a time of peaceful
integration with receptive Vargr populations. The Vargr
are a disunified race and are quite willing to cooperate
and join forces if presented with charismatic leaders,
no matter what their species.

Corridor was not the only front. Once the sector
was secure, with many of its worlds sporting system
defence squadrons and planetary navies of their
own by the year 300, Imperial squadrons turned
their attention to Vland and Lishun to clean up Vargr
incursions and extricate belligerent polities that had
gained footholds there. The missions into these sectors
eschewed the diplomatic approach and mostly resorted
to violent conflict, sometimes with devastating results.

Dynastic Crisis
Upon his death in 244, Martin II left the Vargr
Campaigns only partially complete but was assured
of their success. His approach was bearing fruit and
he died confident that the Imperium would extend
into the Domain of Deneb via Corridor in due time.
Unfortunately, Martin did not leave an heir to the throne,
bringing a brief pause to the Lentuli line. The ensuing
dynastic crisis resulted in the selection of the great-
great-great grandson of Cleon II.

There were concerns about his stability before the
selection was finalised but powerful members of
the Moot pushed it through and Cleon III was made
Emperor in 244. It was an unmitigated disaster. The
Emperor exhibited many sociopathic and psychopathic
behaviours, none more severe than his penchant for
murdering those who disagreed with him. Cleon III
shot, stabbed, impaled and threw members of the Moot
off the ledges of the Grand Palace if they were found
to be ‘disagreeable’. It did not take long for the Moot to
realise their error. ‘Cleon the Mad’, as he had become
known, had to be dealt with. Unfortunately, there were
no devices for addressing this unprecedented situation.
Desperate times called for desperate measures.

A reluctant Porfiria – herself the oldest issue of the
grandnephew of Martin II – accepted the offer of the
remaining members of the Moot (the Chancellor himself
had been murdered by Cleon and therefore could not
personally extend the offer) to ascend to the throne
by a new method: the Right of Assassination. Per the
dictates of this new convention, Porfiria killed Cleon by
her own hand. The fact that Porfiria was not a skilled
combatant is largely overlooked by modern historians.

Some claim that Cleon was mortally wounded by a
Moot-sponsored hit team, a combat veteran in service
to one of the high nobles or possibly even Porfiria’s
own bodyguard, after which Porfiria herself came onto
the scene and delivered the coup de grâce. Whatever
the case may be, the Moot approved the action and
she was made Empress Porfiria I in 245.

THE RIGHT OF ASSASSINATION
This unorthodox method of selecting a new
Emperor was devised after the selection of
Cleon III proved to be a bad one. The Moot
approved the ability to select a new Emperor
by Right of Assassination. This controversial
method – which would later cause great strife –
included three key tenets:
•  The assassin must be a member of the
High Nobility.
•  The assassin must kill the Emperor by
her or his own hand in the presence
of witnesses.
•  The Moot must then approve the new
Emperor just as they would under
normal circumstances.

Should the last of the three tenets fail to occur,
the assassin could be tried for murder in a
court of law depending on the circumstances.

History of the Third Imperium

The Porfirian Age
The circumstances of Porfiria’s rise to power were
unusual but she proved to be a dignified and admirable
Empress. The Porfirian Age is often understated in
history texts. She had been reluctant to take charge,
yet did so and ruled for over eight decades. There was
war but it was handled methodically and without the
bravado of the Imperium’s previous military adventures.
The era was, historically speaking, unexciting. Imperial
borders continued to expand, mostly via diplomacy.
The Imperium would – a few centuries later – become
embroiled in a Civil War. Many historians theorize that
without the stability and growth of the Porfirian Age,
the Imperial experiment may have died an early death,
becoming a mere footnote in the history of Humaniti.

Porfiria was a free thinker and employed unorthodox
methods to solve problems. Recognising that the forces
deployed to fight in the Vargr Campaigns were suffering
from combat fatigue, the Empress sent the Imperial
Guard to fight at their side. The Guard had been
expanded to include artillery and cavalry regiments
and proved highly effective in its new role, serving as a
jump division in some of the most dangerous missions
of the war. The deployment of Imperial Guard troops
had a positive effect on morale as well. The navy’s
communications department created holovideos of
their exploits, which were seen by the rank and file
everywhere. Each film included segments celebrating
the effort and contributions of other Imperial military
units as well. The Guard deployment left the Empress
vulnerable to an insurrection but this was a heady time
for the Imperium. The Moot, the peerage and indeed
billions of Imperial citizens were reaping the benefits
of Cleon’s dream. Free trade and the security of the
empire were making people rich beyond their wildest
imagination and giving them a level of stability that
neither they nor their ancestors had seen since before
the Long Night.

The Vargr Campaigns continued successfully during
Porfiria’s reign. With a serviceable route through
Corridor, the Imperium established a strong foothold
in Deneb and the Spinward Marches, pushing out
Zhodani colonies on the spinward-coreward corner of
the sector.

In yet another flourish of the Porfirian Age, the Empress
abolished the branding restrictions that had been
applied to the Imperial Sunburst in 247. Previously,
users of the symbol were forced to depict it only in gold
on black. Imperial agencies were given permission to
alter the colour scheme as they wished so long as the
appearance of the logo itself remained the same.

Porfiria was also a great advocate of the IISS and
gave the scouts the unprecedented and high-profile
task of performing the First Grand Survey of Imperial
space. The scouts were to catalogue the astrography,
planetology and demographics of the entire Third
Imperium. The previous data on the realm harkened
back to the Rule of Man so it was high time for an
update. The publication of the survey would also
serve to unite the Imperium by clearly identifying
its boundaries, people, their unique characters and
cultures, and the stars and planetary bodies within
Imperial borders.

There was also the matter of the Solomani Rim. As the
Imperium continued to expand its borders into Massilia,
Diaspora and the Old Expanses, it became easier to
develop long-distance trade and diplomatic ties with the
Rim. Solomani nobles in the Moot had never given up
on their desire to reunite with their ancestors. Porfiria
sent a mission to confirm haut-Devroe’s Solomani
Hypothesis in 305, nearly two full centuries after its
initial publication. The mission was well received and
the Easter Concord agreed to become an Imperial
client state. The Concord partnered with the Imperium
to develop the Star Lane, a chain of outposts that ran
from the coreward edge of the Solomani Rim to Capital
itself. The region was still infested with pirates during
this era and the fortification of the Star Lane began to
address this problem.

The Imperium had achieved a maximum Tech Level
of 13, making it the most advanced polity in Charted
Space. New technology included the jump-4 drive and
materials and life-support tech that made it possible to
settle worlds with insidious atmospheres, opening up a
bounty of new territory for development.

As the Porfirian Age came to a close, its primary
events occurred far from Capital. The spinward
colonies continued to flourish with Regina growing in
importance and becoming the capital of its subsector.
The powerful but controversial Humboldt family was
put in charge of the Vincennes subsector in Deneb,
whose capital would one day become one of the most
technologically advanced worlds in the Imperium.
Vast mineral wealth was found in the belts of Glisten
and it was discovered that the worlds of the domain
had a higher concentration of Ancients sites than had
been found in other sectors. More than 200 sites were
discovered, including the only functioning Ancients
site ever confirmed on Antiquity in Corridor. The
excitement of new discoveries on the frontier captured
the imaginations of Imperial citizens and fomented the
notion that the Imperium was a vibrant, growing polity
with a bright future.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

Upon her death in 326, Porfiria’s son Anguistus was
crowned Emperor. Anguistus was much loved by the
people. He had been born during the first year of his
mother’s reign and the public had watched him grow
up from infancy. He pledged to continue what his
mother had started. While his reign was brief for a
Lentuli Emperor, he was credited for being a wise ruler;
Anguistus’ steady hand helped to expand Imperial
borders and consolidate power, fully incorporating all
of the Ilelish, Massilia and Zarushagar sectors. Ilelish
had proven to be the most contentious of the three. The
sector had had some of the most well-developed and
resilient pocket empires to make it through the Long
Night and some of its citizens questioned the value of an
empire that merely governs the space between the stars,
leaving worlds to their own fate.

Despite the rising drumbeat of unrest in Ilelish, Anguistus
managed to close out the Vargr Campaigns, having
pushed out the most powerful states and establishing
garrisons on most of the worlds along the coreward
border of Corridor. Similar results were achieved in
Vland and Lishun with the Imperium either integrating or
pacifying the remaining Vargr.

After the death of Anguistus, his second-born son – the
first had died during childhood – was crowned Emperor
Martin III in 365. Like his father before him, Martin’s
rule was a steady one – at least in its early decades

* marked by the consolidation of power, development
of the Imperial bureaucracy, growing economies and
increasing military might. As a young adult, Martin
became keenly aware of the costs of war. He saw his
father struggle daily with the management of the Vargr
Campaigns. It was a long and costly affair but deemed
worth the price. As a student of history, he knew that the
expansionist Aslan posed a similar threat. While the as-
yet-unincorporated Domain of Sol served as a de facto
buffer state between the Imperium and Hierate, Martin
recognized the danger posed by this burgeoning alien
race. After learning more about Aslan customs and the
value they placed on land holds, Martin issued a formal
apology to the clans of the Hierate in 377 for trespassing
upon their lands. He then designated the Archduke of
Ilelish to serve as the Imperial signatory for the landmark
Peace of Ftahalr, signed in 380. This treaty secured a
non-aggression pact between the Aslan and Humaniti
after over 1,000 years of intermittent border wars and
established a 30-parsec buffer zone between the Hierate
and Imperium. By this time, many Aslan worlds had been
integrated into the Imperium, making their residents
Imperial citizens. As a gesture of good will between the
two species, Martin authorized the establishment of an
Aslan regiment in the Imperial Guard.

PLAN LAZARUS
The Peace of Ftahalr established a 30-parsec-
wide gap between the Imperium and Aslan Hierate
but Emperor Martin and his military high command
were still concerned about the expansionist
Aslan. The acquisition of land was a biological
imperative for them and could not be controlled
with treaties. The Peace of Ftahalr put a stop to
their advancement into Solomani and Imperial
space but only a fool believed the agreement
was permanent. The Aslan had already begun
to cross the Great Rift and it did not require a
psychohistorian to see that the Aslan Hierate and
the Imperium would one day clash in the Domain
of Deneb.

The Emperor sent agents to meet with the military
command of the Archduke of Sol to design a plan
of attack against the Aslan should they ever break
the treaty. The array of strategic and diplomatic
moves was called Plan Lazarus. Unfortunately, the
Ilelish Revolt and subsequent events took priority
and Plan Lazarus was scuttled after the death
of Emperor Martin III in 456. No comprehensive
plan to deal with the Aslan threat has ever been
developed to take its place.

With the Grand Survey already under way, in 382 the
Emperor expanded the IISS mission to collect data on
all of the Major Races that bordered the Imperium. The
Scout Service was accumulating massive amounts of
information and it soon became clear that they would
need a dedicated facility to store all of the data, as well
as the samples and artefacts they had collected.

As luck would have it, the scouts made an astounding
discovery in 399. There was an old Vilani research
station on Aadkhien in the Core that contained a virtual
copy of the data contained at the AAB on Vland as
well as a cornucopia of additional data that had never
been synchronised due to the intercession of the Rule
of Man and the Long Night. They also discovered that
Aadkhien was at the nominal center of the Imperium
and virtual center of the galactic plane. As far as the
scouts were concerned, it was destiny. They relocated
the planet’s reclusive and xenophobic Vilani colony
to a reservation world and remade Aadkhien into
History of the Third Imperium

a central repository of information, renaming the
world Reference. For more about Reference, see its
description in the Cadion subsector on page 198.

The timing could not have been better. The Grand
Survey was completed in 420 and over the next few
years, the entirety of its findings was collated and
stored at Reference.

I Was One of the 1,300
We docked our trader at Maaruur Highport on 108-
350, intending to make planetfall two days later. Plans
changed when five Imperial Navy dreadnoughts came
out of jump at the 100-diameter limit.

With 30 tons of freight bound for Khuumiam and 40
tons of speculative cargo booked, we were planning
on a big windfall. Our broker told us we had to come to
the Downport to get it. My crew and I spend most of our
time on the Sylean Main but we like to shake things up
every so often. We’d come to the Maaruur Cluster to
check it out. Maaruur itself was the crown jewel with a
high-quality starport, lots of products to move and eight
billion people living on the planet. Some were Vilani but
most were aliens called Shingans.

The night we got there the Highport got shut down.
We were told to stay in our ship while the navy sorted
things out. Before they blocked our sensors, we
saw three of the dreadnoughts position themselves
in equidistant spots over the mainworld while the
other two went heaven knows where. I tried to calm
my crew down any way I could but they were losing
it. We’d all heard stories about situations like this
but we never thought we’d become involved in one.
Some kind of revolt or a viral outbreak or something.
We figured they were interdicting the planet. I’d
met Shingans before on other worlds and always
thought they seemed fine but maybe they were up to
something. We had no way of knowing.

The Imperial Navy never told us a thing and they
blocked radio transmissions so we couldn’t find out
what was going on. After a few days, we got inspected
by a team in hazmat suits, accompanied by some
Imperial Marines. We overheard that there were 1,300
people on the Highport and no one was being let off the
planet. Obviously, I couldn’t contact my broker for the
freight or cargo but it was looking less and less like that
was going to be a thing anyway. I had the Downport’s
tightbeam coordinates but I thought better of trying
it. You just don’t mess with the navy, especially when
something serious like this was going down.

When they finally let us go, we saw a different world
than the one we came to. It was on fire. From orbit, we
could see that all the major urban areas were glowing
like hot coals and huge dust storms were swirling all
over the planet. Eight billion people dead, wiped out
by orbital bombardment. Now it made sense where
the other two ships went. They went to the belts to get
rocks to throw. The only folks to leave Maaruur were
those of us at the highport who passed quarantine. The
only Credits we made on that trip were from a few mid
passages booked by folks stuck at the highport. We
even took a few Shingans on our jump to Khuumiam.
It didn’t occur to me at the time but the ones we took
were some of the last of their kind. They must have
been devastated. Most just stayed in their staterooms
during jump and we respected their privacy. We gave
them their money back. What else could we do?

The Imperial Road
By the year 400, the trade routes of the Imperium
extended from the frontier sectors of Deneb and the
contested worlds of Antares, through the Imperial Core
and onward to the purported homeland of Humaniti
in the Solomani Rim. While the bulk of trade was
limited to the jump-1 routes in each sector, long-range
trade missions that ran nearly the entire length of the
Imperium were not unheard of. Comparisons to the
Silk Road of ancient Terra were made. The network of
trade routes that connected East Asia with Southern
Europe were likened to those that stretched from Terra
to Capital and onward to Antares, Vland and Regina.

The monumental growth of the Imperium resulted in
the creation of new megacorporations. Lucien Hortalez
founded Hortalez et Cie, a banking and insurance firm
that underwrote large-scale development projects and
colonial enterprises. Hortalez and other companies like
it increased the efficiency of the expansion. Before the
existence of such companies, there was little oversight
for colonial expeditions. Professional underwriters
became a mitigating force, funding projects that had
the best chances for success and denying the rest as
too risky. These corporations became an uncelebrated
engine for Imperial expansion.

Schunamann und Sohn AG (SuSAG) was founded
in 252, primarily to manufacture psionic drugs. The
corporation expanded into many other markets
as well, including pharmaceuticals, medical and
surgical products, industrial chemicals, chemical and
bacteriological weapons and geneered organisms
for industrial and agricultural applications. Over time,
SuSAG acquired an unfavorable reputation due to its

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

involvement with psionic drugs and other controversial
projects but the corporation and others like it produced
many products that improved the lives of Imperial
citizens and made it possible to colonize worlds with
challenging environments.

The efficiency with which the Imperial bureaucracy
managed the domains increased. Individual worlds
were allowed to govern themselves as they saw fit,
resulting in unique cultural and societal flavors.
Cleon’s dream of a massive trade empire, defended by
the most powerful and well-equipped navy in history,
had come to fruition. While all Imperial worlds enjoyed
the benefits of unity, there were those who saw the
Imperium not as the realization of a dream but only
as an evolutionary step in the development of human
civilization. The Imperium felt otherwise; any evolution
that was happening stopped at the Iridium Throne.

THE ILELISH REVOLT
In 418, the government of the Ilelish system, capital of
a sector by the same name, declared its independence
from the Imperium. Ilelish was the homeworld of the
Suerrat human Minor Race. It and many other high-
population worlds in the domain had begun to feel
neglected by the expanding empire, which had focused
most of its resources on defence of the borders,
growth of the frontier and the construction of the Star
Lane. By 420, 12 other high-population worlds across
six subsectors had joined the Ilelish Revolt. The

governments of these worlds were united in the belief
that independence was the best way forward for them.
By design, the Imperium did not interfere in the affairs
of individual worlds provided they did not break Imperial
law. The leaders of the Ilelish Revolt sought to create a
separate state that took a much heavier hand in world
affairs, standardising Law Levels, governance and
access to technology. This was a crime that invoked the
high justice clause, enforced by Imperial military forces.

In exile, the Archduke of Ilelish called Capital for
assistance. The Imperium reinforced the Ilelish
Sector Fleet with elements of the Dagudashaag and
Gushemege fleets and blockaded the worlds involved
in the revolt. Most surrendered with minimal violence
and Ilelish was the last to fall in 435. To prevent future
revolts, the Imperium made an example of Ilelish. They
evacuated the lush equatorial region where most of its
population lived and blasted it into oblivion, reducing a
once vibrant world into a highly populated backwater.
The capital of the domain was moved to Dlan. Nearly
seven centuries later, Ilelish remains an ecologically
and economically devastated world.

The destruction of Ilelish was intended to be an abject
lesson: defy the Imperium at your own peril. Emperor
Martin III recalled members of the Ilelish peerage to
Capital, whereupon he personally revoked many of
their noble patents and demoted the Order of Ilelish in
precedence. Some were tried and convicted of treason
and either executed or shipped off to the prison camp
History of the Third Imperium

on Sher. Notably, he left the archduke in place. Before
sealing the deal, Martin gave a public address in the
Imperial Park, on the grounds between the palace and
Moot Spire:

_The peerage is responsible for the administration
of the domains, sectors, subsectors, worlds and
continents. If they fail to do their jobs, they risk the
integrity of the Imperium itself. Emperor Cleon built
this empire on the foundation of duty and honor.
Without it, we have nothing._

The Ilelish Revolt had been brewing for decades before
it occurred. There were rumblings as early as 399 when
several of the domain’s high-population worlds had
begun negotiating for an autonomous region, similar to
that of the League of Antares. The Emperor knew about
this but did nothing, placing his faith in the peerage to
resolve the issue. The fabric of the Imperium was the
power vested in the archdukes and subordinate nobles
to manage their domains. In most such crises, the
nobility was successful in this capacity. Not so in Ilelish.
Martin saw it as a potential harbinger of things to come
and was forced to make significant changes in the way
the domains were managed. Cleaning house in Ilelish
was just the beginning.

**BAD MOONS RISING**
Martin III was killed in an air/raft accident on the
Imperial reserve world of Crompton in 456. The
Emperor was reportedly taking an evening ride with his
consort just as the planet’s two moons were rising on
the eastern horizon. He died at the age of 167, once
again exhibiting the longevity of the Lentuli line. He
outlived his heir, who would have been crowned Martin
IV, so his grandson ascended to the throne as Martin
V. Unfortunately, the new Emperor did not have the
hearty constitution of his ancestors and died of natural
causes the following year at 100, middle age by Lentuli
standards. Martin’s daughter, Nicholle, was confirmed
by the Moot and crowned the second Empress of the
Imperium in 457.

Empress Nicholle’s reign was brief and
undistinguished. She did oversee the absorption of the
Easter Concord into the Imperium in 426, strengthening
ties with the Solomani Rim and coming ever closer
to integrating Terra. The Star Lane had, by this time,
become a secure route from the Imperial Core to the
Solomani homeworld. Hundreds of parsecs in the
other direction, the Imperium continued to consolidate
its holdings in the Spinward Marches, annexing the
Vilis subsector and making an enemy of the Sword
Worlds, a pocket empire of Terrans who had come to

the region centuries earlier aboard sublight generation
ships. Things were proceeding apace but most events
were the products of historical momentum more than
any sort of directed plan. If recent events were any
indication, sleepwalking through history was not an
advisable approach. However, the Empress showed
little interest in developments that were far from the
Imperial Court on Capital. Pressed by the Chancellor to
appease the burgeoning frontier, the Empress declared
Aosta in Deneb to be an Imperial reserve world in 474,
the first water world to receive the distinction. The
declaration was... underwhelming, not at all what the
Moot was hoping for.

Despite the continued expansion of the Imperium,
the Moot and its Chancellor were frustrated by
the unwillingness of the Empress to address the
Imperium’s most pressing issues. Nicholle’s great-
grandfather had left unfinished business to his heirs.
The Peace of Ftahalr was a singular achievement but
most believed it merely delayed confrontation with the
Aslan; a long-term solution was required. Furthermore,
the Ilelish Revolt had revealed weaknesses in the
bureaucracy that required tending to. Nicholle was,
by most accounts, disinterested in dealing with such
issues. The Moot and a co-conspirator of dubious
lineage decided to take action.

Admiral Eledon Shaster, a distant heir of the Zhunastu
line, was selected from an extensive cast of characters
to become the first non-dynastic Emperor. Admiral
Shaster had enjoyed a distinguished naval career,
which had earned him the undying loyalty of the Core
Sector Fleet. Although he only had tenuous ancestral
lines to the original Zhunastu Dynasty, he had exactly
what the activist cabal from the Moot wanted: ambition
and dubious ethics. Shaster was credited with the
assassination of the Empress and her entire family,
clearing the way for a new Emperor to take her place.
The majority of the Moot cried foul but extortion, death
threats and other skulduggery ensured there would be
just enough votes to confirm the new Emperor. Shaster
was crowned Cleon IV in 475, setting a dangerous
precedent for the Imperium. While the previous use of
the Right of Assassination was arguably justified since
it rid the throne of Cleon the Mad, the assassination of
Nicholle merely for being disinterested in the job or ‘too
weak’ as Shaster himself had said, would come back to
haunt the Imperium.

The reign of Cleon IV was corrupt from the beginning.
Five years after his coronation, Cleon revoked the
patents of dozens of Vilani nobles, many of whom held
positions in the Moot. He then promoted others in their
places, most of whom were of either pure or mixed

Solomani blood. Coinciding with these events were
a number of declarations made by the Emperor that
removed regulations and restrictions on the abilities
of the peerage to tax the Imperial citizens under their
purview. The additional windfall of tax revenue found its
way directly into the accounts of the nobility themselves.
The megacorporations and merchant lines were making
astronomical sums of Credits as the Imperium grew
larger and more secure. The peerage wanted their cut
and they got it at the behest of a pliable Emperor who
served their every whim.

There was no shortage of investigative journalism
exposing this corruption but bribery, murder and control
of key media outlets kept localised scandals from
becoming an Imperium-wide scandal. Meanwhile, Cleon
IV distracted the citizens of the Imperium. The Imperium
manufactured crises when necessary and in other cases
merely took advantage of events that played into their
hands. One such event was the Hidden War.

Emperor Martin III had launched a series of Alien
Missions in 382 whose intention was to survey the
territories of the Major Races. The Vargr Mission
occurred from 486 to 499 and included the region of
space held by the Julian Protectorate. The Julians did
not take kindly to intrusions of their sovereign space
and used terrorism and hired Vargr corsairs to harry
scouts wherever they could. The Imperium responded
by sending Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) agents
to counter the threat. This ‘Hidden War’ was initially
classified by the Imperium but received a great deal of
media attention in the Julian Protectorate, news of which
inevitably found its way back to the Imperium. Emperor
Cleon IV used the Hidden War for propaganda purposes,
leveraging it as a unifying issue in the Imperium.

Despite the exorbitant wealth and relative stability of the
era, the reign of Cleon IV was largely viewed as a blight
upon the history of the throne, one which would end as
abruptly as it began... with an assassination. Jerome,
yet another dubious claimant to the throne, murdered
Cleon in 555 in what was likely his deathbed; had Cleon
IV been allowed to die naturally, his heir would have
ascended to the throne and the non-dynastic era would
have ended. However, Jerome made sure to kill the heir
and everyone else in his family tree who might have had
a claim. Clearly the Moot – or at least an influential cabal
therein – was onto something. By removing dynasties
before they were allowed to happen, they made the

Emperor their puppet. An Emperor beholden to the Moot
ruled at the beck and call of the nobility. What could go
wrong? As it turned out, a great deal.

As the non-dynastic era unfolded, the foundations of the
Third Imperium began to dissolve. The sectors which
suffered the greatest losses of power at court were those
on the frontiers, several of which were key players in
the long-term plans of the empire. The beneficiaries of
the centralization of power were the sector dukes and
Admiralty. Each pursued their own agendas, which were
not always in concert with one another.

The sectors of the Domain of Deneb began to feel
the pinch as did the Solomani Rim. In the Marches,
it became clear that should a crisis arise they were
on their own. This occurred just as tensions with
the neighboring Zhodani Consulate, Vargr Extents
and Sword Worlds began to rise. Conversely, in the
Solomani Rim, the pocket empires began to join the
Imperium at an increasing rate, even as the stability of
the empire began to dissipate.

Shortly after the assassination of Jerome by Jacqueline,
the third of the non-dynastic Emperors, the pieces
began to fall into place in the Solomani Rim. The Dingir
League joined the Imperium in 582 followed closely by
the Arcturus Federation in 583. Empress Jacqueline
appointed the first Archduke of Sol, hastening the
following events. The Vegan Polity joined in 586 and
then finally, the grand prize: the Old Earth Union
and its capital at Terra joined in 588. The event was
accompanied by a scientific expedition to Terra, which
confirmed the findings of the Solomani Hypothesis once
again. Terra was the homeworld of all Humaniti and now
it was a prized world of the Third Imperium.

Terra had long hung over the Imperium like a Sword
of Damocles. As the confirmed homeworld of Humaniti
and one of the most powerful economic forces in
Charted Space, its destiny was undeniable; yet its
integration into the Imperium had been dreaded for
centuries. Terra would immediately pose a political
threat to Capital. Regardless of its distance from
the Imperial Core, the legacy and symbolic power of
Terra could not be denied. The integration of Terra
had to happen, yet it posed a threat to everything the
Imperium stood for, and worse, it occurred just as the
Imperium was wavering from self-inflicted wounds. As
bad as things had gotten, they were about to become
much worse.

History of the Third Imperium

_THE FRONTIER_

_WARS BEGIN_
After decades of sabre rattling, the Zhodani Consulate
and two Vargr states – the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz and
the Gnaithlloellarrgh Gzolakhgha – launched an attack
against the Imperium in the Spinward Marches in 589.
The initial plan of the aggressors, who called themselves
the Outworld Coalition, was for the Vargr to raid the
coreward worlds of the Regina and Aramis subsectors
while the Zhodani conquered Cronor and Jewell. The
Imperium gained an ally in the Darrian Confederation,
which had lost the so-called Entropic Worlds to the
opportunistic Sword Worlds, who joined the war on the
side of the Coalition.

After receiving word of the war, Empress Jacqueline
established the Domain of Deneb, uniting the Spinward
Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach and Reft. However, she
did not appoint an archduke to the new domain, giving
it no central leadership. The creation of the new domain
was intended to be a symbolic move that would carry
a great deal of weight. What the worlds of the domain
really wanted was Imperial military support.

The war lasted for 15 years with many systems changing
hands. The Imperium lost most of the Jewell cluster early
but reacquired their foothold in 603 when fleet elements
commanded by Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell
pushed the Zhodani out of Jewell and Emerald after
intense fighting.

The decisive battles of the war were fought in 604.
Zhodani Grand Admiral Tliaklabtl attempted to strike
a decisive blow in the Battle of Jae Tellona, in which
combined Zhodani and Vargr fleets would purportedly
overwhelm the colonial forces of the Imperium. However,
the Vargr squadrons failed to show up for the battle,
leaving the Zhodani to fight alone and they were
defeated by Admiral Plankwell with reinforcements from
Porozlo. In the Battle of Rhylanor, a young Duchess
Arbellatra Alkhalikoi led undermanned Imperial system
defence forces against the Zhodani. She was made a
captain by Plankwell at the age of 20 as a reward for her
accomplishments. The final battle of the war was fought
at Zivije, where the Gzolakhgha Vargr and Zhodani
made their final stand. They were outmatched by the
combined Imperial fleets that routed them. Admiral
Plankwell declared victory as exhausted forces on both
sides ceased fighting with one another. The two sides in
the conflict paused briefly to regroup and rearm.

All told, the Zhodani made territorial gains in Cronor but
the Imperium acquired several worlds in Jewell. The
failure of the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz Vargr resulted in a
civil war that broke the Vargr state apart. The Darrians
pushed the Sword Worlds out of the Entropic Worlds
with help from the Imperium. An enraged Admiral
Plankwell collected elements of his fleet and made his
way to Capital.

The respite between the First and Second Frontier
Wars was brief. By 609, the Gzolakhgha Empire and
the Ekhlle Ksafi (the most powerful splinter state that
emerged from the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz Civil War) joined
with the Zhodani to prepare for a second war with
the Imperium. This time, the Sword Worlds joined the
Outworld Coalition at the beginning of the war in an
attempt to reacquire all of the worlds they had lost to the
Imperium in Vilis.

The Zhodani launched the first attack of the Second
Frontier War in 615 at Cipango. The war quickly
spread to Jewell and Regina. The Vargr were much
more effective allies in the second war. Again without
support from Capital, newly appointed Grand Admiral
Alkhalikoi executed a holding action with the limited
resources at her disposal. The manufacture of several
new dreadnoughts, which were quickly launched into
action, helped stave off relentless Zhodani attacks.
The Imperium was once again joined by the Darrian
Confederation, who turned back the Zhodani with the
threat of the Star Trigger, a stellar destabilization weapon
that was allegedly in their possession. By the end of
the war, the Zhodani had conquered all of Cronor and
several worlds in Jewell. The Vargr failed to permanently
acquire any new territory but made themselves rich
with plunder and successfully diverted Imperial forces
that would otherwise have fought the Zhodani. The
Sword Worlds were soundly defeated by the Imperium,
which occupied many of their worlds for five years after
the war. Tired of being drawn into these conflicts, 11
worlds in Vilis seceded from the Imperium, becoming
independent. Depleted from two devastating wars, there
was little the Imperial Navy could do about it.

All in all, the Second Frontier War was disastrous for
the Imperium, despite the heroic efforts of its military to
stave off the invasion. In most eras, the public would
have called for the heads of the Sector Admiralty after
taking such a beating but the citizens of the Marches
generally understood that they had been abandoned
by the Imperium. Like her mentor before her, Grand
Admiral Alkhalikoi intended to take their grievance
directly to Capital, hoping to achieve more lasting
results. She left the sector in the capable hands of
Baron Caranda of Regina.

TRAVELLER

The Civil War
At the end of the First Frontier War, a furious Grand
Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell gathered his remaining
forces and made his way to Core. Plankwell intended
to express his indignation in the most dramatic way
possible: by usurping the throne. He arrived at Capital
in 606, purportedly to celebrate the victorious efforts
of the First Frontier War but promptly murdered
Jacqueline and declared himself Emperor Olav I by
Right of Assassination. Olav’s ascendance ended
the era of the non-dynastic Emperors but did little
to quell the instability of their reign. His brief run
as Emperor was cut short when his most trusted
officer assembled disgruntled fleet elements, uniting
them with squadrons of the Core fleet and defeated
Plankwell in battle, declaring himself Ramon I. He was
confirmed by the Moot, beginning the disastrous era of
the Emperors of the Flag.

A succession of Emperors of the Flag ruled the
Imperium for 13 years. Power was acquired by ‘Fleet
Control’, in which a prospective claimant to the throne
assembled portions of the Imperial Navy, came to
Capital, imposed their will upon the current Emperor
by defeating loyalist naval forces and then either
assassinated or killed him or her in battle.

All of this was arguably made possible by the era of
the non-dynastic Emperors who gradually centralised
power around Capital and ignored the burgeoning
Imperial frontiers. The citizens of the Imperium
had come to expect more from their Emperor. The
bureaucracy had been appointed by Cleon I to serve
with honor and duty. The archdukes, dukes and all
of the peerage were to perform as extensions of the
Emperor. The untimely assassination of Empress
Nicholle 131 years prior to the Civil War had started
a chain of events that unravelled the very fabric of
Cleon’s Imperium and untethered the strands of duty
and honor upon which it was built. It was time for the
Imperium to pay the consequences.

EMPERORS OF THE FLAG
From 609 to 622, a series of short-lived Emperors
ruled the Third Imperium. All of them ascended to
the throne by Right of Assassination or Right of Fleet
Control. All were naval officers of flag rank and all
were pure Solomani. Perhaps the darkest hour of the
Civil War was the brief era of the Barracks Emperors,
in which many claimants to the throne arose, none
of whom were confirmed by the Moot and therefore
not worthy of mention. The region around Capital
briefly became an autonomous state but the Imperial
bureaucracy remained in power, preventing the
dissolution of the Imperium.

**Emperor Reign Events**

Olav 606–609 The hero of the First Frontier War arrived at Capital under the pretence of celebrating
the victory and broke the non-dynastic line of Emperors by assassinating Empress
Jacqueline I. Confirmed by the Moot. Olav disbanded the Imperial Guard and Marine
Escort Service.

Ramon I 609 Protégé of Olav who convinced a large portion of the fleet to revolt. Ramon’s forces
appeared to have lost in the Battle of Tricanus but his destruction of Olav’s flagship
turned the tide. Olav was killed during the boarding action. Credited with the invention
of the Right of Fleet Control. Confirmed by the Moot after some deliberation only to be
assassinated by Constantus.

Constantus 609–610 Claimed the throne by Right of Assassination. Not confirmed by the Moot. The IISS
declared neutrality during Constantus’ brief reign.

Nicolai 610–612 Defeated Constantus in the Battle of Rakakaka, killing him in battle and then claiming
the throne by Right of Fleet Control. Not confirmed by the Moot.

George 612–613 Ascended to the throne by Right of Assassination. Not confirmed by the Moot.

The Barracks
Emperors

613–615 A succession of claimants to the throne, too numerous to name, assassinated and slew
one another in battle during this chaotic era. The Sylean Worlds temporarily became an
autonomous state. The Second Frontier War began in the Spinward Marches

Cleon V 615–618 The last of the Barracks Emperors broke up the Sylean autonomous state and was
confirmed Emperor by the Moot in a close vote. The IISS sided with Cleon, revoking its
neutrality clause. Cleon appointed Arbellatra Alkhalikoi Grand Admiral of the Spinward
Marches Sector Fleet.

Joseph 618 Just as the Moot thought that the debacle had come to an end, along came another
pretender to the throne. Joseph defeated Cleon by the Right of Fleet Control in the
Battle of Markatch, killing him in battle. Not confirmed by the Moot.

Donald 618 Hoping to capitalise on the ill will that Joseph had engendered, Donald assembled
a fleet and defeated those of Joseph in the Battle of Arakoine, killing him in battle.
Donald was not confirmed by the Moot and did not survive the year.

Emdiri 618-619 Claimed the throne by Right of Assassination towards the end of 618 and barely made
it into 619 before suffering the same fate. Not confirmed by the Moot.

Catherine 619 Exhausted by the string of pretenders, the Moot nominated Catherine to sit upon
the vacant throne. Allegedly she murdered Emdiri, becoming Empress by Right of
Assassination. Catherine only survived for a few months.

Ramon II 619 The Moot’s puppet, Catherine, was given short shrift. Ramon II assassinated her
and ascended to the throne. A reluctant but exhausted Moot confirmed him, hoping
for peace.

Jacqueline II 619 Defeated Ramon II in the Battle of the Nivzhine Belt, killing him in battle. The Moot
confirmed her as Empress.

Usuti 619–620 Defeated Jacqueline II in the Second Battle of Arakoine, killing her in battle. The Moot
confirmed him as Emperor.

Marava 620 Defeated Usuti in the Third Battle of Arakoine, killing him in battle. Destroyed the
Grand Palace of Martin II during the final assault on Capital. The palace remains
on the grounds of the Imperial Park where it crashed during the conflict. The Moot
confirmed Marava as Empress.

Ivan 620–621 Defeated Marava in the Battle of Sulgami, killing her in battle. The Moot confirmed him
as Emperor.

Martin VI 621 Defeated Ivan in the First Battle of Zhimaway, killing him in battle. The Moot confirmed
him as Emperor.

Gustus 621–622 Proclaimed Emperor by Right of Assassination. Confirmed by the Moot.

TRAVELLER

Saviour of the Empire
Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi is sometimes
referred to as the last of the Emperors of the Flag.
Doing so is a disservice to her legacy.

Like Admiral Plankwell, Arbellatra assembled elements
of her fleet at the conclusion of a Frontier War and
promptly embarked upon an epic journey of nearly 150
parsecs from Rhylanor to Capital. Emperor Gustus
awaited her arrival with the might of the 1st Fleet at
his disposal. Arbellatra defeated the bulk of his forces
at the Second Battle of Zhimaway, the system’s most
prominent gas giant, and then proceeded to Capital
where she assassinated Gustus. Unlike the previous 17
usurpers, Arbellatra did not claim the throne. She asked
the Moot to confirm her not as Empress but as Regent.
She held the throne in escrow until a suitable candidate
could be found. Her actions ended the Civil War and
peace finally returned to the Imperium.

As Regent, Arbellatra made allies in the Moot and
established a power base among the peerage. By
absolving all participants in the war for their actions
during it, she established firm control of the military,
particularly the navy that had been divided into
countless factions by use of the Right of Fleet Control.
In an effort to maintain the hard-fought stability that had
been restored, the Moot granted the Regent sweeping
powers, not unlike those of the Emperor.

Arbellatra promoted the Marquis Caranda, making him
the first Duke of Regina. For their loyal service during
the Civil War, she rewarded the Geonee by creating the
Duchy of Shiwonee and moving its subsector capital
to Shiwonee. Arbellatra’s generosity did not extend
to all domains. In Antares, she revoked the patent
of Archduke Glazdon Deirdin for not supporting the
Regency, installing Admiral Soegz in his place, the
first Vargr to be so honored. Deirdin was executed
for treason. Likewise, in Deneb, Arbellatra revoked the
patents of the Humbolts of Vincennes. The Marquis
Humbolt had perhaps been expecting a promotion
to duke but was sacked for the involvement of his
family in numerous criminal activities. The Humbolts
disappeared from public view, perhaps exiling
themselves somewhere beyond Imperial borders.

In 624, Arbellatra established the Imperial X-Boat
Network, which would hasten communications between
all of the domains and most importantly to Capital itself.
The IISS would manage the system with a network of
way stations. Over time, the function of these bases
would expand from mere maintenance facilities to
full training centres. This move transformed the IISS
bureaucratic structure into its current state, establishing
Communications, Exploration and Survey branches.
The project was expected to take many decades before
it was completely functional and serviced the entirety of
the Imperium.

The advent of the Imperial X-Boat Network was
accompanied by a major event in the history of the
IISS: the establishment of the Suleiman -class scout/
courier, x-boat and x-boat tender as the primary
starships of the service. Previously, the scouts used
a broad array of spacecraft manufactured by myriad
vendors. With the creation of way stations to service its
ships, higher-ups in the IISS bureaucracy realised that
the costs of maintaining so many sets of spare parts
could bankrupt the service. By standardising on the
trio of key starships, the IISS reduced the impact on its
budget immensely.

Arbellatra settled in at Capital, re-established the civility
of the Imperial court and married Duke Sergey Torgyan
Ashran of Cemplas, with whom she had three children:
Zhakirov, Anton and Maryam. The first two of her
children were born during the Regency era.

After seven years of fruitless searching for a viable
heir to the throne, Arbellatra was asked by the Moot
to become Empress. Arbellatra was the first of the
Alkhalikoi Emperors, returning the Imperium to dynastic
rule. The Alkhalikois remain in power in modern times
after nearly 500 years of stability.

In the first year of her reign, Arbellatra established
the Sylean Worlds cultural zone at the request of
the Sylean Concord. The combined leadership of its
worlds reminded the Empress that at the Imperium’s
darkest hour, they allowed their worlds to become an
autonomous state so the empire might survive. They
expressed their desire that their worlds should never
be used in such fashion again and began the process
of demilitarization shortly thereafter. To this day, of all
the Sylean Worlds, only Capital maintains a permanent
military presence.

History of the Third Imperium

A TALE OF TRAMP TRADERS
A curious historical sidenote from the Civil War era was the creation of the Empress Marava -class far
trader. While Marava’s reign was a short one, lasting less than a year, her singular achievement was the
felling of the Grand Palace of Martin II, destroying its gravitic suspensors and bringing the fairy tale-style
castle crashing into the Imperial Park where it remains to this day. For some, this event signified a new
beginning for the Imperium and while there was no reason to believe that Marava’s reign would last any
longer than the previous 13 Emperors of the Flag, there was a great deal of excitement about it on her
homeworld of Kaskii.

A small and struggling starship architecture firm on Kaskii called Bilitig und Dottir commemorated
Marava’s rise to power with the design of the 200-ton jump-2 Empress Marava. The ship featured
distinctly Solomani lines, employing the ‘bomber-nose’ look used on some of their bulk freighters. The
firm boasted that its jump-2 drive would liberate the ship from the jump-1 mains plied by the ubiquitous
Type-A free trader. Never mind that savvy Type-A owners had been fitting their ships with jump-2
drives for centuries; Bilitig brazenly marketed their ship as the first of its kind and boasted that it would
revolutionise the tramp trader business.

The initial run of starships sold out in short order but with the death of the actual Empress Marava in the
Battle of Sulgami, the class faded into obscurity. Bilitig had banked its entire firm on the project and went
bankrupt when a second run failed to materialise the interest of the first. However, with the ascent of
Arbellatra to the role of Regent, the class showed new signs of life. By the time she had taken the throne in
629, the Empress Marava -class had finally found a solid market. Its specifications were made available as
open source and several starship-construction companies began to manufacture it.

A minor controversy occurred some years later when remnants of the ancient Vilani Garu -class far trader
were discovered in the Ley and Glimmerdrift sectors. The clunkier, more utilitarian Garu had a nearly
identical interior form factor and deck plan to the Empress Marava. With the proprietors of the Garu design
lost in the annals of time and the Marava having become an open source starship, there was no legal
conflict to be had. Examples of both classes may now be found in operation throughout Charted Space.

Belle Epoque
The first years of the Alkhalikoi Dynasty were
industrious. A great deal of damage had been done
during the Civil War and things had to be set right.
The Marine Escort Service and Imperial Guard were
reinstated with a marine regiment added to the latter.
The intelligence services received a thorough house
cleaning, removing administrators and agents who did
not exhibit adequate loyalty to the Empress, replacing
them with hand-picked successors.

After the dramatic crash of the palace of Martin II, a
new one would have to be built. Arbellatra approved
a design for a new Grand Palace and construction
began immediately. The project was completed in 633.
The Grand Palace of Arbellatra was a one-kilometer
diameter sphere that floated above the Imperial Park

using gravitic lifters. It looked down upon the grounded
Palace of Martin II and stood 4.5 kilometers from the
Moot Spire, whose peak reached just above that of the
new palace. For a complete description of the palace,
see The Grand Palace of Arbellatra on page 157.

Arbellatra made many sweeping changes intended
to establish the power and security of the post-war
Imperium. Others were intended to be subtle. It had
not been lost on Arbellatra that all 17 Emperors of the
Flag, including herself, were Solomani. To achieve
greater balance, Arbellatra promoted many Vilani
nobles in the peerage. The integration of the Solomani
Rim had been interrupted by the Civil War, so this
was a dangerous time to make such changes but she
deemed them necessary nonetheless.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

The Empress established several new orders of
knighthood, including the Order of Hlyuea for loyal
Aslan citizens and the Order of Gvadakoung for
Vargr. She also founded the Order of the White
Star for esteemed psions. Previously, psionics
had been viewed with an element of scepticism in
the Imperium. This move brought psionics to the
forefront, lending them previously unseen levels of
validity and acceptance.

The Arbellatran Age was mostly one of peace in
which the empire renewed its commitments and
worked hard to restore the faith of its citizens. There
was the usual array of revolts to put down and a few
brushfire wars to attend to but large-scale conflicts
were avoided. The era came to an end in 666 upon
the death of Arbellatra by natural causes and the
subsequent ascendance of her son, Zhakirov.

Distant Thunder
The early years of Emperor Zhakirov’s reign featured
a continuation of his mother’s policies, emphasising
security, economic growth and above all, peace. If
the 20 sectors of the Imperium were the branches
of a tree, withered by the Civil War, those branches
were reinvigorated during the post-war era, given
bright new leaves, solid branches and a healthy
trunk. The central authority of Capital was once again
reinforced by an honor-bound nobility. Dissenting
dukes and archdukes had their patents revoked
and were replaced by those who fully supported the
Emperor and served the greater good of the empire.

Sacrifices had to be made to create peace and
stability. While the empire was composed of trillions
of sophonts, including a multitude of Minor Races, it
was still essentially governed by a Vilani-Solomani
compact. The Rule of Man may have perished some
two millennia earlier but the spectre of Solomani
culture still hung over it like a dark cloud. The
Solomani nobles who dominated the Moot, fairly or
unfairly, were blamed for much of the chaos that
had occurred. Their greed precipitated the non-
dynastic emperors and fomented the Civil War in
which each of the usurpers was of Solomani descent.
Empress Arbellatra and her heir, Zhakirov, devised

a seismic shift to the center by promoting Vilani
nobles. If this was not a sure sign that the Imperium
intended to establish greater balance, Zhakirov
made it abundantly clear when he married Antiama
Shiishuginsa, a Vilani noble from a powerful family.

Publicly, the shift reflected a desire for greater
balance and stability but privately the Emperor knew
that he had a new and burgeoning threat to deal with:
the Solomani Movement. This movement expressed
that it was the destiny of the Solomani people to rule
all of Charted Space. The recent integration of Terra
and subsequent failure to complete the acquisition
of all Solomani territories to rimward made the
Solomani Movement dangerous to the empire.

Zhakirov’s death in 688 should have been followed
by a smooth transition to the next Imperial heir but
the situation was unprecedented: the ascendant
Empress Margaret was only four years old at the
time of her coronation. A Regency Council governed
on her behalf until she was determined to have come
of age. Cynical factions in the Moot – especially
aggrieved Solomani – saw this as an opportunity to
foment yet another dynastic crisis, possibly creating
a second civil war, but cooler heads prevailed and
Margaret was permitted to take the throne.

Under the advice of her Chancellor and key members
of the Moot, Margaret declared the Solomani
Autonomous Region with the Mandate of 704.
This gave the Solomani semi-independence in a
50-parsec radius from Terra. The Mandate placated
the powerful Solomani region and established
much-needed separation between the Rim and
Solomani agitators in the Imperial court, yet set the
stage for problems down the road. The Imperium
had by this time reached a maximum Tech Level of
14, surpassing the abilities of all of its neighbors.
Its navy was the most powerful military force
in Charted Space but its officer corps was still
dominated by Solomani. To prevent the Imperium
from returning to the self-destructive days of the Civil
War, concessions had to be made to the Solomani
Rim. Over time, it became increasingly obvious that
no amount of conciliatory action could satisfy the
adherents of the Solomani Movement.

History of the Third Imperium

_THE SOLOMANI_

_MOVEMENT_
The Imperium awakened a sleeping giant when its
scouts made contact with the disparate pocket empires
of the Solomani Rim. The people of the Arcturus
Federation, Easter Concord, Vegan Polity, Dingir
League and most importantly of all, the Old Earth
Union, could hardly have known how much the far
greater empire to coreward feared and dreaded a future
in which the combined might of the Solomani Rim
would be brought to bear against them as a unifying
force. Shortly after the Imperial scouts made contact,
haut-Devroe published the Solomani Hypothesis,
expressing that not Vland, Shiwonee or any of the other
poseurs were the birthplace of Humaniti. The evidence
overwhelmingly proved beyond doubt that humans
originally came from Terra.

The Solomani Hypothesis was barely noticed when it
was first published. With the integration of the Rim, the
hypothesis became a rallying cry that helped spawn
the Solomani Movement. There was little the Imperium
could do to prevent an eventual day of reckoning. The
best the Emperor could hope for was to delay it and
that is exactly what happened.

In the Solomani Autonomous Region, the core structure
of Imperial rule was dismantled while the Imperium
blithely looked on. In truth, there was little that could
be done. A war-weary populace was loath to get into
another major conflict so soon after the Civil War. The
mixed results of the Pacification Campaigns hung
over the Imperium like a spectre. While they had been
successful by and large, most of the peerage felt that
Artemsus’ crowning achievement was a slap in the face
to Cleon I, who advocated diplomacy, not force of arms,
to incorporate worlds into the empire. Furthermore, the
failure of the Antarean campaign would always haunt
the Imperium. It was difficult to imagine overcoming
a region with the size and power of the Solomani
Sphere when the Imperium had failed to defeat the
considerably smaller Julian Protectorate. However, the
Imperial Navy had grown immensely in the intervening
centuries. Mathematically speaking, the navy could
take on just about any opponent if it set its collective
mind to it but the public simply would not support such
a bold, aggressive move. As so often happened in the
history of Humaniti, it would require a crisis to push the
Imperium over the edge and into conflict.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

AND THE BAND PLAYED ON
Despite the imminent showdown with the Solomani Rim
on the horizon, the Imperium as a whole was perhaps
more stable than it had ever been. The Alkhalikoi
Dynasty proved to be an enduring one.

The Scout Service, now ubiquitous in Imperial space,
was further enhanced by the advent of the Detached
Duty branch. One could muster out of the scouts
but the scouts never truly mustered out of its former
employees. A scout is a scout for life. To enhance
its commitment to the reserves, the IISS developed
a program by which retired personnel could gain
access to a scout/courier of their very own provided
they respond to the summons of the Scout Service
when required. In addition to providing a purpose for
retired Type-S ships, the move made scout veterans
into a de facto source of intelligence. Flitting about in
their loaner starships, they collected data that might
otherwise have been missed by intelligence agencies.

By 718, the Imperial X-boat Network had been
expanded to cover all of Imperial space, ensuring that
information travelled from one end of the Imperium
to the other at jump-4 speed. While the prospect of
governing such a vast expanse of space was and
continues to be a daunting task, the Imperial X-boat
Network ensures that its remote fiefs remain in
communication with Capital.

Speaking of Capital, its grandiosity continued to
grow. The Grand Palace of Arbellatra acquired
several annexes. In 729, Empress Margaret had the
Consortium Trinary built, a trio of smaller spheres that
would appear to ‘orbit’ the Grand Palace. The three
spheres contained museums dedicated to the Ziru
Sirka, Rule of Man and Third Imperium, respectively.
Access to the public was limited but the Trinary was
made available to academics year round.

Tragically, Empress Margaret died in a tunnel collapse
while visiting the Imperial Reserve World of Onon in

736. Margaret’s reign was unremarkable on the whole,
remembered more as an era of stability than for grand
achievements. Her twin brother, Paulo, was confirmed
by the Moot as the new Emperor. Margaret left no heir,
which could have caused a dynastic crisis but Paulo
was so well-suited to the crown that he was an easy
choice for the Moot. He was educated, erudite and
well-prepared for the role despite having suffered the
cruel hand of fate by being born a mere 22 minutes
after his twin sister.

Paulo’s reign was similar to that of Margaret. He
continued to cultivate relationships with the peerage
and kept the peace on Imperial borders, most notably
with the Zhodani Consulate. Other than putting down a
few minor revolts, Paulo did not embroil the Imperium
in conflicts. In 740, he left his mark on Capital, adding
yet another annex to the Grand Palace. Paulo’s Annex
was a pleasure palace, a place where visitors could
indulge in myriad forms of entertainment. Fine dining,
the performing arts, sporting events and countless
other diversions were featured. Beginning in 740 the
annex would serve as the primary site of the Emperor’s
Games, a decennial sporting event.

The greater inclusion of Vilani nobles in the Moot
and promotion of their cultural principles was a key
component in this era of prosperity and stability. If there
was one thing the Vilani were good at, it was running
a bureaucracy. Paulo was a great student of Imperial
history and the parallels of his era and that of the Ziru
Sirka before its fall were not lost upon him. He certainly
did not want to see the growing Third Imperium fall to
the burgeoning threat of the Solomani, just as the Ziru
Sirka had fallen to the Terran Confederation thousands
of years before. The Imperium was not yet ready to
confront the Solomani crisis directly. Instead, he simply
shepherded the empire along its current course.

Emperor Paulo died of natural causes in 767, and his
son, Tomutov, ascended to the throne. Alas, the weight
of the crown was too much for Tomutov, who abdicated
after two years. His sole legacy was the construction of
Tomutov’s Palace, another annex to the Grand Palace.
Tomutov’s Palace was a place of welcome, where
esteemed visitors to Capital could stay when they came
to see the Emperor.

Tomutov’s oldest offspring ascended to the throne
as Paula II in 768, beginning another era of steady
Alkhalikoi rule. Paula was only 16 when she took the
throne but took to the role quickly. Her first test of
leadership would come a mere four years into her reign.

The Psionic Suppressions
In 772, it was discovered that many of the Imperium’s
65 chartered psionic institutes had been infiltrated by
the Zhodani Consulate. For most of Imperial history,
psionics had been looked upon as an oddity of sorts.
While the practice of psionics was never fully embraced
in the Imperium, there had been psionics clubs and
psionicology university programs since the age of
the Sylean Federation. Prior to the formation of the
Third Imperium, there were even worlds governed by
psionic leaders.
History of the Third Imperium

Psions occupied many useful roles throughout the
Imperium, often serving as valuable aides to the
Emperor, members of the Moot and megacorporate
officers. There were even specialized psionic soldiers
in service to the military and intelligence agencies. The
discovery that just a portion of them had been infiltrated
by the Zhodani set loose a wave of hysteria. The
scandals extended to all levels of society and Imperial
citizens began to question whether their leaders at
all levels had been compromised by mind-controlling
psions. The xenophobic fear of the Zhodani was just
one aspect of the crisis. People began to question
the financial, ethical and moral implications of the
use of psionics. Were the markets fair or were they
manipulated by telepaths and clairvoyants? Was it right
for a powerful noble to use a psion to read the minds
of his political adversaries or to manipulate public
sentiment in his favor? Were the nobility the puppets
of psions? The practice of psionics, which had become
an accepted, if somewhat obscure, part of Imperial
society was now being questioned at all levels.

The scandals went on for decades, coming to a head
in 792 when the pro-Zhodani government of Attica in
the Spinward Marches came under fire. Members of
the public asserted that Zhodani-trained psions had
manipulated the outcome of what were supposedly free
elections. Attica became a lightning rod for growing
anti-psionic sentiments and quickly descended into
chaos as protests against the government became
violent. Elected officials invited Zhodani peace-keeping
troops to restore order and an Imperial Navy squadron
blockaded the world in response to the Zhodani
incursion. The government fell before things got further
out of control and both the Zhodani and Imperium
withdrew. As news of these events swept across the
Imperium, anti-psionic fervour grew.

In 800, Empress Paula II signed the first of 65
suppression orders for all psionic institutes operating
within Imperial space. All of the institutes were
ordered to cease operations and training programs
immediately. The hysteria carried over the border into
the Solomani Autonomous Region where a similar anti-
psionic pogrom took place. By 826, all of the institutes
had their charters revoked and practicing psions were
forced underground.

While the Psionic Suppressions garnered massive
public support, not everyone was quite so sanguine
about the whole affair. The Imperial megacorporation
SuSAG had a highly profitable psionic drug business
and was badly affected by the suppressions.
Sympathetic members of the peerage – especially
those who held SuSAG stock – pleaded for exemptions

that would save the company from suffering more
damage to its finances and public image. There was
also the matter of psionically sensitive alien races.
There were several Minor Races within Imperial
borders whose rights were oppressed as a direct result
of their use of psionics. In addition, the Droyne had just
been declared a Major Race in 790 after a consortium
of archaeologists, historians and xenobiologists
determined that their scattered populations were a
single species. The fact that Droyne civilization was
based on the use of psionics did not play in their
favor. The IISS promptly interdicted the worlds of
Andor and Candory in the Five Sisters subsector of
the Spinward Marches, which were considered to be
possible homeworlds of the Droyne. The Imperial Navy
sent a follow-up mission to secure the subsector.

The Psionic Suppressions were highly successful.
Those who still practiced psionics had to do so
in private, sliding into a dangerous and hostile
underworld. The Suppressions were the signature
achievement of Paula II but some wondered whether
the Imperium had gone too far. The public had been
gripped by mass hysteria, so easily condemning an
element of society that had long been thought benign.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

CONSPIRACY THEORIES
At the conclusion of the Psionic Suppressions,
there were numerous conspiracy theories about
who the ‘real’ culprits were. Many theorized that
the Zhodani were an all-too-convenient bad guy
and that their base of power was far too remote to
have infiltrated the Imperium so completely. Some
of the more popular conspiracy theories included
the following:
•  The Imperium got tricked into getting rid of
their psionic institutes by SolSec.
•  The Psionic Suppressions were a
Hiver manipulation.
•  The Zhodani were indeed the culprits,
but the primary bad actors were from a
Consulate client state in The Beyond sector.
•  None of the institutes were actually closed. A
psionic manipulation prevented the closures
from happening. They were moved, though,
to hide them from public view.

None of these were true, of course, but the last one
came the closest. Two psionic institutes remained
open after the Psionic Suppressions ended. They
were on Regina and Terra, both kept open by the
Imperial Department of Defence. The institute on
Regina was eventually moved to Wypoc in Lanth,
but the one on Terra is still there.

Of all the theories that came about, the one that
gained the most traction came nearly two centuries
after the fact. In his book, Almost Disaster , Imperial
Historian Albert Croale posited that the Psionic
Suppressions were a psychohistorical manipulation
designed to eliminate the growing power of
the psionic institutes. In the text, he surmised
that they worked too well, making it impossible
for the Imperium to continue using psionics in
any capacity. Croale also said that a straight
examination of the psychohistorical mathematics
indicated that the Third Frontier War, which did not
occur until 979, should have actually happened in
the late 700s, but that the Psionic Suppressions
effectively delayed the war for 200 years.

PROJECT LONGBOW
For reasons that were mysterious at the time,
the Empress initiated a covert project in 830
called Project Longbow or more accurately,
LongBOW (Long Baseline Observation
Window). The goal of the project was to
create an immense radar telescope, 46 billion
kilometers in diameter, with its collector plane at
the Lishun Depot. The purpose of the elaborate
device was to view the galactic core where
the Zhodani had been sending expeditions for
centuries. Rumor had it that deep Imperial
scouting missions had discovered something
wrong far beyond the Zhodani Consulate and
Vargr Extents borders. While any data received
would be centuries old, it would give the
Imperium time to prepare for what, if anything,
might come their way. The project was not
completed until 940.

Prelude to War
Empress Paula II died of natural causes in 836,
leaving the throne to her third child, who was crowned
Tomutova II. Paula had held the Imperium together
through a crisis and it was now time for her daughter
to see it through yet another challenging phase of
history. Tomutova’s reign was almost deliberately
bland with its only notable event being the creation of
the Imperial Academy of Science and Medicine in the
Core in 845. A seemingly innocuous development, the
creation of the IASM is now greatly credited for the
advancement of technology that gave the Imperium
the upper hand in its upcoming conflict with the
Solomani Autonomous Region.

Tomutova, like many Empresses and Emperors before
her, was an avid adherent of psychohistory. She was
confident that the hand she played would enable the
Imperium to win its eventual conflict with the Solomani.
She also knew that it would occur long after her death
but in Tomutova’s mind the outcome was certain. It was
satisfying enough to know that she played her part,
preparing and arming for the conflict to come despite
having to endure the lashes of public opinion as one
system after another fell to the Solomani.
History of the Third Imperium

Tomutova died in 908, passing the torch to her oldest
child, who was crowned Margaret II. The Alkhalikois
continued to play the long game and a succession of
wise rulers paved the way towards a psychohistory-
guaranteed victory over the Solomani. This was a game
the Imperium had been preparing for since Artemsus
wisely resisted the temptation to integrate Terra in
the early 200s. Every psychohistorical prediction that
included the too-early incorporation of Terra had set
off alarm bells and changed the maths for the entire
Imperial project. Like Napoleon escaping from Elba,
Terra was an old conqueror that would have to be put in
its place before peace could finally be had.

Empress Margaret patiently watched as the
upstart Solomani Confederation – which remained
unrecognized by the Imperium – continued to spread
the Solomani Movement among its worlds and
threatened to spill over the border into Imperial space.
By 920, she began to receive appeals for protection
by worlds that had remained loyal to the Imperium. In
response, she made several demands of the Solomani

* taking great care to only indirectly address the
Solomani Party Secretariat and its Secretary-General
* ratcheting up the tension. The Imperium, she said,
would not be intimidated or cowed from protecting
Imperial citizens. She dispatched naval squadrons
to secure worlds along the borders of the Solomani
Autonomous Region. This stoked the fury of the
Solomani Confederation but there was little that they
could do at this point.

By 938, skirmishes between Imperial and Solomani
naval squadrons had begun to flare up in the Daibei,
Diaspora and Old Expanses sectors. The Solomani
Movement had become fractious and the Imperium
sowed division between factions where it could. The
success of Imperial forces garnered more defections
to the Imperial side and, in a few cases, bold members
of the peerage returned to administer worlds that had
been previously lost. Fearing the advancement of
the Solomani Movement might be halted by Imperial
incursions, the Confederation issued a formal complaint
to the Empress that she was violating the tenets of the
Mandate of 704. After months of silence, the Empress
responded by revoking the Mandate and ordering the
immediate reintegration of the Solomani Autonomous
Region into the Imperium in late 940. The drums of war
began to beat ever louder.

Like her mother before her, Margaret had trained her
heir since birth to prepare for this moment. Margaret
had grown old and infirm and suspected that Tomolin
would be the Empress whose role it would be to pacify

the Solomani. Alas, Tomolin died in 944 after exposure
to an alien pathogen. Margaret feared that this single
event might derail centuries of planning. Tomolin’s son
Styryx, then an officer in the Imperial Marines, was
headstrong and had many connections with Solomani
factions in the military. She was leery about whether
her grandson could be depended upon to properly
execute the plan but psychohistoric predictions rarely
depend upon a single individual, even if that person is
the Emperor. Margaret died in 945, secure in her belief
that the Imperium would prevail despite her concerns.

Emperor Styryx inherited an Imperium primed for war.
Along the Imperial-Solomani border, worlds changed
hands between the two sides with a net gain going to
the Imperium. Meanwhile, in the Spinward Marches,
commerce raiding along the coreward border by
Zhodani and Vargr starships had reached epidemic
levels. One would think that the Emperor would have
heeded the lessons of the past by paying closer
attention to events in the Marches but Styryx was
obsessed with the Solomani crisis.

Styryx and his wife were quick to produce an heir,
Gavin, born in 946, just one year after Styryx’s
ascension to the throne. Styryx was young, healthy and
hale after his brief career in the marines and expected
to have a long life but now was not the time for the
Imperium to suffer a dynastic crisis should anything
happen to him.

He fostered the growth of the IASM, extending it to 31
campuses throughout Imperial space. The Imperium
was driving hard toward a heretofore unseen Tech
Level 15 with early prototypes of weapons, electronics
and starships already in circulation.

As tensions continued to rise, Styryx stoked the flames
by appointing a naval commission in 970 to ‘manage’
the Solomani Autonomous Region, a sure-fire sign that
an invasion was being planned. He channelled the
majority of the Imperial military budget to the navy at
the expense of the other services, creating a stir in the
joint command structure. Senior officers of the army
and marines questioned how they were supposed to
secure Solomani worlds in the upcoming war without
proper funding. Styryx also poked the Solomani
beehive by making post-war plans for the region. In
975, a well-appointed task force from the diplomatic
corps laid the groundwork for a Vegan Autonomous
District. Up to this point, the Solomani had been able
to focus on the coreward front. By offering pre-emptive
concessions to the Vegans, the Emperor had the
Solomani looking over their shoulders as well.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

Interlude: Third Frontier War
With the Imperium almost completely focused on
the Solomani front, yet another Outworld Coalition,
led by the Zhodani Consulate, launched a surprise
attack in the Spinward Marches in 979. The Coalition
fleets concentrated their initial attacks on the Efate,
Boughene and Pixie systems in an attempt to cut off
Jewell and Querion. The Vargr aided in the attacks
but focused on commerce raiding to keep Imperial
auxiliary forces busy. Deep strikes by the Zhodani
established a narrow corridor through Vilis and
Lanth, preventing the easy transit of Imperial forces
through the region. This would normally have been
the province of the Sword Worlds who – suffering
through a constitutional crisis – sat this war out.

Just as it had in previous Frontier Wars, the Imperium
found itself caught off balance and inadequately
prepared. In 980, the Coalition established a foothold
on Jae Tellona and Porozlo fell to their forces after a
major invasion. Porozlo would serve as a marshalling
point for a relentless assault on Rhylanor that lasted
the duration of the war.

The attacks and raids by the Coalition reached their
apex in 981, allowing the Zhodani to make territorial
gains in Jewell and Querion. The war was a disaster
for the Imperium. Coalition forces were forced to
withdraw from the battle for Rhylanor after the
arrival of Imperial reinforcements from the Deneb
Sector Fleet and the 194th Fleet out of Sabine but
by then the damage was done. At the end of the
war, the Imperium ceded systems in both Jewell
and Querion, and was forced to demilitarise portions
of Vilis under the terms of the Armistice. Quar was
made an independent world though its Imperial
Navy base remained intact. Likewise, the research
station at Retinae was retained. Arden was spun
off into an independent world that then reached out
to neighboring worlds to initiate the creation of a
neutral federation, eventually becoming a buffer state
between the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate.

Imperial forces had taken heavy casualties, far more
than in any of the previous Frontier Wars. In one of
the more egregious incidents of the war, the entire
910 th Imperial Marine Regiment was lost in action.
It was scandalous that for the third time in Imperial
history, the Spinward Marches had been left to its
own devices after being brazenly attacked by the
Zhodani and their allies. In 989, the military and
its supporters in the Moot had had enough. With

the support of the military joint command structure,
Imperial Guard General Nicolai Dienne staged a
palace coup to overthrow Styryx. Only the Scout
Guard remained loyal to the Emperor but they were
quickly defeated by the Aslan Guard who took point
during the assault. Styryx, who was found hiding in a
fresher, surrendered and consented to abdicate the
throne in favor of his son, Gavin.

Gavin’s first major act as Emperor was to
commission the Scout Service to begin its Second
Survey of Imperial space in 990. The maps and
demographic data collected during the First Survey
had become obsolete. He instructed the scouts
to save the Solomani sectors for last since its
borders, he confidently assured them, would soon
be changing. The event was commemorated with the
introduction of a new starship class: the Donosev -
class survey ship, named for Villemina Donosev, the
Master Chief Surveyor who was famous for having
published the First Survey in 420. Subsequent
starships in the class would be named for other
famous scouts.

One of Gavin’s final pre-war acts was to disband the
Solomani Regiment of the Imperial Guard, vowing to
reinstate it after the crisis in the Rim was addressed.

Brother vs. Brother
Leule left Exage on a liner bound for Asmera at the
crack of dawn. He spent all of his scholarship money
on a mid passage. Mother and Father refused to see
him off but I went. I didn’t want my last memory of him
to be the angry shouting match at the dinner table
the night before. When I begged him to reconsider,
he just spouted more of that Solomani Movement
stuff. About how being of Solomani blood makes you
special and how you have a unique destiny. The last
straw for him was when Mr. Dimaakhuna assigned
him to lathing duty at the plant. Leule said he couldn’t
stand another day of working for that Vilani... well, I
don’t want to repeat the next word. It’s impolite and
besides, I always thought Mr. Dimaakhuna was a fair
and reasonable boss.

From Asmera, he was supposed to catch a transport
to Burlta where Solomani forces had recently taken
over. After Emperor Styryx abdicated, the Imperial
Navy pulled out and the Solomani moved in. Leule
said he would pledge himself to the Movement there,
hoping to join one of the more extreme factions. Our
family had roots in the Old Expanses dating back
History of the Third Imperium

to the Rule of Man. I tried to convince Leule that
there was no way he could know if we were really
‘genetically pure’ Solomani or not. Our homeworld
was a place where Vilani and Solomani had mixed for
thousands of years. The tests were inconclusive but
he said he could feel it in his blood that he was ‘pure’.

Military service is mandatory on Exage and I got
conscripted into the army in 989, right before the
Rim War. I was assigned to mobile infantry. I was
one of the ‘boots on the ground’ as they say. The
Imperial Navy comes in, beats up enemy squadrons,
the marines hit the ground first and then we come
in on transports to secure and hold the place down.
I fought in the Battle of Martham Prime in the first
year of the war. Things didn’t go well early on and
we got pushed back. The thought of retreating to
my homeworld and defending it against Solomani
invaders terrified me. The idea that Mother, Father
and our younger sister would be endangered kept
me up at night.

Eventually things turned around and we started
winning. I was a sergeant in 998 when we had made
it all the way to Desel. By then, my little sister was
a midshipman in the Imperial Navy. At the time, I
wondered if my sister and I ever fought in the same
star system but after the war, we checked and
we were never closer than 10 parsecs from each
other. As for Leule, I never saw him again. I heard
that he fought in the Battle of Gresham, where
I was stationed for a while, but even although I
tried, I couldn’t find him. I will always wonder what
happened to him.

The Solomani Rim War
Distraction and indecision followed the Imperial
defeat in the Third Frontier War. After the coup,
abdication of Styryx and quick ascension of Gavin,
the Imperial fleets were temporarily ordered to stand
down and await further instructions. News takes time
to travel across the broad expanse of the Imperium
but once couriers had made it to the front, the
subsequent pause allowed the Solomani to retaliate
and regain most of the worlds they had recently lost.
The Imperium declared that this would not stand and
declared war on the Solomani Confederation in 990.

In the early battles of the war, things went poorly
for the Imperium. The massed Solomani fleets and
ground forces repelled the Imperial advance and
actually ended up conquering several worlds that
had never previously been a part of the Solomani
Confederation. After three years of war the Imperium
had suffered a net loss of worlds. Emboldened by
their success, the Solomani attempted to regain
lost territory in the Old Expanses only to be sharply
rebuffed, especially on worlds with large Vilani
populations. Now firmly in the Imperial camp, the
Old Expanses Sector Fleet delivered a devastating
blow to the Solomani, inflicting heavy losses that
prevented them from going on the offensive for
almost the entirety of the war.

The two sides were stalemated for the next five years,
neither gaining significant ground on the other. The
Solomani had become obsessed with the defence
of every single world along the border, precariously
stretching their forces in the process. Meanwhile, the
Imperial Navy was in a period of rapid technological
advancement, moving to TL15 and improving its fleets
to a jump-4 standard. By 998, the Imperium was
prepared to prosecute the war with great alacrity.

Grand Admiral Baroness Arielle Adair massed the
Imperial fleets and proceeded into the Solomani
Confederation in two distinct columns, conquering
hundreds of worlds and carving a crescent of star
systems within the Solomani sphere. By 1001, the
worlds of the former Vegan Polity had been liberated.
Having long been oppressed by the Solomani,
the Vegans made natural allies for the Imperium.
They welcomed their liberators and invited them
to establish permanent bases on their worlds from
which they could continue their long march into
Solomani space.

Admiral Ivan Wolfe took charge of the Solomani Grand
Fleet and prepared for a last-ditch effort to preserve
the heart of the Confederation. ‘Grand’ may have
been a bit of a misnomer. After four years of retreat,
what was left was a ragtag assemblage of capital
ships bolstered by replacements from the rimward
shipyards. The Solomani had been hard-pressed to
keep up their fleets under persistent assault from
the larger, more advanced Imperial fleets. Jump-4
capability enabled Imperial squadrons to leapfrog the
front lines to decimate Solomani reinforcement fleets
and auxiliaries before returning to the front.

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

Despite the attrition the Solomani fleets had
suffered, Wolfe managed to inflict major damage
on the Imperial 17th Fleet at Agidda before moving
on to attempt a similar attack on the 1st Fleet in the
Vegan District. However, the reconstituted 17th Fleet
regrouped and proceeded to Dingir where it delivered
decisive blows on Wolfe’s rear guard, cutting off his
fleet’s supply lines and essentially destroying its
ability to function. Wolfe was forced to withdraw and
was harried by the Imperial 1st Fleet during his retreat
to Aldebaran.

TEST OF LOYALTY
Pureblood and mixed-heritage Solomani occupied many stations in the Imperium. Prior to the Alkhalikoi
Dynasty, the Solomani dominated the Moot and composed most of the Imperial Navy High Command.
There were some defections to the Solomani Confederation but the vast majority remained loyal to the
Imperium. By the time of the Solomani Rim War, the Imperium was nearly 1,000 years old and it had been
two and a half millennia since the fall of the Rule of Man. While vague notions of loyalty to Mother Terra
existed, new and more lasting loyalties to the Third Imperium had taken their place for most humans of
Solomani descent.

Many found the Solomani Movement to be distasteful. Adherents of the movement declared that it was
not just humans but only Solomani humans whose destiny it was to rule the stars. The Imperium had
long moved on from such notions. In the Declaration of 17, Emperor Cleon I had declared that Imperial
citizenship was extended to all sophonts. Furthermore, the Imperium had already been a hybrid state of
Solomani, Vilani and, of course, Syleans even before Cleon’s declaration. The Imperium had come to
include Aslan, Vargr and dozens of Minor Races among its citizenry as well. Aslan served in the Imperial
Guard. A Vargr had been appointed Archduke of Antares. The notion of Solomani supremacy seemed
barbaric and outdated to most Imperial citizens no matter their heritage.

By the late 900s, the Imperium had a great deal of momentum. It had been centuries since it went through
the crucible of the Civil War. The stable Alkhalikoi Dynasty – whose matriarch Arbellatra was herself
Solomani in origin – had established over three centuries of stable rule. While many Solomani had balked
at the greater inclusion of Vilani nobles in the Moot, the origins and power structure of the Third Imperium
were still very much rooted in Solomani traditions and culture. To many of Solomani origin, the Imperium
was thought of as the far-more-effective successor state to the Rule of Man.

One of the more understated subtexts of the Imperial narrative was its advancement of technology. Before
the Rim War, the Imperium was on the fast track to TL15, two full levels over that of the front-line Solomani.
Coupled with the growing wealth of its worlds and its vast trade routes, it was difficult to argue with the pre-
eminence of Imperial power. It was hard to recruit defectors from a side whose progress and growth was so
clear for all to see. There may have been Solomani sympathisers among the ranks but there were simply
too many reasons to remain loyal to the Third Imperium for most of them to switch sides.

Imperial High Command rallied its forces for the
final assault on Terra. With 14 squadrons and five
army corps, the Imperium engaged in an assault
that lasted nearly six months. Things became so
desperate that the Imperium considered using
nuclear weapons late in the battle but cooler heads
prevailed. By the end of the battle, the Imperium
had landed over two million troops on the surface of
Terra. Late in 1102, the Solomani surrendered the
world and an armistice was signed. While no formal
peace agreement was ever signed, the Imperium
managed to conquer and occupy approximately
25 percent of the Solomani Autonomous Region

History of the Third Imperium

where they remain to the current day. The defeated
Solomani Confederation relocated its capital to Home
in Aldebaran. Admiral Wolfe stationed his fleet there
and was elected Secretary-General.

The Classic Era
With the return of peace to the Imperium, Emperor
Gavin restored the Order of Sol (after first degrading
it in precedence) and appointed Admiral Adair as the
new Archduchess of Sol in 1003. The archduchess at
first administered the affairs of the domain from Muan
Gwi, elevating the standing of the Vegans to new
heights and then eventually moved her offices to the
sector capital at Dingir. The manor of the Secretary-
General on Terra was converted into a center for
diplomacy, dedicated to finding peaceful solutions to
all of the issues that the Imperials and Solomani had
with one another. Adair got started with the long and
arduous task of re-establishing the peerage in the
Domain of Sol and extricating Solomani Movement
cells from the hundreds of worlds that were now under
the Imperial aegis.

Adair formed the Vegan Autonomous District in
1004, cementing the loyalty of a key Solomani Rim
constituent and establishing a firm base of power in the
center of the sector. In 1005, the archduchess created
the Order of Muan Gwi, which was used to recruit
honorable Vegans to the ranks of the nobility.

Adair and Wolfe, once adversaries on the battlefield,
now began a long, cold stare down across the border
between the two polities. The Solomani established a
new reserve, the Home Guard, in 1005 to serve as the
front line of defence for the depleted Confederation.
Solar Shipping, the Solomani megacorporation,
cancelled all lines in the occupied zone. At first there
was very little trans-border activity between the two
polities but it proved impossible to prevent all travel.
Separated families had to be reunited, certain types
of property had to be returned and basic diplomatic
communication was restored.

The battle lines may have been drawn but the two sides
had little interest in renewing the conflict. The Solomani
had scant hope of removing an entrenched and powerful
Imperium. They would have to be satisfied that their
Confederation remained largely intact even if they had
lost Terra and other key worlds. The vast Imperium had
other fish to fry. It ready time to finally give the frontier
its due. The Spinward Marches was the vanguard of
Imperial expansion and after three Frontier Wars, it was
high time that the region received some attention.

A fortuitous development of the Gavinian Age was
the advent of the Authentic Movement. The principles
of the movement were developed in 988 by Dr.
Johann Kramm at a university on Shudusham, only
four parsecs from Capital. This movement posited
that the human spirit was diminished in high-
technology societies but that it could be replenished
by celebrating one or more of the myriad cultures
of Charted Space, both current or historical. People
were encouraged to select a culture, study it with
great detail and express themselves through its lens.
Wearing the unique dress of the culture, learning its
language, reading its literature and serving as a sort
of volunteer ombudsman for the culture were deemed
to be activities that would renew the human spirit. The
Authentic Movement became a sensation in the Core
and began to spread to neighboring sectors as well.

The Authentic Movement reached the Solomani Rim
by 1010 and received a frosty welcome by occupying
Imperial forces and the renascent peerage. There
were concerns that it might foment rebellion among
Solomani citizens who had just come to terms with the
occupation. As it turned out, the effect was quite the
opposite. Many of the people of the Rim acquired a
newfound tolerance and respect for other cultures by
participating in the movement. By 1050, the movement
had acquired as much popularity in the Rim as
anywhere else in Imperial space. While many Solomani
people selected Terran, Rule of Man and Old Earth
Union cultures to emulate, a significant percentage
of the population chose cultures well outside those
boundaries. Some even chose Vilani cultures. The
Authentic Movement helped to pacify the Solomani
Rim and eased the integration of the occupied worlds
into the Imperium.

Upon Gavin’s death in 1031, the throne was passed
to his oldest issue who was crowned Paulo III.
Paulo inherited a stable Imperium and dedicated
his reign to the maintenance of peace. The Meson
Rebellion of 1032 on Khikaba took 12 years to put
down by depleted naval forces but the outcome was
never in doubt and the sentiments expressed by the
rebels were kept from spreading to neighboring
star systems. By 1045, Imperial intelligence agents
had ferreted out the last remnants of the Phoenix
Project, a Solomani resistance movement on Terra.
The Imperial occupation force ingratiated itself with
the locals by participating in relief, preservation and
reconstruction programs. The occupiers sought to
integrate themselves with Terran culture, becoming
Terrans themselves as best they could. By 1050, all
remaining fringe resistance movements had been

History of the Third Imperium

TRAVELLER

brought to the negotiating table and pacified. This event
was celebrated by the reestablishment of the Solomani
Guard Regiment on Capital. Paulo wanted his time as
Emperor to be remembered as another glorious period
of peace and economic growth. Any problems that
came up were handled as efficiently as possible and
without fanfare.

Paulo’s wife Elbet gave birth to their first child,
Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi, in 1049. At the age of 58,
Paulo was old for a first-time parent but he was far
from a doting one. Strephon was the heir that the
Imperium demanded but he meant little else to his
father. Strephon’s sister, Lydia, was born three years
later in 1052 and was equally neglected. Unfortunately,
Empress Elbet died under mysterious circumstances
in 1053, leaving her two toddlers motherless. Paulo’s
brother, James, was implicated in Elbet’s death but
committed suicide within the year, before he could be
properly tried for his involvement. With their mother
dead and their father indisposed with the burdens of
rulership, Strephon and Lydia did not even have each
other to rely on, as they lived very separate lives and
were only brought together when Imperial events
required it. The two were raised more by their tutors
than any member of the Imperial family.

One of the final acts of Paulo’s reign was the
completion of the Second Grand Survey in 1065.
The 75-year project was completed in the Reference
system when data from the survey was downloaded
to newly installed TL15 computer substrates on the
planet. The transportation of all new relics and artefacts
to the Reference archives was completed by 1068.
Paulo basked in the glory of his achievements, having
stewarded the Imperium through difficult post-war
years. He died a contented man in 1071.

Strephon Ascendant
Unlike so many of his predecessors in the Alkhalikoi
line, Strephon was ill-prepared for the throne. Serving
as a midshipman in the Imperial Navy, Strephon was
called home when his father had been reported ill;
he arrived on Capital three days after his father’s
death. Only 21 years old at the time of his coronation,
Strephon had a lot of catching up to do. He had hoped
to have an illustrious naval career before ascending
to the throne but fate dictated otherwise. He spent his
early years as Emperor learning what he would need
to know to rule wisely. Unlike many of his ancestors,
Strephon had very little tutelage from his predecessor.

Hoping to produce an heir more promptly than
his father had, Strephon married Iolanthe
Guuilbataashullibaa in 1079. Iolanthe was the daughter
of the senior duke of Gushemege and reaffirmed the
commitment of the Alkhalikoi line to incorporate Vilani
blood into its heritage. Times had changed. When
Zhakirov married Antiama exactly 400 years earlier, the
powerful Solomani bloc in the Moot were up in arms.
The Solomani Rim War and subsequent Authentic
Movement had changed the Imperial mindset. At long
last the Imperium had come to terms with its complex
historical legacy.

Better educated, and by many accounts more intelligent
than her husband, Iolanthe became a close partner
and valuable counsel. Strephon was lucky to have her.
His reign was about to face its first major challenge. An
incident at the Quar system of the Spinward Marches
in 1082 sparked the Fourth Frontier War, resulting
in numerous naval battles in Jewell and Cronor. Its
final conflict was the Battle of Two Suns, fought in
the depths of space between the Yres and Menorb
systems. Losses to both sides were so devastating
that both Imperium and Zhodani Consulate forces sued
for peace. The fighting lasted only 18 months before
an armistice was signed in 1084, causing the war to
be nicknamed the ‘False War’. By the time word had
arrived at Capital, the fighting was essentially over.
Nevertheless, clever messaging was devised to make
Strephon look like a highly capable commander-in-
chief. As had so often been the case with the Frontier
Wars, a few systems changed hands and things
returned to the status quo.

A few short years after the war, the Emperor and
Empress produced an heir to the throne. Ciencia
Iphegenia, Grand Princess of the Imperium, was born
in 1088, extending the Alkhalikoi Line.

1105
There are pregnant moments in history that,
unbeknownst to those living in them, are on the verge
of unleashing a torrent of changes and events that
will reshape the very fabric of society, redefining and
rearranging things so drastically that they became
virtually unrecognizable thereafter. The year 1105 is just
such a moment. The Imperium is about to experience a
number of events that will forever change it.

The tension between the Imperium, the Zhodani and
their Outworld Coalition allies has shown no signs
of abating. The Imperium hopes to be prepared for
subsequent Frontier Wars better than it has been

History of the Third Imperium

before. There is reason for hope. The Imperial Navy
is devising plans that should guarantee the security of
the Domain of Deneb. However, it will require strong
and capable leaders to carry it out. Duke Norris Aella
Aledon of Regina might be just the man for the job.
The Emperor sees a kindred spirit in the Duke and
hopes to make his acquaintance eventually. Strephon
is less inclined towards the senior Duchess of the
Marches, Delphine Adoriana Muudashir. Born in 979,
the august Duchess Delphine was a child during the
Solomani Rim War and was knighted to the Order of
Starship and Crown in 1018 by Strephon’s grandfather,
Gavin. Regardless of their shared history, Strephon
and Delphine have little in common. He has privately
remarked that she seems a bit too devoted to her
protégé, Admiral Frederick Santanocheev. Now, nearly
126 years old, the duchess’ ambitions seem to be at
odds with those of Norris.

The Domain of Deneb is the future of the Imperium and
Strephon means to serve it and its people far better
than previous Emperors have. The first Alkhalikoi came
from Rhylanor in the Spinward Marches and Strephon
intends to honor the memory of Arbellatra by being
a better custodian of his ancestral homeland. To this
end, Imperial naval strategists have adopted a new
‘elastic defence’ strategy in which colonial reserves are
strengthened and more powerful reinforcements are
stationed nearby in Corridor. Should another Frontier
War occur, the colonial forces need only hold on until
messengers can retrieve the larger, more powerful fleet
elements from Corridor, which will arrive in the nick of
time to vanquish the enemy. The Imperium has also
committed to the concept of the battle rider, sublight
capital ships attached to massive jump tenders. By not
installing jump drives on these spacecraft, they can
be packed with more ammunition and weaponry than
jump-capable naval ships.

The pace of innovation is reaching new levels.
Several Imperial worlds are now striving to achieve
TL16. The naval weapons research facility on
Sabsee has developed a more powerful small arm:
the FGMP-16. On Ye-lu and Celetron, experiments
in artificial intelligence are creating fully independent
systems and robots that promise to bring new levels
of processing speed and efficiency to Imperial
worlds. Imperial Research Station Zeta on Pashus
in Deneb is close to making a breakthrough in jump
technology. Meanwhile, Vincennes, also in Deneb,
has standardised at TL16, particularly in the realms of
communications and electronics.

LONGBOW II
Unbeknownst to the rank and file of the Imperium,
Emperor Strephon commissioned the highly
confidential Project Longbow II in 1103. The
previous Longbow had a much smaller scope.
This new phase of the project professes to
use the entire width of the Imperium as its long
baseline, using jump-6 couriers to carry collected
data to Depot in Lishun.

Elsewhere there are other problems to contend with.
While the Battle of Terra ended the Solomani Rim
War a century ago and the Imperium has done a
fine job of integrating the worlds that it conquered,
the enemy is only a few parsecs away. While the
Solomani are still technologically inferior to the
Imperium, there are highly motivated zealots within
their ranks. It would be unwise to underestimate
them. There is unfinished business in the Solomani
Rim and it remains to be seen which side has the
vitality and determination to win should another
major conflict arise in the region. Since 1095,
the Solomani Party has again been allowed to
operate on Terra. Considered a dangerous move by
some, the Imperium believes that after a century,
the occupied worlds have learned the benefits of
Imperial membership. Greater pluralism has been
allowed so that peace may continue.

While the Imperium has its jump-4 x-boat network, and
the navy its jump-6 courier system to communicate
urgent issues, Emperor Strephon still fears a
fragmentation of the empire. Cleon’s dream of a
loyal, honorable and dutiful feudal nobility seems
to be working as intended but there is reason to be
concerned. Strephon is afraid that the disparate
regions of the Imperium desire more localised
government to better serve their needs. He is staunchly
committed to a unified empire and seeks ways to
enhance the bonds that the domains have with Capital.
To this end, he has appointed progressive archdukes
such as Dulinor Astrin Ilethian, men and women who
he believes share his vision and know how best to
serve their domains, all the while maintaining their
commitment to the Imperium as a whole.

History of the Third Imperium

# CORE SECTOR

Visitors to Core often find that it is not at all what they
expected. There is a common misconception that the
entire sector is one big, crowded extension of Capital,
that all of its inhabitants are exorbitantly wealthy with
robots and computers running every aspect of their
lives and that Imperial patriotism runs thicker than
blood in their veins. While there certainly is wealth
to be had in the Core, and Capital does wield a wide
sphere of influence, not every world is a bastion of
technological development, covered in arcologies and
industry, nor does everyone fly the Imperial flag with
nationalist zealotry. It is quite the opposite in many
ways. Core is in fact a disparate and diverse place
where individualism runs rampant and there is little in
the way of consistency or uniformity. This is by design,
if one can truly say that controlled chaos is something
to which the greatest interstellar empire in history
aspires. The Imperium is working as intended.

For those who never manage to travel to the Core, the
myths remain larger than life. This sector is thought
to be a magical place, a hallowed region of space as
unattainable as it is distant. While millions of sophonts
travel among the stars at some point in time, the fact
is that most remain on their worlds of origin for the
duration of their lives. To a belter in the Empty Quarter,
a merchant in the Spinward Marches or a starport
administrator in the Solomani Rim, the Core is just a
place seen in holovideos or read about in daily news
feeds. Some Travellers dream of seeing its wonders for
a lifetime but only a privileged few actually make the
long journey to the Core and Capital, perhaps affording
them a visit to the Grand Palace of Arbellatra itself.

The reality is that the Core is much like any other
Imperial sector. It is a wealthy sector but not the
wealthiest. It is populous but not the most populated. It
has technological wonders aplenty but there are worlds
elsewhere in the Imperium that have achieved levels
beyond those of the Core. The sector certainly has a
distinct character and unique features. It is home to
Capital where the current and all former Emperors have
sat upon the Iridium Throne and where the nobility
meet at the Moot Spire. It is home to Reference, a
world dedicated to the retention of all information ever
collected by Humaniti. Some of the most powerful
starships in existence have been built at its Imperial

Navy Depot in a star system that was touched by the
Ancients. Even after over 1,000 years, the Core’s
economy is among the mightiest in the Imperium. More
goods are exported from its industrial worlds than from
those of any other sector.

The Sylean Main is the Core’s richest trade route,
connecting Capital to the majority of the sector.
Achenaar Antilles currently dominates shipping in
the sector but the megacorporate lines are engaged
with them in fierce economic combat for control
of the sector’s rich export business. While the big
corporations duke it out for control, there is plenty of
business for enterprising free traders to make a living.

Several alien races hail from the Core, including the
Ssienjhiovla, an aquatic species who have integrated
themselves into Imperial society and the sagely but
bloviating Bhu’oovaakaylaa, large and phlegmatic
and virtually unseen beyond the confines of their
homeworld. The Oo-ne-beto-pon-tee or ‘whistlers’ as
some call them, a strange and potentially dangerous
species, are under the watchful eye of the Imperial
Navy on the isolated world of Night. Their ability to
affect the minds of their human cohabitants is cause for
concern. The dead race known as the Shingans were
wiped from existence nearly 800 years ago, allegedly
for having similar abilities. A recently discovered race
called the Ganmeids have been found in the oceans of
the windswept world of Indshiim Ganme, a mere seven
parsecs from Capital. The Core is also home to several
human Minor Races, none more famous or influential
than the Syleans, whose unique philosophy enabled
Humaniti to arise from the ashes of the Long Night.

Despite the presence of many human and alien
races, the Vilani and Solomani have by far had the
greatest impact on the sector. The Vilani first arrived
approximately 7,500 years ago and called the sector
Ukan. They left their mark in many ways, none more
obvious than the many Vilani-named star systems.
During the Interstellar Wars, the Terrans invaded
and renamed many worlds, left some names intact
and corrupted others with Galanglic influences. To
some extent, the names of the Core’s worlds tell
the tale. The Terrans burst into the First Imperium in
leaps and bounds, annexing and conquering high-

value worlds and leaving lesser worlds in their wake.
Many diamonds in the rough were overlooked during
the invasion, which explains why many rich worlds
still retain Vilani names and cultural heritage. After
thousands of years of intermixing and the intercession
of the Long Night, the Core is neither Vilani nor
Solomani but somewhere in between.

The sector is a dynamic and ever-changing realm,
and the structure of the Imperium does not lend itself
to stasis. Individual worlds are free to determine their
own destinies. There is a great deal of conflict and
strife in the Core, just as there is anywhere else in the
Imperium. Amidst all the wealth, gleaming palaces
and gargantuan starships there is poverty, conflict,
avarice, violence and every other human foible on
display. This makes for a patchwork of freewheeling
anarchies, authoritarian regimes, would-be utopias,
struggling colonies, balkanised jigsaw puzzles and just
about every other type of society that one can imagine.
There is a greater concentration of high-tech and high-
population worlds than on the frontiers. High-population
worlds tend to have complex governments and high
Law Levels as well. Authoritarianism runs strong in the
heart of the Imperium.

The Core presents unique and exciting challenges
for a group of Travellers. As one approaches
Capital, the trappings of empire become increasingly
evident. The burden of serving and protecting the
Imperial throne world creates political and military

intrigue throughout most of the Core and Kaskii
subsectors. Branches extend from Capital like the
nervous system of some great organism, making
neighboring worlds an extension of its will. Nobles
jockey for position in fiefs near the throne world.
Because of their proximity to Capital and easy
access to the Moot, the nobility here wield an
outsized influence.

Portions of two defeated empires – the Interstellar
Confederacy and the Chanestin Kingdom –
and other worlds retain some semblance of
independence and a distinct cultural flavor but most
have been fully integrated into the Imperium. This
does not mean that the sector is devoid of conflict.
New squabbles have taken the place of the old,
most centered on territorial disputes between various
political rivals, noble houses, megacorporations
and trade guilds. The Emperor and peerage watch
brewing disputes carefully. The ties that bind the
Imperium can be tenuous.

The Core is well defended by its numbered and
sector fleets, which are the most powerful in all of the
Imperium. The Core Sector Fleet is headquartered at
Depot with a goodly portion of its fleet elements based
at Capital. The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has
its bureaucratic headquarters at Reference, where
it also berths multiple scout cruisers. Reference is
also well-defended by the Imperial Navy due to its
strategic importance.

CORE SECTOR

# APGE

The Apge subsector is dominated by the Apge
system, which contains over 80 percent of the
subsector’s inhabitants. Apge is the capital and is
situated along a ring of star systems that are fittingly
called the Apge Cluster, which is a tributary of a
longer jump-1 main that extends into neighboring
Sanches, dipping into the Mekee and Perite
subsectors as well.

Duchess Azabaka Ashushashmi of Apge enjoys
her role as custodian of a Core subsector but is
very sensitive about the status of her world and its
importance to the sector. The worlds in the rimward
half of Apge are economically dominated by the
Iiradu system in the neighboring Dagudashaag
sector. Restrained and conservative Apge has a
difficult time wooing some of its more impressionable
citizens away from Iiradu. The Apgeans are staunch
traditionalists who favor a Vilani-style caste society
in which everyone knows their place. Conversely,
there is a great deal of economic mobility on Iiradu,
both up and down the scale. The fact is most
Iiraduans do not get rich. Wealth gravitates to a very
select few but the stories of immigrants who go there
and acquire immeasurable wealth are seductive.
Duchess Ashushashmi does what she can to offer an
alternative life path in which tradition, stability and
service have greater value than obtaining riches. She
puts immense pressure on the Apge Bureau of Life,
Environment and Resources (ABLER) to ‘get out
and spread the word’ about how wonderful the Apge
Cluster is and how it is absolutely brimming with
economic potential. Despite their catchy acronym,
ABLER is in fact a traditionalist-style Vilani bureau,
the members of whom would just as soon focus their
efforts on the difficult job of managing a challenging
planet without the interference of a busybody

duchess. However, the duchess is quite persistent
and does manage to persuade members of ABLER to
take on public-relations missions from time-to-time.
The Travellers might encounter these exhausted and
unenthusiastic bureaucrats during their visits to
the subsector.

The work done at Research Station Beta and the
Naval Science Division Regional Headquarters on
Sabsee are presented as examples of what can be
achieved when Imperial citizens put their personal
ambitions aside and dedicate themselves to the
greater good. Scientists there are hard at work
developing high-tech weaponry systems that are
used to defend the Imperium. They are on the verge
of a significant breakthrough in the field of fusion
weapons technology and are about to introduce the
FGMP-16, the smaller, lighter and deadlier successor
of the FGMP-15.

Technological innovation has always been part of the
lifeblood of Apge. At the dawn of the Third Imperium,
Cleon Zhunastu’s patented Fusion Plus technology
was first employed in the Azimuth system, where it
was successfully used to provide power for a light
carrier and squadron of gunships deployed to combat
pirates in the subsector. Azimuth is little more than
a naval outpost in modern times but its highport is
decorated with several mixed-media murals and
interactive displays that reprise the battle to the
tune of overly dramatic and slightly too loud original
compositions from the Apge Symphony Orchestra.

Apge is defended by the 26th Fleet, with squadrons
more or less evenly distributed among its worlds. A
larger contingent is present at Sabsee to ensure the
safety and security of its research facilities.

###### Apge subsector

Apge
At one time an important world of the First Imperium,
Apge has experienced a tumultuous history. The fall of
the Ziru Sirka caused a radical shift in the importance
of various star systems. Apge weathered the storm
by becoming an important stopover on the long route
between Vland and Hub, the capital of the Rule of Man.
During the Long Night, Apge reverted to its Vilani roots,
declined to a lower Tech Level and adopted a more
conservative culture.

A resurrected Vilani nobility returned to the practice
of appointing the third-born child of the family as heir.
This practice propagated to other tiers of society
and resulted in a massive population boom. Under
normal circumstances, this hallowed Vilani practice
would precipitate the migration of first- and second-
born offspring to other worlds, thereby serving as an
engine for colonization. However, during the Long
Night, migration was not an option. The population of
Apge flowered without access to enough resources
to easily provide for everyone. The management of
food production and processing became of utmost
importance on this marginally habitable world. Apge
is tidally locked with Aseladar, its red dwarf star, and
only its twilight zone has a mild climate with its bright
and dark sides less so. Nevertheless, billions of people
were forced to live in all regions of the world as well as
numerous orbital and Lagrange point artificial habitats.
Apgeans have also settled the majority of the system’s
other worlds and even today a large belter community
mines the planetoids of the Pukushkilaam Belt in the
outer system, despite the fact that it has been largely
tapped out from thousands of years of exploitation.

While Apge has once again arisen as a powerful
interstellar high-technology society, it retains a
disciplined and reserved culture. The advent of the
Third Imperium resurrected Apge’s importance and its
Vilani-style bureaucracy reinvented itself as a key link
between Vland and Core. While members of Apge’s
ruling class have accepted their roles as Imperial
citizens, the world has maintained a distinctively Vilani
flavor. Galanglic is universally spoken but Vilani is the
language of choice when not engaging with offworlders.

Castell
Over 90 percent of the surface of Castell is covered
by water. While its land masses are unremarkable and
have only a few small settlements, its ocean floors
are rich in valuable minerals and metals. For most of
the world’s history, the majority of the population has
lived in undersea arcologies. After a large seismic
disturbance in 758, the Myteria-Seru arcology
flooded and crumbled, tragically killing all 1.5 million
inhabitants. To prevent a recurrence, the government
established draconian laws governing all aspects of
life in the world’s remaining undersea cities. Despite
the overly rigorous laws, the world’s leader retains the
confidence of his people. Citizens are educated from
birth to respect the artificial environments in which they
live and to believe that strict control of every action is
necessary to ensure their safety.

The overzealous safety regulations have had an
adverse effect on population growth. Among Castell’s
many laws are some that strictly control reproduction.
The goal was to maintain replacement level population
numbers but instead they have seen a steady decline.
A full 350 years after the accident, the population
is approximately 10 percent of what it was. To
prevent complete social and economic collapse,
the government has begun to allow offworlders to
immigrate to Castell, allowing them to build floating
cities, mining submarines and establish a nomadic
ocean-going culture. The one requirement is that they
participate in Castell’s essential mining industries. The
newcomers are virtually unrestricted by Castell’s high
Law Level. The state-run media restricts the natives’
knowledge of how the immigrants live but some of them
have found out nonetheless. The government is now
engaged in a two-prong attack to set things right: on the
one hand, they have redoubled their efforts to restrict
the flow of information to the natives, and on the other
they have begun to impose laws on the immigrants that
they are loath to accept.

Maaruur
Maaruur is the largest moon and solitary habitable
planetary body of the gas giant, Kaasgada. The moon
once hosted a burgeoning industrial society of billions
of sophonts, which had achieved TL9 by the mid-300s.
In addition to its human inhabitants, the world was also
host to a native intelligent species known as Shingans.
The Shingans were hairy bipeds whose development
was limited by their lack of dextrous appendages. Their
graspers enabled them to create a primitive agrarian
society but the inability to craft more advanced tools
kept them at approximately TL1 when they were first
contacted by the Vilani thousands of years ago.

Under the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man, the Shingans
formed a societal underclass, taking service and labour
roles. They were an intelligent species and many
resented the millennia of oppression at the hands
of humans, whom they believed to be their equals.
Progressive human scientists developed prostheses
for the Shingans, which enabled them to do the same
things as their human counterparts but the technology
was outlawed during the Long Night, returning the
Shingans to their traditional roles.

Despite their inability to craft items of technology
beyond stone tools, the Shingans were a philosophical
people who were very much in touch with their
environment. In addition to consuming the plant and
animal life of their world they cultivated a vast array of
narcotics, which were consumed for medical, religious
and recreational use. The effects of most of these
substances were next to nil for humans but produced
almost mystical effects in the Shingans. Scientific
studies of these biochemical interactions were left
largely incomplete but early research discovered that
the Shingan biome extended heavily into their brain
tissue. The various microbes living on the Shingan
brainstem served as a biological middleman, catalysing
much stronger effects than would otherwise occur.

During the early Third Imperium era, Shingan shamans
discovered a rare natural substance that enabled
them to commandeer the conscious mind of humans
and other animals. Frequent usage of the substance
eventually subsumed it into the cerebral biome of the
Shingans to the point where they no longer had to
imbibe it to achieve these effects. The shamans led
the Shingan people in a revolt against the humans. It
was theorized, but never proven, that the substance
was only able to interact with the cerebral biomes of
psionically talented Shingans. In 350, the Imperial Navy
interdicted the world before the Shingans were able to

export the mind-controlling agents. Five dreadnoughts
were brought into the system, three of which orbitally
assaulted population centres with particle weapons
and mass drivers while the other two bombarded the
planet with planetoids gathered from the system’s
belts. Maaruur was cleansed of virtually all life forms
within weeks. The 1,300 people at the highport – 400
of whom were Shingans – were quarantined and
examined for the presence of the dangerous narcotic.
Those who were free of its effects were relocated to the
Khaam system where the navy quarantined them for an
additional period of time before releasing them into the
general public. The 400 or so surviving Shingans were
not a large enough sample to revive the race and are
believed to have gone extinct within a few generations.

Today, Maaruur remains a desolate world, its
atmosphere still tainted by the dust, gases and other
effluvia of the bombardment. Although inspectors
declared the world safe for recolonization two
centuries ago, few people accepted the offer, even
with generous subsidies.

So thorough was the bombardment that no cities were
left standing. Maaruur was basically reduced to a
primordial state. Nevertheless, salvage teams still come
to Maaruur to pick over its bones from time-to-time.
There is a great deal of superstition among spacers
about Maaruur and what happens to those who disturb
this worldwide graveyard.

Niizediju
The acidic air and high atmospheric pressure
on Niizediju have made settlement of the planet
challenging at best. For this reason, much of the
population lives in orbital cities, Lagrange-point habitats
and on the moons of its mainworld and gas giants.
Those who eke out a living on Niizediju itself do so
with the use of materials technology imported from
Dana and Muudeshi. Niizediju is rich in petrochemicals
and valuable rare-earth minerals but conditions on the
planet make resource extraction difficult. Most of its
cities are subterranean and linked by an underground
rapid transit network. Habitats and factories on the
surface are built with corrosion-resistant polymers and
crystaliron alloys.

Niizediju has a highly transient population. Fully
40 percent of its people are offworlders who have
come to make a living and then move on to greener
pastures. For most, the supposed road to success has
been paved with broken dreams. A large percentage
of its population are living on the edge of financial

apge

disaster and reliant on the charity of its more well-to-
do inhabitants, many of whom are loath to provide
assistance. This has resulted in a financially stratified
society with a great deal of tension between the social
classes and the paralysed ruling council has done little
to alleviate such problems.

The Viscount of Niizediju has been petitioned to come
up with a long-term solution. Unfortunately, the good
viscount spends most of his time at the Moot Spire
on Capital, where he basks in the glory of being an
Imperial noble. While he does spend about a quarter
of each year on Niizediju, he has shown little interest in
involving himself in local affairs. His offhand response
has been to provide subsidies for traders and liners to
take its financially challenged citizens and deposit them
elsewhere. This has made him extremely unpopular
with his neighbors and the factory chiefs of Niizedjiu
itself who need a work force and do not want to send
the wrong message to potential newcomers.

Sabsee
In addition to the FGMP-16, which is described in the
Central Supply Catalogue , Research Station Beta on
Sabsee has created a number of other interesting
armor and weapons technologies.

Ion Rifle
At higher Tech Levels, ion technology has been
miniaturised to the level that it can be used for
personal weapons. At TL14, a hit from an ion rifle
can disrupt electronic equipment on vehicles or
powered armor for 1D rounds. Powered armor with
Protection +20 or higher is immune and the weapon
does not affect vehicle with Armor 4+. At TL15,
the ion rifle is considerably more expensive but can
penetrate personal armor with any Protection and can
momentarily disrupt vehicles with Armor 8 or less.

Personal Energy Shield
There are times when armor is needed but the
appearance of having armor is not. Nobles
visiting hostile territory, military officers inspecting
undisciplined militia, diplomats making first contact
and others may require defensive armor without
looking as if they are geared up for combat. The
personal energy shield creates an invisible gravitic
field around the wearer, which repels ballistic and all
energy attacks except lasers. The shield is powered
by a small, unobtrusive battery that may be worn at
the belt or beneath the clothing in order to conceal its
presence. A standard battery provides six hours
of protection.

A skilled wearer can overload the battery to get more
Protection by making a Difficult (10+) Electronics
(computers) check to recalibrate the device. Success
with an Effect of 0-3 provides Protection +18 but
reduces the battery life by one half. Effect of 4–5
provides Protection +24 with one half the battery
life. An Effect of 6+ provides Protection +24 with no
reduction in battery life. The Traveller must reattempt
the calibration with each recharge of the battery.

Stun Rifle
A non-lethal weapon, designed to inflict a massive
shock to the target or targets, incapacitating them.
The stun rifle employs similar technology to that of
the stunner (see page 116 of the Central Supply
Catalogue ), inflicting more damage and providing a
blast option. When set to blast, the stun rifle receives
the Blast trait. Blast shots inflict reduced damage of 3D
and consume two charges from the magazine.

## PERITE

The motto of the Perite subsector might very well
be ‘Look to Spinward’. Regardless of its proximity
to Capital, Perite has a distinctly Vilani flavor. After
the fall of the Rule of Man three millennia ago, many
of the worlds in Perite shook off the yolk of Terran
dominance, in some cases violently, and returned
to their roots. During the Long Night, populations on
many worlds collapsed; the societies that remained
returned to the Vilani language, traditions and
rituals that had guided their lives for thousands of
years before the disastrous Interstellar Wars and
subsequent Rule of Man. After contact with the
Sylean Federation in approximately -450 and the re-
emergence of interstellar trade, Perite became more
of a hybrid culture but even today visitors can see the
tension that exists between cosmopolitan Imperial
society and traditional Vilani boroughs.

The Karnika system is called the ‘Gateway to Core’
and serves as an important link on the route between
Vland and Capital. Duke Dagalu Kiinlarsuush
Rikhummi makes his home there but spends a great
deal of time travelling the worlds of the subsector with
his charismatic wife, Asasshaa, a woman of noble
lineage who traces her heritage back thousands of
years to the dynasties that governed the region during
the era of the Ziru Sirka. The duke himself is of mixed
origin but has adopted a Vilani surname in order to
endear himself with the Vilani-majority population.
Only his nearest friends and relations know him by his
birth name, Evander Konig.

Unlike some members of the nobility who prefer to
lie low and manage their holdings, the duke and
duchess are celebrities in Perite, which has a free and
progressive culture. Law Levels are mostly low and
government interference is minimal on most worlds.
While Perite celebrates its kinship with nearby Vland,
the economy of Perite is much more heavily linked with
that of the Lishun sector.

A popular entertainment trend in the subsector is a
rash of ‘Shugilii shows’, holovideo series that celebrate
the Vilani tradition of food processing. The hosts of
the shows travel the subsector, showing people how
to process flora and fauna from its worlds. The most
popular of them is ‘Shugilii Shimiirkhuki’, in which the
host hunts a multitude of animal species and shows

how to field process the animals, using each and every
bit for consumption and other uses. The hosts of the
most popular shows are huge celebrities in Perite and
Apge but less well known elsewhere.

Perite’s stellar density is spotty and includes several
inconvenient gaps in its astrography. Tramp traders
working their way into the lucrative Core market
typically operate far traders or subsidized merchants
equipped with collapsible fuel tanks for crossing the
empty space between its star clusters.

Perite is defended by the 51st Fleet, based in Karnika,
Mishaar, Shazeku and Uumeaxan with squadrons
posted at numerous systems. All of the ships of the
fleet bear Vilani names, which makes them easy to
pick out during joint exercises elsewhere in the Core.
The flagship of the fleet is a heavy cruiser that is called
Khidenuum iru Argukege , the ‘Duty of the Wise’.

Akussanja
Akussanja hosts a variety of unusual life forms as
a result of its unusual relationship with its red dwarf
binary pair, Blaukasa and Iona. Like most worlds
that orbit red dwarf stars, Akussanja is tidally locked,
so one side of the planet always faces Blaukasa
while the other faces away. Iona has an eccentric
orbit, approximately 45o off the plane of the ecliptic.
Approximately every 2.5 standard years, Iona comes
close enough to Akussanja to have a significant
effect on the planet. When distant, Akussanja’s
hydrosphere is frozen, creating ice caps nearly the

world over. The planet’s abundant sea life is mostly
dormant during this period but when Iona is close,
its frozen oceans partially melt and the seas come to
life. Akussanjan fish hibernate during the cold periods
and become active only when they have significant
heat from both stars. In addition, Iona casts its dim
light on what is otherwise Akussanja’s dark side.

The Scout Service maintains a base in the system
to observe the unusual Akussanjan life forms. IISS
scientists believe that studies of the biochemistry
of these creatures might have applications in the
cryogenics field. After failed attempts to involve the
Core sector’s Research Stations Beta and Gamma,

perite

the IISS extended offers to the corporate community
and – much to their chagrin – drew the interest of
SuSAG, which established a permanent presence on
the planet. As it turns out, the IISS and SuSAG do
not get along well and have recently stopped sharing
their findings with each other. Most of the population
on Akussanja are members of the Scout Service,
employees of SuSAG, or workers from various
companies present to support the two organizations.
As the rift between the IISS and SuSAG has
gotten worse, the service companies have found
themselves caught in the middle. Accusations have
been made on both sides that the service companies
include spies for one side or the other. Unfortunately,
the situation has continued to get worse and shows
no signs of abating.

Gakxaal
A popular destination for Travellers who enjoy
roughing it in the great outdoors, Gakxaal is stitched
with an unusual number of tall mountain ranges. The
world has been largely overlooked because of its
high degree of tectonic activity and pervasive species
of fungoids, viruses and bacterial masses. Evolution
on the planet never managed to produce complex
animal species but microbial life runs rampant in its
oceans, seas and low-lying valleys. However, little of
its native life may be found at an elevation of more
than 1,000 meters. The planet has a dense, high-
pressure atmosphere with significant carbon dioxide,
sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide taints spewed
from its dozens of active volcanos.

Gakxaal is off the beaten path and poses a
challenging environment for long-term settlement.
The starport is rudimentary, little more than terraces
and pueblo-like structures carved out of limestone.
The landing pads are too small and unstable to
dock a starship but many can support small craft
and gravitic vehicles. A tourist service in the planet’s
northern hemisphere offers transportation via airship
between some of its more popular mountain ranges.
Trained guides and mountaineers are available to
show intrepid Travellers the many wonders of the
planet. One of its more popular attractions is the
Glass Valley, a canyon system with billions of loose
olivine and pyroxene stones that have been cleansed
of dust and regolith by various bacterial species. The
canyons glisten with the green and purple hues of
the stones and cast a hypnotic prismatic effect when
Gakxaal’s star shines directly upon them.

Shazeku
During the Long Night, Shazeku was governed by a
pantheist religion known as the Bamshimbakkada.
The priesthood remained in power for thousands
of years until it was toppled by a revolution a
few decades after being integrated into the
Imperium. The remains of the Bamshimbakkada
are everywhere. Immense temples, state buildings,
monuments and other public works have been
preserved and converted for use by the modern,
high-tech society. Others have been made into
museums and historical sites for tourists.

There were 14 deities in the Bamshimbakkada
pantheon, each of whom were represented by a
planet or star in the Shazeku system. Shazeku’s two
red dwarf stars, Aadii and Kuusi, are approximately
one light year apart and each orbited by six planets.
The Bamshimbakkadans believed that the worlds of
Aadii, including Shazeku itself, represented various
aspects of goodness and virtue. Conversely, the
worlds of Kuusi represented vice, the underworld
and other evils. While the populations of the worlds
orbiting Kuusi all died out during the Long Night,
they have since been repopulated. To this day the
Shazekuans are superstitious about Kuusi and
generally avoid engaging in trade, diplomacy or other
exchanges with its worlds in spite of the fact that
they debunked the Bamshimbakkadan religion over
1,000 years ago.

The Imperial Navy Base on Shazeku is an
important one. The world is host to several small
craft construction yards that manufacture fighters,
armed pinnaces and modular cutters for the navy.
Shazeku’s solitary moon is a test site for new
prototypes where some of the sector’s top test pilots
put these spacecraft through their paces before they
are sold to the Imperial Navy and various planetary
navies. Naval architects have recently been seen
at the ‘Black Cube’, a highly secure research
installation where the navy is said to be working
with sector-wide corporation Hodan-Barley on a new
breed of starfighter.

The Annililik Run
The legendary ‘silk road’ between Vland and Capital
is known as the Annililik Run. The route between the
two worlds was of great importance at the dawn of the
Third Imperium, linking the two capitals during an era
when the intervening space was strewn with pirates and
the remains of civilizations blighted by the Long Night.
Contact between Sylea and Vland was established
centuries before the advent of the Third Imperium but
few ship captains had the nerve to travel between the
two worlds. Traders could make a decent living plying
routes in the relative safety of their own pocket empires
and only those with a lust for fame and adventure
attempted the Annililik Run. Those who completed it with
their hides intact became celebrities, many of whom
leveraged their fame to acquire greater social standing
and prosperity.

The route was perilous for a number of reasons, not
the least of which was the distance across reaches of
space that had not been travelled much for centuries.
Right out of the gates from Vland, you have a number
of star systems with no gas giants, which makes
wilderness refuelling a challenge. While hydrogen
may also be obtained by extracting it from liquid
water on planets with a hydrosphere, there are often
regulations that prevent this practice on inhabited
worlds. There are several minor stellar chasms along
the way as well and chokepoints at the Vliishuug (now
called Inader) and Karnika systems. Savvy traders
took bypasses, of course, but every deviation from
the main route meant more jumps and thus more
exposure to potential pirate attacks, equipment failure
or other perils. Many traders became lost along the
route, some never to be seen or heard from again.
Lost traders were often said to have vanished into
the ‘Annililik Pyramid’, a mysterious phenomenon that
mercilessly gobbled up wayward starships.

The Annililik Run became somewhat safer as the Long
Night came to an end and Capital benefited immensely
from increased traffic along the route. Linking old
Vland with newly minted Capital lent the fledgling Third
Imperium an air of validity at a time when its prospects
for success were very much in doubt. It also enabled
Capital to seed Vland with Fusion Plus technology,
one of the cornerstones of Cleon Zhunastu’s outreach
program to the worlds around Sylea. As the route
became safer, larger and more capable merchant
convoys began to make the Run. This resulted not only
in the enrichment of many merchant lines but also in a

cultural exchange between empires old and new, laying
the groundwork for the eventual incorporation of Vland
into the Third Imperium.

In modern times, a race between Vland and Capital
is held once every four gurkula (a Vilani ‘year’, each
of which is approximately 478.7 standard days) to
commemorate the Annililik Run. The two worlds alternate
as starting and finish lines for the race; after an Annililik
Run is completed in one direction, it reverses course the
next time the event is held. If ever there were a fitting
interstellar analogue to the ancient Terran fable of the
‘Tortoise and the Hare’, this race is it. Ships are limited to
jump-2 and up to 600 tons. The race has dual objectives,
the first of which is to make the Run in an allotted period
of time. The distance between Vland and Capital is 60
parsecs and a jump-2 ship can make it between the
two systems in about 31 jumps if the most direct route
is taken. Contestants are expected to make the run in
60–75 weeks. Late arrivals are disqualified. The second
objective is to make money. The Annililik Run is, after all,
a commemoration of a famous trade route. Besides that,
there are very few contestants who have the Credits to
travel so far without making money to cover expenses
along the way. Contestants may take on freight, mail,
speculative cargo and passengers. The most reputable
ships are often fully booked with mid and high passages
before they even begin the Run.

The Annililik Run is more about efficiency than speed.
The rules allow for contestants to purchase fuel at
registered starports or extract it from gas giants,
comets, icy planetoids and other natural resources.
Each jump must be to an inhabited star system, so
leapfrogging between worlds by jumping into empty
space and using fuel from a collapsible fuel tank is not
allowed. Fuel costs are recorded and subtracted from
one’s totals at the end of the race. Some star systems
along the route are backwaters that see little traffic
when the race is not being run. Not surprisingly, many
of them take advantage of the situation and have been
known to price gouge for fuel, maintenance and other
services. To combat this, some contestants scout the
route ahead of time and seed it with fuel caches to
reduce costs and speed up their transit times. This
practice is strictly forbidden by the rules but has proven
to be difficult to enforce.

One would think that the modern Third Imperium would
not be a place for superstition and myth but tales of the
Annililik Pyramid persist. Very few ships are lost during
the event but those that do disappear are commonly
believed to have been consumed by the Pyramid. There

perite

are rational explanations for most disappearances:
deviating too far off the main route and failing to return,
quitting the race, engine failure and piracy to name just
a few. While the latter is extremely rare in the civilised
heart of the Imperium, the high amount of traffic passing
along the Run makes it too tempting to pass up for those
of a predatory nature. Most of the culprits are merely
opportunistic part-time villains who look for the weak
among the herd and strike where they can, victimising
unarmed ships that stray off the beaten path.

Despite the competitive nature of the event, many ship
crews engage in a level of camaraderie along the way.
Contestants meet each other at starport bars to tell
tall tales, gossip about fellow competitors and trade
rumors. However, not all exchanges are friendly. The
crews of competing ships often try to misdirect their
opponents with red herrings to throw them off the main
route. False stories are planted about big scores to be
had, low-priced fuel, minable comets that turn out not
to be there, essentially anything that can slow down
or befuddle other racers. Wise and experienced ship
captains learn to separate truth from fiction. Competing
crews often develop enmity with one another and
friendly competition sometimes morphs into heated
rivalries. Many a starport brawl has broken out between
rivals along the route. In extreme cases, this escalates
into a bout of ship combat but firing upon one another is
a severe breach of the rules and grounds for immediate
disqualification, so it rarely happens.

As the event has gained in popularity, corporate
sponsorships have become a big boon to Travellers
who make the Annililik Run. Corporations tend to
sponsor only proven winners, contestants who have
made the Run in the past and shown well. Contestants
sponsored by the top corporations typically sweep the
main categories of the event. Their ships are highly
maintained, possess the best technology available and
have skilled, well-trained crews. The event garners so
much media attention that participating corporations
gain a great deal of publicity simply from having their
logos adorn the hulls of sponsored ships. While collusion
between contestants is prohibited, those who are
sponsored by the same corporation get away with a few
subtle advantages. Most of them run analytics software
that tracks their opponents and shares the data among
other ships that have the same sponsor. Independent
tramp traders have none of these advantages but some
still manage to show well by employing a combination
of skill, cleverness and more than a little chutzpah.
It should be noted that not all corporate sponsors
are on the up and up. Some are fraudulent or shady
front organizations that take Credits from would-be

contestants and others are failing companies that fail
to provide the promised support. Travellers must take
caution when establishing a relationship with a potential
sponsor. There are private investigation firms on both
Vland and Capital whose specialty is investigating
sponsors but their services do not come cheap.

There are many distractions for the contestants,
especially the most famous ones and those who are
leading the pack. Media outlets flock to their ships to get
the latest news and many worlds roll out the proverbial
red carpet as the ships make their way along the Run.
Worlds like Karnika – generally considered the gateway
to the Core for race participants – create a festive
environment including armed escorts and a ‘parade path’
from the 100-diameter limit to the highport or downport.
With all the pomp and circumstance, it is easy for a
contestant to get side-tracked; only those with the utmost
degree of professionalism know best how to manage the
media, politicians, fans and all of the other distractions
with grace and aplomb. Corporate-sponsored ships are
expected to engage with the public to some degree.
Petulant captains and crews can lose their sponsorships
if they are overly curt or rude.

Reaching the finish line is just the beginning. Until the
75 th week has passed, the locals at Capital or Vland
watch and wait as more and more contestants roll in.
A leader board forms, ranking the contestants with an
algorithm based on the speed and efficiency with which
they made the Run along with a measure of their profits.
There are many categories to win but the top award
goes to the ship that achieved the best balance of speed
and net income. The Grand Champion is given an
enormous cash prize and gains fame and fortune to last
a lifetime.

For some, making the Annililik Run is a once-in-
a-lifetime adventure, a break from the norm and
an adventure they will never forget. After a Run is
completed, most contestants return to their lives as
crewmembers on liners, freighters and tramp traders.
For others, the Annililik Run is a way of life. Many of
them establish a migratory lifestyle around the event.
For example, a contestant might make the Run to
Capital and then spend the intervening years before
the next race plying the trade routes of the Core, only
to come back to Capital to prepare for the next race.
When they arrive in Vland, more than four garkula
later, they ply the routes of Vland for a while and so
forth. The Annililik Run has a culture and tradition all
its own that seems to have captured the imagination
of Imperial citizens. Its popularity seems to grow with
each passing year.

Corporate sponsors for ships making the Annililik
Run want results. The _Empress Porfiria_ -class far
trader has been optimized for efficient operation
during the event. Its two Gs of thrust enable it
to get from the 100-diameter limit to starports or
gas giants considerably faster than most ships.
This design sacrifices the low berths and air/raft
that usually come standard in order to increase

available cargo space. One of its two turrets is
equipped with an intense-focus laser drill for
faster acquisition of ice chunks from comets
and planetoids, enabling the ship to perform
wilderness refuelling even when a gas giant is not
present. Variants of the class sometimes feature a
high or luxury stateroom. Fame and fortune have
their privileges after all.

## AMEROS

Ameros has two distinctive features: the rimward tail
of the extensive Lishun Main, which wends its way
through Ameros in serpentine fashion and proceeds
into the Shinkan subsector; and the Ameros Rift, a
broad stellar gap that most starships cannot cross with
a single jump.

The coreward portion of the subsector is dominated
by the capital at Khizuun. The Khizuuni see
themselves as the rock upon which the Lishun sector
breaks and Core begins. To be a world of the Core is
to be an extension of Capital as far as the Khizuuni
are concerned and they believe that Lishunians
must be ‘cleansed’ before entering the hallowed
worlds of the Core. Entering at Khizuun – which
many Travellers do because of its rich markets and
convenient location – foreign starships are reminded
that they are no longer in ‘the provinces’ but have
entered the proverbial gatehouse of the Emperor.
Khizuun’s intrusive planetary navy, whose uniform
is intentionally similar to that of the Imperial Navy,
attempts to inspect every single ship that enters the
realm, despite the impossibility of actually doing
so. The Khizuuni are effectively trying to serve as a
protective membrane through which visitors might
transform themselves into respectable citizens of the
Imperium. For their part, Lishunian traders and other
visitors see the Khizuuni as a nuisance but not one
that is entirely unfamiliar; Lishun is no stranger to
authoritarian governments and most just see it as a
cost of doing business.

The Imperial Navy’s 69th Fleet is headquartered at
Khizuun with squadrons in several other systems
and two BatRons semi-permanently stationed at
Nimluin. Likewise, the Scout Service maintains a
large presence on Khizuun, where they supervise the
construction of x-boats, tenders and survey craft for
the way station on Gemi.

The intensity of Khizuuni culture has had an effect
on many of its neighbors, mostly by making them a
little neurotic. There are several worlds with Amber
Zone designations in Ameros, many of which suffer
from varying degrees of political instability. Like a nosy
and vigilant watchdog, Khizuun recklessly intrudes
upon their affairs with intelligence agents emplaced
throughout the subsector. These agents subvert
governments, foster insurgencies and assassinate

political opponents in an effort to bring them in line with
Khizunni dictates. The High Captain of the Khizuuni
Supreme Council has made veiled threats that he might
authorise the invasion of some of the subsector’s more
troublesome worlds, all for the cause of establishing a
safer, more prosperous Imperial order, of course.

While Ameros is an old and long-civilised subsector, it
has somehow managed to retain several worlds with
virtually unspoiled wildernesses. The frozen water
world of Erkiim, the bountiful twilight band of Luuni Miu
and the recently opened reserve world of Lagaashin
are a few examples. These worlds are popular
destinations for tourists provided that they can ignore
the invasive presence of the subsector capital.

Ameros
Over 50 years ago, megacorporation Hortalez et Cie,
LIC underwrote an ambitious terraforming project on
Ameros, whose goal it was to give the planet a thin
atmosphere and 10-percent hydrosphere within the
century. Purportedly they would transform the world
without dropping any comets and planetoids from
orbit, normally the linchpin of any terraforming project.
Metamorph, the fledgling firm in charge of the project,
have employed an experimental combination of
biochemical, geological and gravitic techniques to get
the job done, eschewing more traditional means but at
far greater expense.

The results have not justified the hype thus far. With
the project more than half complete, Ameros only has
a trace atmosphere and negligible hydrosphere, all
of which is currently locked up in equatorial ice caps.
Hortalez et Cie is upset about the lack of progress but
Metamorph scientists have assured them that results
are coming. Metamorph contends that the first several
decades of their revolutionary approach are preparatory
and that the majority of the results will not appear until
the very end of the project.

A competing firm has recently offered to come in and
finish the job, proposing to scour the system’s Oort cloud
for cometary bodies and other material with which to
bombard Ameros, thereby thickening its atmosphere
and providing water. Using less fancy technology, they
believe that they can free up water in subterranean

aquifers and even add spin to Ameros, which would
otherwise be tidally locked to the system’s circumbinary
pair. Hortalez is considering their pitch but Metamorph
has expressed concerns that mixing the two approaches
could have unexpected and possibly disastrous results.

Lagaashin
Lagaashin had been a reserve world dating back
to the late stages of the First Imperium when it
was a playground for high-ranking members of
the Vilani nobility. Its stable primary star, habitable
mainworld and well-developed biosphere made it a
prime candidate for settlement. However, colonial
expansion sometimes advances in mysterious ways
and the world was bypassed numerous times in spite
of its suitability. The Vilani had intended to develop
Lagaashin for agricultural purposes once population
levels in nearby systems reached a certain point but
the Interstellar Wars and eventual fall of the Ziru Sirka
prevented this from happening. During the Rule of
Man, the conquering Solomani were more eager to
exploit established agricultural worlds than to do the
hard work of developing new ones and Lagaashin was
passed by again. As the Third Imperium came about,
one of its key tenets was respecting Vilani culture and
traditions. While the Vilani had probably long forgotten
that Lagaashin was ever a reserve world at this point,
the Syleans’ historical records indicated otherwise and
so, once again, Lagaashin was left undisturbed.

In the ensuing centuries, the notion of Lagaashin
being a reserve world faded and local powers
began to plan for its eventual use. Ninua, the capital
of neighboring the Shinkan subsector, wanted
Lagaashin to become a penal colony whose prisoners
would be forced to work the land. Rapidly growing
Nimluin hoped to send colonists there to relieve
its overpopulation problems. Nuudle and Aaruu Zi
planned to offer access to Lagaashin as an alternative
for people who sought a simple, pastoral lifestyle.

It was Ninua who struck first, sending political
prisoners, suspected dissidents and other perceived
troublemakers to the world in 577, allegedly to
provide labour for a number of agricultural collectives.
A few decades later, the military junta on Nimluin
followed suit, sending millions of political prisoners
to Lagaashin where they were given basic supplies
for survival and left largely to their own devices.
Over time, the administration of the world became
a nuisance for both Ninua and Nimluin and the
descendants of the first Lagaashinians were granted
limited self-rule. In the late 800s, the Lagaashinians
created an array of interlocked councils to govern their

world, a civil-service bureaucracy whose responsibility
it was to carefully manage the resources and
environment that had been gifted to them. Above all,
they sought to achieve balance, using technology and
planning to create a sustainable society.

As Lagaashin’s government matured and its people
became aware of the universe around them, they saw
the opportunity to make their world an experiment in
which resources were not ravenously gobbled up but
instead carefully managed and cultivated. The Tech
Level on Lagaashin is somewhat difficult to measure.
While its citizens do not rely on technology to the
extent that people from other worlds do, they do use
high-tech building materials, agricultural techniques
and equipment with other technologies, which do not
adversely affect the unique society they are trying to
build. High technology is applied in an unobtrusive
manner and low-tech solutions are used wherever
practical, resulting in an overall lower Tech Level rating.

While Lagaashin was hardly a utopia, it had
successfully created a sustainable and peaceful
society. Alas, the Lagaashinians have fallen on
troubled times. Ninua has once again asserted its
authority over the planet, sending troops to the world
under the pretence that they were present to ‘keep the
peace’ despite there being little evidence of conflict.
Ninua has also asserted that they require greater
agricultural output from Lagaashin to address the
needs of their growing population. Ninua is pushing
Lagaashin to adopt a more aggressive development
strategy and to expand their agricultural zones to
include regions of the world that had been declared
natural preserves. Ninua also wants Lagaashin to
use lower-cost agricultural extraction technology
that would threaten the delicate ecological balance
that they have achieved. Many Lagaashinians are
pushing back the only way that they can: by peacefully
protesting Ninua’s unbidden and jackbooted assault
on their world. General strikes by agricultural workers,
hunger strikes and large demonstrations have become
the norm in Lagaashin’s cities and towns. Authoritarian
Ninua is intolerant of all forms of civil disobedience
and has begun to oppress the Lagaashinians with the
same methods used on their own world.

Of all the species native to Lagaashin, Kovil’s
ox – or simply, the kovil – has been the easiest
to domesticate. This gentle, elephantine creature
showed little fear of the early colonists and settled
in among them. The kovil is not really an ox at all
but its size and demeanour earned it the name.
Kovils were trained to pull ploughs and other heavy
equipment on the agricultural combines until more

ameros

TRAVELLER

efficient technological means were imported. While
the kovil does not object to being led or ridden,
attempts to train it to charge or behave aggressively
have failed miserably. The animal is able to manage
its pain centres, so corporal punishment and training
techniques are ineffective. If badly wounded, the
animal will attempt to flee and might trample anyone
caught in its path but it will not otherwise attempt to
harm humans. Kovils are rarely used as beasts of
burden anymore, but they are still frequently seen
grazing the fields and meandering through villages
looking for food.

Unnagilu
The Unnagilu belt was host to small outposts for most
of its history until the late 650s when belters struck
rich deposits of iridium, ruthenium and rhodium,
causing a rush to the system. Since then, the belt
has been heavily exploited but belters continue to
actively search for lodes of the rare metals among
its millions of asteroids. Sternmetal Horizons was the
first megacorporation to purchase major claims in
the belt and has the longest-running presence in the
system. Upstart mining firm, Delgado Trading, LIC,
came onto the scene in the mid-1050s. The two firms
now battle it out for supremacy, snatching up claims
as they arise and scouring the belt for new strikes
with arrays of mining drones. Things got nasty when
the two corporations started deploying weaponised
drones to disable and often outright destroy each
other’s drones and other equipment. They kept their
little war a secret until one of them inadvertently
destroyed a seeker starship that was owned by
an independent belter. Unnagilu’s government got
involved but its representative democracy had been
corrupted by the influential megacorporations and was
unable to resolve the dispute. The government was
dissolved having lost the confidence of its people. The
Imperial Navy threatened to intervene before things
got out of hand so the two firms hired mercenary
forces to secure their strikes and keep the peace. The
mercenaries have been put into the unlikely role of de
facto governors of the system and established military
rule in the belt and on the system’s other worlds and
gas giant moons. Mercenary commanders working
for both sides effectively collude with one another
in order to maintain the status quo. While they are
ill-suited to the tasks of government, a tense peace
remains in place in the system. The Imperium is ready
to intervene and has threatened to apply an Amber
Zone designation to Unnagilu, which would likely be
disastrous for all involved.

It is difficult to make a living as an independent belter
in this environment but that does not deter many from
trying. Independents – or ‘indies’ as they are known

* make up 8–10 percent of the belter population in
Unnagilu. The indies chafe at the arbitrary interference
of mercenary security forces but there is little they can
do about it. Many are taking their seekers elsewhere to
avoid getting caught in the crossfire but dreams of hitting
a big beltstrike have kept the indie community alive in
Unnagilu’s belt.

ameros

The scout base on Unnagilu includes one of the
service’s primary zero-G training facilities. The scouts
have sectioned off a region of the belt for the purpose
of training its members in the finer points of vacc suit
and zero-G operations. While its official designation
is IISS Base 096G-1117, the scouts affectionately
refer to it as ‘Camp Space Jockey’. The majority
of scouts present for training are from the
Exploration and Survey branches with a
minority from the Communications branch.
The asteroids inhabited by the scouts have
been tapped of their most valuable metals
and minerals, which prevents them from being
contested by the megacorporations or indies.
The scouts also have a base on Ordri, one of
the moons of the system’s innermost gas giant.

Despite Unnagilu’s problems, centuries of
settlement have created a thriving civilization
in the belt. Hundreds of hollowed out asteroids
are now home to populations of belters,
corporate employees and the employees of
the companies and small businesses that
are required to provide services for the
them all. Most of these artificial habitats
are run quite well by local councils who
are in the process of building a new
system government and drafting a
constitution for Unnagilu that excludes
the bickering megacorporations from
having an influence.

**IISS EVA Suit**
The Scout Service EVA suit is a hardier, more well-
equipped version of its standard vacc suit. The suit is
designed to handle multiple challenging and hazardous
working environments with improved heat and radiation
shielding, internal grav-assist, precise handling and
extended life support for up to 48 hours. The equipment
consists of two components: the vacc suit itself,
which may be worn in non-vacuum, standard-gravity
environments; and the EVA rig which is a heavy, multi-
purpose apparatus that the suit clips into.

The rig includes a set of waldos for sample collection
and several sealed storage containers to store them
in. Its advanced life-support gear is designed to make
operating in the suit very comfortable. The suit closely
monitors the occupant’s vital signs and has internal
injectors to provide first aid, anti-rad medicine and
stimulants for long EVAs.

## SHINKAN

The flow of interstellar trade and travel does not
bestow equal benefits to all the worlds of the Core.
Shinkan is a case in point, an important subsector
but it has always been a bit of a backwater. Sitting at
the nexus of four major Imperial sectors, it has the
potential to become a shining pearl of the realm but
things simply have not played out that way thus far.

Shinkan was the site of many Vilani ‘reserve worlds’,
planets that – thousands of years ago – were marked
for future development. Few of them were even
given a proper name other than an alphanumeric
designation. For this reason, many worlds in the
subsector do not bear Vilani names but instead those
of the Terrans, who swept through the subsector
as a conquering force during the later stages of
the Interstellar Wars. Besides naming them, the
Terrans and subsequent Rule of Man did little with
these untapped treasures and they were eventually
inherited by the Third Imperium who finally began to
develop them.

The seat of government for Shinkan is at Ninua,
which shows little interest in managing subsector
affairs, making its worlds a loose confederation at
best. The systems of Shinkan are rarely cooperative,
often contentious and in a few cases downright
hostile to one another. The aloof Ninuans are
constantly struggling with their own internal political
problems and generally regarded as a nuisance by
their neighbors. Ninua is jokingly referred to as
the anshikaam naimiiu saarpuhii , loosely translated
as ‘the world which looks away’. Indeed it does but
Ninua just might find that while its attentions are
diverted inward, the remainder of its worlds have
moved on without it.

The flow of trade from neighboring Fornast and
Antares passes into the Core through Shinkan, which
has created a caste of nouveau riche merchants
on many of its worlds. An abundance of recently
constructed high-tech starports along the Shinkan
Main are signs of its burgeoning economy. Ishnuunar,

despite appearances, channels more wealth into
the Core than any other world in the subsector.
Ishnuunar’s kleptocratic government, collapsing
infrastructure and disastrous Tech Level seem to be
signs of a world in freefall but in fact opportunities
abound there. The powerful and exorbitantly wealth
Ishnuunari merchant guilds run the system like a
syndicate of crime families. The guilds have their
hands in just about every business venture on the
planet and their tendrils have begun to spread to
other star systems. The fastidious landed gentry of
Gekhuu and Derku have done what they can to stave
off guild infiltration but have not proven to be up to the
task thus far. The three worlds – which have become
known as ‘the Triad` – have begun to fight proxy wars
on the hapless smaller worlds of the subsector. Most
believe that it is only a matter of time before these
conflicts spread to the Triad worlds themselves.

The sector-wide Achenaar Antilles line, which
dominates shipping in just about every other
subsector of the Core, has found it difficult to
penetrate the byzantine markets of Shinkan. Their
efforts to establish a regional headquarters at
Dureija have met with one disaster after another. The
regional director of the corporation has accused the
Triad of sabotage. The powerful trade line has been
lobbying the Imperial bureaucracy for assistance but
so far they have received little help. It seems that the
Imperium does not want to rock the boat in Shinkan,
whether or not the subsector’s successes have been
achieved by questionable means.

The bulk of the Imperial Navy’s 76th fleet is
headquartered at Sekwon with squadrons stationed
throughout the subsector. The Naval Base on Iidsha
includes a training facility and operational center
for Imperial Naval Intelligence. While the INI are
allegedly there to monitor incoming traffic from
Antares and Fornast, they are presumably also
keeping a watchful eye on the Triad to make sure
that their problems with one another do not boil over
into something more serious.

###### SHINKAN subsector

Aarza Kand
For all that Aarza Kand lacks in comfortable, habitable
worlds, it is rich in resources. The system was never
much more than an outpost for the Vilani and the
Solomani only began to scratch the surface of its
potential before the Long Night interrupted. Aarza
Kand was overlooked by just about everyone until the
mid-400s when belters and wildcatters began to exploit
its planetoid belts and gas giants for resources. The
system became a proverbial boom town and attracted
millions of immigrants who came to make their fortunes.
Among those who came were Irilitok Vargr from the
Antares sector.

In Antares and other Imperial sectors, the Irilitok
have become the go-to minority to do the dirty work
that no one else wants to do: running remote space
stations, building infrastructure on hostile-environment
worlds, exterminating alien pests, providing security
for minor merchant convoys and just about every other
hazardous, life-threatening job that needs to be done. If
there is money to be made and no one else wants to do
it, the Irilitok will avail themselves for the job. They are
heedless of danger and serve in roles that most right-
minded Imperial citizens refuse to take. However, there
is a dark side to the Irilitok: the Ekilati Onati, a star-
spanning organised crime organization that occupies
the lower rung of their society.

Shinkan

TRAVELLER

In most sectors, the Ekilati Onati are an afterthought,
low-level thugs who extort protection money from
the bottom-feeding Irilitok castes but in Shinkan –
where they are referred to simply as ‘the Antareans’

* they are a force to be reckoned with in the criminal
underworld. The Triad War between the guilds of
Ishnuunar and syndicates of Derku and Gekhuu
has left a power vacuum on many worlds that the
Antareans have been quick to fill.

The Antareans operate primarily out of Aarza Kand
itself but they also have gangs in both belts and
just about every spaceport in the outer system. The
Vargr are a minority race and try to keep a low profile
as best they can but when crossed, the Antareans
respond with violent retribution. They often employ
humans as enforcers and assassins to prevent law-
enforcement officers from easily implicating them.
Their signature act of retribution is to perform a
‘defanging’ before offing someone. The bodies of their
victims are found with their incisors and often their
claws – or fingernails if they are human – removed.
Mid-level gangsters sometimes wear collected teeth
on a necklace. Traditionally this form of violence was
only enacted upon other Vargr but the Ekilati Onati
have begun to inflict it upon humans as well.

Dim
The primary star and mainworld share the same
name in this system: the star due to its weak
luminosity and the planet for the prospects of its
citizens. Dim is a cold, mostly barren world, far
outside the habitable zone of the system, its star a
distant speck that provides little in the way of light
or heat. The system’s largest gas giant, Oaf, is at
the tipping point of becoming a brown dwarf and
approaches the size of Dim, the star. Oaf and Dim
orbit a close common barycentre, the two cosmic
bodies engaged in a tightly spinning dance with one
another. The other planets of the system, including
Dim itself, are circumbinary and therefore orbit both
the star and gas giant. The planet Dim is not tidally
locked with its primary star, which is unusual in a
red dwarf system. At some point in its distant past,
Dim may have been struck by a planet nearly its own

size, giving it a rotational period of about 12 standard
days. The collision theory also explains the presence
of a reasonably thick atmosphere and large amount
of water, most of which is frozen to a depth of several
hundred meters.

Life on Dim is, well... not bright but the world does
have some intrinsic value. It is located on the
extensive Lishun Main, which wends its way from
Ameros into Shinkan and continues two subsectors
into Fornast sector before it finally terminates. Traffic
on the main is high and Dim’s modest starport is
designed to facilitate trade as best it can. The central
pod of its highport is a busy thoroughfare where
freight and speculative cargo flows from ship-to-
ship. Low-tech robots, large and small, scurry about
transporting cargo modules, product samples, mail
pods and other materials between wheeling and
dealing merchants. Visitors learn to watch their step
lest they be run down in its narrow streets.

Free-market shenanigans aside, Dim’s top commodity
is information. Dim is an entry point into the Core and
as such serves as a launchpad into the markets of
the sector. Some may dismiss borders as ultimately
just imaginary lines but most tramp traders are quick
to point out that there is something different about
the Core’s worlds. They have a unique culture and
way of doing business. Newcomers to the sector or
Travellers who have returned after being away in
Fornast or Antares for a while come to Dim to get the
lowdown on current events. The liquor may be cheap
at Dim Highport but the talk is not. Its numerous
taverns, speakeasies and dive bars are crowded with
Travellers who trade information on any number
of topics.

The surface of Dim is barely populated. The world’s
metal and mineral reserves are poor although there
are a few small operations that scratch out a living
mining copper, aluminium and tungsten. Its main
industry is ice cracking: robotic extractors obtain
the ice, crack it for hydrogen and ship it up to the
highport where it is sold in its unrefined state. There
is no downport on Dim, just a small spaceport that is
fit only to dock small craft.

robots may be rented by the hour and used
to retrieve small lots of cargo from the
central hub or other ships docked at the port.
Most are designed to be remote controlled
by individuals, but some have preset
programming and a list of daily tasks which
they doggedly perform with little regard for
pedestrians on Highport thoroughfares.

from time-to-time.

Maeghen
After living under the rule of a feudal monarchy
for much of its existence, Maeghen underwent a
revolution a few centuries ago in which the people
rose up and violently overthrew the ruling families. The
successor government was ostensibly a representative
democracy but was in fact controlled by a corrupt
shadow government, some of whom were exiled
members of the monarchy. This was toppled as well
and the Maeghenians, despite repeated attempts,
proved unable to build a lasting government. After
several failed experiments with self-rule, the People’s
Army took control of the planet and established a
modicum of stability. While military rule is considered

to be an interim step towards the establishment of a
viable civilian government, it seems to be working just
fine on Maeghen and there are no plans to change the
arrangement any time soon. There are still rumbles
of another revolution brewing but none of them have
achieved any level of legitimacy or momentum thus far.

Maeghen maintains an aloof presence among the
worlds of the Shinkan Main, a throwback to the Long
Night when fending for oneself was the way of things.
Generally speaking, life is good on Maeghen. With its
Earth-like atmosphere and nearly standard gravity,
the Maeghenians are self-sufficient and most of its
citizens pay little attention to the interstellar community
around them. Its serviceable and utilitarian highport

Shinkan

TRAVELLER

welcomes visitors who are travelling along the Lishun
Main but the downport scarcely rates a Class E facility.
The scout base on the planet has its own Class B
starport, complete with a service facility, small-craft
manufacturing center and refined fuel. The base is not
accessible to the public but detached duty scouts may
use it upon request.

The scouts’ reason for being on Maeghen is to study its
unusual native plant and animal life. Based on the fossil
record, over 75 percent of the species on the planet
have been present for over a billion years without a
major extinction event, highly unusual in the galactic
scheme of things. Most worlds have fairly regular
cataclysms: ice ages, asteroid strikes, plagues and
other catastrophes that wipe out existing life forms only
to make way for a new wave after millions of years of
evolution by the survivors. The results of IISS studies
are inconclusive but they have noticed several curious
gaps in the taxonomy of the planet, which might be a
contributing factor.

The molecular structure of Maeghen’s native plant
life makes it indigestible for humans. Over thousands
of years of habitation, the Vilani genetically altered
select species to make them nutritious for humans.
In addition, they manipulated the soil so it could grow
crops of imported edible food. The methods they used
to adapt the plants have been lost in antiquity but most
of these crops continue to thrive today. There is some
concern that a blight of sufficient size could cause
widespread famine but the Maeghenians have been
fortunate enough to avoid such a calamity so far.

Minos
Minos was overlooked by the Vilani during the era
of the Ziru Sirka due to its inconvenient location and
lack of resources or life. It was eventually settled and
developed by Solomani colonists after surveyors
reported that there might be riches under the crusts of
its airless rockballs. Lo and behold it was true; beneath
the shallow crust of Minos, rich iridium and tungsten
lodes were found as well as the elements to easily
manufacture synthetic Zuchai crystals, all of which are
key components in the construction of jump drives.

The initial plan was for a conglomerate of local
companies to ship the materials offworld on mid-
to long-range freighters, to be used in shipyards
located elsewhere. Much to everyone’s surprise, the
megacorporation GSbAG orchestrated a hostile takeover

of the publicly listed companies in the conglomerate and
effectively commandeered the Minos system. Shares of
the major players involved were held in three different
offworld exchanges but GSbAG timed their purchases
to be virtually simultaneous, therefore preventing any
of them from communicating with one another and
preventing the takeover. Minor holdings are still held
by the locals and several other investors but GSbAG
managed to acquire a commanding 53-percent share of
the operation. The move was extremely unpopular with
the locals even after GSbAG promised to employ them
at its newly built shipyard. GSbAG made assurances
that it had no designs on corporate control of the system,
just its industries. However, the megacorporation
seems to be quite cosy with Minos’ civilian dictator
who gives in to GSbAG’s every demand. In spite of the
apparent conflict of interest, Minos’ shipyards are highly
productive, producing starships for the Imperial Navy
and several planetary navies. They also manufacture
starships of civilian design but only at premium prices.
GSbAG is known for high quality and its Minosian
products do not disappoint.

While Minosian culture cannot be said to be distinctly
Solomani, they do possess a certain smugness and
entitlement that hails back to the age of the Terran
takeover. Minos was a Quarantine World until late in
the Sylean Pacification Campaign and surrendered
to Imperial authority only after being threatened with
orbital bombardment. Time and the hostile acquisition
of their system’s resources has not imbued them with
any degree of humility whatsoever. By and large,
Minosians see themselves as bold wildcatters, making
their way on a frontier system when in fact, they are
very much ingrained citizens of the Imperium. There is
a navy base present to remind them that the Rule of
Man fell long ago and that they are citizens of the Third
Imperium, not the Second.

Rumor has it that Minos is what one might call a
‘double Amber Zone’. While the Imperial Navy is
allegedly present to ensure the loyalty of the Minosians
and to guarantee safe transit across the Shinkan Gap,
they seem to be preoccupied with something else
entirely. Naval ships of unusual design have been seen
jumping out of the system without reappearing at any
of the worlds in the interstellar neighborhood. It is
believed that these ships are jumping into the empty
space somewhere between Minos and Kalendae, for
what reason no one knows. Spurious rumors abound
that they are investigating an Ancients cache, a rogue
planet, a wreck from the Interstellar Wars or another
unusual object somewhere in the cold depths of space.
Whatever it is, the navy has been tight-lipped about it.

## SANCHES

Heavily populated Sanches is considered by most to
be the gateway to Dagudashaag but the Sanchesian
Prime Worlds – the high-population cluster of worlds
centred around the Sanches system itself – are
primarily focused on serving the Core. Its two industrial
worlds, Alekvadin and Dudin, manufacture many of
the sector’s consumer electronics and entertainment
devices. Sanches brings in a great deal of wealth from
the sales of its products to the other worlds of the
Core and exports to other sectors. The business of the
subsector is business. Its culture is highly collective
with individual needs and wants set aside in order to
serve the greater good of the Core. The subsector
is mostly surrounded by less-populated, provincial
subsectors; therefore, the transportation of its goods
requires the assistance of long-range freighters that
bridge the gaps to the other high-population worlds of
the sector. Many of these starships are constructed in
this subsector at the shipyards on Per, Kakhu Gash
and Sanches itself. While the yards on Sanches
are also used by military contractors, the majority of
their products are civilian in nature and include the
production of megafreighters of 50,000–500,000 tons
and ranging from jump-1 to jump-4 in performance.

Almost all of the worlds in the subsector retain their
original Vilani names with the sole exception being
Sanches itself. Most believe that the name is simply
a corruption of Sanshes, a common Vilani surname,
but it was in fact renamed by Terran Admiral Anatoliy

Sanches, whose naval forces conquered the system
late in the Interstellar Wars. After setting up shop on
the planet, he renamed it after himself and left the
remainder of world names in the subsector intact.

The subsector economy is bolstered by two small
jump-1 mains: the Sanches Cluster to spinward and
the Quadrant I Main, which dips into Apge, Perite
and Mekee. Sanches’ high-population worlds have
economies that far outstrip those of its neighbors
and Sanchesian traders rarely pass up the chance
to remind them of this. Sanches’ well-to-do worlds
sees themselves as powerful engines of prosperity for
which their neighbors should be thankful. Sanchesian
arrogance is mostly tolerated as long as the Credits
keep flowing into their coffers.

The Sanches subsector is defended by the Imperial
Navy’s 200th Fleet with headquarters at the Sanches
Navy Base. The navy has a large presence in the
subsector and regularly harbours squadrons in the Gir,
Khid and Neki systems in order to quell problems on
some of the troublesome worlds of the neighboring
Dagudashaag sector. While Dagudashaag has its own
Imperial Navy fleet elements, the Core has expressed
concern over their seeming inability to establish a
degree of lasting peace on many of its worlds. The
spectre of the Ilelish Revolt still looms large and the
Imperium is determined that such a thing should never
occur again, especially on its proverbial doorstep.

Arla Un
Arla Un orbits a bright blue-white subgiant star called
Kir Aikhalingas. The Arla Un ‘day’ is 263.8 standard
days long. The bright side of the planet heats up to a
white-hot 365o Celsius and its dark side can drop to as
low as 125o below zero. Arla Un appears to have been
subjected to multiple large impacts that have stripped
away much of its lithosphere and crust, leaving the
metal-rich mantle exposed. The planet has a trace
atmosphere and an oceanic slurry of water, tar and
sulphuric acid that moves along longitudinal cracks,
canyons and through deep veins under its surface. A
high degree of volcanic and tectonic activity results in
an ever-changing geography with crumbling hills and
mountains, and new fissures carved into its extensive
lava plains with each passing year.

Arla Un posed a technical challenge to the conservative
Vilani that they chose to pass up. It was deemed better
to go after the ‘low-hanging fruit’ than to brave the
dangers of a half-molten planet. The system was left
uninhabited until the Rule of Man and even then, only
survey outposts were established on the world. Only
in the year 565 did permanent settlements begin to
appear on Arla Un. There are three types of inhabited
structures on the planet: subterranean, surface and
gravitic. Underground cities have been emplaced in
relatively stable pockets, far away from volcanism
and underground acid oceans. Its surface ‘cities’ are
actually wheeled or tracked platforms that slowly rove
around the planet, while the gravitic habitations float
close to its surface to avoid direct exposure to the
powerful rays of Kir Aikhalingas. Surface and gravitic

cities use a combination of imagery and data collected
by rad-shielded satellites and heat-shielded rovers
and drones to guarantee their safe transit around the
world. With new crevices, river valleys and reservoirs
developing all the time, they must take care to ensure
that there are no surprises in front of them. The
constant movement of living on a mobile platform is
unusual but for the most part, they function as typical
cities complete with all the trappings of a modern, high-
tech civilization. Arla Un has two Class B downports
emplaced in mobile cities, one on tracks and the other
on a gravitic platform. The largest of the cities is a
massive linked caravan of tracked platforms, which
provides housing for over 200,000 people.

The highport is an industrial facility, mostly concerned
with shipping Arla Un’s metals and minerals off planet
and importing the many goods and services that its
citizens need. There is a residential and hospitality
district but for the most part, the highport is quite
utilitarian. The majority of permanent residences are on
(or just above) the planet itself. The world is governed
by the Arla Un Mining Consortium, a federal union
of representatives from its mobile and subterranean
cities, which manages the exploitation of the planet’s
natural resources and acts as a mediator with large,
off-world mining concerns. Megacorporate and sector-
wide corporate mining and resource-extraction firms
have attempted to invest in Arla Un by purchasing local
companies but none have broken ranks thus far. The
Arla Unians are solemnly proud of the way they have
tamed the hostile environment of their homeworld and
have an almost nationalistic fervour when it comes to
their independence.

Bright-Side Crawler

As much as they might try to avoid it, there are times
when a mission to the bright side of Arla Un is necessary.
The bright-side crawler is just the vehicle for the job. The
crawler is designed to withstand the intense heat of Arla
Un’s beaming blue-white subgiant star and can transport
a crew of six (one driver and five passengers) across the
bright face in safety. Arla Un’s mercurial landscape requires
caution, so the crawler is outfitted with top-notch sensory
and navigation systems. Its satellite uplink provides
constant and secure communications with the world’s
roving cities and starports.

Dudin
The society of Dudin is what many citizens of the
Imperium would consider an industrial dystopian
nightmare. However, its people are by and large
quite content with their lives. Dudinian culture is
an extremist version of the Vilani caste system,
made possible by large-scale cloning and genetic
engineering. In traditional Vilani culture, individuals
may choose their caste wherein they are apprenticed
to a master who teaches them to perform a
specialized task or skill. On Dudin, caste decisions
are made by the Executive Bureaux, the bureaucratic
institution that runs the planet and whose processes
and procedures are remarkably similar to those of
Makhidkarun, the Vilani megacorporation that once
ruled this region of space during the reign of the era
of the Ziru Sirka. While the influence of Makhidkarun
is obvious to those familiar with the company, the
origins of Dudin’s rather unique application of its
culture and techniques has been lost in the annals
of time. Dudin’s current modus operandi has been
practiced since the dark ages of the Long Night.

Dudin strictly manages its population to ensure
that there are approximately 60 billion inhabitants
to work in its millions of factories. These factories
range anywhere from massive industrial complexes,
to small fabricators or home-based businesses. The
planet itself is not easily habitable with only a very
thin and tainted atmosphere and 80 percent of its
surface covered in frozen water. Virtually all of its
people live in arcologies or orbital habitats where
they are packed in like lemmings. Over the centuries,
Dudinians have been conditioned to live comfortably
in such an environment. Furthermore, the nucleus
accumbens, amygdala and prefrontal cortex of their
brains have been altered to require less dopamine
to achieve feelings of happiness and satisfaction.
The result has been that no matter what their
vocation, Dudians are almost universally content
with what they do. When they are not engaged in
labour, Dudinians become involved with a number
of simple pastimes that unaltered humans would
find trite or even boring. These activities enable
them to comfortably operate in a society that offers
little opportunity for upward mobility and requires
them to engage in repetitive labour, day in and

day out. Ironically, the primary products that they
produce are electronics for complex and extravagant
entertainment equipment that is used throughout
the Core and beyond. Dudinians would find such
devices overly stimulating, possibly even causing
them physical pain. They prefer the simplicity of low-
tech artistic, hobbyist or gaming pastimes that do not
threaten to overload their pleasure centres.

While most live solitary lives, there are also families
on Dudin, married couples who have children just
like anywhere else in Imperial space; however, once
born, children are subjected to a litany of genetic
engineering procedures to ensure they ‘meet the
standards’ of the Executive Bureaux. More often
than not, they do; after all, the vast majority of them
were born to Dudinian parents and ancestors who
were genetically treated themselves. The Executive
Bureaux does not actively encourage families since
they do not need to. If the population ever drops off,
they can manufacture as many clones as necessary
to fill labour shortages. The larger factories use some
degree of automation but the system is mostly based
on human labour, not robotic. Most tasks performed
by robots are those that are exceptionally dangerous
or require greater strength or force.

Genetic mutations occasionally occur that make
random Dudinians resistant or unsuitable for
conditioning. These individuals are deported to a
nearby world where they are allowed to live out their
normal, decidedly non-Dudinian lives. Eugenics
are not practiced on Dudin. The elderly are allowed
to age and remain a part of society, living out a
comfortable, if dull, retirement; however, little in the
way of healthcare is provided for them. Once their
utility to the Bureaux has expired, Dudinian society
sees little value in investing much to keep them alive.

Sanches
Sanches is a moon of the gas giant, Eniiluim. The gas
giant is tidally locked with system primary, Khaslar,
and Sanches is tidally locked to Eniiluim. However,
Sanches orbits the gas giant once every 48.3 hours,
giving it with a reasonably standard day-to-night cycle
when light from Khaslar is not obscured by Eniiluim
itself. Sanches’ proximity to Eniiluim and its other
Sanches

moons give the world complex tidal effects. Sanches
is a cold world but not terribly so, except when in the
shadow of Eniiluim. Its inhabitants can spend time
outdoors with only a light covering during its ‘summer’,
which occurs every few weeks because of Eniiluim’s
rapid orbit around Khaslar. Sanches is the beneficiary
of extensive terraforming that occurred during the
brief reign of the Rule of Man. The world’s atmosphere
was thickened and its hydrosphere enhanced by
bombarding it with icy planetoids and cometary bodies
in what were then desolate regions of the planet.

Sanches is run by a highly fluidic governmental
structure in which its leading 25 corporations submit
government officers to a body called the Board of
Designates. The factors that constitute a leading
corporation are many and coalesced by a complex
algorithm. Profits are the key factor but consistency,
public sentiment, fame, tradition, altruism and other
factors are considered as well. The makeup of
the board can shift from day-to-day – sometimes
hour-to-hour – which results in transition times
that humans, even with cybernetic enhancements,
robotic assistance, expert programs, high-speed
transportation and other technological aids are
not always capable of making. For this reason,
the ruling corporations have AI designates who
take interim control on their biological designate’s
behalf. The period of interim control can be as little
as a few seconds to several days, depending on
the circumstances. The bottom rungs of the board
are often held by corporate executives who do not
believe they will have the position for long and
therefore abstain from voting or participating in
board events until their position has solidified or they
lose it to the next designate. Others have jockeyed
themselves into positions for months, sometimes
even years, to have the opportunity to obtain a board
position. It is sometimes considered to be a strategic
move to allow one’s AI to occupy the position for a
number of days or weeks in order to befuddle the
competition. The top 11 board positions have been
held by the same corporations for over a decade,
although their order has shifted considerably. A
tremendous amount of prestige is held by those
designates who occupy the top five spots.

Artificial intelligence is anathema to most Vilani-
influenced cultures but Sanches is a unique world.
It was annexed by the Terrans late in the Interstellar
Wars, oppressed by military rule for centuries and
was the capital of a Solomani-dominated pocket
empire during much of the Long Night. Even today,
the more conservative governments of the Core
chide Sanches for its willing enablement of AI for
such an important role but it seems to work for them.
The unique governmental structure establishes
a kind of order that only a Sanchesian can truly
appreciate. To outsiders, who cannot see the waves
of change coming, events on Sanches appear to
be unbridled chaos. For example, one day a given
orbital starport might have access to certain services
and resources and the next day it will not, all based
on the fortunes of its parent company. Educated
Sanchesians can see these changes coming and
wisely invest their time and effort into facilities
controlled by consistent board members and typically
do not waste their time on the mercurial fortunes
of corporations likely to lose their designations.
Bottom-rung designates are known to offer certain
complimentary services to help solidify their
positions; therefore, by speculating on who the lower
tier will be, one can obtain free refuelling and other
services if they time the market right. The futures
market in the corporations ranked 26–50 is always
active with investors striving to pick the eventual
winners. One might make a fortune by buying the
stock of a corporation just before they acquire a long-
term position on the board.

The Imperial Navy and Scout Service both have
bases in the system. Each service has administrative
and recruiting offices on Sanches’ highport and
downport but also have more extravagant bases on
other satellites of Eniiluim. The main scout base is
on the virtually airless rockball moon, Daashadkiu, a
distant natural satellite known for its numerous active
geysers, which spout methane effluvium high into
its trace atmosphere. The naval base is an artificial
satellite, a massive spherical structure that orbits the
gas giant approximately 100,000km from Sanches.

# MEKEE

Mekee is a sparsely populated subsector marked by
two stellar chasms and no fewer than eight small stellar
clusters, each of which is referred to as a ‘county’
by the vacant office of the subsector duke. Mekee’s
previous duke was killed in a duel with a high-ranking
member of the peerage from Fornast. Duelling is
frowned upon in the Core but reversion to the barbaric
practice still occurs from time-to-time. Duels must be
sanctioned by the Emperor and attended by an Imperial
observer, and this only after a lengthy bureaucratic
process and a great deal of paperwork is completed.
The process typically takes 6–9 months. The hope
is that by making the code duello cumbersome and
inconvenient, cooler heads will ultimately prevail and
the whole thing will be called off. It usually works quite
well but it obviously failed as far as the Duke of Mekee
was concerned.

The subsector is now managed by the eight nobles
who represent each of the counties. In truth, most
of Mekee’s clusters are far too small to warrant the
assignment of a count so several are barons and
knights. By Imperial law the duke’s heir should have
succeeded him as subsector duke but the ducal family
had been besmirched by scandal and the Emperor
temporarily suspended their patent. The leading nobles
of each county come to Ushra once every 100 days
in order to manage the subsector’s affairs. It is rare
that all eight can make it to the meeting every time,
so the rules have recently been adjusted so that a
quorum is declared if six are present, although there is
little administration to be done. Mekee is a disparate
collection of small fiefs that have little in common with
one another and it seems to get along just fine without
a large degree of oversight. Nevertheless, rules are
rules and the peers of the realm have obligations.

The most significant system in the subsector by far is
Depot, which provides personnel, training, berthing and
maintenance services for the Core Sector Fleet. The
world of Depot Prime – or Uugnii, as the Vilani called
it – is theorized to have been terraformed but never
settled by the Ancients. Perhaps even more fascinating
are the ruins of a multi-world civilization on Adguu Uun,
Guun and Mukiid. There is a body of evidence that
indicates these may be the remnants of a species that

originated on one of the three worlds and reached the
other two by sublight spacecraft. None of the artefacts
that have been found appear to be of human origin and
they are too recent to have been built by the Ancients
who vanished approximately 300,000 years ago. The
ruins on Mukiid have been reasonably well preserved
but archaeologists are still uncertain about many
things, including what caused this multi-world species
to disappear from the galactic scene.

Most traffic from the Core subsector does not flow
through Mekee, unless it is naval traffic making its
way to Depot or scout ships travelling to the IISS way
station on Ushra. Mekee is a backwater and traversing
it is difficult for most civilian starships so most simply
go around rather than through it. Merchants generally
avoid Mekee like the plague, preferring instead to ply
the Sylean Main to rimward or the Quadrant I Main to
coreward. The only reliable commercial traffic through
the subsector are bulk freighters from the Achenaar
Antilles line, which keeps its worlds supplied with the
goods that they need.

The Imperial Navy 3rd Fleet, headquartered at
Muskoxah, has only three squadrons but a large
number of auxiliary ships, mostly fleet couriers used
to carry news rapidly to Capital from the spinward
subsectors of the Core and beyond. Two of the
squadrons are typical BatRons, which patrol the
subsector when not otherwise engaged and one
TankRon, stationed at Gipkikhar, which is present to
lend assistance to fleet elements making their way
outward from the Core subsector.

Coppelia
Coppelia is the site of Research Station Gamma,
which was founded in 882. An initial eight-person team
was put in place to study the anomalous gravity field
of the system mainworld. While most of the planet has
a consistent 0.45G, regions of Coppelia, ranging in
size from 10,000 to 500,000 square kilometers, have
been seen to fluctuate from 0.3 to 0.7G. These gravitic
disturbances last anywhere from a few seconds to
several hours after which the region slowly returns to
the median 0.45G.

As so often happens with unexplained scientific
phenomena, the public suspects that the Ancients must
be involved. A great deal of their technology was so
advanced and was developed by a culture so different
than that of Humaniti that the assumption is natural.
However, there is no hard evidence that the Ancients
had anything to do with the world’s gravitic anomalies.
No actual Ancients sites have been discovered on
Coppelia and none of the other tell-tale signs of their
passing are present.

The research team was eventually expanded to 50
and a small downport was built for the scientists with a
single landing pad large enough to dock a spacecraft
of up to 100 tons. There is no highport at Coppelia
but there are several satellites in place to measure

gravitic disturbances from orbit. In addition, one or
more scientific craft are often present, usually Type-L
laboratory ships that are uniquely suited for the study of
such phenomena.

Depot
Depots are the focal points of the Imperial Navy
base system. There is one Depot per sector (except
at Delphi, where there are two, and the Spinward
Marches, where there are none). Depots contain
massive shipyards and maintenance facilities,
support services, administration centres, housing and
recreation facilities, technical services and training
grounds for naval personnel.

###### MEKEE subsector

The system mainworld of the Depot system is called
Depot Prime. Depot Prime is special because it is a
world that was touched by the Ancients. While there
are no Ancients sites present in the system per se,
they left their indelible mark on the planet. Hundreds
of thousands of years before this world was named
Uugnii by the Vilani, it was terraformed by the Ancients.
Extensive research has revealed that it was once
a large rockball world from the outer system. The
Ancients somehow moved it into the habitable zone,
made its core spin to give it an electromagnetic field
that it previously lacked, got it rotating so that it has
a 36.7-hour day and brought in enough water to
cover it with oceans and gases to give it a standard
atmosphere. Scientists theorize that the project was
incomplete. Evidence indicates that they may have
been preparing to thicken the atmosphere further and
activate tectonic plates so islands might emerge out
of the ocean depths. Perhaps the Final War of the
Ancients interrupted the project or maybe they just
moved on, leaving the world unfinished. Whatever the
case may be, they somehow managed the titanic task
of creating a spinning, habitable world where there
once was none.

Vilani priests believed the world was sacred and
prevented large numbers of people from colonising it.
The religion that protected Uugnii died out during the
Long Night, leaving a remnant population behind. After
rediscovering the world, the Imperium relocated the
survivors so they could claim it for their own and make
it into the first Depot of the Imperial Navy.

Depot system is the headquarters of the Core Sector
Fleet. Most Sector Fleet assets are deployed elsewhere
but a number of its battleships and dreadnoughts are
always present in the system, even in peacetime. It is
also the home of the Depot Fleet, which consists of
three sections:

•  Training Fleet – Formed of ships of the line
that have been brought to Depot to train naval
personnel in their use. Every type of ship in
service to the Imperial Navy is present at one
time or another. Training Fleet ships are on
loan from both the Sector Fleet and numbered
fleets, and typically return to service after a
designated period of time. Common classes of
ship (for example, mid-size cruisers) may see
extended duty in the Training Fleet and remain
in system for months or even years, as required.
The Training Fleet also contains Adversary
Squadrons, ships designated to play the role
of enemy ships in training exercises. In most
cases, these are Imperial Navy ships outfitted
with weaponry, software and other elements to
make them resemble enemy ships as best they
can. In other cases, these are actual captured
enemy spacecraft refitted for training purposes.
Assignment to an Adversary Squadron is highly
desired by members of the officer corps. Some
of the most battle-ready officers of the line
learned their craft by having served aboard the
‘enemy ships’ of an Adversary Squadron.
•  Mothball Fleet – The last stop for many of the
navy’s starships is the Depot Mothball Fleet.
Ships are brought to one of Depot’s maintenance
hangars for a thorough inspection, given
preservative treatment and then designated
for one of the following: refit and reassignment
to a colonial or reserve fleet, the breaker yard
to be disassembled for scrap, equipped with
automation and used as targets in live-fire
exercises or storage at one of several auxiliary
facilities on one of the other planets or planetoid
belts in Depot system. Assignment to storage
usually means the navy is uncertain about quite
what they want to do with the ship and that it
requires more time to make the decision.

TRAVELLER

•  Security Fleet – The alert and highly active
Security Fleet defends Depot from all possible
dangers. This fleet consists of system defence
boats, jump-capable early-warning squadrons,
decommissioned battle riders that function
essentially as large SDBs and armored
planetoid monitors. The latter are composed of
planetoids drawn from Depot’s two belts and
include some absolutely massive specimens.
Depot-PM1A is a 1.5-million ton buffered
planetoid, equipped with a top-of-the-line
meson spinal mount. The planetoid is bristling
with dozens of bays and turret weaponry as
well. This and other planetoid monitors also
contain multiple fighter wings.

Hundreds of space stations orbit Depot Prime and
sit perched in its Lagrange Points. Most of these are
hangars for Imperial Navy spacecraft and shipyards
where the largest naval starships are built. Some
stations are reserved for training purposes and contain
simulators, vacc suit and EVA training grounds and
zero-G firing ranges.

The navy’s primary administration, personnel and
training facilities are on the surface of Depot Prime.
While the world has no land masses to speak of, it does
have many sea mounts that approach the surface of its
oceans. The navy has built structures on these natural
formations, most of which jut from beneath the ocean
surface in domes and spires. The largest of these
facilities is Depot Prime Downport, which includes an
extensive surface area to land and dock naval starships
and small craft. Depot Prime is also heavily laden with
defensive structures ranging from missile batteries and
point defence lasers both on its primary structures and
on floating artificial islands scattered throughout its
oceans. There are also multiple deep-site meson guns
implanted at confidential and highly secure locations
beneath the ocean floor.

Life at Depot Prime can be a pleasant experience
during peacetime. While there is always work to be
done, shore duty is also a time to take a break from
long tours aboard a naval starship. Living in one of the
world’s many residential districts or artificial islands,
one might even forget they were in the navy if not for

the uniforms, flyovers and the blinking lights of the
shipyards and space stations in the night sky. Extensive
recreational facilities are present for naval personnel
on liberty and all sorts of entertainments and services
are available. Over the centuries, the oceans have
been stocked with fish and other sea life and fishing
excursions are a favorite pastime.

Despite the languorous aura at such facilities, the navy
does its best to ensure productivity and engagement
among its staff with frequent reminders that a return
to active duty is never far away. Peacetime or not,
naval Depots must be ever vigilant in spite of the fact
that large-scale wars are few and far between. Should
the Imperium ever go to war, its Depots will become
contested battlegrounds.

Sher
The Sher system was virtually uninhabited until the
early years of the Third Imperium when it became
host to the Core’s largest prison system. There are
several facilities, each designed to house criminals of
various stripes, from organised crime bosses to mass
murderers. The prisons are reserved only for those
who have broken Imperial law or severe violations of
subsector and planetary laws with a sentence of life
without parole. All of the prison facilities on the planet
are located in the murky nitrogen soup of its lower
atmosphere. Some are subterranean and others are
bunkers half submerged in rocky plains and valleys.
Stepping outside without the aid of an environment suit
brings about a quick death as cold nitrogen replaces
oxygen in the lungs, causing asphyxiation. As if the
environment alone were not sufficient to prevent
escape attempts, the prisons use high-technology
surveillance and access systems to monitor and limit
each prisoner’s every move.

The civilian population of the planet are housed in
cities on the planet’s mountains and plateaus, where
the atmosphere is a breathable oxygen-nitrogen mix.
Workers take the high-speed maglev train to work in
the dismal prison facilities below. There is no naval
base in the Sher system but the navy does have an
administrative office on the planet, which reports to the
base on Temra. Temra provides offworld management
of the prison planet and supplies its civilian personnel.

## CORE

Core is home to Capital, the world where the Emperor
of the Third Imperium sits upon the Iridium Throne.
Because of their proximity to Capital, the worlds of the
Core subsector are scrutinised closely and modifications
are made when it is deemed that the safety of Capital is at
stake. Some of these alterations are subtle and some are
blunt. Unrequested surveillance software might be added
to a starport security system or the Imperial Guard might
drop troops onto a world where trouble is suspected.
While the Imperium is not shy about doing what it must
to protect Capital, it tries to do so with a soft touch – or
at least the appearance of one. One of the credos of
Imperial rule is to defend the space between worlds
without applying a heavy hand to local politics. Individual
worlds are left to their own devices as long as they do
not break Imperial law, allowing for a broad range of
social and political variation. This is also true in the Core
subsector but the Imperium does have its security to think
about. As with any powerful polity, there are those who
would do it harm if they could and the Imperium pulls out
all the stops to defend the Emperor.

Most of the worlds of the Core subsector understand their
unique place in the Imperium and tolerate a more intrusive
government presence. Capital does what it can to remind
them how unique and important they are. The fact that
there are a number of Sylean worlds goes a long way to
ensure a cooperative environment. The Syleans were
largely responsible for the success of the Third Imperium
and those with Sylean blood are especially proud of their
part in its history and more willingly submit to the higher
level of scrutiny.

Core contains 11 of the 25 worlds that form the Sylean
Worlds cultural zone. These worlds were settled by
pureblood Syleans and people of mixed Sylean blood
after the formation of the Third Imperium and were
casually referred to as ‘the Sylean Worlds’ long before
they acquired the official designation. During the Civil
War, the Moot refused to endorse many of the pretenders
who laid claim to the throne. Naval battles were fought
in Capital and other nearby star systems. The Sylean
Worlds called upon the Imperial Navy’s 1st and 4th Fleets
to protect Capital and the heart of the Imperium. The Moot
waited for a proper candidate to appear and, for a time,
the Sylean worlds became an autonomous region. To
a degree, this event inoculated the rest of the Imperium
from the chaos of the Civil War. The move localised the
conflict and enabled the remainder of the Imperium to

carry on, unaffected by events on Capital. The region was
later converted into an official cultural zone to harbour
and preserve Sylean culture and serve as a reminder that
when things get tough, the Imperium closes ranks and
safeguards its capital.

The subsector has two reserve worlds, Lectorsen and
Crompton. Lectorsen’s unique twilight-band jungles
caught the interest of Emperor Martin II, an avid naturalist
who made it an Imperial protectorate and emplaced a
soft interdiction to strictly control access to the planet.
The world’s extensive staff of administrative and wildlife
maintenance professionals carefully cultivate the planet
to preserve its pristine state. With a far smaller staff,
Crompton has been reserved as a playground for the
Imperial family and other high-ranking nobles who come
for rest and recreation. Crompton’s hardy ecosphere is
stocked with game from throughout the Imperium. Its staff
conducts, extensive safaris for the world’s guests, during
which they may hunt or simply observe its animals.

There is a cultural rift between the Sylean Worlds and
a group known as the Wayward Worlds. The Wayward
Worlds are not an official district or cultural zone but do
have a unique place in history that has some carryover
to modern times. These were the worlds that were part of
the Sylean Federation at the dawn of the Third Imperium
but chose to reject the offer of membership in the fledgling
empire. Cleon Zhunastu accepted this betrayal with
aplomb but ultimately acquired these worlds over time.
In truth, they had no choice. As the Imperium grew, the
Wayward Worlds became increasingly isolated and were
ultimately forced to accept Imperial membership. It is
said that time heals all wounds and such is the case with
the Wayward Worlds. The descendants of the traitorous
powers who rejected Cleon’s advances no longer pay for
the sins of their ancestors; however, the schism did result
in a distinct, non-Sylean culture that is still evident among
these worlds to this day.

In spite of its high security, the Core subsector is part of
a vibrant trade route: the Sylean Main, which includes
all of the Wayward Worlds, several of the Sylean Worlds
extending into Kaskii, along the coreward flanks of Chant
and Cemplas, and ultimately broadens to include most
of the systems in Bunkeria before wending its way into
the neighboring Dagudashaag Sector. Most of these
subsectors are lightly populated, so the Sylean Main
is not as lucrative as those found in heavily populated

TRAVELLER

sectors like Massilia or Ilelish. Savvy traders contend that
any shortcomings the Sylean Main may have are more
than made up for by the sheer quantity of development
opportunities present. While Capital has always sought
to avoid becoming directly involved in the affairs of its
worlds, it has been somewhat of an embarrassment that
the trade main upon which it sits is so utterly provincial
and underdeveloped. There are those among the nobility
and megacorporate community who seek to change that.

The Core subsector is defended by the hallowed 1st Fleet,
which is headquartered on Capital itself with squadrons
spread throughout the subsector. The fleet consists
of eight full squadrons including five BatRons, two
AssaultRons and a TankRon to assist with deployments
and training exercises. The Core’s Subsector Fleet is
supported by large elements of the Sector Fleet, which
are rotated into service in the subsector regularly. In
addition to its many bases, there is the Imperial Marine
Training Centre on Codsen, a rough outpost with a
challenging environment where marines are trained in
the arts of survival. The system has not been assigned
a base symbol on purpose; only barebones housing and
other facilities are present, which hint at the challenging
environment that lies before trainees.

The Wayward Worlds
At the dawn of the Third Imperium, Cleon Zhunastu’s
appeal to the worlds of the Sylean Federation were
not accepted by all. Thirteen worlds initially rejected
membership in the new Imperium. Cleon managed to
convince six of them to reconsider only to see three flip-
flop once again shortly after his coronation. Only eight
of the original Sylean worlds accepted roles as founding
systems of the new empire outright. The founding worlds
were Kiiri (now Nesdo), Lauursha (Shudusham), Khash
(Rhylea), Laairer (Rib), Idmum (Ercan), Gikuu (Codsen),
Kuunen Ish (Yirsh Poy) and of course Sylea itself,
which became Capital. The Syleans had deep cultural
resentment of the Vilani after a millennium of oppression
and were quick to shed the Vilani names of most of their
worlds. Only Shudusham, which had already changed
its name shortly after being contacted by the Sylean
Federation, retained its name largely due to the presence
of such a large Vilani population.

The Wayward Worlds were Unrair (now Thass), Unkuu
(Balpan), Irurk (Ankod), Aggii Ganaan (Ploiqu), Irmap Muu
(Traak), Nirinirk (Crompton), Bala (Morii), Zuarkri (Ion) and
Kain (Onon). Many of these worlds retained their original
names for many years before being renamed one-by-one
in an attempt to shed the burden of their traitorous past.

**CORE**

###### CORE subsector

Ankod
Reverently referred to as the ‘Gateway to Capital’,
Ankod is a key stop on the route into the subsector
from Vland and Lishun. The Imperial Navy base
at Ankod has a partnership with universities on
neighboring Knabbib to develop security technology
that provides a protective cordon for Capital and
the subsector at large. Naval astronomers and
technologists come to Ankod to work on the ultra-
secret Project Shortbow at its secure training and
development facilities.

Ankod is a key stop on the Annililik Run (for more on
this epic event, see The Annililik Run on page 120)
and has hospitality facilities for millions of visitors
who come to see the thousands of racing ships en
route either to or from Vland. When not providing
lodging and entertainment for fans of the race, the
government subsidizes these facilities, using them
to provide free housing for visiting traders and other
Travellers. Ankod also provides complimentary
refuelling for ships in the sub-1,000-ton range and a
60 percent discount for those larger than that. Ankod
is a gas-giant moon and runs a fleet of skimming
drones that extract hydrogen from the gas giant for
processing at its refineries. This generosity is a big
expense but is more than paid for by the increased
trade that it brings to the system, which is near the
terminus of the Sylean Main.

Capital
Capital is the seat of government of the Third Imperium
and home to both the Emperor – who resides at the
Grand Palace of Arbellatra – and members of the
peerage, who assemble at the Moot Spire.

Capital is a pleasant world with a varied climate,
oceans that cover almost two thirds of its surface
and a dense atmosphere of a suitable oxygen-
nitrogen mix. The residents of Capital have gotten
used to the density of its air over time but the
atmospheric pressure at high levels of elevation
are more comfortable for un-adapted humans. The
world has five continents and many large islands and
archipelagos. Its system primary is Zan Ki Ond, a
type-G2 main sequence star, nearly identical to that
of Terra in size and luminosity. However, Capital’s
slightly closer proximity to the star has made the
world marginally hotter, giving it a large temperate
zone with immense rainforests and river valleys. Its
subtle 18o axial tilt results in consistent weather. The
interaction of its dense atmosphere and star produces
some extreme weather effects including strong inland

storms and hurricanes along the coasts. Technology
is used to mitigate meteorological effects to ensure
a pleasant and fruitful stay for visitors to the world.
Capital has two small moons, neither of which are
near enough to create significant tidal forces. Despite
its middling size, Capital has higher-than-expected
gravity at 0.69G due to its thin mantle and larger-than-
normal nickel-iron core.

The world’s 20 billion inhabitants are well-distributed
among its land masses and oceans, with residential
arcologies located mostly in the coastal regions, but
several cities are in its mountain ranges and oceans
as well. Cleon’s residential zones are home to 450
million people, which does not take into account the
millions of visiting dignitaries, diplomats, business
people and tourists who are present at any given time.
Travellers may be surprised to discover that Intell is
actually Capital’s largest city with a total population of
562 million citizens living within its urban sprawl. The
city of Intell is where Capital’s primary administrative
centres and light industry are located. It is often said
that while the heart of Capital is Cleon, its mind is
at Intell. Despite the fact that Capital has 20 billion
sophonts living on its surface and orbital habitats,
judicious use has been made of its available land.
Large expanses of territory have been restored to their
original states, including millions of hectares of jungle,
open plains and mountains. Most of these regions
have been inhabited at one point or another during
Capital’s long history but have been painstakingly
returned to their original condition.

Capital was once known as Sylea and has been
inhabited by humans for hundreds of thousands of
years. The Syleans, a human Minor Race, were seeded
on the world by the Ancients. After thousands of years
of intermixing with Vilani, Solomani and other human
subspecies, there are few genetically pure Syleans
remaining. However, there are some Sylean populations
that have preserved their genetic and cultural identities,
mostly those who maintained an isolated existence
in the mountain ranges of its third-largest continent.
Nevertheless, one will find billions of people on Capital
who claim Sylean heritage, many of whom proudly
participate in cultural events, traditions and religious
rituals that were practiced by their ancestors.

Capital is well defended with three full BatRons
present in the system at all times. The planet is also
defended by squadrons of smaller system-defence
spacecraft, dozens of orbital batteries of lasers and
missiles, particle weapons, ground-based aerial
defences and deep-site meson guns. Capital makes
more of an effort than most worlds to conceal its

defences. While the Imperium wants its capital to be
safe, it does not want to project the image that it is a
militarised bunker anticipating attack.

The most popular destinations on Capital are in
Cleon, where tourists go to see its many museums,
shopping districts, the Grand Plaza of Heroes and
the palace grounds where they can see the lofty Moot
Spire, Cleon’s Tomb, the Crescent Lake (where the
second Imperial Palace crash landed during the Civil
War) and of course the Grand Palace of Arbellatra
itself and its attending structures: Paulo’s Annex,
Tomutov’s Palace and the Trinary Consortium. Visitors
of a more academic bent go to the Imperial Archives
where thousands of original documents and scholarly
works are on display. There are many more popular
destinations throughout the world and elsewhere in
the system. War history aficionados make pilgrimages
to the gas giant Zhimaway where retired capital ships
perform re-enactments of Arbellatra’s famous battle
for control of the planet.

The Grand Palace of Arbellatra
The Grand Palace is a grandiose structure, a tribute
to the magnificence and power of the Imperium. At
39-million tons and one kilometer in diameter, the sheer
enormity of the palace never ceases to amaze visitors.
The palace was completed in 633 after four years of
construction. It is suspended half a kilometer from
the surface of Capital by a ring of gravitic suspensors
emplaced below the grounds of the Imperial Park. The
palace itself has backup gravitic drives within its hull
but should they ever be required, they have limited
power and can only keep it aloft for a short period of
time before they must gently set it down.

Defences include four deep meson bays, eight
particle accelerator bays, eight missile launcher bays
and eight point-defence lasers. The palace is also
protected with a thick layer of bonded superdense
armor, nuclear dampers, meson screens and radiation
shielding. To top it off, the entire structure is psionicly
shielded to prevent any form of telepathic intrusion.
The airspace within 100km of the palace is strictly
controlled by security technicians within the palace and
in subterranean control structures below the grounds.
This impressive array of defences is concealed from
public view. It is of the utmost importance that the seat
of Imperial power not be seen as a fortified bunker.
Shields and weapons – while necessary – show
trepidation. The Emperor strives to convey confidence
and power. The palace does all that and more.

The central shaft of the palace contains the
Imperial Gardens and aquarium, each of which are
approximately 400 meters deep and contain flora
and fauna from places throughout the Imperium.
Along the equator is a 25-meter wide promenade that
encircles the entire palace sphere. The promenade
has walkways, a tram and a narrow highway for
small vehicles. Its inner wall is adorned with scenes
from Imperial history. Speaking of history, the current
Emperor has access to the Hall of Wisdom, where he
may speak with artificially intelligent simulations of all
previous Emperors.

The throne room of the Grand Palace is a spacious
octagonal room that is adjacent to the Imperial
Residence. The Emperor entertains his most esteemed
visitors in this room. The hallowed Iridium Throne was
built by Cleon Zhunastu himself and is one of the few
surviving artefacts from the first palace.

The Grand Palace of Arbellatra is attended by several
smaller floating gravitic structures, including the
following: the Consortium Trinary, which is a trio of
small spheres, each of which contains a museum with
exhibits dedicated to the three Imperiums; Paulo’s
Annex, a pleasure palace that contains all sorts of
entertainments and is often used for sporting events;
and Tomutov’s Palace, which is used to house
esteemed guests of the Emperor.

Onon
Onon is an inhospitable world originally settled by
the Vilani over 5,000 years ago. Among the planet’s
many imposing features are high winds of over 350
kilometers per hour, acid rain and poisonous gas
clouds emitted from porous and cracked volcanic
plains. The final straw for the colony may have come
when a violent shifting of the world’s tectonic plates
massively increased the volcanism. So much volcanic
effluvium was emitted into the atmosphere that
Onon was concealed in worldwide dust-cloud cover
for over two centuries. Onon has ample resources
but ultimately proved to be too challenging an
environment to sustain a long-term settlement. The
only colonists who remained were belters who settled
the system’s two planetoid belts. The belts were never
especially rich and were eventually tapped of what
valuable metals they had.

##### GRAND PALACE OF ARBELLATRA

Today, Onon is a lonely and desolate system with
only a few thousand permanent inhabitants. The
world receives few visitors other than an occasional
team of geological researchers. While not technically
an Imperial Reserve, the Emperor does use it as a
solemn refuge from time-to-time in order to get away
from the stresses of managing an empire. Much of
the world’s infrastructure has fallen into ruin and is
being reclaimed by native flora and the elements.
The major Imperial retreat is the central palace and
surrounding government buildings, poised on a sheer
cliff overlooking a scum-choked sea; much of the
surrounding city is also in ruin. An obsidian fortress
has been built for the Emperor on one of Onon’s mid-
size mountains, overlooking a wide basalt plain. Its
stark vistas and noxious black cloud cover make it an
excellent place for brooding and deep contemplation.

Rhylea
Rhylea has a hybrid hydrogen-chloride/carbon
dioxide atmosphere with trace oxygen. The world
does not have much in the way of complex life
forms but does have abundant microbial species
and several hundred types of oceanic algae, coastal
lichens and low-lying shrubbery, which have been
catalogued by naturalists who explored the world in
hostile environment suits. Like most F-type stars,
Rhylea’s primary simply will not have a long enough
lifespan for the world to evolve a broader range of
flora and fauna.

The world was barren until a few centuries ago when
Sylean colonists built a cultural and religious refuge
there. The name of the world means ‘new home’.
The colony is governed by a council of priests,
philosophers and academics and has no law to
speak of. While the facilities are intended for people
of Sylean heritage, non-Syleans are not forbidden
from coming. However, visitors are expected to adopt
the dress, customs and language of ancient Sylea.
The official language is Old Sylean and speaking
Galanglic, Vilani and other languages is discouraged.
Monks at the temple will teach visitors the language
provided they prove their heritage is at least 75
percent Sylean.

The domes and other structures of the colony are
deliberately mid-tech but are ornate, well-designed
and have been built with high-quality materials.
Sylean culture emphasises prosperity and the
acquisition of wealth and it appears that the Rhylean
colony has well-heeled benefactors.

Residents and visitors alike are allowed to explore the
exotic environment of the planet, which they often do.
Vehicles are provided by the colony but many people
opt to simply don an environment suit and go for a
hike. The chlorine in the atmosphere gives it a fumy
green colour and visibility is limited. The colony has
begun to keep close tabs on explorers with tracking
and communications devices after a few expeditions
were lost in the world’s murky mountain ranges.

Shudusham
A water world with only a few small land masses,
Shudusham has been inhabited for thousands of
years dating back to the early expansion period
of the First Imperium. The world, which the Vilani
called Lauursha, was isolated during the Long Night.
Shudusham is rich in natural resources but presents
a challenging environment that requires reasonably
high technology to survive. When the flow of
interstellar trade abruptly came to a halt, many of the
world’s thousands of undersea arcologies floundered
and died. Small groups of cities and in many cases
individual arcologies became isolated city states.
Radio contact was retained and used by oceangoing
ships and submarines but linguistic drift divided the
arcology nations even further.

After being contacted by Sylean scouts, the
Lauurshans eagerly accepted technological aid
and gradually climbed back up the technological
ladder, eventually surpassing their pre-Long Night
level. After recontact, the locals adopted Galanglic
as their primary language but even today, people
from many of the extant arcologies speak a local
dialect as a second language. Lauursha changed
its name to Shudusham, referencing a resurrection
story from Vilani lore often likened to the story of the
phoenix from ancient Terran mythology. Shudushami
resources and industrial output are given a great deal
of credit for fuelling the rise of the Sylean Federation
and its successor, the Third Imperium.

Core

TRAVELLER

For over 700 years, Shudusham has been the site
of the famous Shudusham Robotics Conference.
Held once every 10 years, this year-long conference
attracts academics and technologists from
throughout the Core sector and beyond. New
discoveries, product demonstrations and thousands
of panels are held during the year-long event.
Shudusham was selected to host the event due to
its historical significance. About a century before the
founding of the Third Imperium, terrorists used armed
robots to destroy a Sylean warship at Fornol. Shortly
thereafter, Shudusham hosted the Shudusham
Robotics Concords, which set strict limitations on the
use of robots.

Syroe
Syroe was on the edge of ecological disaster until
Emperor Martin II intervened in the mid-230s.
Syroe, then called Shaaak, was overpopulated and
governed by an agency that sought to develop its
resources as fully as it could with little regard for the
environmental damage it was causing. Its industrial
concerns were producing toxic atmospheric taints,
which threatened the lives of its inhabitants. In
addition, careless development projects had done
a great deal of damage to the world’s surface by
speeding up the erosion of delicate coastal land
masses. Martin could not stomach having such
a collapse occur right on Capital’s doorstep. He
initiated a deindustrialization and emigration program
that sought to reverse the seemingly inevitable
disaster and relocate millions of its most endangered
citizens to the previously undeveloped worlds of Ase,
Uunli (now Umgadin) and Khishnar (now Xalm).

It was a colossal undertaking that took decades to
complete. Using disposable one-shot and two-shot
jump drives, the Shaaaki were transported to their
new homes where they built three new societies, two
of that – Ase and Umgadin – have become industrial
powerhouses. Each had rich planetoid belts which
were mined for the materials they needed to build their
societies. Things have not gone quite as well on Xalm,
which is in environmental freefall but Imperial aid has
been provided in an attempt to reverse its decline.

Syroe is a small, low-gravity world with three
continents and highly unusual geography. Most of
the accessible land on the world is in the form of
high plateaus surrounded by sharp, craggy mountain
ranges at the coasts that appear to jut upwards from
the sea like daggers. At the center of each continent
is a massive caldera, each of which was active
approximately a million years ago but all of which are
dormant now. The largest of the continents actually
has two overlapping calderas but the oldest of the
two seems to have gone dormant many millions of
years before the other. Natural erosion has cut sharp
crevices and canyons into the plateaus, carving them
up with deep river valleys and canyons some of which
descend below sea level where the atmosphere
is considerably denser, nearly reaching a thin
classification. In its oceans, Syroe has two enormous
atolls created by additional calderas but which failed
to reach above the surface of the water. One of the
two is still active and has been bubbling a sulphurous
spume to the surface for centuries but it has not
violently erupted for hundreds of thousands of years.

The placid, stable K-type primary star of the system
is old and the planet has had billions of years to
develop a complex array of life forms. Its distant red
dwarf companion is too remote to have a noticeable
effect on the system mainworld. Imperial Navy and
Scout bases have been present on Syroe since the
early 300s. Emperor Anguistus endowed the world
with a multi-billion Credit grant, which was used to
terraform it back into a more pristine state, a project
which was completed in the early 600s and has been
in maintenance mode ever since.

The syroc is an aerial reptiloid predator that hunts
small- to mid-sized creatures on the surface of
Syroe. An adult syroc measures approximately one
and a half meters from head to tail and its leathery
wings span from three to four meters, ending in
sharp talons. Males and females use their talons
for different purposes. Males use them to establish
mating privileges and females to crack open hard-
shelled or skinned prey for their young to eat and to
ward off males when they are not ovulating. Syrocs
are graceful and precise flyers and are often seen in
flocks of two to five, slicing their way through Syroe’s
canyons. The air above the canyons is too thin to
support their flight capabilities so they are rarely
seen on the plateaus. However, they are occasionally
found on the edge of an escarpment, hopping along
and looking for small prey.

Tiwath
Tiwath is a tidally locked circumbinary planet that
absorbs regular, almost rhythmic stellar flares from
one of the two red dwarf stars that it orbits. The flares,
which occur every 15–18 years, cause immense fires
in the twilight band, virtually levelling its forests and
evaporating seas and marshlands. Without fail, this
event is followed by an upwelling of convection currents
that carry nutrients from the dark side of the planet to
replenish the scorched lands. New trees, foliage and
animal life grow at a miraculous rate and are typically
restored within one to two years.

The people of Tiwath have adapted to this cycle of
creative destruction, moving to deep subterranean
hovels during the flares and taking with them a bounty
of agricultural products grown during the fertile years
between each cycle. They carefully monitor the

progress of the flares while underground and return
to the surface when they are over. The return to the
surface is marked by glorious festivals followed by the
building of new habitations and the planting of new
crops. Tiwathans are avid naturalists and enjoy hiking
into their marshes and forests to watch the wildlife re-
emerge from its dormant state.

Every few centuries, the flare cycle has a ‘hiccup’ of
sorts in which the star breaks its rhythm, producing
shorter or longer flare-and-growth cycles. This presents
enormous challenges for the Tiwathans who gauge the
cycles as precisely as possible. The Imperium routinely
offers assistance during these challenging periods
but has been unequivocally rebuffed thus far. The
Tiwathans see themselves as the blessed custodians
of their world and feel they must take the bad with the
good, even when it means risking their very survival.

Core

# K ASKII

The Kaskii subsector has a low stellar density but
a surprisingly high population. With only 24 star
systems – the fewest in all of the Core – it is home to
the second-highest number of people in the sector,
second only to Saregon. Of Kaskii’s seven high-
population worlds, three are classified as industrial.
Of these, Kaskii and Khuir are models of efficiency;
the other, Markasher, is plagued with problems that
prevent it from becoming one.

Most worlds in the subsector were barely populated
when the Third Imperium was established. It
was a barren and desolate place with only a few
struggling remnant populations that were left over
from the Long Night. There were two reasons why
this changed as rapidly as it did. The first was the
betrayal of the Wayward Worlds. When 10 systems
from the original Sylean Federation refused to join
the fledgling Third Imperium, the Syleans expanded
their presence to trailing of Capital. The second
was the desire of the Syleans to build a cultural
legacy, which they felt they could only do if there
were significantly more Syleans and more worlds on
which they had an enduring presence. While they
were instrumental in the founding of the Imperium,
the Syleans were a tiny minority at its outset. They
embarked upon an aggressive population expansion
project, the fruit of which may be seen in the Kaskii
subsector today. Sylean families were encouraged
to be fruitful and multiply, which they did with great
alacrity, so much so that there are now over 48 billion
Syleans in the subsector.

The Sylean Worlds are thought to be like any other
Imperial worlds until one visits them. Travellers
often note that when they make the jump into the
worlds of the cultural zone, they feel as if they
have left the Imperium for a foreign polity. Others
say that it is more like going through a time warp,
either to a distant past when technology was not so
prevalent or to a utopian future, in which there is
no military presence. The cultural zone does in fact
have many high-tech worlds but the Syleans are
understated when it comes to technology. A key tenet
of their culture is that technology is best when it is
seamlessly integrated into things. Flashy tech takes
away from more important things in life like quiet
contemplation, religious worship, industriousness
and family. Despite the Syleans being devoted to the
Imperium as much as anyone else, one rarely sees
the Imperial Sunburst or similar iconography within
its borders. What one does see is a devotion to
culture. The art, architecture, religions, style of dress
and dominant philosophies of the Sylean Worlds
are distinctly different than those seen outside the
boundaries of the cultural region. Within these
borders, the Syleans are allowed to be Syleans.

There are no navy or scout bases within its borders,
except on two worlds: Capital and Yirsh Poy, both
of which are in the Core subsector. The defence of
the cultural region is left to external star systems
along its borders. It was not always this way. The
Sylean Worlds were as heavily militarised as any
other Imperial world up until the end of the Civil War.
The Emperors of the Flag made the Core and Kaskii
subsectors their own private war zone. The Sylean

leaders allowed the Moot to declare the region an
autonomous state in order to prevent the war from
spreading to the rest of the Imperium. After the war
ended and Arbellatra was declared Regent, the
leadership of the Sylean Worlds held a conference
on Khuir, where they decided as a group that they
would never be used in such a way again. Sylea,
they declared, was instrumental in the formation of
the Imperium and it had been equally important for
its preservation. From then on, it would become a
place of peace.

Because of the demilitarization of the cultural zone,
Kaskii has few military bases. There is only one
scout base and three navy bases. The Imperial
Navy’s 4th Fleet is concentrated on few worlds
but has an active presence in the subsector. Its
personnel are by regulation over three quarters
Sylean and each of its ships are given traditional

Sylean names above the banner of Kaskii, a trio of
three crimson Imperial sunbursts. The sunbursts
represent ‘The Belt of Cleon,’ a constellation of
red giants visible just to coreward, the stars of the
Uungip, Kuuir Am and Kishkeiim systems.

The jury is still out on the Kaskii experiment. While
the Syleans certainly demonstrated they could tame
a barren wasteland, make its worlds prosperous and
whole, and populate them, there is still the question
of what they were trying to prove and to whom. The
Wayward Worlds have long since been annexed
and with the expansion of the Imperium to 11,000
worlds, the Syleans remain a relatively tiny minority.
The debate rages on among historians. While
some dismiss the Sylean Worlds as a civilization
borne from a fit of pique, others applaud them for
expanding their presence, thereby ensuring their
place in history.

**CORE**

###### KASKII subsector

The Chasmata Sylea
Kaskii has two stellar chasms, one to coreward that averages three parsecs in width and another to
rimward that runs four to six parsecs wide. The two are collectively known as the Chasmata Sylea;
the smaller called Chasma Sylea Minor and the larger Chasma Sylea Major. In frontier sectors, such
as the Spinward Marches, stellar voids like these are simply seen as an impediment, an inconvenient
absence of stars that one must circumnavigate. In sectors like the Core, these regions present a threat
to the security of the empire.

In 1056, Solomani supremacists built a secret deep-space outpost one parsec from the Riid Irman
system. The Solomani had acquired several large planetoids from the Riid Irman belt and took them
into the Chasma Sylea Major using disposable jump drives. They intended to accelerate the planetoids
to near-relativistic speeds to impact on Sevan, thereby destroying the world. While the Solomani did
everything they could to maintain the secrecy of their mission, Imperial Naval Intelligence agents
intercepted them in the Shashuua system and prevented the catastrophic event from happening. The
Imperium had long feared that terrorists or insurgent organizations might try something like this, perhaps
with Capital itself as the target. The event resulted in the immediate funding of Project Shortbow, which is
intended to prevent an attack like this from happening.

Because of the threat to security that the Chasmata present, these deep-space regions and others like
them are regularly patrolled by the Imperial Navy and Scout Service. The Imperium has placed dozens
of refuelling caches and space stations in many of the empty parsecs of the Chasmata, although their
exact location is a state secret. Travelling into stellar voids is tricky business. Jump technology relies on
the presence of large gravity wells that are used by astrogators to plot their courses; these are obviously
lacking in deep space. Generally speaking, if one wants to actually find an object that has been planted
in the empty depths of space, it must be equipped with a communications device that broadcasts its
location, lest it be lost. For this reason, bases emplaced in the Chasmata are equipped with sophisticated
equipment that makes them easy to find if one knows where to look.

The methods used to patrol the chasms are not perfect but until Project Shortbow goes online, they will
have to do. Along with the diligent work of the Imperial intelligence agencies, they have thus far averted
a major catastrophe from taking place. Meanwhile, the Imperial Navy has catalogued thousands of deep

When looking at the Core sector, one of its notable
features is a complete lack of Red Zone worlds. A
Red Zone designation indicates that a world or even
entire star system has been interdicted for some
reason. The Core certainly had its share of Red
Zone-worthy worlds at one time but thousands of
years of settlement, terraforming and adaptation has
changed that. Indshiim Ganme was once one of its
Red Zone worlds.

A look at its basic features reveals nothing out of
the ordinary. Indshiim Ganme is roughly Earth-like
in size and atmospheric composition. The majority
of its surface is covered in water and it has only two
small continents and thousands of islands scattered

over its surface. Its primary star is a placid yellow
dwarf, slightly smaller and cooler than Sol. Despite
its seeming habitability, Indshiim Ganme suffers from
a number of unusual characteristics that make it an
extremely challenging environment.

Indshiim Ganme is blanketed by nearly constant
storms with winds that reach up to 1,200 kilometers per
hour, scouring its land masses of all but a few hardy
life forms. The primary factors are its axial tilt of 52o,
rotation period of only six hours and proximity to its
star. The high rotation rate creates a strong Coriolis
effect and dozens of Hadley cells that cause extreme
weather effects. In addition, the world is on the inward
portion of the habitable zone, subjecting it to a high
level of stellar radiation, which accelerates its winds.
Its atmosphere, magnetic field and other factors are

suitable to support life but the added stellar energy
exacerbates the world’s meteorological conditions,
making it difficult for land-based life to exist.

This extreme environment was enough to deter
colonists from settling the planet during the era of
the Ziru Sirka. Solomani settlers also passed it by
during the Rule of Man, opting only to install a space
station in its L4 Lagrange point to serve as a stopover
between the Likhamii, Ispumer and Khiinra Ash
systems. Only in the era of the Third Imperium has
there been an effort to explore the world. In 856, a
Sylean expedition out of Khuir built a space elevator
to the surface of the planet. The primary cable was
built with bonded superdense alloys, making it strong
enough to endure the harsh weather. The exorbitantly
expensive project was a gamble but one which would
pay off if they were able to find and extract resources
from this potentially rich world.

The windswept surface of Indshiim Ganme revealed
little in the way of valuable resources but surveys of
its oceans made startling discoveries. The world is
host to a plethora of advanced life forms, all of which
live just beneath the surface of the water. The most
advanced of these are an intelligent species of filter/
scavengers that inhabit depths of 20–100 meters and
appear to have achieved approximately TL1–2. The
Syleans have named them the Ganmeids. Most of their
structures were built in cavern systems on escarpments
and sea mounts that shielded them from discovery by
orbital probes. An IISS exploration team was brought
in to examine the species but contact has not yet been
made. The expedition eventually became a colony
based at the refurbished Rule of Man-era space station.
No permanent habitations have been established on
the surface of the planet, nor in its waters, but some
resource extraction has occurred. The Scout Service
has petitioned the Syleans to have the world interdicted
but no final decision has yet been made.

Ganmeids are a roughly human-sized water-breathing
species that survive by filtering nutrients from the
turbulent waters near the surface of their oceans and
consuming the carcasses of dead animals found in the
shallows near the coasts and on sea mounts. They
communicate by emitting high-pitched sounds when at
a distance but typically resort to hand signals and other
forms of non-verbal communication when within a few
meters of each other.

Expeditionary Crawler

This hardy tracked vehicle is custom designed to travel
on worlds like Indshiim Ganme. Its treads are spiked
in order to grip the ground and when stopped, it bores
into the ground with an array of anchors to prevent it
from being thrown about by high winds. The crawler is
armored and structurally reinforced to protect it from
windborne projectiles. Accommodations are cramped but
there is enough room for the crew to move around. Bunks,
a fresher and a mini-galley are installed for extended
expeditions. The crawler is segmented into three small
compartments that enable it to navigate crevasses and
deep inclines. The rear compartment is designed to hang at
an angle of up to 90o in order to deposit its mini-submarine
into the ocean over the edge of an escarpment or other
angled surface.

Khiinra Ash
Khiinra Ash is a moon of a circumbinary gas giant called
Khamikurde Anku, which orbits the system’s pair of red
dwarf stars. The two stars have similar mass and they orbit
one another closely. The larger of the two accretes a small
amount of mass from the smaller, making them what is
known as a semidetached binary pair.

Khiinra Ash is a massive moon with a diameter of
nearly 17,000 kilometers and a gravity of 1.9G. It orbits
its gas giant once every 63 hours, exposing both of its
hemispheres to the twin stars of the system, thereby
giving it some semblance of a day-night cycle. The moon
has liquid water oceans, two massive continents and
several hundred islands, some of which are arranged in
long, winding archipelagos. Because of its high gravity,
Khiinra Ash has no large mountain ranges to speak of but
its porous, cracked land masses have enormous canyon
systems, some of which are over 100km in depth. The
atmosphere on the surface is trace but a thin oxygen-
nitrogen atmosphere may be found deep in the canyons.
Not surprisingly, this is also where its complex land-based
life resides. Khiinra Ash is an unlikely candidate to harbour
life and yet it has a teeming biosphere.

At the apex of the world’s life forms are the
Bhu’oovaakaylaa, an immense species that defies strict
definition. The species has two sexes, each of which weigh
about four tons with females slightly larger than males.
They bear live young, usually in litters of two or three,
which are immediately mobile upon birth. Bhu’oovaakaylaa
have a thick, elongated body with rear flippers for
swimming, an armored carapace on their dorsal surface
like that of a crustacean, two dextrous appendages that
end in three fingers with an opposable thumb and a head-
like structure at the front. The head has four eyes that
wrap most of the way around it to provide 270o vision. The
species is omnivorous with a large mouth that contains a
dozen large molar-like teeth to masticate plant food and
sharp incisors in the front to bite off chunks of meat from
animals. The Bhu’oovaakaylaa have an internal bladder
with which they extract gaseous elements from the
atmosphere for various purposes. When filled, the bladder
enables them to float short distances.

The Bhu’oovaakaylaa are classified as a Minor Race
with human-level intelligence. They are currently at
approximately TL2 with some tool manufacturing
that extend to TL3. They are by and large a friendly
species and were initially contacted by Vilani scouts
thousands of years ago. The worldwide population of the
Bhu’oovaakaylaa is difficult to determine but the Scout
Services estimates that there are probably about 12
million of them. The listed population figure for the world
represents only the humans present.

While it is not classified as such, Khiinra Ash
is effectively a reserve, with few humans living
permanently on its surface. The high gravity makes it
uncomfortable for humans but the Bhu’oovaakaylaa
welcome expeditions when they come. When
offered Red Zone status, they declined. They are a
philosophical species and while few have ever left
the planet – due to their size and highly specified
adaptations – they welcome the idea that they
are members of an interstellar community. The
Bhu’oovaakaylaa enjoy speaking with visitors of all
races, learning more about them and engaging in
spirited debates. They speak in deep bellows and
communication with them is loud and ponderous. They
are a long-lived species, with an average lifespan of
over 300 years and they seem to be in no hurry to rush
through a conversation.

Khiinra Ash Highport is a serviceable and friendly
facility but its technology is outdated. The staff see
themselves as ambassadors to the Bhu’oovaakaylaa
civilization and are helpful to offworlders, for whom
they maintain a selection of high-G apparatuses and
exoskeletons to make wandering the surface of Khiinra
Ash more comfortable.

Markasher
The mainworld of the Markasher system is not a
planet at all but simply one of the larger planetoids
of its two belts, Markasher α (the inner belt) and
Markasher β (the outer belt). This ‘world’ is fortuitously
located in a less dense region between the two belts
where collisions are rare. Most of the system’s actual
terrestrial planets are far into the outer zone of the
system’s orange giant star, Kalyptus. This star is
well on its way along the red giant branch and will
one day swell to enormous size, consuming both
belts. Fortunately for Markasher’s residents, this will
not occur for many millions of years. The system
has no gas giants so there are no ready sources for
wilderness refuelling.

Markasher’s rich belts have been exploited for
centuries by the Conglomerate, a collection of mostly
Sylean mining concerns whose leadership positions
are passed on hereditarily or by the appointment of
the previous owner. Markasheri mining ‘clans’ work in

concert to extract the resources from the belts that are
needed to build infrastructure for the high-population
worlds of the Kashii subsector. Thousands of hollowed-
out planetoids contain a variety of habitats, few of
which have artificial gravity. In most cases, these
planetoids have been given spin to simulate gravity but
in others the belters live in low- or zero-G environments
for their entire lives, which has an adverse effect on
their health. Most of their maladies – muscle atrophy
and osteoporosis, to name a few – can be treated
with exercise, intervals spent in higher G and modern
medicine but the austere Conglomerate does little to
provide treatment. Aid groups from Mikhag Kuu have
come to the system to purchase abandoned planetoid
habitations, which they intend to outfit with artificial
gravity so they can be used to provide ‘regeneration
intervals’ for the Markasheri. The self-reliant
government is not pleased with this development, as it
could create unrest among the masses who might start
to demand such services.

Inhabited planetoids are fitted with surveillance
equipment that closely monitors the activities of
Markasheri citizens, although allegedly this is only
present to monitor the traffic of sublight mining barges
and other spacecraft. Abnormalities in traffic and the
movement of mineral payloads are watched closely to
prevent claim jumping and smuggling. Markasher has
an extremely high Law Level and a low tolerance for
criminal behaviour. Relatively minor infractions have
been known to result in one-way trips out of an airlock
without the benefit of a vacc suit.

Markasher system has a soft interdiction in place.
While Travellers are not forbidden to pass through the
system, there is no official starport and no refuelling
services to speak of. Any fuel present is owned
by individual clans, who use it to operate sublight
spacecraft. Visitors who enter the Markasher system
without making arrangements ahead of time have no
place to go. Unscheduled visitors have been known to
sit in docking queues for weeks before being allowed
to park their ships at one of the system’s rudimentary
spaceports. Stranded craft sometimes resort to
‘ice cracking’, finding a planetoid with frozen water,
breaking it down and refining it for hydrogen fuel. This
practice is forbidden and violators can expect anything
from an extremely stiff fine to incarceration on a zero-G
planetoid or, in extreme cases, ejection from an airlock.

Creating Sylean Travellers
Syleans are a human Minor Race, created by
the Ancients who took a sample of the hominid
predecessors of _homo sapiens_ from Terra and seeded
them on Sylea. The differences between Sylean
humans and other subspecies are subtle and it is
unclear whether the Ancients subjected them to any
form of genetic engineering. Syleans are physically
similar to Solomani humans with some minor
differences. They are slightly taller with an average
height of almost two meters. Their skin is very light,
nearly white in some cases, while their hair colour
is almost universally dark brown to black, creating
a stunning contrast. Sylean eye colour tends to the
extremes from an almost crystalline grey or blue to a
deep dark brown, appearing almost black.

The primary differences between Syleans and other
human subspecies are not physical but cultural.
Syleans are a focused and driven race, guided by a
long history of oppression at the hands of Vilani and
Solomani invaders. While most are now of mixed
heritage, having bred with Vilani and Solomani humans,
there are still billions of genetically pure Syleans due to
the fact that many were isolated in remote reservations
on their homeworld deep into the Long Night and
maintained their purity even after leaving Sylea for
other star systems.

The Syleans are a spiritual and philosophical people.
The introduction of interstellar travel and high
technology has not disconnected them from religious
practices, meditation, spiritual contemplation or any
number of other pursuits that have disappeared from
the lives of many of their human brethren.

**CHARACTERISTICS**
Sylean Travellers have the following modifiers applied
to their characteristics: STR-1 and EDU+1.

**TRAITS
Cooperation** : Syleans are exceptionally cooperative
with others of their species. When on a Sylean World
(one with a Sylean population of 50 percent or more),
Sylean Travellers receive DM+2 on Admin, Diplomat
and Streetwise checks. This reflects the Syleans’ innate
ability to close ranks and cooperate with one another to
achieve a desired goal.

**CAREERS**
Almost all of the careers listed in the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_ are suitable for Sylean Travellers but the
Drifter and Rogue careers require additional explanation.

For the Drifter career, Sylean barbarians and
wanderers should be exceedingly rare. The Sylean
Worlds are old and well-developed, and there are few
low-tech worlds to be found. However, a Sylean might
purposely go to a primitive world, perhaps on a journey
of spiritual discovery. Most Syleans are very directed
and would rarely slip into the wanderer career, although
there could be exceptions.

As for the Rogue career, most Syleans gravitate
towards honorable professions that provide them
with financial and spiritual prosperity, avoiding
those that directly involve them in crime for crime’s
sake. That said, they are no more or less ethical
than humans of any other kind and might indulge in
underworld-oriented activities if there are extenuating
circumstances. A thief might be in the employ of a
corporation, engaged in skulduggery to acquire goods
and intelligence by underhanded means. An enforcer
might be in the employ of a Sylean cartel or syndicate,
which are remarkably similar to the organised crime
organizations of other species. Syleans are unlikely to
operate as independent pirates but may very well serve
as corporate privateers or corsairs who raid enemy
shipping with a letter of marque.

In addition to the above career choices, many Syleans
are religious and subscribe to one of the traditional
Sylean faiths. Sylean Travellers in the priesthood may
use the Believer career from the Traveller Companion.

WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
Syleans are driven by a desire for prosperity and
wealth and receive DM+1 on all Cash Benefit rolls
when mustering out of their careers.

# BUNKERIA

Bunkeria was once home to a large portion of the
Interstellar Confederacy, a multi-world polity that got its
start during the Long Night. The string of Confederacy
worlds extended from the Hektalus system in Bunkeria
to Velpare in Cemplas, encompassing 32 star systems
at its peak. The Confederacy looked as if it would
pose a major challenge to the Sylean Federation for
supremacy in the Core sector but its lack of unity was
ultimately its downfall. Two wars determined the destiny
of the Confederation, the first of which was lost to better
organised Sylean squadrons who routed disjointed
Confederacy forces in the Battle of Velpare. The
second was a brutal civil war in which the Confederacy
lost its capital at Sketola to rebel forces. Sketola was
eventually reconquered but the damage was done. The

Sylean Federation was able to exploit the weaknesses
of the Confederacy, causing it to collapse one year
before the founding of the Third Imperium.

The Interstellar Confederacy may have died long
ago but its spirit and culture lives on. The worlds of
Bunkeria have cultivated a flair for independence within
the confines of the Imperium. Bunkerians celebrate
Liberation Day to commemorate the reacquisition
of Sketola from the rebels. The celebration includes
festivals to honor famous war heroes, politicians and
other historical figures. There are art exhibits, re-
enactments of great battles, feasts and banquets and
all sorts of other entertainments. Bunkerian worlds are
drawn together by a shared history and heritage that
unites them in ways that most subsectors are not.

**CORE**

###### BUNKERIA subsector

Bunkeria is defended by the Imperial Navy’s 217th
Fleet, one of the smallest numbered fleets in all of the
Core with only two full-time squadrons. A rarity in the
Imperium, Bunkeria’s 217th Colonial Fleet is actually
larger than its numbered fleet with four full squadrons
at its disposal. The ships of the official 217th are highly
capable TL15 spacecraft with jump-4 capability while
the Colonial 217th is composed of locally built ships that
average TL13 and jump-3. Bunkeria’s Colonial Navy
ships are some of the most colourful in the fleet, adorned
with the martial regalia and names of heroes from their
vibrant historical past. Because of how few squadrons
it has, the 217th primarily patrols the worlds along the
Sylean Main, while the 217th Colonial patrols the interior
of Bunkeria including the Irlu and Dral Clusters.

Sketola is the capital of the subsector and headquarters
of both the subsector and Colonial fleets. The economic
powerhouse of Bunkeria is the F’rnow system, home
of the sector-wide Achenaar Antilles Line, which was
founded during the era of the Interstellar Confederacy
and remains one of the most powerful corporations in
all of the Core. Achenaar Antilles has over 1,000 ships
in its fleet, most of which operate on the Sylean Main.

The Imperium is leery of Bunkeria’s independent
streak but have been cautious not to spoil a good
thing. In spite of its relatively small population, the
spirited worlds of Bunkeria have done their part to help
grow the traffic along the Sylean Main. Furthermore,
the subsector is remarkably stable with only one
world classified as an Amber Zone. While Bunkeria is
certainly not the Core’s best and brightest locale, it has
undeniable appeal and a seemingly bright future.

Hellhole
The aptly named Hellhole has always been a difficult
world to live on but also one that has been deemed worth
the trouble. The planet has been stripped of its crust by
multiple deep impacts over its long history, giving mining
companies easy access to the exotic minerals and heavy
metals in its exposed mantle. Unfortunately, its surface is
teeming with radioactivity, which made it a deadly place
to work during the era of the Interstellar Confederacy
when its miners only had access to TL12 safety gear.
Now under Imperial management, there are very few
human miners on its surface with most of the work being
done by high-tech radiation-shielded robots. Almost all
of Hellhole’s population lives on the close-orbit highport
or one of its Lagrange-point processing and shipping
centres. Mining activity is performed remotely by well-paid
remote operations engineers who do the delicate work
of extracting Hellhole’s abundant resources from a safe
distance of 1,000km.

While gifted with a placid, long-lived star, the entire
Hellhole system has barely a drop of water or wisp
of atmosphere on its 11 planets. With no gas giants
or planetoid belts to speak of, ships cannot perform
wilderness refuelling. Liquid hydrogen must be
imported into the system, making it exorbitantly
expensive. Travellers can expect to pay three times
the standard price for fuel, all of which is refined at
the highport.

The Revived Grand Senate on Sketola snaps up as
much of Hellhole’s product as it can using loans from
the Achenaar Antilles Line. Sketola claims that these
resources are used to maintain the Colonial Navy but
the Imperium has begun to cry foul. There simply is
no way that all of the extracted materials could be
put to use by one provincial navy, or so the Imperium
believes. Auditors from the Office of the Exchequer
have descended upon Hellhole to make sure nothing
is amiss.

Irlu
The Meritocracy of Irlu purportedly uses a nonpartisan
selection process to identify and appoint the best-
qualified sophonts among its population to fill its
administrative and governmental positions. Like so
many other corrupt bureaucracies, its levers have
been usurped by those in power to obtain roles for
selected allies and family members regardless of
their qualifications. While the selection process still
manages to see to it that some of the cream rises to
the top, the system has become so corrupt that many
of its offices and institutions have been rendered
utterly ineffective.

One of the organizations that does seem to work
rather well is the Office of Mercenary Affairs (OMA).
Due to unusual circumstances, the OMA was tasked
with the coordination of defence forces for nearly
all the worlds of Bunkeria. When the Interstellar
Confederacy was integrated into the Imperium, the
armies and militias of its member worlds surrendered
their arms and were occupied first by Sylean forces
and later by the Imperial Army.

The young Imperium was unable to sustain the
occupation and sought to return Bunkeria’s pacified
worlds to local control. During the Confederacy
Era, the world of Marsus was a renowned exporter
of mercenary forces. Unfortunately, Marsus had
fallen on hard times after fighting on the wrong
side of the Civil War. Even after its decline,
Marsusian mercenaries remained some of the
best-qualified fighting forces in the subsector. The

Imperium imported the best and brightest mercenary
commanders from Marsus to Irlu where they were
given the daunting task of guiding the worlds of
Bunkeria to military self-rule. In fits and starts, they
gradually accomplished their goal. Early contracts
were given to trusted mercenary companies but as the
scope of the job became larger, they were eventually
forced to recruit talent from neighboring subsectors.
Over time, the practice of employing professional
soldiers to serve in its worlds’ armies took hold.

The OMA had help, of course. The management of
a subsector-wide bureaucracy was a bit beyond its
expertise. Enter: Instellarms, the megacorporate buyer,
seller and manufacturer of weapons systems. As the
leading provider for mercenary companies throughout
the Imperium, Instellarms was eager to become
involved in the OMA. In return for sponsorship, the
OMA gets reduced prices on all gear it requires as
well as favorable lease terms for Broadsword -class
mercenary cruisers to transport troops.

While the practice of employing strictly mercenaries
is anathema to most worlds of the Imperium, it seems
to work in Bunkeria. Its mercenary forces exhibit a
high level of professionalism and have become sought
after outside the subsector. The vaunted OMA Seal of
Approval is given to the best mercenary companies,
a practice which thus far has not been corrupted by
Irlu’s disingenuous meritocracy.

MAJOR RAYNIER GRGIC
Major Grgic is a retired ex-mercenary and
current regional manager for the bonding
authority of the OMA. If the Travellers are
mercenaries, he can get them the most
favorable rates in the subsector on a
repatriation bond. He is also well-connected
with Instellarms and can hook them up with just
about any weapons they want short of tactical
nukes. However, the more powerful and illegal
the weaponry, the steeper the price. The laws
are stringent on Irlu, so Grgic prefers to make
arms deals on neighboring Irdu, which has
almost no law to speak of.

Bunkeria

Lalandra
Lalandra was the headquarters of the feckless
Interstellar Confederacy Naval Administration. Proud
naval historians have often sought to paint a rosier
narrative of the Confederacy Navy, one which seeks
to cover up the fact that in the hour of need, it utterly
failed to perform to expectations. In reality, the navy
was a microcosm of the Confederacy government:
a disjointed collection of organizations intended to
cooperate with one another but which were incapable
of doing so when it mattered most. Regardless of
the truth, the Lalandra Museum of Naval History is
a popular attraction for both Bunkerians and foreign
tourists alike. It includes two departments: an indoor
facility located in one of the Lalandra Belt’s largest
planetoids and ‘The Shipyard’, a large collection of
now ancient naval starships that have been arranged
for the viewing pleasure of its visitors. Tourists may
spend days or even weeks, travelling from ship-to-
ship. Most have been restored to resemble their
original states but some have been deliberately left
as wrecks. Two of the most popular exhibits in the
naval museum are the cryogenically preserved body
of Admiral Moshe Halfview – the cyborg military hero
credited with quashing the rebellion at Sketola – and
the _Exatar_ , an espionage ship that used unique
‘ramscoop’ technology.

In addition to its normal duties, the Lalandra Scout
Base has liaison officers who work with the local ship-
building industry. Some of the scouts’ most advanced
craft are assembled here, including advanced
versions of its _Suleiman_ - and _Donosev_ -class
starships. For years, the Colonial Naval Administration
on Sketola has sought to expand Lalandra’s facilities
to include the construction of naval vessels but they
have been turned down by the Imperial government
thus far. If anything, Sketola’s frequent entreaties only
make the Imperium more nervous about Bunkerian
naval independence. While their TL13 Colonial Navy
is of little concern to the Admiralty, the thought of
giving Bunkeria access to a TL15 shipyard is not one
they are willing to entertain.

HIGH GUARD: RAMSCOOP (TL12)
Ramscoops are passive hydrogen collectors
that operate automatically whenever a starship
is manoeuvring in normal (non-jump) space.
Ramscoops require several weeks of continuous
operation to obtain enough hydrogen to fill
the tanks of a typical ship. The ship must be
actively manoeuvring during this time, which
enables the ramscoops to extract hydrogen
from the interstellar medium. Ramscoop ships
do not have fuel scoops, nor do they have fuel
processors since the hydrogen is processed and
purified as it is collected. The advantage of this
technology is that it enables a starship to make
as many jumps as desired without ever visiting a
starport or gas giant for refuelling purposes.

Ramscoops require one percent of a ship’s
available tonnage plus five tons, with a minimum
overall size of 10 tons and can collect five tons of
hydrogen per week for every ton attributed to the
ramscoops. Additional tonnage may be added as
desired. Ramscoops cost Cr250000 per ton.

The typical configuration for ramscoops is an
array of cylinders or similar structures fitted
on the exterior of a ship, co-located with its
fuel tanks. Because of the bulkiness of the
collectors, ships outfitted with ramscoops
cannot perform atmospheric re-entry without
damaging the ramscoops and are therefore
rarely streamlined. If the ship is docked or
otherwise immobile, ramscoops cease to
function but will automatically resume operation
once the ship starts manoeuvring again.

While ramscoops were an innovative use
of technology by Interstellar Confederacy
engineers, were ultimately deemed an inefficient
use of space and are rarely seen in service.
Bunkeria

# CEMPLAS

Many worlds of Cemplas were members of the
Interstellar Confederacy, which challenged the Sylean
Federation for dominance of the Core before the rise
of the Third Imperium. Cemplas is a region of sharp
contrasts. Unlike the former Confederacy worlds in
Bunkeria, those of Cemplas underwent a difficult
transition into the Imperium, which in many ways was
never fully consummated. Bunkeria rarely saw direct
conflict with Sylean forces but major wars were fought
on the worlds of Cemplas, some of which still bear the
scars today. Because of this, there was a great deal
more resentment towards the Syleans and their new
Imperium. Many of these worlds grudgingly relented
to Imperial authority and developed cultures that take
umbrage to any perceived interference in their affairs.
Time heals all wounds but even after 1,000 years,
there are feelings of mistrust between the close-knit
worlds of Cemplas and its Imperial overlords. While a
large-scale insurgency would be virtually impossible to
carry out, Imperial intelligence agencies keep a close
eye on Cemplas for any trouble that might be brewing.
There is little danger of outright rebellion but Cemplas
is on a shorter leash than Bunkeria and probably
always will be.

The spirit of rebellion lives on in Cemplas. It is a place
of both great wealth and immense challenges. Cemplas
is home to some of the most technologically advanced
worlds in all of the Core but also harbours some of
its most oppressive dictatorships. Cemplas has four
industrial worlds, three of which – Bendo, Keplo and
Shibashliim – are ideally located along the Sylean
Main. Near the heart of the Core and in close proximity
to Capital, these worlds are of great importance to

Cemplas and the region at large. Bendo and Keplo
manufacture low- to mid-tech consumer goods and
the factories of Shibashliim – which cover the majority
of the planet’s surface and sprawling swaths of its
sea bed – produce high-end computer systems and
electronics. The governors of Shibashliim have large
stakes in the megacorporation Naasirka, which holds
a monopoly of the planet’s industrial capital. The fourth
industrial world, Lishiruud, is located in the rimward
portion of the subsector and sits upon a small jump-
1 main where competing merchant companies run
liners and megafreighters and operate a network of
subsidized merchant routes in the surrounding markets.

Innovation in Cemplas is fuelled by the Imperial Navy,
which has ultra-high-tech research and development
centres on Celetron and Ye-lu. Both are on the verge
of major breakthroughs in automation and artificial
intelligence. Celetron is developing autonomous
starships and Ye-lu has all of its essential functions
controlled by an AI computer network. Both worlds
are high-value strategic assets and heavily defended
by the 160th Fleet. While they are fully engaged in
the development of military hardware and software,
each has agencies that share consumer-oriented tech
with civilian firms. Meanwhile, private companies on
Shibashliim are competing in the cutting-edge field of
matter transport. While some are close to being able
to transmit small amounts of matter across continental
distances, a few niche companies are attempting to use
the technology to teleport radio waves across an entire
star system. If successful, they will have invented the
Imperium’s first working FTL communications device.

**CORE**

###### CEMPLAS subsector

Biirke
In a frontier sector, Biirke is the type of system that
might be left barren but in the Core there are no such
places. The system’s bright white main sequence star
and its unstable red dwarf companion have swept most
of the resource-poor planets clean of atmospheres and
water, leaving little reason for settlers to stay. Biirke
itself is a cold dustball chosen by a small resource-
development company to host an automated Class D
highport. Small craft pilots were hired to fly tankers to
and from the system’s gas giants, bringing unrefined
liquid hydrogen to be sold as fuel. Robots would
be there to help visiting Travellers refuel their ships
quickly and efficiently so they could move on to more
promising ports of call. When the expected traffic failed
to materialise and the company went bankrupt, the
facility was abandoned. It turns out that most visitors to
the system had opted to perform wilderness refuelling
rather than travel to the out-of-the-way starport.

About a decade later, the mothballed starport was
salvaged and refurbished by belters who had been
fruitlessly searching Biirke’s planetoid belts for
prospects. The savvy belters stripped the idle robots
of their brains, reprogrammed them and fitted them
into the tankers, which now make perpetual fuel runs
to and from the gas giants, constantly replenishing
the station’s fuel supply. While Biirke’s appeal has
scarcely improved, traffic to the port has experienced
a noticeable uptick. The belters turned it into a co-op,
offering a share to others in their profession provided
they participate in the highport maintenance rotation.
They converted two of the station’s four docking bays
into a market bazaar, which visiting merchants use to
trade speculative cargo with each other. Members of
the co-op recently salvaged an abandoned subsidized
merchant, which they intend to refit and hire out to
a crew, provided they limit their operations to the
Lishiruud Cluster.

Ehok-ta
Virtually all of Ehok-ta’s 10,000 inhabitants are in the
employ of Ne-ka-otabi, an entrepreneurial venture
run by Syleans and Bwaps (refer to the _Traveller
Companion_ or _Aliens of Charted Space Volume 3_ for
more on the Bwaps). The firm used a large portion of its
seed money to purchase a small gravitic city that was
designed and built to their specifications by General
Products, LIC. Ne-ka-otabi uses industrial robots from
Shibashliim to mine the resources of the planet below.
The gravity, atmospheric pressure and heat on the
surface is much too high for a permanent settlement

but it is rich in rare-earth minerals and petrochemicals.
The city floats high above the clouds where the
temperature and atmosphere are more comfortable.
Even at high altitude, the air is dense and humid, which
is just fine for Bwaps but often a bit uncomfortable for
human inhabitants.

The workers elect a Civic Council that runs a union,
requests infrastructure improvements, operates utilities
and manages the purchase of offworld foodstuffs
and other goods. The Council advises Ne-ka-otabi
corporate officers on what the population needs but the
company is under no legal obligation to do anything
other than pay their employees. The operation has
an opportunity to do extremely well, making the
company and its employees rich. However, despite
bringing in impressive resource hauls, Ne-ka-otabi has
struggled to make a profit thus far. To make matters
worse, the city’s gravitic pylons have been failing at
an alarming rate. The extraction bots, purchased on
Shibashliim, have been performing to expectations
but the technology that keeps the city afloat has been
subpar. Its gravitic support system has multi-redundant
safeguards, so there is no imminent danger of it
plunging into the crushing depths of Ehok-ta but the
frequent failure alarms and subsequent costs incurred
for repairs are unnerving for the city’s residents. Many
question the decision making of the Ne-ka-otabi
executives and have petitioned to have them replaced.

Heraldia
Heraldia is a trinary system with three red dwarf stars,
the largest of which is in distant circumbinary orbit
around the smaller two, which orbit each other around
a common center of mass. There are two key worlds
in the system: Heraldia and Gyga. Heraldia orbits Uli-
Beta, the second largest star in the system, while the
gas giant Gyga orbits Uli-Alpha, the largest of the three
red dwarves.

Heraldia was once a strategically important world
of the Interstellar Confederacy and bore the brunt
of the assault from the Sylean Federation during
the war between the two powers. To avoid the long
end-around through Velpare, Sylean squadrons often
entered the fray at Heraldia. Confederacy forces were
stretched thin trying to defend both Heraldia and
Gyga. The battles around Gyga left dozens of wrecks
behind, most of which have plummeted into the gas
giant’s gravity well over the centuries. The few that
remain have been preserved and converted into war
memorials and tourist attractions. Heraldia itself also
bears the scars of the war. Its atmosphere was tainted

with fallout from the orbital bombardment of its cities
and its hydrosphere was virtually eliminated, leaving
the world a desert wasteland. Heraldians were forced
into domed and subterranean structures to survive the
intense stellar radiation from the system’s three suns.
Life is hard on Heraldia but even after 1,200 years the
descendants of those who fought here have a solemn
pride in their ancestry.

Many worlds celebrate war-time glories but few do so
with the fervour of Heraldia. Just about every particle
accelerator burn, nuclear crater, blasted grav tank and
wrecked structure has been marked as a historical site.
At the extremes, the dropped plasma rifles and suits
of combat armor worn by key war heroes have been
preserved under transparent plasteel right where they
fell in action. Heraldians chafe at the suggestion that
they have gone overboard worshipping the sites of
their ancestors’ sacrifices. Martyrdom is big business
on Heraldia and the world attracts millions of tourists
each year. During peak months, the tourist population
outnumbers the planet’s permanent residents.

Khusgurlu
The supreme pontiff of Khusgurlu is Aulonn Jhourdan-
Valestin. While this particular ‘instance’ of the man has
led the Church of the Chosen Few for only the last
two decades, he has in a way led it for the last 2,000
years. Jhourdan-Valestin and virtually all 20 billion
of his parishioners are clones. The Church keeps a
catalogue of approximately 12 billion approved DNA
templates, each of which is a permanent ‘citizen’
of the planet. Some twins are allowed to occur
but triplets are prevented by the cloning process.
Approximately five billion Khusgurluans are duplicates,
so at any one time there might be two or three clones
of one template in circulation. After one lives a full
life and dies a natural death – anagathics are strictly
forbidden – they are `resurrected` by having their
template implanted into and taken to term by a female.
The Church is monotheistic and the people believe
that God protects them and grants them ‘immortality’
in exchange for strict adherence to its rituals. While
coital behaviour between couples is allowed as a

Cemplas

ritual activity, natural reproduction is not. Motherhood
only occurs at the behest of the Church and only
through implantation. Despite a comprehensive
high-tech surveillance network and virtually infallible
contraception, natural childbirths do occur from time-
to-time. Natural reproduction is a high crime and
punishable by the death of both parents and their
naturally created child. The parents are referred to as
‘heretics’ and children as ‘abominations’.

It should be noted that Khusgurlu’s use of cloning
technology and consciousness templates treads a
fine line with recent Imperial law. In 1070, Emperor
Paulo III ruled that consciousness transfer is a crime
because it tampers with the mind of a sentient life
form. The Church of the Chosen Few got around the
law by establishing that its clones are not fitted with
the consciousnesses of live individuals but merely with
copies of a template. The templates themselves are
artificial constructs, none of which are based on brain
patterns extracted from actual living beings, or at least
so the Church claims. The practice began during the
murk of the Long Night and there is no concrete proof
to the contrary.

Upon resurrection, most Khusgurluans embark upon
a unique life experience, meaning they do not fill the
same role or live in the same geographic location as
their previous clone; however, a favorite pastime is
looking into the Church’s extensive databases to see
one’s past lives. The texts and holovideos are edited
to convey the virtues of a duty-bound, pious lifestyle.
While they may have filled many roles during previous
lives – perhaps a genetic scientist in one life, a soldier
in another and a labourer in the one after that – these
histories convey a frightening consistency designed to
encourage conformity and obedience. No one wants
to view their past lives to discover they were rebellious
and brought shame to the church or had dangerous
independent thoughts.

While its origins are lost in the murk of history, the
Church of the Chosen Few is thought to have resulted
from the struggles of the Long Night. Khusgurlu,
a moon of the system’s innermost gas giant, was
the site of a Vilani colony that was left intact by the
Terrans during the Rule of Man. The system has
reasonably rich resources in its planetoid belt and
other gas giant moons (it has no independent planets)
but Khusgurlu itself is its only marginally habitable
world and only just. Its intemperate red dwarf star
spews flares every few decades, most of which only
last a few hours. When Khusgurlu is occluded by

its gas giant, it suffers few effects. When it is not,
the flares strip away much of its atmosphere which
is, over time, restored by the world’s abundant
genetically engineered plant life. The flares had
historically caused a large number of deaths and
genetic mutations, endangering the viability of the
colony. To prevent its collapse, Khusgurluan scientists
developed a library of genetic templates, which they
kept in circulation through an implantation process.
It is likely that the Church is an outgrowth of this
meticulous process.

The Church of the Chosen Few is loyal to the Imperium
and willingly subscribes to the notion that Capital is its
political nexus; however, they believe that Khusgurlu is
its spiritual center and that the Imperium would greatly
benefit from adopting similar rituals. Missionaries from
the Church are commonly encountered throughout
the Core. While they do not invite offworlders to their
own planet, they do encourage them to adopt Church
practices and have built temples on worlds throughout
the Core. Khusgurluans who have proven their piety
are allowed to serve in the Imperial armed forces,
which they use as yet another opportunity to evangelise
their religion. Anyone allowed to leave their homeworld
is implanted with surveillance augments to ensure they
remain faithful.

Velpare
Velpare is a key stop along the Sylean Main, linking
the Keplo and Vvrin Clusters. The system primary is a
long-lived orange main sequence star called Auroralari.
The richness of Auroralari’s planetary disk gave birth
to several worlds and gas giant moons with a diverse
array of atmospheric compositions. Velpare itself is
gifted with a breathable oxygen-nitrogen mix and a
lush biosphere of highly evolved flora and fauna. Much
like Capital, Velpare has a larger-than-normal molten
iron core, giving it higher gravity and a more powerful
magnetosphere than would otherwise be present for a
world of its size.

Velpare was the site of a famous battle between the
Interstellar Confederacy and the Sylean Federation.
Disorganised Confederacy naval forces were no
match for the strategic savvy of Sylean Commodore
Orori Rudolph. However, the Syleans went a bridge
too far by bucking orders and launching an orbital
assault in which their marines were soundly defeated
by Velparian army and militia forces. The commodore
and his officer corps were subjected to a court martial
and subsequent dishonorable discharge for their

actions. Having saved face and maintained the pristine
condition of their world, Confederacy forces sued for
peace and were granted self-rule provided they pledge
fealty to Sylea. This they did and their government
gradually evolved into a non-charismatic dictatorship
in which their leader became Duke of Velpare. As the
centuries passed and the Third Imperium took charge,
Velparian leadership became more autocratic, which
resulted in a number of revolts and terrorist attacks
by resistance forces. These were violently put down
and the world was eventually occupied by forces
from Shibashliim, which established military rule.
In 978, rebels infiltrated the garrison, assassinated
several Shibashliimi officers and destroyed key
strategic resources, expelling the tyrannical duke to
the equatorial jungles. Imperial arbitrators brokered an
armistice by which the Shibashliimi were expelled from
the system and self-rule was restored.

The exiled duke is still the official representative of
Velpare but the world is now effectively governed
by five baronies, which oversee the world’s cities,
agricultural districts and wildlife preserves. Ironically,
Velpare was made capital of Cemplas one month after
the coup, thereby promoting the exiled noble to the
role of subsector duke. In the absence of the duke,
the barons collectively share the responsibility of
representing Cemplas.

The barons of Velpare lead with a light touch and
allow for a great many personal freedoms including
the possession of non-military weapons for self-
defence. House militias may legally use military
weapons provided they pledge to engage in joint
exercises and assist with the planet’s defence
should the need arise. Unfortunately, the spectre of
dictatorship and the occupation still haunts Velpare.
The ousted duke remains in hiding, using superior
Shibashliimi technology to mask the presence of his
forces. No one knows if the original duke still rules
or if his successors are now in charge. The group
occasionally raids baronial farms and perpetrates acts
of terrorism, destroying public buildings, infrastructure
and settlements on the periphery of Velpare Downport.
Rumor has it the barons plan to pool their resources
to hire offworld mercenaries to assist them with the
expulsion of the duke and his army. Since the duke
is still ostensibly a member of the Peerage, no one is
quite sure how the Imperium will react to such a move.
Furthermore, other members of the Moot have pointed
out that Velpare is a case in point for why it is best

to keep Imperium bureaucracy and world leadership
separate. Leading members of the advisory body have
petitioned the Emperor to separate the powers but he
has thus far resisted their requests to do so.

In spite of its problems, Velpare welcomes interstellar
commerce and offworld immigrants in an attempt to
further establish its presence on the Sylean Main.
Velpare is a beautiful world with sprawling primeval
forests, equatorial rainforests and extensive mountain
ranges that attract tourists and adventurous Travellers
from throughout the Core. Its cosmopolitan cities are
popular destinations, known for their excellent cuisine,
all of which is made from locally grown ingredients.
Their post popular dishes are spiced with extracts
of the varinte plant, which is prized for its flavor
throughout the Core and beyond.

Velpare hosts both Imperial Navy and scout bases. The
bulk of scout personnel are from the Communications
branch, which coordinates x-boat routes and starship
resources along the entire Sylean Main.

Ye-lu
Ye-lu is one of two worlds in Cemplas wholly owned by
the Imperial Navy, the other being Celetron. Ye-lu is a
tiny airless rockball that serves as the testing ground
for an automated conscious intelligence that runs the
entire planet. This software, which answers to the name
‘Mother’, uses advanced, nearly instantaneous meson
communicators for all of its instructions.

The Imperial government and – to a lesser degree –
its armed forces have always had an irrational fear
of artificial intelligence, borne of their partially Vilani
heritage and various mishaps that have occurred over
the ages. While the Ye-lu installation and those like it
are controversial, there are legally mandated mitigation
technologies present that prevent applications like
Mother from being truly autonomous. Ye-lu skirts these
regulations very closely.

The entire world is, metaphorically speaking, a multi-
cellular organism. Mother controls all of its computer
systems, utilities, thousands of robots and trillions
of microbots and nanites, making her own decisions
about what needs to be added, removed or altered as
demands change. On a given day, personnel at the
station might notice a new wing under construction
without knowing about it ahead of time. Mother
posts all of her activities in a database accessible

Cemplas

to the human staff but it is difficult to keep up with
her myriad projects. At present, Mother has covered
approximately 35 percent of Ye-lu’s surface with
various structures but this percentage ebbs and flows
depending on what she has been asked to do and
what she is working on independently.

The naval staff are present at Ye-lu in a primarily
scientific role. They are there to guide and monitor
Mother’s activities in order to determine if her advanced
technology can be applied elsewhere. If things go well,
more automation at Imperial military facilities could
become the norm.

Shipwreck Hunters
The Sylean Main has been travelled by starships for thousands of years. It was a provincial route for the
Vilani, a major artery into the First Imperium for Terran conquerors, the site of numerous battles during
the Sylean Federation-Interstellar Confederacy War and now hosts the Core’s most valuable trade route.
Over the millennia, hundreds of ships on the route have been lost during battles, wilderness refuelling
operations gone wrong, misjumps and other calamities. Celebrity shipwreck hunters ply the route searching
these old hulks for salvage and adventure. The few dozen that have been found have captured the public’s
imagination. Imperial citizens are fascinated with their long, complicated histories and a great deal of
excitement and media attention surrounds the discovery of each old wreck. Holovideo documentaries about
newly discovered wrecks are among the most popular entertainments available in the Core and each new
discovery is like opening a time capsule from various eras of Imperial history.

Perhaps the most famous of these lost ships, and one that has yet to be found, is the Regal Voyager ,
a 50,000-ton cruiser commanded by Interstellar Confederacy war hero, Beau-Ta-Quitala. A noble from
Keplo, the daring and handsome Beau-Ta-Quitala was the warrior-sage of his era. Legends tend to
grow out of proportion with reality over time but the historical record speaks for itself. He was a brilliant
academic with a doctorate in jumpspace engineering, a savvy politician and a warfighting capital ship
captain. Beau-Ta-Quitala and all hands of the Regal Voyager were lost in action 1,300 years ago while
travelling from Keplo to Sketola where the heroic captain was to engage in a final showdown with the
rebel leader, Baron Rolf von Toerbach of Protalus.

There are many mysterious theories about Beau-Ta-Quitala’s disappearance, some quite outlandish, but
few solid clues as to where his famous starship may have ended up. Most people believe it must have
misjumped somewhere into the Bunkeria-Cemplas Gap, the stellar chasm between the two subsectors. If
anyone were to find the lost ship, fame and fortune beyond imagination would surely follow.

Cemplas

# CHANT

The Chant subsector currently has a population
of about 13.7 billion. At its peak, it had over 14
times that. Chant has been continuously settled for
over 7,000 years dating back to the original Vilani
expansion into the Core but over the millennia,
ecological collapse, war and the effects of the Long
Night decimated its worlds. The remnants of lost
civilizations are everywhere, in particular at Merat
and Avthaus where sprawling Vilani ruins sit side-
by-side with the structures of the modern Imperium.
On Effinity, the deserts and equatorial marshes have
reclaimed the ruins and new cities have sprung up in
the temperate latitudes to take their place.

Some have compared Chant to the picked over
remains of a long-dead carcass. Others call it ‘the sick
man of the Core’. Its resources have been plundered
for thousands of years and it has been a bloody
battlefield more times than anyone cares to remember.
Perhaps the greatest killer of all was the Plague of
Duskir, the slew of Terran diseases that wiped out
billions of Vilani.

With its population in freefall and its economy in
tatters, things have certainly been better for Chant.
Nevertheless, there is reason for hope. While Chant
is a shadow of its former self, there are signs of a
resurgence. The subsector retains several of its Class
A and B starports, propped up by Imperial subsidies.
Industrial worlds Skeen and Raami, two of the oldest
civilizations in the sector, have pledged to revitalise
Chant. The Achenaar Antilles Line has opened
up a hub at Anther from which they have plans to
reinvigorate trade on the trailing spur of the Sylean
Main. Emperor Strephon himself has invested a portion
of his personal wealth in the region and solicited
trillions more from the megacorporations. As far as the
Emperor is concerned, it simply will not do to have an
economic disaster of this scale on Capital’s doorstep.

Chant is defended by the Imperial Navy’s 2nd Fleet,
which consists of only three squadrons. The ships of the
2 nd are outdated, underfunded and desperately in need
of a refit. Fortunately, the fleet has more than its share
of auxiliary spacecraft, many of which are dealing with a

burgeoning piracy problem in the rimward portion of the
subsector. The Imperial Navy normally takes a heavy
hand against pirates but because Chant is so close to
Capital, they are addressing the problem with a lighter
touch. That such a thing as piracy could even occur so
close to the throne world is an embarrassment and if
word were to get out to the greater Imperium, it would
be a public relations nightmare. Piracy results from
economic strife and the Imperium hopes to rejuvenate
Chant’s ailing worlds. While the navy is not averse to
using force, they are attempting to win hearts and minds
instead. They hope to provide viable alternatives for
those who have turned to piracy.

There is no single reason for the severe decline of
the rimward worlds. There are many factors that have
contributed to their fall but corruption, nepotism and
cronyism are by far the greatest culprits. Astrography
plays a part as well with the region being surrounded
by several small- to mid-sized stellar gaps, which
impede the flow of information and make for a spotty
economy. Chant is also bordered on its rimward flank
by the Chanestin worlds, which are isolationist and
therefore rarely trade with outsiders.

The future of Chant is very much in question. Relief
has begun to flow in from external sources but the
subsector has more than its share of kleptocrats who
misappropriate funds and redirect them to their own
coffers. It will require more than just the good will of the
Emperor to save Chant from plummeting even further
into decline.

Anther
Anther is a vacuum world on the coreward periphery
of Chant. The system has poor resources but is
strategically located on the Sylean Main and has five
gas giants, which makes wilderness refuelling easy for
visiting Travellers. The system primary is an orange
subgiant, an immense star that has begun its long
transformation process along the red-giant branch. While
Anther is a small world, it is theorized that it once had a
trace atmosphere and liquid water that evaporated away
as its primary grew in size.

**CORE**

###### CHANT subsector

As the nexus of no fewer than six trade and
communications routes, Anther is ground zero for
the Chant Subsector Rejuvenation Project (CSRP).
Its starport was recently upgraded to a sterling Class
A facility, complete with cutting-edge shipyard and
the best maintenance facilities in the subsector. The
highport is a large facility, befitting its enviable location
along the trade routes. The downport and adjacent
startown are modern, aesthetically attractive towers
with disc-like landing platforms and enclosed docking
bays. Residential and hospitality facilities are contained
in domes at the bases of each tower. Even before the
upgrades to its facilities, Anther experienced a high
volume of traffic and things have gotten noticeably
better since the work was completed. Unfortunately,
most ships are just passing through and that is a
problem. People currently see Chant as a ‘highway’
of sorts, an obstacle to get through to reach more
lucrative markets elsewhere. The Imperium wants to
see more traffic going rimward where the benefits of
trade might revitalise the subsector’s fortunes.

The CSRP has two key roles: economic evangelism
and public relations, both of which are to be achieved
by teams of administrators who flit about to the other
worlds of Chant. The evangelism component seeks
to entice the trader community to travel off the beaten
path and go to worlds they might otherwise ignore. The
public relations component consists of ‘Outrider’ teams,
which go to the underserved systems of Chant and
help them to become more attractive markets. Getting
these systems to cooperate is often more difficult than
one might think. The people of backwater worlds can
become accustomed to their limited prospects and are
often leery of offworlders who come to promise them a
brighter future.

CSRP agents are frequently encountered while travelling
through Chant, providing incentives for Travellers to take
the rimward route to the subsector’s less-developed
systems. Unfortunately, not all CSRP employees have
Chant’s best interests in mind. As with many well-funded
bureaucracies, corruption is an ever-present problem.
CSRP accounts have been raided by embezzlers and
hackers, many of whom have been given back-door
access by insiders. While the problem has not yet gotten
out of hand, if it gets much worse, it will begin to have
a deleterious effect on the agency’s efforts. High-level
officers at CSRP headquarters have been tasked with
addressing the issue.

ALMA SANTOLUCIO
Alma is a humorless bureaucrat whose job it is to
ferret out corruption and expose it to higher-ups in
the Imperial Justice Department so they may seek
out offenders and prosecute them. Alma might
encounter the Travellers at Anther or another
busy port in the Chant subsector, where she will
request a working or basic passage aboard their
starship provided that they are travelling rimward
towards the more troubled worlds. Alma is a
determined, if inexperienced, auditor/detective
and could use the Travellers’ help seeking out
those who misappropriate Imperial funds. She is a
bit of a blunderer and more than a little naïve, and
is therefore likely to run into all sorts of trouble,
mostly along the lines of offending dangerous
people who would just as soon not have illegal
activities exposed.

Chant

TRAVELLER

Chant
Chant has an unusual ecology that exists mostly
underground in and around its extensive aquifers and
underground reservoirs. These resources support
thousands of troglodytic animal species, mosses
and fungi, most of which never see the light of day.
The majority of desert worlds have little in the way
of atmosphere but Chant’s plant species employ
photosynthesis to provide one that is 28 percent
oxygen, 71 percent nitrogen with trace amounts of
carbon dioxide and other gases. The plants wind
their way upward through Chant’s porous crust to
the surface where they protrude with large flowering
surfaces to absorb the light of Ami, the system’s
orange main sequence star. Chant has a slow
rotation of 196.2 hours, making the local day well
over a standard week long. Photosynthesis on Chant
is based on retinal instead of chlorophyll, so most
plants are purple, lavender and sometimes pink.
Whichever side of the planet faces Ami is covered in
flowering plant life, while on the dark side the plants
retract into the earth to drink from its subterranean
water sources. The higher oxygen level means
that things catch fire more easily and burn longer.
Lightning strikes from Chant’s eerie ‘dry storms’ burn
desiccated plant life, creating sprawling wildfires that
can last for weeks and are part of the planet’s cycle
of life and death.

The sensitive ecology of the planet has been
preserved due to a lack of large-scale exploitation.
Chant has only small reserves of precious metals
and has never been heavily colonized. Wave after
wave of settlers skipped over the world, most of
whom moved on to resource-rich Skeen and Raami.
Chant is currently home to nine million inhabitants,
most of whom farm its unusual and resilient flowering
plants for export into foreign markets. The Duke
of Chant has a home on this world but spends the
majority of his time three parsecs away at Vvrin, the
subsector capital, or at Capital, where he is an active
participant in Moot deliberations.

Chant Downport is a high-quality but austere facility,
designed to accommodate diplomatic visitors to
the duke’s estate and tourists who come to roam
the world’s deserts. The downport has only a few
docking bays and is not equipped to handle large
amounts of traffic. The Scout Service has a small

administrative office on-planet, which sometimes
hosts members of the Exploration branch who come
to study the local flora and fauna. The shipyard and
port authority are both located at the highport, a
large facility that they share with the Scout Service
way station. In addition to serving the needs of
the Communications Branch, the way station also
includes administrative offices where retired scouts
come to pick up their Type-S scout/couriers. These
ships are rarely given without also assigning a
detached duty mission. There is plenty of work to be
done in the subsector and retired scouts make an
excellent auxiliary work force.

Chant’s low-key government is primarily concerned
with the preservation and maintenance of the world’s
delicate ecological balance but also manages the
Civilian Service Bureau, an agency that provides
services for the world’s nine million inhabitants.

Farhome
Farhome is one of the failing worlds of the rimward
cluster, evidenced by its poor starport quality,
declining population and low Tech Level. This world
was the site of a Solomani Colony that collapsed
during the Long Night and a second colony that
was established in 667. The second go-around
got off to a fair to middling start, exploiting the
untapped resources of both the mainworld and the
system’s two planetoid belts. In more recent times,
poor planning and subsequent financial struggles
have slowly and painfully choked any prospects
for success that the colony might have had. While
some still eke out a decent living in the belts, those
on the mainworld have become destitute. Most have
eventually found a way off of Farhome but some
descendants of the original colonists remain, living
out a bleak and seemingly pointless existence.

If there is a silver lining to Farhome’s dark cloud,
it is its invention of a musical style called altDirge.
It is performed by a live band, usually with three to
five musicians and always includes a bass drum, a
high-pitched horn similar to the Terran suona and
an accordion. A snare drum and acoustic guitar are
usually included to complete the quintet with the
accordion or guitar player at lead vocals. The lyrics
of altDirge songs are about depressing things like the
deaths of loved ones, barren worlds, financial ruin and
unrequited love. The sensation has caught on at the

Chant

Port Away and Rorpa Din systems as well. Top bands
tour the interstellar region, making a decent living and
raising awareness of the struggles of their respective
homeworlds. The altDirge band No Prospects is
currently making waves with the political protest song,
‘Take it as it comes’, which draws attention to the fact
that some of their people have turned to piracy out of
desperation. The song rather bluntly blames corrupt
Imperial bureaucrats for their suffering.

Traa
Traa has been mined by belters for thousands of
years and its asteroids have been almost completely
tapped of their precious metals. Most mining
activity now occurs on the other planets and gas
giant moons of the system where prospecting and
extraction is more difficult. Traa is off the beaten
path of the rimward main by one parsec, so its
government has found other ways to make it a
worthwhile destination. Its dozens of hollowed out
asteroids, once home to millions of belters, have
been converted for recreational use and now host
myriad artificial habitats including zoos, spas,
environmental simulations, amusement parks, urban
settings with fine dining and opportunities for social
interaction and ‘pleasure asteroids’, which promise
experiences beyond Travellers’ wildest dreams.
Vacationers from industrial Raami and Skeen are
frequent visitors.

The starport is housed in Kala-an-Vodi, Traa’s largest
planetoid. Its high-tech shipyard only manufactures
civilian spacecraft and is known for producing
many custom designs. Its financial success has
garnered the interest of investors including the
megacorporation GSbAG, which has purchased a
minority stake. Imperial authorities have expressed
concern about the shipyard’s willingness to install
all manner of weaponry, stealth coatings and other
typically military features on so-called civilian
starships but has thus far resisted the temptation
to intervene. The economy of the rimward main is
already in a state of deep economic depression and
the Imperium is reluctant to upset the applecart.

Wrebil
Wrebil was once the site of an extensive psionic
training institute, which was grooming psionic aides
to serve high nobles. Initiates in the program were
the cream of the crop, selected from thousands of
candidates within the Core. The group trained at
a secure facility known as ‘the Keep’, located on a
high seamount in the world’s northern hemisphere.
When the Psionic Suppressions occurred, the group
resisted dissolution and incarceration, resulting in
a bloody confrontation with a battalion of Imperial
Marine lift infantry troops. Despite being unarmed
and unarmored, the psionics gave as they received,
using their abilities to take out dozens of marines
during the assault.

In an effort to ingratiate themselves with the locals,
initiates from the Keep were regularly parcelled out
to members of Wrebil’s ruling bureaucracy, where
they made themselves invaluable members of
Wrebilian society. When the marines came down
from the heavens and the Keep was destroyed,
it caused a great deal of unrest and ultimately
resulted in the dissolution of the government. Wrebil
split up into factional governments, some of which
were pro-Imperial and some adamantly against
them. Grievances were settled over time and the
anti-Imperial nations have simply become more
isolationist while the pro-Imperial ones have sought
more involvement from the interstellar community.

Of note, several of the psions at the Keep escaped
the attack aboard a deep sea submarine. The
marines were unable to pursue beyond 100 meters
of depth in their assault craft but did manage to
fire weapons at the submarine and claimed that it
was destroyed. Conspiracy theories abound that
the psions actually escaped and resumed their
roles helping Wrebil to govern its society and that
the balkanised nations of the world are a ruse to
put off the Imperium. There are also rumors that
the master of the Keep, an über-talented psion by
the name of Marak Ilyaman, has been able to use
a unique Awareness talent to maintain his youth,
thereby making him immortal. Allegedly he continues
to lead and teach psions from a secret training
facility, far beneath the water world’s ocean surface.

# DINGTRA

All but one world in Dingtra has retained its original
Vilani name; Glimmer, which is probably just a
corruption of Gimuur Luu, its former (also Vilani) name.
Many of these worlds were cut off from one another
during the Long Night but the jump-1 cluster in the
rimward portion of the subsector managed to maintain
limited contact via a fleet of light freighters and escorts
that had belonged to Sharurshid, the venerable Vilani
megacorporation. These worlds did not have the
resources to become a pocket empire after the Rule
of Man fell but limited contact enabled them to save
populations that would have otherwise perished.

The spirit of cooperation lives on in Dingtra, where
its four industrial worlds provide goods for the entire
subsector. In fact, it has more industrial output than
it actually needs because Dingtra has few easily
accessible foreign markets. To coreward, the Chasma
Sylea Major blocks easy transit. The subsectors to

both spinward and trailing are underdeveloped, have
relatively small populations and are not attractive to
most traders. To rimward is the Saregon subsector,
which has four industrial worlds of its own, far more
people and a more aggressive culture that bullies
Dingtra into submission. There are bold traders who
make the long circuit into Fornast and back but by and
large Dingtra is an insular subsector more focused
on maintaining what it has than trying to become
something it is not. In short, Dingtra has not strayed
far from its conservative Vilani heritage. Visitors to
Dingtra sometimes jokingly refer to it as ‘The land that
the Third Imperium forgot’.

With more resources and industrial output than
it needs, Dingtraians have an adequate but not
exorbitant standard of living. Both the labour and
professional castes work hard at their jobs and can
expect to take a family vacation once every few

**CORE**

###### DINGTRA subsector

years either at Kamsii the ‘pleasure planet’ or another
suitable world in the subsector. In addition, most
Dingtraian societies are members of one traditional
Vilani religion or another with almost no Solomani-
inspired faiths among them.

Offworlders often find Dingtraians to be aloof or
perhaps even a bit hostile. With the exception of
Kadushii, all of Dingtra’s high-population worlds
have high Law Levels, showing their preference for
strict, orderly societies. Unfortunately, it also reflects
intolerance towards foreigners. Dingtraians do not
much care for behaviour that strays outside the norm
and Travellers to Dingtra’s high-population worlds
often get into trouble with law enforcement officers.
For this reason, most of these worlds have been
given Amber Zone designations. Dingtraian justice is
harsh and the court system often assigns long prison
sentences for petty infractions. However, Dingtra is
after all a part of the Imperium and usually commutes
sentences provided that foreign diplomats intercede
on an incarcerated Traveller’s behalf. Commuted
sentences are usually accompanied by deportation
and a lifetime expulsion from the system where the
‘crime’ occurred.

Dingtra is defended by the squadrons of the
Imperial Navy’s 274th Fleet, which maintains an alert
if standoffish presence at the navy bases in the
subsector. The Imperial credo is to protect the space
between worlds without interfering in their affairs.
Nowhere is this truer than Dingtra where the navy
maintains a distinctly separate existence from the
locals. While citizens of the subsector do serve in the
navy and other military services, most do so without
distinction from their respective worlds. Imperial service
is neither celebrated nor reviled but merely looked upon
as a necessity for membership in the empire.

There is a flipside to that Imperial creed; systems
under the Imperium’s protection must abide by its
laws and must not move to restrict free trade. Dingtra
appears to have a problem with the latter. So little
commerce moves into and out of the subsector that
the Imperium has become wary. Ultimately it is the
responsibility of the subsector nobility to ensure that
the worlds under their purview are adhering to the
rules but even they have run into trouble penetrating
the monolithic Dingtraian culture. Sharurshid
maintains an ominous presence in Dingtra and may
well be propping up a ‘shadow monopoly’ in which
the megacorporation and its shell companies hold
all the cards. Imperial inspectors sent to investigate

the situation have all too frequently ‘run afoul of the
law’ and subsequently found themselves serving
time in a gulag. The Imperium is attempting to
resolve the problem without making too heavy a
play. The age of orbital bombardment and planetary
‘cleansings’ has long passed and officials hope to find
a diplomatic solution. Recently they have begun to
make inroads with some of the less-populated worlds
of the subsector, specifically those which have less
authoritarian governments.

Idas
Idas is a full-fledged technologically reinforced police
state that severely limits all aspects of its citizen's
lives. Idasians are never allowed to leave the system
and interstellar travel is limited to high-ranking
members of the Ruling Council and the Sovereign
himself, and then only with an oversized force of
security officers. Council members are fitted with
augments that enable them to communicate with one
another using an encrypted neural network. Most
communication is done sub-vocally, thereby enabling
them to speak with each other in a virtually telepathic
fashion. All conversations are recorded and analysed
by data algorithms designed to spot rebellious thinking
and nip such behaviour in the bud wherever it may
exist. The augments are also fitted with brainwave
suppressors that can be used by the Sovereign and
high-ranking members of the secret police to render
an individual unconscious or – in extreme cases –
given a painful and fatal cerebral aneurism.

The Sovereign of Idas serves as the world’s
executive authority and is allegedly selected
under the advisement of the Ruling Council. In
fact, the role is solely appointed by the previous
Sovereign – usually a male blood relative – but
the ruse is propped up to convey the illusion that
the Council has more power than it actually does.
Upon selection, the Sovereign is ritually blinded
and has his eyes replaced with cybernetic ones that
supposedly enable him to see into the souls of his
subjects. In fact, these glowing red eyes are the
least sophisticated augments given to the dictator.
After the ritual, the Sovereign disappears from public
view for a few months, during which time a full array
of TL14–15 augments are surgically implanted at
a world with the desired technology on hand. With
the sophisticated and highly specialized augments,
he can indeed detect a great deal about those
with whom he communicates, including whether or
not they are telling the truth and whether they are
favorably disposed towards the Sovereign.

Dingtra

TRAVELLER

Idas’ roughly one billion citizens are equipped with
internal devices at birth that track their whereabouts
and record all of their experiences into a sprawling
data substrate. These recordings are rarely accessed
by law enforcement but the mere knowledge that they
exist keeps most Idasians in fearful compliance. In
addition, Idas likes to apply authoritarianism with a
personal touch. All of its arcologies are panopticons,
circular structures whose buildings are observable
by a central listening and viewing post. With the
technology available, the Idasian security apparatchik
could perform all surveillance unobtrusively but, for
whatever the reason, they prefer the populace to be
acutely aware that they are being watched. Besides
the secret police and intrusive surveillance technology,
the people are controlled by the twin pillars of the Free
Party of Idas and the Indenturate, a quasi-religious
authority that harbours the belief that achieving
perfection in one’s works shall set them free in the
afterlife. This afterlife is not spiritual but technological.
After a life of labour, the sum total of one’s recorded
experiences are assembled as a unique identity
and set free in a virtual world where none of the
trappings of authoritarianism exist. Idasians spend
copious amounts of their spare time editing out the
experiences they would just as soon forget from their
personal data troves, in preparation for the blissful
experience that awaits them in a digital afterlife.

While TL12 is formidable, there is certainly higher
technology to be had in the Imperium. The security
apparatus on Idas is acutely aware of this fact
and spends a great deal of its time worrying about
‘infections’ by higher technology. They are desperately
afraid of what might happen should rebellious
members of society – rare as those may be – obtain
technology that enables them to thwart Idasian
safeguards and expose the lies that prop up the
ruling authorities. There are rumors of an insurgent
organization known simply as ‘The Anarchy’ that
seeks to do just that, although no actual proof of their
existence has been found.

While the world is not interdicted, Travellers are
advised to restrict themselves to the highport,
downport and the rather pedestrian startown. Delving
into Idasian society is not recommended as visitors
have a bad habit of disappearing without ever being
seen or heard from again.

Kamsii
Kamsii is a pleasure planet, with virtually all of its land
masses and much of its seas devoted to providing
entertainment for millions of visitors. Amusement
parks, nature preserves, zoos, ocean cruises,
immersive virtual reality experiences and just about
any other entertainment that one can imagine is
available on Kamsii.

Kamsii is the subsector capital and the Ducal Offices
are there but the Duchess of Dingtra actually spends
little time on the world. The ruling family of Kamsii are
descendants of Solomani who conquered the world
during the Interstellar Wars. A patriarch or matriarch
of the family is assigned the nominal role of count or
countess but rarely do they use this appellation. Along
with their apparent distaste for the terminology of
noble lineage, the family controls Kamsii as if it were
a city state within Imperial confines. They maintain
their own sublight planetary navy, which patrols close
orbit all the way out to the 100-diameter limit. There
is both an Imperial Navy base and scout way station
but neither has a presence on Kamsii itself. Both are
located in orbital space stations and on the surfaces
of other worlds in the system.

Kamsii is also the site of sizeable Hiver, Droyne
and most recently K’kree enclaves. While these are
ostensibly tourist attractions of a sort, the government
is careful to nurture relationships with each of them in
an effort to prevent their inhabitants from feeling like
exhibits in a zoo.

Ushba Sind
During the Interstellar Wars, Ushba Sind fell under
the jurisdiction of a Terran Navy sublieutenant
who designated the world as a wildlife refuge for
numerous animal species found throughout Dingtra.
He noticed that Vilani exploitation had resulted in
mass extinctions on many of its worlds and was
determined to reverse the damage. His successors
never managed to replenish the worlds of Dingtra
with species that had gone extinct but they did
convert Ushba Sind into a ‘Noah’s Ark’ of sorts,
with thousands of alien animals transplanted to its
surface. Ushba Sind itself had no native life forms of
its own but thousands of years of soil treatment and
the application of other terraforming techniques had
transformed the world into a viable home for a broad
range of plants and animals.

Dingtra

The modern Ushba Sindi people are the inheritors
of this conservationist approach. There are strict
Vilani-style laws in place that protect the world’s
artificial habitats and severely limit the use of land
for agricultural purposes. There is essentially just
enough farmland to support the planet’s 400 million
sophonts with the remainder reserved for the
animals. Where possible, these disparate groups
of animals have been united into shared habitats,
effectively creating new ecosystems out of groups
of animals that have evolved on different worlds.
Centuries of experimentation has resulted in a
carefully cultivated balance. By the mid-350s, this
arrangement had settled into a patchwork of separate
governments, each of which was responsible for a
distinct ecosystem. Unfortunately, nature has a way
of expanding beyond its prescribed borders and
some ecosystems expanded into others of their own
volition. More often than not, this was not caused
by human intervention but it nonetheless resulted
in conflict. The Ushba Sindi possess no high-tech
weaponry but brushfire wars between militias
began to occur. Members of the Scout Service
Exploration Branch were sent to the system in 752
to help remedy the situation. The scouts established
an orbital supply depot and a ground base and
worked with the Ushba Sindi to apply unobtrusive
but high-tech solutions in order to carefully manage
and prevent the encroachment of habitats on each
other or – where possible – arrange for habitats to
combine. When performing the latter, the scouts
have also had to carefully merge their respective
governments. There are 14 distinct habitats and
associated governments remaining on Ushba Sind.
The ultimate goal is to combine all of them into one
worldwide ecosystem and government but there are
many challenges to overcome before that would be
possible and achieving this objective is expected to
take many years.

The Ushba Sindi are decidedly low tech but have
learned to use technology for the betterment of
society. Sometime in the last century, they began to
import a pharmaceutical treatment from Brangwen
in nearby Fornast, which enables users to develop
animal empathy. Users can customise the treatment to
alter one’s nervous system and that of an associated
animal so the two species develop an emotional
connection. This has enabled the Ushba Sindi to have
an unusually close association with their animals
whose needs they can then serve more effectively.
Use of the treatments is widespread and has resulted
in a noticeable societal change in which the Ushba

Sindi see themselves less as citizens of various
nations and more associated with the residential or
migratory nature of the various species to whom they
have become pharmaceutically linked. The scouts are
closely monitoring these changes and are prepared to
intervene as necessary.

While Ushba Sind is not an interdicted world, access
to its surface is restricted and Travellers must typically
go through a lengthy application process before they
are allowed to visit. The Scout Service have set up
an array of security satellites to prevent unlawful
landings. The Duke of Kamsii has been known to
expedite the application process for those who prove
that their visit to the world is for altruistic purposes.
Select traders have also been given access to the
planet but they are usually limited to the market zone
of Ushba Sind’s austere downport.

# CADION

Cadion has multiple clusters of worlds that are
divided by gaps of two or three parsecs, preventing
the bulk of them from forming cohesive political and
commercial communities. There are three or four
distinct clusters of stars – depending on how they are
grouped – and one outlier in the Night system. Imperial
astrocartographers refer to subsectors like Cadion as
‘assistive’, meaning that their disparate clusters seem
less associated with one another and more with those
of outlying subsectors. While gaps of three parsecs
are by no means insurmountable, most trading ships
and freighters have jump ratings of 1 or 2. However,
communications are carried by the x-boat network,
which is standardised at jump-4, so the worlds of
Cadion do remain in communication with one another.

The cluster to spinward-coreward, which includes the
Cadion system itself, contains the rimward spur of the
Sylean Main. Not all traders who ply the main come all
the way to Cadion before turning back to Capital but
those who do have the option of continuing onward to
the densely populated Shardi Cluster in neighboring
Dagudashaag. Naasirka has recently made Reel a
regional R&D and manufacturing hub, which has made
the long journey to the spur worthwhile for merchants
who want to obtain the megacorporation’s popular high-
tech products.

The spinward-rimward (lower left) corner of Cadion also
contains worlds that are linked to the Shardi Cluster but
these are not considered part of the Sylean Main due to
the fact that to reach them by jump-1 transit, one must
first delve into Dagudashaag. This cluster also contains
Reference, the central repository of Imperial knowledge
and administrative headquarters of the IISS. Reference
is heavily defended by Imperial Navy and Scout Service
spacecraft but civilian traffic is strictly limited there for
security reasons.

Located in the central chasm of Cadion, the Lia and
Double Star Clusters are seldom visited by traders
and only one system among them, L’rotuu, has
planetoid belts and is therefore the only system to
attract belters. Sharurshid has sponsored subsidized
merchant routes in each cluster to explore their
economic potential and has even installed a deep
space refuelling depot in the empty space between
Double Star, Lia and Patu for those merchants who

want to explore both regions. The jury is still out
on whether there are enough Credits to be made
on these underserved worlds. The majority of them
are in rapid technological and population decline
and resemble frontier colonies more than they do
worlds of the Core. In addition, some have developed
decidedly isolationist cultures and would rather be
left alone. Nevertheless, these worlds are of strategic
importance to the Imperium whose 210th Fleet is
charged with defending the subsector. Stellar chasms
pose a security concern and the squadrons of the
fleet monitor the empty space between worlds as best
they can. The navy bases at Double Star and Markun
share the bulk of this duty. The remainder of Cadion’s
squadrons are based on its periphery and are tasked
with defending its holdings from the troubled worlds of
neighboring sectors. In the galactic scheme of things,
it was not all that long ago that the Imperium dealt
with the Ilelish Revolt. The navy bases in this region
were a major jumping-off point for the successful
quashing of that separatist movement. The Emperor is
leery of festering unrest in the other sectors and has
instructed the navy to keep a watchful eye on events
as they transpire.

By and large, the worlds of Cadion make up a free-
wheeling, laissez-faire society. In comparison with other
subsectors, there are few authoritarian governments
present and most of its worlds have low Law Levels.
Unlike most of Core, Cadion has the look and feel of
the Imperial frontier.

Brygella
Brygella has a complex oceanic biosphere that
has been left largely undisturbed. The planet is
almost completely covered with water and island
land masses consume only three percent of its
surface area. It is believed that Vilani nobles
used the world, then called Lash, as an aquatic
game-hunting preserve. The world was devoid of
sophont populations during the Long Night and was
only resettled during the early years of the Third
Imperium. There is only one permanent habitation
on the planet and that is at the prestigious Brygella
School of Oceanography, a post-graduate university
whose campus is entirely on artificial floating islands
and underwater structures built on its seamounts.

**CORE**

###### CADION subsector

The Imperial Navy and Scout Service both maintain
bases on the planet where they train personnel for
aquatic operations. The use of all forms of seafaring
vehicles is taught, as are scuba and underwater
survival skills. Both services have annexes at the
university where their personnel interact with the
civilian staff and student population.

The highport is an automated, high-tech facility
where visiting Travellers can refuel their ships. There
is little in the way of infrastructure for commercial
activity so merchants conduct trade outside the
confines of the starport. Highport robots and small
craft may be rented to help transfer cargo and
freight. Permits to land at the downport are arranged
through the Scout Service. Typically, only academics
are allowed on planet but Travellers who say they are
there for scientific reasons – and not for sport fishing
or some other illegal activity – can often wheedle
their way into a short-term pass.

Kysizi
Kysizi is a world of deep oceans with dozens of
stitch-like mountain ranges along its tectonic plates
that jut upward from the sea floor, striving to reach
the surface. The few that actually made it above the
waves formed several large islands and hundreds
of smaller ones, covering less than two percent of
the planet’s surface. However, Kysizi’s natural land
masses are only part of its story.

Kysizi was once Ganshas, an important Ziru Sirka
world along an extensive jump-1 trade route that ran
from the Laraa subsector in Dagudashaag into the
Arar subsector of Massilia, skirting through a few
worlds on the periphery of the Core. Ganshassian
civilization lasted for thousands of years under
Vilani rule. The world was under the aegis of all
three of the major Bureaux and was considered to
be one of the gems of the empire. While Ganshas
had only marginal resources of its own, its location
on the trade route made it a key world. Over the
millennia, the Ganshassians built atop the islands
and seamounts, creating another 18 million square
kilometers of surface area for habitation.

At its peak, Ganshas was host to over eight billion
people, over half of whom died from the effects
of the Plague of Duskir, the collection of viruses
and diseases brought to Vilani worlds by Terrans
during the Interstellar Wars. For reasons unknown,
the Ganshassians were uniquely vulnerable to the
plague. Ganshas continued to decline in population
during the deprivation of the Long Night but had
nearly stabilized by the time it was contacted by
Sylean Federation scouts. The natives of the world
were once again decimated by plagues, which wiped
out billions more in the years after contact with the
Syleans. Despite reasonably high technology, the
pathogens to which they were exposed were resilient
against treatments and vaccines. By the time the
plague had finished devastating the Ganshassians, a
mere one percent of their original number remained.

The world was left barren for centuries but was, in
the early 800s, resettled by colonists who salvaged
what remained of its massive artificial land masses
and built new cities upon them. Eight centuries
is a long time and many of the old Ganshassian
structures had crumbled, fallen into the sea or
had been reclaimed by various algae, mosses and
seavines. The fact that so many still remain is a
testament to the durability of the high-tech materials
used to build them.

While not technically an agricultural world, Kysizi’s
primary products are genetically engineered crops
grown under translucent domes. The domes are
made from a patented ‘hyperpolymer’ designed by
engineers from the Naasirka megacorporation. This
material extracts the desired nutrients of a system’s
star and filters out excessive radiation.

The majority of Kysizi’s land masses are uninhabited
but being picked over by millions of salvage robots
who recycle materials found for incorporation into
new buildings and other structures. Thanks to the
investment of Naasirka, Kysizi has a very high-
technology society. However, its citizenry are spread
out and do not share a single government. Each of
the major settlements has its own regional authority
and the Law Level may be seen as an aggregate
rating of the various city states.

Cadion

TRAVELLER

A new wave of colonists have come to Kysizi to
exploit its massive and revitalised fisheries. After
centuries of being left alone, the oceanic ecosystem
now resembles its pristine state before the world
was settled thousands of years ago. Most of these
newcomers live in floating seasteads, some of
which are anchored to uninhabited seamounts.
The instability of the crumbling structures along the
coasts has made it difficult to settle them. Seasteader
interaction with the world’s land-locked cities is mostly
achieved by grav vehicle. There are projects under
foot to clear and rebuild the crumbling foundations
of several coastal areas in order to create bona fide
cities and harbours for ocean-going vessels.

Lia
Lia is known throughout the Core as ‘the world of
planned progress’ where a complex terraforming,
colonization and civilization-development project
has been under way for millennia. Formerly an
uninhabited Vilani reserve world with a thick, high-
pressure carbon dioxide atmosphere, it has gradually
been transformed into a habitable, self-sufficient
society with one of the highest populations in the
sector. During the Rule of Man, the world was
selected from among several candidates by Terran
colonists and was originally dubbed ‘51 Alpha’ using
the Roman numeral LI and the Greek letter α, which
was eventually simplified to ‘Lia’.

The colony was initially funded by the exorbitantly
wealthy Corwin Corporation of Terra, which sought
to prove that there are alternative paths to creating a
habitable world and not all of them require a constant
uptick in Tech Level. Corwin brought enormous
stockpiles of raw materials and capital equipment
to the system in preparation for the project. The
world has intermittently and deliberately raised and
dropped its Tech Level according to a perplexing and
byzantine plan that eventually has Lia settling into
a final, utopian state with a standard atmosphere,
60-percent hydrosphere, an expected 100 billion
inhabitants at TL15 with an artificially intelligent
computer running the show and effectively no
government or Law Level to speak of.

Utopia continues to elude them but the Lians have
indeed achieved a great deal during the nearly
3,000-year-long project. In the early going, colonists
temporarily inhabited the system’s airless rockball
worlds while the initial terraforming stages were
completed. An immense shield-mirror was installed to
reflect the light of Lia’s bright, whitish-yellow F-type
star in order to cool the planet, thereby reducing its
heat and atmospheric pressure, carbon dioxide was
bled off by various methods, enormous amounts of
hydrogen were imported from the system’s gas giants
to help create liquid water and a magnetic shield was
built to prevent the thinned atmosphere from being
stripped away. The real marvel is that most of this
somehow occurred during the Long Night when the
entire region was deprived of interstellar trade.

While the Lians have certainly achieved something
remarkable, similar feats have been accomplished
elsewhere in a much shorter period of time and
considerably less effort. When the Imperium
annexed the system, the Lians were struggling and
yet refused all aid. Then numbering only 50 million
people, they instituted a program of educational and
industrial development that helped them rise to a
peak of TL13 by the mid-500s. Having achieved that
and stabilizing their world, they then allowed it to
falter to a middling TL10, where it remains today. By
the early 600s, many of the Lians had had enough
and people began to leave the world in droves. In
the following two decades, millions emigrated to the
surrounding systems with the vast majority making
their way to Night.

It is unknown whether the Lians will ever reach their
utopia but the ongoing attempt shows no signs of
abating. It stands to reason that their spirit of self-
reliance and the effort of generation upon generation
to achieve the goal is, in itself, the glue that holds
society together.

Night
Night is the origin world of the Oo-ne-beto-pon-tee
or ‘the Whistlers’ as most humans call them. The
Whistlers are a small species with an average mass
of 25 kilograms and a length of 40–60 centimeters.
They resemble large, fat and hairy caterpillars with
up to 96 small legs, the front six of which are larger
and more coordinated than the other 90.

Cadion

Whistlers have four sexes: male, female, neuter
and matcher. The males and females are the only
Whistlers capable of reproduction, which they do with
great alacrity. In fact, meeting to mate and produce
offspring is their sole obsession. When not mating,
they go dormant and recede into one of several
crèche types until summoned by a matcher. Matchers
use their well-developed olfactory senses to locate
suitable males and females to mate and then match
them with one another. Once found, they call them,
sometimes over a distance of up to 20 kilometers, to
travel to a designated location for mating purposes.
Most calls are made at a frequency of 50kHz, so
humans cannot hear them with the unaided ear.
Mating is a long, drawn-out affair with rituals, feasting
and ultimately the act of mating itself, all of which is
presided over by the matcher, whose pheromones
and musk make procreation possible. Matchers
typically manage two to six mating pairs at a time so
they are busy going from one site to another to follow
the process through to completion. Once mating has
been accomplished, mating pairs are split up never
to see one another again. It is assumed this is an
adaptation that ensures genetic diversity.

The fourth Whistler sex is the neuter, incapable of
reproduction. Neuters are the most industrious of
all Whistlers and responsible for the construction
of crèches, mating pagodas, airsails and just about
any of the other contraptions the species uses.
Neuters are the only sex that can ‘whistle’ in the
lower frequencies and therefore the only ones who
can speak with humans without the assistance of
a frequency modulation device. In fact, neuters
are also the only sex that is actually interested in
speaking with humans. Matchers are far too busy
matching and both males and females are either
dormant or too obsessively engaged in the mating
sequence to bother with anything else.

It is unknown when humans and Whistlers began
interacting but the world was settled by the Vilani,
so the relationship goes back millennia. It is likely
that Whistlers had independently achieved TL1–2
based on the fossil record but no one really knows
for sure. Solomani settlers came to Night during the
Rule of Man, attracted by its rich natural resources
and planetoid belts. The Solomani discovered –
as the Vilani did before them – that living on the
world of the Whistlers has an effect on human
physiology. The pheromones and pollens given
off by the creatures noticeably change human
behaviour. While all humans can technically mate

with one another provided there are no physiological
ailments or other disabilities that prevent it, long-
term exposure to the Whistlers causes humans to
segment themselves into breeding groups. Males
and females devote themselves to the practice of
reproduction, aided by the skills of ‘matchers’ who

* in the human adaptation of the practice – form
the third part of a polyamorous threesome, which
contain two males and a female or two females and
a male. The ‘neuters’ among Night’s humans are
physically capable of mating but choose a life of
celibacy, focusing instead on the construction and
maintenance of Night’s rather well-developed high-
tech society. An interesting side effect enjoyed by
the human neuters is a virtually unmatched ability
to focus and concentrate on a task at hand. This
supreme ability has enabled Night to achieve the
Imperial maximum Tech Level in spite of the fact that
the world receives relatively few visitors due to its
isolated location.

The ‘Whistler effect’ wears off of most humans after
a few months off planet. Those who leave Night
often have a difficult time readjusting. Being born
with strong biological imperatives and then having
them stripped away has rather severe psychological
effects and can cause depression and even suicide
among those who leave. Departing humans also suffer
withdrawal effects that can take weeks to overcome.

Night is designated as an Amber Zone to warn visiting
Travellers of the effects that come from cohabitation
with the world’s native intelligent species. The Imperial
Navy base in the system maintains a mostly separate
existence for obvious reasons but naval personnel
may sometimes be found on planet for short periods
of time, after which they are subjected to a physical
examination and pollen cleansing to ensure no long-
term effects occur.

The Imperial Navy and bureaucracy are keeping a
close eye on Night. The effects of exposure to its
native alien species are localised, and seem to wear
off after a short period of time offworld, but should
a mutation occur or some other happenstance by
which the effects became permanent and could be
exported to neighboring worlds, the Imperium could
have a huge problem on its hands. The developing
Imperium used to ‘cleanse’ such worlds in the past
but now tries to manage them more carefully. At
the very least, a Red Zone designation might be
warranted should any changes occur in Night’s
unique ecosystem.

Cadion

TRAVELLER

CREATING OO-NE-BETO-PON-TEE (WHISTLER) TRAVELLERS
Whistlers rarely leave Night but when they do they must typically take a decent number of their kind with
them. The unique cooperation among the four sexes must be maintained at some level or they tend to
wither and die. Some neuters are an exception and can become capable independent crew members
aboard a starship or participating members of an alien society.

When away from Night, a group of Whistlers spreads out into whatever abode they have been confined to,
preferring to have space between each other until called upon by a matcher for the mating rituals. Neuters
build various structures in anticipation of their use by the other three sexes. If brought onto a starship,
Whistlers begin to have an effect on a human crew after 4–6 weeks that is similar to what occurs on Night.
In fact, Whistlers have a similar effect on many alien races, including all Major Races except the Hivers,
half of whom have no sense of smell.

For the purposes of roleplaying, only the neuter sex is recommended. The extreme focus of matchers,
males and females make them less-than-capable Travellers.

CHARACTERISTICS
Roll Whistler characteristics as follows: D3 for STR, END and SOC, 1D+4 for DEX, 2D-1 for INT and
2D for EDU. Whistlers are not actually less intelligent than the Major Races but the reduced Intellect
reflects their extreme focus and specialization.

TRAITS
Whistlers have the following traits:

Sticky Feet: Whistlers have sticky and clawed feet that enable them to climb just about any surface.
Sneaky: Whistlers automatically have Stealth 2 due to their quiet, unassuming natures.
High-frequency Communication and Perception: Whistlers can hear sounds from an extremely low
20Hz to a high of 60kHz.

Reference
Reference is located at the nominal center of the
Imperium and is almost exactly on the central
plane of the galactic disc. It is the administrative
headquarters of the IISS and the primary data
storage archive of the Imperium.

The world has a long and convoluted history and
has been known by many names. The Vilani called
it Shiishuusdar, which was apparently the name of a
despised member of their nobility. They used the planet
to test new weapons systems, which explains many
of the black craters and burn marks on its surface that
are still visible today. The Vilani eventually installed
an extensive data storage network deep in the bowels
of the planet, upon one of which they stored a copy
of the Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin (AAB), the
sum total of Vilani historical knowledge. During the
Interstellar Wars, the Solomani dismissed the planet
as a worthless rockball and evacuated it but otherwise
left it intact, never realising what it contained. Refugees
from various worlds occupied its subterranean warrens
during the Long Night, and called the planet Mamatava,
but the colony died out after a few centuries. During the
era of the Sylean Federation, the planet was renamed
Aadkhien for the corporation that purchased it.
Aadkhien eventually went bankrupt and once again, the
world was left barren. The world was then rediscovered
by the Scout Service in the early 300s, during the reign
of Porfiria. The Scouts were in the midst of the First
Survey and when investigating Aadkhien, they found
the Vilani archives. This was a monumental discovery
but it took the scouts years to decipher and replicate
the computer interfaces needed to access the data in
the archives. During the process, the IISS decided the
world would also be an ideal location for the storage of
an Imperial archive. They renamed the world Reference
and immediately began to assemble a powerful
computer network substrate which would serve as the
backbone of the project. The project evolved over time
from being a strictly data-oriented project to a dedicated
storage site for artefacts and samples found throughout
Imperial space and beyond.

Reference is now host not only to the Scout Service
but also to Core Research Station Alpha and the
prestigious University of Aadkhien, which specializes
in astronomy, physics, cosmology, planetology and
sophontology. The capital city of Reference is called
Encyclopaediopolis, the city center including a grid of
towers, each of which representing an Imperial sector
and organised in the same order that they are found
in Charted Space. Each tower is one kilometer long,
100 meters wide and a variable number of storeys tall,

depending on how much space is required to store the
data, artefacts, heirlooms and samples for the sector
it represents. Most towers are up to one and a half
kilometers high. In some cases, the data and collected
samples for several worlds can be contained on a
single storey. In others, multiple storeys are required
for a single world, such as Capital, Vland or Terra. Not
all data is publicly accessible and there are secure
rooms and vaults that contain confidential information
and materials, some of which have remained secret for
centuries. The sector towers are separated by four-
kilometer-wide spaces within which there are residential
districts, shopping centres and other amenities.

On the outskirts of Encyclopaediopolis, there are
additional towers devoted to the Vargr Extents, Aslan
Hierate, Zhodani Consulate, Hive Federation, the
Two Thousand Worlds and the Solomani Sphere,
all of which are also organised as they are found on
the map of Charted Space. There are also hundreds
of warehouses on the southern periphery of the city
that are used for the storage of items too dangerous,
obsolete or in many cases too large to store within
the borders of the city. The university and research
station grounds are to the nominal north of the
city but their respective grounds are linked to
Encyclopaediopolis by a shared data network and
maglev transportation system.

While the Encyclopaediopolis facilities are made open
to Imperial citizens on a case-by-case basis, the vast
majority of users are accredited scholars, students
working on post-graduate theses, members of the
Scout Service and other Imperial officials.

Reference is a key strategic resource for the Imperium
and is well defended by the Imperial Navy and Scout
Service. Two full naval squadrons are present in the
system and the scouts maintain both a fleet of auxiliary
ships and a decommissioned Azhanti High Lightning -
class cruiser that is reserved for important operations.
The official name of the cruiser is that of the ancient
Vilani archives, Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin , but
the scouts call her the Librarian or ‘Libby’ for short. In
addition to these, there are almost always elements
from the Core Sector Fleet present in the system.

In addition to serving as custodians of
Encyclopaediopolis, the scout base includes extensive
training facilities and a specialized fleet of x-boats and
tenders. When new and important discoveries are
made, the x-boat fleet is activated and its spacecraft
are sent to Capital and other key worlds. The last major
data dump to Reference occurred in 1065 when the
Second Grand Imperial Survey was completed.

Cadion

**ENCYCLOPAEDIOPOLIS**

Second Reference
Reference contains the largest body of information and artefacts ever collected by Humaniti. The planet,
and more specifically the data it contains, is of immense strategic importance to the Imperium. For that
reason, the Imperium allegedly keeps a ‘Second Reference’ at some undisclosed location. Many x-boats
and long-range scout/couriers are said to carry secure, encrypted updates to Second Reference frequently
in order to keep the two facilities as synchronised as possible.

Information travels at the speed of jump and the same can be said for the preservation of Reference’s data
stores. There is no other practical way to ensure this happens other than for starships to physically carry
it there. That said, the location of this alleged Second Reference is a mystery. There are many rumors
about its location, none of which have been confirmed by physical evidence. No starships have been
directly tracked making the journey to Second Reference but then the scouts would do everything in their
power to maintain its confidentiality. Some believe that a complete copy of Reference’s data is on Zikhi, the
system at the exact opposite corner of the Core. Others believe it is far away on a remote system in the
Empty Quarter. There are those who think it is not in the Imperium at all but in fact on an unincorporated
world in Star’s End, perhaps Enola or Miramon.

The idea of a backup with a nearly complete copy of the data is entirely conceivable but there is simply
no way to replicate the artefacts and samples at Reference. However, some surmise that Second
Reference is the storage site for unusual samples and the most dangerous artefacts, perhaps Ancients
devices that could pose a threat to Imperial security, should they fall into the wrong hands. All of this is
idle speculation, of course.

Whatever the case may be, the Intelligence Branch of the Scout Service is tight-lipped about it and only
those with the highest levels of authority and clearance know anything about Second Reference... that is, if
it even exists.

# CH'NAAR

Ch’naar is dominated by its capital, Aursis, which
owns four other worlds in the subsector. Aursis
has owned Okefir and Vala since they were initially
colonized in the year 57 but more recently acquired
Diam Kani and Siniir Sa. Aursis allegedly has its
sights set on Anshar as well. Duchess daMae of
Aursis claims that Aursis’ presence on so many
worlds is necessary to prevent a full-blown Chanestin
insurgency from the Dunea subsector. Dubious
Imperial intelligence officials and the Duchess’ rivals
in the Moot have expressed concern that she is
overstepping her boundaries and attempting to carve
out an empire within the empire. Despite the Duchess’
ravenous appetite for worlds, the Imperium has thus
far resisted the urge to rein her in. The Sector Fleet
has made some noise about sending squadrons to
Zagi Uun to monitor the situation more closely but no
moves have been made as yet.

Critics in the media and at court wonder if the whole
thing is not just an elaborate bit of political theatre.
The threat of a Chanestin insurgency is real and the
presence of a bold and boisterous counterweight
in the region might actually serve the Imperium
well. While the Imperial Navy Admiralty has often
expressed concern about Aursis’ aggression towards
its neighbors, it could be a case of ‘they doth protest
too much’. Aursis’ strong presence in Ch’naar might
block the Chanestin from further expansion. It might
well be that the Imperium is wilfully letting Aursis flex
its muscles in the region so that the Imperial Navy
does not have to.

As for the worlds conquered by Aursis, they have
been – to this point, anyway – mostly low-population
systems with only minor holdings. Despite dramatic
shows of force when taking each star system,
Aursisian troops actually encountered little to no
resistance when acquiring Diam Kani and Siniir Sa.
Furthermore, Aursis has not instituted martial law on
any of the captured worlds; if anything, laws have
become less restrictive under the Aursisian aegis.

The one exception is Okefir, whose gradual rise in
technology and increasing population has spurred an
independence movement. Aursisian occupiers have
made it quite clear to the Okefiri that they have no
intention of granting the world self-rule. An Okefiri
resistance movement has begun to form and they
like their chances against their oppressors. While
Aursis has a significant technological advantage, the
harsh desert environment of Okefir is not something
Aursisian troops are used to and a war of attrition
could come out in Okefir’s favor.

Headquartered at Aursis, the 150th Fleet consists of
six squadrons and is heavily used as an instrument of
force and intimidation throughout the subsector. The
bulk of the squadrons maintain an ominous presence
in the Ekhuurme and Dimanaam systems, where the
Duchess claims she is keeping a watchful eye on the
Chanestin worlds to trailing for the sake of Imperial
security. Ekhuurme has a large Chanestin minority
whom the Aursisians gleefully oppress. The flagship
of the 150th is a hardy prototype of the new Voroshilef -
class battleship which the shipyards at Dimanaam
hope to make a staple of the Sector Fleet. The less-
well-appointed 150th Colonial Fleet is tasked with
patrolling Ch’naar’s spinward flank.

Tensions run high in Ch’naar, with nine systems
designated as Amber Zones. Many of these worlds
have been spurred into action to help prevent
Chanestin incursions and their Amber Zone
classifications reflect a heightened level of anxiety. For
their part, Chanestin populations profess not to know
what all the fuss is about. They have made it clear that
they see themselves as a distinct culture, worthy of
all the rights and protections afforded to the Lancians,
Luriani and Antareans in other sectors. They have
not violated Imperial laws in any way, shape or
form and see no reason for the Imperium to fear
them. Furthermore, they claim to have no territorial
aspirations beyond those of their original 25 worlds.

**CORE**

###### CH'NAAR subsector

**DUCHESS COLYERE HAJESTA DAMAE**
Even in an empire with trillions of sophonts, there
are outsized personalities who dominate worlds,
subsectors and sometimes even entire sectors.
Such is the case in the Ch’naar subsector where
the Duchess Colyere Hajesta daMae rules the
roost. The duchess has had a distinguished – if
controversial – career, starting with her military
service. Born to the nobility on Cobham in the Old
Expanses, daMae’s family had a multi-generational
history of service in the Imperial Navy. Young
Colyere created a stir by breaking tradition and
opting for service in the Imperial Marines where
she fought in brushfire wars against Solomani
insurgents on the Imperial border, rising to the
rank of brigadier by the age of 30. Despite the
misgivings of her family, there could be no doubt
that Colyere was a born leader.

After retirement from the military, she became
the matriarch of her family and countess of her
homeworld. She was sent to Capital to join the
deliberative body of the Moot. Colyere had a
talent – some would say a misguided one – for
boiling issues down to their basic elements and
cutting through any red tape that got in her way.
Her abrasive style got her into conflicts with her
fellow nobles, a few which came to fisticuffs, and it
soon became obvious that if the Moot Spire were
going to remain standing, Colyere would have to
be reassigned.

Emperor Strephon learned to rely upon Colyere to
give him uncensored opinions about a number of
issues including what she thought of his leadership
style. Most of the peerage kowtow to the Emperor
and there are few among them willing to tell him
exactly what they think, which makes nobles like
Colyere invaluable. After problems with Chanestin
insurgents began to plague Ch’naar, the Moot
reassigned its subsector duke and put Colyere in
his place, purportedly at the behest of the Emperor.
That was 20 years ago and things have changed
dramatically since then.

Colyere is a large and intimidating woman who
usually has a scowl or sneer on her face. She is an
aging lioness but one who still has a considerable
bite. She refuses to use anagathics to preserve
her youth but maintains a strict dietary and
exercise regimen and consumes high-tech nutrient
supplements in an effort to stay fit as a fiddle.

TRAVELLER

Diam Kani
Diam Kani is the site of a failed terraforming experiment
in which genetically engineered ‘airplants’ – a collection
of oxygen-producing purplish-black plants, fungi and
lichen – were strategically spread over the desert world’s
surface in an effort to thicken its atmosphere. The original
expedition to the world failed to find aquifers or other
sources of liquid water and funding dried up before
they could import the needed hydrogen and nitrogen to
make things work. Nevertheless, the resilient genetically
engineered airplants have grown in abundance, extracting
nitrogen and oxygen from the soil and distributing it
into Diam Kani’s otherwise inhospitable atmosphere.
Unfortunately, the planet’s lack of a magnetic field, small
size and proximity to its orange main sequence primary
means oxygen generated by the airplants is bled off at
a slightly slower rate than it is generated. In time, the
ravenous airplants will consume most of the oxygen from
the soil and leave the world an even more dried-out husk
than they found it.

When Aursis acquired Diam Kani, it was assumed they
would find a way to jumpstart the terraforming project
and get things back on track. However, this was far from
their intentions. Aursis has converted Diam Kani into a
‘war world’, a place where squabbling systems in Ch’naar
come to air out their grievances with one another so they
do not have to wreak havoc on their own environments.
Apparently, the idea originated from a chance encounter
with a high-ranking Aslan member of the Imperial Guard.
The Aslan told stories about the ruling clans back in the
Hierate, who designated certain inhospitable worlds
as neutral locations where conflicting clans could go to
conduct forms of ritual warfare. This enabled them to
resolve disputes without wrecking valuable landholds on
their own worlds.

So far, Diam Kani has only been the site of a few small
battles, all of which were staged to resolve disputes
between bickering nobles. The wreckage of each
conflagration has been left behind on the planet like so
much rubbish. Subsequent battles have used the burned-
out chassis of tanks and APCs from previous conflicts
as cover and field fortifications. Salvagers are allowed to
scour dormant battlefields at their leisure but the hostile
environment of the planet prevents all but the most well-
geared crews from doing so.

While the war world concept has yet to fully catch on,
megacorporation Instellarms and other weapons dealers
have set up shop at Diam Kani to sell their wares. Diam
Kani’s atmosphere is very thin but rich in oxygen, which
means that demonstrations of mid-tech conventional

arms produce impressive pyrotechnical displays. The
ring of territory extending from approximately 100–
250km from the starport is used for all sorts of weapon
demonstrations, many of which result in big sales for
the corporation. In fact, sales have been so brisk that
Instellarms invested in the starport, upgrading it from
Class C to Class B, in order to accommodate the rush of
customers to the planet.

Meanwhile, critics have come to question the feasibility
of the war world concept. In the Core, most disputes are
resolved diplomatically. While armed conflicts certainly
occur from time-to-time, the Core is supposed to
represent the peak of human achievement. Designating
worlds like Diam Kani as places to kill one another might
have a deleterious effect on civilization. The battles that
have been held on the world so far could definitely have
been resolved with less loss of life and property damage.
In fact, some question whether these wars would have
occurred at all if a venue such as Diam Kani did not exist.

Gidekis
Count Rolfo Menderis of Gidekis is originally from Night
in the Cadion subsector where he made his riches
producing advanced quantum microprocessors for
the Imperial Navy. The Menderis Corporation remains
a powerful, multi-subsector operation and competes
well against megacorporations in the same industries.
Menderis was awarded a noble patent for his efforts and
assigned the Gidekis, Gandar and Shueshlar systems
as his county. During the reign of the previous subsector
duke, Menderis had virtual free reign to administer the
worlds under his purview. He designed and appointed
each of their respective governments, traded freely
with whomever he wished and influenced the current
governmental structure of Khea, a key world of the
old Chanestin Kingdom. Under the current subsector
duchess, he finds himself considerably more restrained.

Gidekisian government is based on a high degree
of specialization with each of its widespread oceanic
provinces focused on a unique industry. The largest
‘continent’ in the Gide (the word used for the planet’s
worldwide ocean) is Lemuria, which consists of a series
of cities built on seamounts and floating grav platforms.
Lemuria is the primary processing center for the Gidekis
fishing industry which, like most Gidekisian operations,
is highly automated. Other continents are focused on the
fishing operations themselves, aquaculture and deep-sea
mining. The high technology at Gidekis’ disposal means
that little labour is performed by human hands but instead
done remotely using specialized robots. These robots are
designed on Gidekis and manufactured on Gandar.

Ch'naar

Menderis’ operations have recently come under scrutiny
by Aursisian authorities who have threatened to impose
a subsector-wide embargo on trade with the Chanestin
worlds. However, evidence suggests that Menderis has
not reduced shipments to them at all. While there are
no Imperial laws that prevent trade with the Chanestin,
Menderis must tread a fine line. He does billions of
Credits of business with Aursis and does not want to
jeopardise his contracts with the subsector capital.
Aursisian government agents and auditors are trying
to catch Menderis in the act of smuggling goods to
prohibited worlds in Dunea subsector but have so far
been unable to prove that anything is amiss. Despite the
lack of a ‘smoking gun’, Aursis is pulling out all the stops
to drive Gidekis into submission. Aursisian diplomats are
attempting to curry favor with the government of Zimmel,
which owns Gandar. Aursis wants Zimmel to force Gandar
to expel Menderis’ manufacturing operations on the world
if they continue to flout the embargo. Menderis provides
a lot of jobs on Gandar and Zimmel is hesitant to rock
the boat; however, the Duchess of Aursis has promised
that the Emperor will assign baronies to the Anarchs of
Zimmel should they comply. This tangled web of corporate
and political influence has yet to be resolved. Meanwhile,
Menderis is content to keep all of his operations running
smoothly until he finds himself forced to do otherwise.

Hiilev
Hiilev is home to a human Minor Race of sorts but not
one seeded there by the Ancients. The Hiidamo are
descended from Vilani colonists who came to the world
during the early settlement of Ukan (the Vilani name for
the Core sector). It seems likely that they were genetically
engineered to survive the conditions of the planet. They
settled the lowlands of Hiilev’s richest river valley and
developed dark and leathery skin that protects them from
exposure to the harsh rays of the system’s primary star.
The Hiidamo have large, overdeveloped lungs that can
extract oxygen from the planet’s very thin atmosphere and
filter out its sulphur-dioxide taint.

The Hiidamo have a xenophobic culture and did not
take well to the arrival of Imperial colonists in 420. The
newcomers were more interested in gaining access to
the world’s rich sea life than encroaching on Hiidamo
territory but conflicts between the two groups occurred
nonetheless. The colonists had superior technology and
some factions among them wanted to commit genocide
on the Hiidamo. A colonial militia began to systematically
search for and destroy Hiidamo settlements, killing every
man, woman and child in several of them. Fortunately,
cooler heads prevailed before the natives could be
scoured from the planet and the colonists left the
remainder alone. The two have learned to live separately
in the intervening centuries.

Krain and Mirror
The Geonee Alakavala Corporation from the Massilia
sector has been buying up property and industrial capital
on Krain and Mirror, two worlds with suitable environments
for the high-gravity-oriented human Minor Race. The
Geonee are eager to get a foothold in the Core market
and an overemphasis on military matters in Ch’naar has
them believing they can make a splash by focusing on
commercial pursuits by rapidly increasing the Tech Levels
of both worlds and making them viable players in the
heavy machinery and automation industries. The Geonee,
who tend to govern with a light touch, believe their values
will be embraced by the locals of these two worlds, each
of which has a remarkably free society.

As a species, the Geonee are highly focused on
ownership. They very much want to know who owns what
and, furthermore, what they can obtain for themselves.
This cultural trait has been a bit jarring for some of the
long-time residents of these worlds. While both worlds are
barely populated, and there is plenty of land to be had,
the aggressive approach of the Geonee has made their
arrival feel a bit more like an invasion than a business
venture. For their part, the Geonee have expressed that
they merely want to know where the lines are drawn so
they do not offend the locals. They also want to know
what is up for grabs so they can establish ownership of
the things they believe they will need to be successful.

The Geonee are common in Imperial space and may be
found on a number of worlds. They usually segregate
themselves into ethnic communities but are quite
gregarious and branch out into society by taking roles
in engineering and business. One of the more eccentric
aspects of the Geonee is that they believe they are
the descendants of the Ancients. While others find this
dubious, the Geonee seem to be quite assured of their
heritage. Knowing that Geonee often seek out worlds
with Ancients sites has caused a bit of a stir in the region.
Neither Krain nor Mirror are known to have been graced
by the Ancients but the mere presence of the Geonee has
drawn archaeologists and speculators to these worlds for
a fresh look.

Mirror is a highly unsettled world with a great deal of
hydrogen sulphide in its oceans, deposited there by its
many active volcanos. The world is so named because of
the reflective properties of its oceans. This visual oddity
may have increased speculation of an Ancients presence,
even if it is merely a chemical phenomenon. In fact, the
Geonee are mostly interested in this world because
it reminds them of Shiwonee, their highly unstable
homeworld. Shiwonee is troubled by extensive climate
change, which precipitates the nomadic movement of the
Geonee people.

Ch'naar

The pride of Dimanaam Shipyards is the
_Voroshilef_ -class battleship, a hardy, versatile,
well-armed capital ship that is built to last. The
_Voroshilef_ is designed with a war of attrition in
mind. In naval circles, it is called the ‘doomsday
dreadnought’ not because it is more capable
than other ships but more so because it is not.
Its designers assert that its slightly lower Tech
Level makes it invaluable in the event of a large,
drawn-out interstellar conflict. At TL13, crews will
be better able to maintain the _Voroshilef_ with parts
on hand and would not have to rely on the ready

**BATTLESHIP CLASS:VOROSHILEF**

availability of TL15 replacements and materials.
Hubris in the Admiralty has made the Voroshilef
program a controversial one. The Imperium
mostly builds ships designed to win short battles
with overpowering force. Only the most pragmatic
officers of the flag are willing to entertain the
notion that the Imperium could get drawn into
a long, difficult conflict. Should the project take
hold, Dimanaam expects to massively expand its
shipyard and attract a large labour force to build
many more ships of the class.

# DUNEA

Dunea was once home to the Chanestin Kingdom,
an interstellar empire conquered by the Imperium
in the year 2. The Chanestin worlds were pacified
and some occupied for a time before being turned
over to self-rule. Even after over 1,100 years of
Imperial citizenship, the Chanestin people have
clung to their cultural heritage and have found it
difficult to assimilate. All eight of the Amber Zones
in the subsector have been designated due to the
activity of Chanestin separatists. A great deal of
unrest has sprung up on these worlds and there is a
burgeoning movement to create a Chanestin cultural
zone similar to that of the Sylean Worlds. Cultural
zones have been afforded to human Minor Races
and cultural groups that have found it difficult to fully
accept Imperial hegemony. While the Emperor is
considering the possibility, he does not want to set
a bad precedent. The Imperium wants to emphasise
inclusion, not division. If too many groups are granted
cultural zones, the Imperium could become a fractious
entity, which is the last thing the Emperor wants.

The Emperor must tread a fine line with the Chanestin
Crisis. The Imperium has had to put down revolts
before and they are unpleasant affairs to say the
least. The Chanestins have little in the way of
resources to stage a bona fide revolt and everyone
knows this. With ultra-high-tech surveillance gear and
highly trained counterinsurgency operatives at their
disposal, the Imperium has the upper hand. Without
the ability to actually make things uncomfortable for
the Imperium, it would appear that the Chanestins
do not have much of a leg to stand on. However,
this is the Core and appearances are important.
The Emperor certainly does not want to see a multi-
world insurgency occur in his home sector, even one
hopelessly doomed to fail. The Moot is divided on the
subject. While some are determined that the Imperium
must draw a line in the sand and deny the Chanestin
request, others believe it to be more expedient to
simply give them what they want so that the Core can
move on to more pressing matters.

Meanwhile, the Imperium has done what it can to
keep the peace. None of the Chanestin worlds are
under Imperial military rule but the armed forces do
have a presence on most of the systems that they
claim. The Imperial Navy 132nd Fleet, headquartered
at Uundizi, keeps a watchful eye on the Chanestin

worlds and has been quick to respond when there
are riots, mass insurrections or terrorist acts. In
addition to its role as a link on the x-boat routes, the
Scout Service way station at Ginnekar also maintains
a small fleet of jump-6 couriers to keep Capital
abreast of current events should things go awry.

The coreward portion of Dunea has a moderate-sized
stellar gap, which makes for a somewhat challenging
passage to the rest of the Core. The worlds in and
around this gap have formed strong commercial
ties with one another, anchored by the efforts of the
Uundizi, Zimmel and Bussirka starports. This trio
would very much like to incorporate the Chanestin
worlds into what could become a vibrant subsector
economy. While the Chanestin buy goods from
coreward Dunea, many of them levy ‘phantom taxes’
on visiting traders. It is against Imperial law to hinder
free trade but making things inconvenient by charging
exorbitant prices for routine services and fuel and
finding other ways to gum up the works are workable
methods to hamper the flow of commerce. The
Chanestin are playing with fire here since free trade
is the law of the Imperium. Should tensions escalate,
the Imperial Navy could apply a form of gunship
diplomacy by taking over starport operations on the
Chanestin worlds and forcing them to play fair. The
Imperium sincerely hopes it does not come to that.

Keshi
Keshi is the former capital of the Chanestin Kingdom,
an empire of 25 star systems that lasted for nearly
1,300 years. The Chanestin Kingdom rebuffed
both the Sylean Federation and its successor
state, the Third Imperium, and ultimately engaged
in a 100-year war with both empires. After losing
the war, Keshi became the cultural and spiritual
center of the Chanestin people and took on an
unexpected role: antiquities collector. Fearing
that their culture would be erased from the pages
of history, the disenfranchised Chanestin nobility
retrieved paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, archived
holovideos and just about any other art forms and
records that they could get their hands on from the
former worlds of the kingdom. Entire bridges, towers,
monuments and other architectural pieces were
disassembled and transported to Keshi where they
have been reconstructed for the public to marvel at.

**CORE**

###### DUNEA subsector

Over the centuries, Keshi amassed such an
impressive collection of Chanestin Kingdom
memorabilia that the world became a destination
for millions upon millions of pilgrims from the other
culturally Chanestin worlds. An ancestor and cultural
fetish worshipping religion has taken the place of the
monarchy that once ruled most of Dunea. The ruling
authority on Keshi is a quasi-religious bureaucracy
known as the Curators. This shadowy group
conceals their identities from the public but professes
to redistribute the profits of their enterprises to
the people. While Keshians are given a universal
basic income, no one except the secretive Curator
administration truly knows how much revenue is
brought in or how equitably it is distributed.

Keshi has partnered with industrial Khea to capitalise
on the pilgrimage and tourism industry, which brings
in a large portion of Keshi’s total wealth. Part of
the appeal of Keshi to the Chanestin people is the
world’s unwillingness to accept Imperial authority.
Keshi and Khea advocate the establishment of a
Chanestin Worlds cultural zone and have actively
stirred up insurgent groups on many of the kingdom’s
former worlds to help support their cause.

Those with Chanestin heritage are not the only
interested parties. Keshi and other Chanestin worlds
are a big tourist draw for foreigners as well. The
unique art, architecture and culture appeals to many
people from elsewhere in the Core and millions of
them make pilgrimages to the region to see the
world’s wonders.

Khii Isis
This world has been called many things. During the
era of the First Imperium, it was known as Gikhii
Iis, roughly translated as ‘desolation’ or ‘dry death’,
which makes sense considering that its original Vilani
colony died out during the Long Night. The world was
resettled during the Chanestin era, who maintained
the tradition of giving it a Vilani name but subtly
changed it to Khii Isis, meaning ‘dry home’. There is
a movement to change the world’s name yet again
to Ekal, which comes from the old Terran language
of Hindi and means ‘solo’. The majority of the world’s
current inhabitants are the descendants of Terran
immigrants who came from the Indian subcontinent.

The Khii Isis binary star system features two nearly
identical red dwarves that orbit a common center of
mass. Khii Isis is in a tidally locked orbit around the
slightly larger of the two stars but has an unusual
day-night cycle due to its occasional proximity to
the second star. When its orbit takes it close to the
companion star, the normally dark hemisphere of
Khii Isis is exposed to dim light, roughly equivalent to
early dawn or dusk.

Khii Isis is host to a number of life forms, all of which
presumed to have been brought to the world by Vilani
colonists. The world itself is unlikely to have developed
life independently although there have been no
definitive studies that prove this to be the case. While
there are no permanent bodies of water on the surface
of the planet, Khii Isis has liquid water underground
in artesian wells and aquifers, percolating to the
surface due to tidal forces from the world’s moon and
companion star. The world’s population expansion over
the past few centuries has necessitated the drilling of
hundreds of additional wells, co-located with the world’s
cities, towns and settlements.

After the Chanestin yolk was thrown off, the locals
quickly evolved into an egalitarian and democratic
society. Cities, towns, villages and even remote
settlements are dependent on one another for
survival in the harsh, dry climate of the world that
has moulded Khii Isis into a society of equals.
Elections are held for all government positions twice
per year, which enables the people to quickly and
easily toss out the old and usher in the new when
things are not working. Voting age is 13, by which

point the Khii Isisians are educated and well aware of
the harsh realities of life on their world. Most citizens
are armed and at least reasonably skilled in the use
of guns and bladed weapons. The equality-oriented
culture of Khii Isis had made its people intolerant of
the nobility. While the world is technically under the
administration of the Marquis Dauve-Oloi Dubois,
he rarely visits Khii Isis, spending the majority of his
time at his manor on Nadir or at Capital.

One term of military service is mandatory for all Khii
Isisian citizens after which most go into farming
or resource extraction. Hardy outdoors-people
sometimes become wilderness and safari guides
for tourists who come to see the planet’s stark and
beautiful vistas, and hunt its unusual animals. The
most elusive of these creatures is the dunvic, also
known as the ‘sandlion’. This 100 kilogram four-
legged predator resembles a Terran lion in form
but is more similar to an armadillo in other regards.
The dunvic is a stealthy animal with a carapace that
provides camouflage, making it difficult to find, much
less sneak up on. Hunters of the creature must take
care lest they become the hunted.

Dunea

Uundizi
The fledgling Third Imperium made Uundizi the focal
point of its efforts to pacify and integrate the worlds
of the Chanestin Kingdom after defeating them.
Uundizi has in many ways become a model Imperial
society, having allowed the Chanestin to keep
elements of their culture that do not pose a threat to
the Imperium. The Uundizians attempted to create
an environment in which the Chanestin might pull
themselves up by their bootstraps during the era of
postwar reconstruction.

Alas, there were those among the Chanestin
who wanted no part of the brave new world that
the Imperium offered and many emigrated from
Uundizi to Keshi or Khea. Imperial citizens were
urged to take part in the Uundizi project by coming
to the world to help rebuild it and, despite the
environmental challenges this posed, the idea had
broad appeal. In the early days of Imperial history,
many worlds in the Core were still recovering from
the Long Night. Chanestin worlds like Uundizi had
survived the era largely intact and provided a ready-
made infrastructure for colonial development. In
addition, Chanestin art and architecture was known
throughout the Core for its beauty and intricacy.

Over time, the Chanestin who remained on Uundizi
became fully acclimated to Imperial society and
there is now no discernible difference between those
who were there 1,000 years ago and the Imperial
colonists who came after. After 10 centuries, there
are very few genetically pure Chanestin, although
many proudly delve into their family trees and
proclaim native heritage.

Uundizian traders continue to reach out to Keshi,
Khea and other Chanestin worlds but even after
a millennium there is little enthusiasm to join the
Imperium. Uundizi commerce primarily flows to
spinward where trade with Ch’naar is strong and to
trailing where Uundizi’s high-tech wares compete with
those of Saregon. Subsector Duke Halaris Olchetomi
has been encouraged to invest in trade junkets to the
ailing Basilling Cluster in Chant but has seen little
in the way of profit there. The duke has a number of
estates along the profitable route towards Ch’naar but
only grudgingly visits the depressing and wayward
Chanestin worlds to rimward.

Both the Imperial Navy and Scout Service have
bases on Uundizi, which is indicative of its
importance to the region. In addition to berthing
the ships of the subsector fleet, the navy base is
a bulwark against aggression from the Chanestin
worlds. The flagship and its auxiliaries include troop
transports should the Imperial Marines be required to
keep the peace.

Uundizi orbits Oliphant, an enormous yellow giant
star that has just begun its journey along the red
giant branch towards an eventual core collapse and
type-II supernova explosion. Oliphant is orbited by
Rive, a white dwarf companion with an eccentric orbit
that takes it dangerously close to the primary every
few thousand years, during which time it accretes
mass from the swollen yellow giant. This has the
potential to result in a type-Ia supernova. Neither
of these events is expected to occur for millions of
years but astronomers are studying the two stars
closely to ensure this remains the case.

Zimmel
For reasons unknown, the highly inviting and
habitable world of Zimmel was devoid of human life
at the dawn of the Third Imperium. Vilani records
discovered at Shiishuusdar (now Reference) indicate
this world was once called Riid and was the site of a
flourishing colony during the era of the Ziru Sirka. It
was overlooked by the Terrans as they made a mad
dash through the sector during the Interstellar Wars,
perhaps noting it on some chart for future settlement.
The Third Imperium looked upon the world with envy
but resisted the temptation to colonize it due to its
proximity to the Chanestin worlds who also had their
sights set upon it.

In an overture to the Chanestin, the Imperium
granted a charter to the Salo Merchant line to
establish a free trade zone on the planet that
serves both parties. The Chanestin worlds and the
Basilling Cluster of rimward Chant have long been
economically depressed. The subsector duke at
Uundizi gladly accepted the Salo proposal in the
hopes it might serve the dual purpose of reviving
Chant and drawing the reluctant Chanestin into the
Imperial fold.

TRAVELLER

THE SALO LOGO
The logo of Salo merchant lines is one small
orange star and two large stars, one red and
one orange, representing the stars of Zimmel,
Gandar and Shaaram. Orange bars connect the
stars to each other. Salo is a multi-subsector
line with its foot in both Dunea and Ch’naar.
While its logo is intended to express the
corporation’s desire to unite the two subsectors,
there is little evidence that either side embraces
the notion. Dunea is largely a refuge for the
Chanestin worlds and Ch’naar is under the
direction of the decidedly anti-Chanestin
Aursisians. The two sides often scoff at the
blind idealism that the logo represents but Salo
has stuck with it thus far.

Zimmel has no government or law to speak of as
Salo is built upon principles they call egalitarian
individualist anarchy. It is libertarian in economic
spirit but culturally driven toward fair and equitable
distribution of wealth. While the two concepts are
seemingly opposed, Salo makes it work by using
technology to ensure that the lower classes are
always provided for. The system seems to work even
if it causes some grousing among the merchant class
who sometimes let slip feelings that it is they who
provide the wealth and therefore they who should
reap all benefits. Since business is booming, there
is plenty of wealth to go around and such grumbling
is mostly swept under the rug. However, should Salo
see a slowdown at some point, there is concern that
the entire system could break down.

To ensure the continued viability of the experiment,
Salo has linked their operation to the vibrant
economy of Ch’naar. A few decades ago, Salo
purchased Gandar, the largest moon of the
neighboring system’s only gas giant. Salo upgraded
Gandar’s starport, invested in a fleet of automated
gas giant-skimming drones and converted the
port into a refuelling station for traders who make
their way to and from Ch’naar. While the move has
significantly enhanced their fortunes, Gandarians
have not entirely taken to the egalitarian anarchy
concept and broken ranks with their parent world.
Gandar has more of a freewheeling frontier culture
and without some degree of law and order, social
structure tends to break down.

Dunea

## SAREGON

Saregon is the Core’s most populated subsector with
286 billion sophonts living on 39 worlds. It has nine high-
population worlds, four of which are industrial. Saregon
is one of the most powerful subsectors in the Core,
second only to Kaskii when it comes to industrial might.
With its rich and growing economy, vibrant jump-1 main
and powerful subsector navy, Saregon is in many ways
the Imperial dream. In others, it is a dystopian nightmare.

Saregon has more than its share of police states and
technologically enforced authoritarian regimes. There
are eight worlds with Law Levels A+, all of which use and
abuse surveillance technology to watch their people’s
every move. The draconian states on Dishadshii, Igla,
Milpa and Dinad take the concept to another level;
citizens are fitted with tracking devices at birth and
forcibly implanted with wafer jacks, neural comms and
neural links during adolescence. These devices are used
to brainwash them and ensure absolute compliance with
the dictates of those in power.

For its part, the world of Saregon is attempting to
show these dictators there is another way. Saregonian
technologists have leveraged the power of artificial
intelligence to create what amounts to a post-scarcity
anarchist utopia. The Imperial Navy has gotten into the
act as well on worlds like Arla and Iimdii where military
rule is giving way to low Law Level societies. After the
chaotic collapse of an authoritarian government on Khuir,
the Scout Service and Imperial Army restored order and
are experimenting with a minimalist legal system that
has yielded good results. Unfortunately, these attempts
to lead by example have not swayed most dictators
in the subsector, many of whom contend that without
extreme laws, their societies would descend into chaos.

Another overriding theme of Saregon is the ongoing
battle between megacorporation Tukera Lines and
sector-wide corporation Achenaar Antilles. Tukera,
which has major holdings in Delphi, has made inroads
in the lower third of the subsector by using their
industrial might to undercut Achenaar Antilles. The
two lines have each accused the other of sabotage,
commerce raiding and other skulduggery. Both have
hired mercenary companies to secure their starships
and industrial facilities. While some of the more
outlandish claims made by the two corporations
have been dismissed by the subsector duke, he has
instructed the Imperial Navy to keep a close eye on
events to ensure they do not boil over into a full-blown
mercantile conflict.

The Imperial Navy’s 273rd Fleet has its hands full in
Saregon, patrolling the Core’s borders, defending
trade routes, quelling problems on its nine Amber Zone
worlds, ensuring corporate conflicts do not escalate
into something more and keeping a watchful eye on
the Chanestin worlds on Saregon’s spinward flank.
The 273rd has 10 full squadrons at its disposal and has
appointed highly regarded officers from the Admiralty
to command them. Saregon has an aggressive,
individualistic and rather unruly subsector culture.
While the Imperium is careful not to play too heavy a
hand, they have deployed the squadrons of the 273rd
Colonial Fleet in an advisory role to many planetary
navies. They must tread a fine line so as not to intrude
upon the affairs of individual star systems but the
general feeling is that more uniformity might mitigate
some of the chaos.

**LIGHT CRUISER CLASS: STARBURST OF EXTREME HEROISM**

The _Starburst of Extreme Heroism_ -class, or _SEH_ -
class for short, is a common sight throughout
Imperial space and may be found serving in many
of the empire’s numbered fleets. It is essentially a

more rounded and streamlined version of the larger
Ghalalk -class cruiser. The form factor of the two
ships is basically the same with less space for bays
and other accoutrements on the SEH.

Dinenruum
Dinenruum is a Trojan planet, perched in the L4
Lagrange point of the system’s orange subgiant primary
and the larger of its two red dwarf companions. The
rarity of this phenomenon makes Dinenruum a natural
wonder of Charted Space.

A few decades ago, the planet was the site of a
large and growing colony and ground had just been
broken on Research Station Delta when catastrophe
struck. The tertiary red dwarf star in the system has
an eccentric orbit that brings it close to the other two
stars every few centuries. It erupted with a two-day
long series of stellar flares that lashed the colony with
radiation. Hundreds of thousands were killed instantly
and many thousands more died a slow and horrific
death from absorbing such a high dose of radiation.
The research station, a more modern structure with
proper radiation shielding, was nearly complete but
soon abandoned without the infrastructure to support it.

The remaining population are mostly transient
corporate workers on Dinenruum to extract mineral
resources. The system’s two planetoid belts are
reasonably rich and have a decently sized belter
community. The University of Ashga is attempting to
raise funds to restore the research station so that local
studies of the rare Trojan planet may resume.

Igla
Igla is governed by the Church of Preservation,
which emphasises that all resources are finite and
restrictions on the use of technology are necessary
for all of its citizens. The beliefs of the church stem
from the Long Night when the collapse of the Rule
of Man and subsequent disintegration of interstellar
trade resulted in the degradation of technological
equipment, which had severe effects for those living in
hostile environments, such as that of Igla. The church
preaches that objects of technology are a gift from God
and worthy of worship in their own right. Adherents to
the religion – including all native-born Iglans by church
decree – thank God for the continued operation of their
technological devices with daily prayers.

Iglan society has multiple castes, each of which has
access to different levels of technology. The lowest
caste is only given access to facilities and equipment
of approximately TL7. The church uses surveillance
technology to monitor how ‘devout’ its citizens are and
grants access to ever-greater levels of technology to
those who show sufficient levels of ‘enlightenment’
with TL14 restricted to the priesthood and the Order
of Fusion, the armed and armored guardians of Igla.
The order pledges fealty to the Imperial Army and are
known for their discipline, selflessness and overzealous
maintenance practices. Their frugality, effectiveness
and efficient use of technology has made them a model

Saregon

for other Imperial Army units in the subsector. Cadre
battalions are sent to other systems to teach others
how to achieve similar results. The order uses these
missions to evangelise the teachings of the church and
recruit parishioners with mixed results. Authoritarian
systems, those with Law Level A+, have been receptive
to their teachings. However, most high Law Level
systems have their own stringent rules and regulations
and sometimes bristle at the notion that their armies
are being taught new ways of thinking. This can cause
friction but cadres are usually allowed to continue with
their instruction. After all, most military budgets are
constrained and proven methods to reduce expenses
must always be given a long, hard look.

Saregon
The Anarque of Saregon is a powerful computer
network that manages the lives of the planet’s 10 billion
inhabitants. All of their basic needs are provided by
automated and sustainable systems so the motivation
to work is limited. In order to provide for everyone,
the Anarque needs a constant influx of raw materials
and natural resources. With a habitable mainworld,
four gas giants, dozens of gas giant moons and a rich
planetoid belt, Saregon might be the ideal world for just
such an experiment. The Imperium is highly suspicious
of unconstrained artificial intelligence, which has put
the Saregonians under the watchful eye of Imperial
authorities but Saregonian culture is open and allows
the Imperium to probe and analyse the system as much
as they like.

The Anarque subdivides the world’s inhabitants
according to needs, so provincial borders vary from
day-to-day even if the location of residents does not.
Most Saregonians do not engage in work as most
understand the concept. However, the system makes
sure to keep the citizens busy with one task or another,
some of which are industrious and some more artistic
or social in nature. All citizens are outfitted with wafer
jacks into which they plug software they need to
perform their assigned tasks. The end result is a culture
that seems to be terribly busy, flitting from place-to-
place, engaged in one activity or another but little of
which appears to be absolutely necessary. Some have
joked that the Saregonians are on a life-long scavenger
hunt forced upon them by its ruling computer system.

The world’s opportune location on a sizable jump-
1 main has made it rich from trade, the bounties of
which are shared among its populace. Wealth is not
shared equally but according to need and relatively
few Saregonians argue with the outcome. Those who

are dissatisfied are encouraged to seek their way
elsewhere and willingly granted exit visas to any of the
other systems in the subsector.

Population is strictly controlled by the Anarque but
this is done subtly so as not to convey the feeling that
one lacks self-determination. Should one province or
another exceed its quota of citizens, sonic inhibitors
in the arcologies impede further conception until the
numbers balance out again. Critics of these techniques
have called them ‘soft eugenics’ but most Saregonians
just see it as the Anarque being practical. Neighbouring
systems such as Sinad, Ganad, Igla and Shakiiga have
runaway population crises that result in an endless
cycle of overcrowding and overdevelopment, and all of
which require authoritarian governments to keep them
from slipping into chaos. Saregon has averted such
problems by turning over the decision making to an
advanced computer system without overtly curtailing
individual freedoms.

Shimaraak
Shimaraak is the homeworld of the Ssienjhiovla,
a species of mollusc-like omnivorous sophonts,
which had developed to approximately TL3 when
discovered by the Ziru Sirka thousands of years ago.
The Ssienjhiovla evolved from a strictly aquatic to an
amphibious species at some point in their evolutionary
development. Shimaraak has a remarkably old and
stable yellow main sequence star, so catastrophic
stellar flares are an unlikely culprit to have brought
about the mutation. In addition to the Ssienjhiovla, the
world has a bountiful and varied ecosphere.

Shimaraak is a large, high-gravity world with a thin,
low atmosphere. The world has few mountain ranges
of note but its shallow oceans are rich in high-
grade metals and rare-earth minerals. The industrial
worlds of Saregon are eager to get their hands on
these untapped resources but the Scout Service
has acquired a proclamation from the Emperor
that denies them access. The scouts would like to
interdict the system but the highly social Ssienjhiovla
have requested that they refrain from such extreme
measures. The Ssienjhiovla have acquired and
adapted to Imperial technology and very much want to
continue being participating citizens of the Imperium.
Slapping an Amber or Red Zone on the world would
segregate them from the interstellar community, which
is the last thing the Ssienjhiovla want. While there is
no scout base on Shimaraak, the scouts visit often and
vigilantly watch over the world.

TRAVELLER

Creating Ssienjhiovla Travellers
The Ssienjhiovla are shelled, mollusc-like species
that are highly adapted to the conditions of their
homeworld. The atmosphere is thin and low with
high gravity, which resulted in the development
of no avian species and enabled many unique
evolutionary paths to occur. The Ssienjhiovla have
smooth, moist skin on their legs that gradually
becomes drier and more porous higher on the
trunk. They have two squat, dextrous feet that
require constant moisturization lest they become
chapped and cracked, causing great discomfort.
The feet have numerous suckers that enable
them to firmly grip just about any surface when
shoes are not worn. It is very difficult to move a
Ssienjhiovla that has anchored itself with its foot
suckers. Their upper bodies have four arm-like
appendages, each of which ends in a malleable,
six-fingered hand. Any of their digits can be made
opposable to the others, giving the Ssienjhiovla
heightened dexterity. They do not have a head;
instead, their brain and sensory organs are
located towards the center of the trunk.

Ssienjhiovla do not hear well by human standards.
The thin atmosphere of their homeworld does not
permit the easy propagation of sound but they do
have exceptional senses of sight and smell. Their
primary mode of communication is the excretion
of various gases and pheromones from their
porous upper bodies. Their olfactory senses can
pick out a large array of smells simultaneously
from a range of up to five kilometers. Reading a
composite of emitted smells from their brethren
and other natural odours gives them an almost
clairvoyant sixth sense. When in visual range, the
Ssienjhiovla also communicate by gesticulating
with their arms and fingers to convey complex
thoughts and feelings to one another. Devices
similar to those used by the Hivers have been
created, which enable the Ssienjhiovla to
communicate audibly with humans.

The Ssienjhiovla are asexual and temporarily
develop male and female parts in order to
reproduce. An individual Ssienjhiovla may
therefore become both male and female several

times over the course of its life. They bear live
and motile young who are almost immediately
independent. The young grow up among the adult
community and are treated like pets until they
come of age, at which point they become peers.

The Ssienjhiovla have a dorsal carapace
that provides strong natural protection. Most
Ssienjhiovla decorate their carapaces by using
naturally occurring acids from Shimaraak to burn
away small portions at the edges in order to
produce what they believe to be an aesthetically
pleasing look.

Relatively few Ssienjhiovla leave their homeworld
but among those who do, the most popular career
choices are the Scout Service, Imperial Navy or
their own planetary navy. They must wear special
clothing, vacc suits and armor to help them
endure the drier conditions and reduced gravity of
human starships.

CHARACTERISTICS
Ssienjhiovla Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics: STR-2, DEX+1.

TRAITS
Ssienjhiovla Travellers have the following traits:

Carapace : The Ssienjhiovla carapace gives them
natural Protection +6.

Composite Imaging : On worlds with Atmosphere
3–7, the Ssienjhiovla can use their senses to
create a detailed composite image of events that
occur out of visual range at a distance of up to one
kilometer provided that they occur within the same
environment, similar to the psionic Clairvoyance
talent. This ability does not work with events that
occur within a sealed environment such as a
starship or behind a vault or airlock door.

Non-verbal Communication : Ssienjhiovla can
communicate with one another over a distance of
up to five kilometers without the benefit of a radio
or other device using their pheromone excretion
abilities and heightened sense of smell.
