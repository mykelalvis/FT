### ASKIGAAK

Askigaak is the seat of the Count of Askigaak, who has ambitions to one day be Duke of Star Lane. The world's population numbers around 90 billion, most of whom are from the native sentient species, the Sigka.  A few million humans and other offworlders dwell on Askigaak's few useable land masses.

The human population is ruled directly by the Count of Askigaak, an unusual situation but not entirely unknown.  An efficient bureaucratic apparatus implements the count's edicts and in general the world is smoothly governed. The starport code refers to the generally-available landing sites – all traffic through the small but efficient highport requires a license from the Office of Interstellar Affairs, one of many specialized departments set up by the government.

Licences are not cheap but easy enough to obtain since they exist primarily to make money for the count. This is technically a restriction of interstellar trade and thus a violation of Imperial High Law but the count gets away with it partly by way of legal obfuscation – presenting the licensing arrangement as a means of paying for the orbital port he built with his own funds – and partly through complex political wrangling that allows the count to derail any investigation into his business practices.

The Sigka are self-governing within their own underwater communities and in constant conflict with ocean-
going predators such as the Sachupe. Some leave their homeworld and journey around the subsector but for the most part they are content to remain in their ocean homes.

The Sachupe have been described as 'horrific tentacled whales... only worse'. They are large deep-water predators capable of a surprising turn of speed, although they cannot turn quickly. Sachupe generally do not need to; their favored attack is a rapid dash at the target with grabbing tentacles or an ambush from behind seabed cover. Smaller prey are grabbed and stuffed into the creature's maw, whilst larger creatures may be rammed before being dragged to the mouth. Sachupe are adept at manoeuvring their prey so the first bite cripples the tail of a swimming creature.

Sachupe are not a threat to an underwater colony's structures but frequently mistake seabed farming or maintenance craft for rivals, prey or potential mates.  They are intelligent enough to know that submarines contain edible creatures and have been known to drag one down below its crush depth or ram a vessel against rocks to crack its hull. Groups will sometimes gather close to an underwater settlement and drift outside, coming right up to viewing ports to peer in and testing the surface with their tentacles.
