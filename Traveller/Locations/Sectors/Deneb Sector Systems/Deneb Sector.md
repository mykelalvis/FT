Domain of the Imperium

# DENEB

Deneb sector lies beyond the [[Great Rift]], around 12 months' travel from the Imperial core aboard a standard jump-2 liner. It is a place of contrasts, with highly developed economies and one of the highest-tech worlds in the [[Imperium]] counterpointed by backwaters and a troubled coreward frontier.

Most of the 385 star systems of Deneb sector lie within the Imperial border, including [[Deneb]] itself. [[Deneb]] is one of the brightest stars in the night sky and, according to local legend, it was the beacon that drew Imperial explorers onward through Corridor and ultimately to the current Imperial frontier in the [[Spinward Marches]] sector.  The truth of this is debatable but [[Deneb]] has been used as a calibration point by navigators for centuries.

The politics of Deneb sector have always been vigorous, with subsector dukes vying for greater influence over their neighbors and incursions by Vargr from just across the coreward border. The region saw bitter fighting during the [[civil war]] of the 600s and there are those who still bear grudges. The Humbolt noble house, architects of Deneb's early expansion, were exiled after the war but continue to cast a long shadow over the region.  Politics is a dangerous game in this sector and even the humblest merchant captain can be drawn into a web of highly complex machinations. Those with ambition can find opportunities here but they must tread carefully; the powers of Deneb are not merciful towards those who interfere in their plans.

## First Impressions

There are distinct regions within Deneb, with their own character. As a general rule, Deneb is more developed than the neighboring Spinward Marches but there are backwaters and frontier zones where centuries of progress seem to have passed unnoticed. In some cases, trade routes run through these regions, which are subject to sporadic attempts to pacify troubled systems or upgrade their economies to make them an asset to the sector as a whole. For the most part, however, backwaters seem destined to remain so.

Between the major worlds, the x-boat routes and merchant shipping lanes are filled with liners and freighters, many operated by large corporations; large-scale freighting and bulk cargo are big business in Deneb. Some extremely long-range freighters come all the way from the Imperial core, terminating at Mora or Rhylanor in the Spinward Marches. More commonly, long-distance cargoes are shipped in stages, sometimes as a whole and sometimes broken up into ever-smaller lots as they move farther from the Imperial heartland.

The most famous world in Deneb is [[Vincennes]], partly for its TL16 and partly for its role as the base of the infamous [[Humbolt family]]. At Vincennes, the FGMP-16 prototype is undergoing second-generation trials.  Organic computers are on the horizon, promising a large improvement in starship automation. Droptank configurations hold out hope of fuel-minimal freighters and liners, and experimental jump-6 [[x-boat]]s are being tested between [[Magash]] and [[Kubishush]], and [[Kubishush]] and [[Vincennes]]. This position at the cutting edge of Imperial technology should make Vincennes the foremost world, and its duke the foremost noble, in the sector. At least, the [[Duke of Vincennes]] thinks so. Others are determined to make sure this does not happen.

There are six Imperial research stations in Deneb sector, pushing the limits of science, yet just a few parsecs away are worlds trapped in a cycle of conflict and economic collapse. Mercenaries, privateers and smugglers find these worlds a constant source of employment, whilst the Imperial Navy struggles to maintain order amid conflicting political directives, corsair raids from across the border and the occasional trade war or armed confrontation between the subsector dukes.

A place of contrasts and one where apparent success can lead to unexpected intervention from a powerful corporation or noble house whose carefully laid schemes have been disrupted. In the words of the great social historian Malden Arkhesaar

> 'Deneb sector: Bright lights. Lots of shadows.'

> [!info]- Sittin' on the Dock
>
> There is a direct correlation between the number of ships coming into a world's port from any given power and the amount of influence it has. Movement of people and goods leads to a merging of cultures, along with the knowledge that the nearby power will quickly come to know about events on the world and is likely to care about them. Thus, jump-1 clusters and mains are important not only in economic terms but also politically – all those little tramp freighters carry culture and political influence from world-to-world.
>
> The converse is also true; an isolated world will perceive less influence from any given power and one of the indicators that a subsector duke wishes to gain control of a world is an increase in the number of ships using its port. Even if these are independents or third-party vessels, it is not difficult to trace the increase back to origins. The intelligence agencies of all duchies keep careful watch on ships coming and going in their ports and there is good money to be made by independents from selling accurate shipping rosters from more distant worlds to the intelligence services. Of course, this third-party information might be sold to more than one client and it might have been manipulated, so wherever possible duchies put their own agents in place or work with trusted regulars who have established the reliability of their data.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

There was life in [[Deneb Sector]] sector long before the [[Ancients]] uplifted humans and [[Vargr]] and seeded them throughout [[Charted Space]]. Much of that life was basic; the progenitors of today's flora and fauna found on many worlds throughout the sector. Even there, a few anomalies exist; species that appear integrated into local ecosystems so well that they seem to have evolved there but which did not. Some transplanted species seem to date back millions of years, long before the Ancients developed the jump drive and began exploring the region.

Various hypotheses exist about how this came to be. Did some species travel the stars of the region in the extremely distant past? This idea is popular among the sort of scientists who get invited to take part in low-budget chat shows but there is no evidence to support it. Is this an extreme case of parallel evolution or did the Ancients integrate these species with local life as an experiment? None of these ideas seem particularly strong but there is no better explanation.

There is archeological evidence of intelligent life in Deneb long before humans or even the [[Ancients]] arrived.  Most of these species got no further than a Neolithic level of tool use and on a few worlds stone-age societies survived until humans colonized the region. The remains of a few cultures that got further and developed a low-tech civilization are studied by Imperial scientists interested in how they came to an end.

It is known that the [[Ancients]] were active in Deneb, leaving behind a few sites of interest and the odd isolated artefact. They seeded humans on some worlds and transplanted the Vargr to the region coreward of Deneb. After the Ancients disappeared, these societies went their own way, with Vargr eventually filtering into Deneb through gradual expansion. Human settlers arrived during the [[First Imperium|First]] and [[Second Imperium]] but it was not until after the Long Night that most of Deneb was colonized by humans pushing through [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]].

Little more than legends remain from these early eras. It is said that the [[Deneb]] system itself was colonized around -2400 by Vilani fleeing the collapse of the [[First Imperium]]. Certainly there were humans of Vilani descent dwelling on Deneb when the first scouts from the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] arrived but Deneb seems a rather odd choice for a place to settle. A sparse system orbiting a giant star, with an uninviting mainworld, Deneb was a lot less welcoming than many other worlds in the region. Some systems were settled around the same time and perhaps one of them was intended as the main colony instead.

Be that as it may, the Vilani colony on Deneb regressed during the Long Night but regained jump technology by the time the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] arrived. Some Vilani colonies died out but survivors were recontacted and formed the basis of the Lidash League, which was extant at the time Imperial explorers arrived.

Similarly, around -1700 a large group of [[Solomani]] exiles settled on [[Vincennes]]. The choice of that particular world remains a mystery; again, Vincennes was hardly the most promising prospect in the region. Conditions were tough enough that the colony died out during the [[Long Night]].  The legend of Vincennes continued to hold a strange fascination for the [[Solomani]] people, however. Another group of exiles would later claim it as their home.

> [[Jehun]] is located on the trailing-rimward fringe of the [[Sabine subsector]] and therefore within the [[Duchy of Sabine]]. It is a garden world, rich and agricultural, but has a small economic base and thus little power of its own. [[Jehun]] should be able to rely on the protection of the subsector fleet but this is subject to the influence of the [[Duke of Sabine]]. The duke does not directly control the fleet's deployments but can apply pressure for ships to be sent there or elsewhere depending on his own agenda and how favorably inclined he is towards [[Jehun]].
>
> Jehun is closer to important worlds in the duchies of Inar and Vincennes than the center of power in Sabine and receives more ships from these regions. Its agricultural exports are of some importance to nearby major worlds - [[Thengin]] in the [[Duchy of Sabine]], [[Kubishush]] in the [[Duchy of Inar]], [[Northammon]] and [[Vincennes]] in the [[Duchy of Vincennes]]. In addition, as a border system, [[Jehun]] is vulnerable to the influence of Inar and Vincennes. Both have repeatedly attempted to gain control, if only to weaken the position of Sabine or each other.

> 1102-110 [[Magash]]/Sabine: Magash warmly welcomes the new Vincennes ambassador to the subsector capital. Sir Rikeb replaces the late Mr. Thaeho of Northammon, who died of natural causes last month while presiding over the embassy. An elite Sabine guard is placed at the disposal of Sir Rikeb.
> 1102-143 [[Kubishush]]/Inar: Several members of an undisclosed noble family were kidnapped in a recent raid by privateers on Hessel. Their release was quickly negotiated in return for processed radioactives, a move condemned by a spokesperson from the Duchy of Sabine. Representatives from Vincennes and Magash have loudly denounced the Hessel kidnapping and called for the Inar subsector fleet to step up patrols in the region.
> 1102-190 [[Northammon]]/Vincennes: The execution of a Sabine diplomat accused of espionage has drawn condemnation from the Duchy of Sabine. Sources on Vincennes state that the diplomat was found offworld, in the Peres system, in possession of classified research data. In a strongly worded statement, Sabine protests that the execution was performed 'without due process'.
> 1102-199 [[Thengin]]/Sabine: A clash between mercenary forces and a vessel of the 195th Fleet off Thengin has been justified by the mercenaries' patron, who claims the subsector forces looked and acted like pirates.

A spokesperson from Sabine dismissed Inaran claims that the privateers were those who previously kidnapped nobles from Hessel and were operating from a base in Jehun. In turn, Inara has issued a statement that the Duchy of Sabine is either harbouring pirates or turning a blind eye to their activities when it suits the duke's purposes and that if Sabine will not take action then others will.

### EARLY EXPLORATION AND SETTLEMENT

The earliest serious attempt to chart and survey all of Deneb sector began in year 60, although [[Scout Service]] vessels had made sweeps much earlier and venturesome traders were pushing though the sector long before official charts were published. The early mapping missions suffered from a disjointed and contradictory brief, the result of pressure from different groups who all wanted different data. The scouts were under pressure to push out rapidly to find resource-rich worlds for exploitation but also to create detailed surveys of each system as they progressed methodically through the sector. Some agencies wanted to know about potential threats, while others were eager to develop the 'big picture' of what lay beyond the Great Rift and pushed for long-range exploration at the expense of detail.

Early explorers also came under threat from corsairs and non-human enclaves which were not always friendly, but nevertheless settlement took place and trade routes were forced through to the new colonies. Resource-rich worlds were targeted for heavy investment by megacorporations, whilst other groups grabbed what land they could in a semi-regulated rush. Later settlement was much more orderly but this was the early days of the new [[Imperium|Third Imperium]]; lessons were still being learned and there was an almost amateurish excitement about the opening of a new region.

In year 34, long before the detailed survey of the sector began, Imperial scouts made contact with the Lidash League, a small state descended from Vilani colonists around Deneb. The League had possessed jump drive technology for some time but was under near-constant attack from corsairs and raiders when not fending off attempts at conquest from nearby Vargr states. In return for a small fleet of obsolescent warships, the [[Imperium]] gained an ally in the region and in year 100 the League's member worlds joined the [[Imperium]] as they crushed local opposition, improved their own security and not coincidentally made Imperial expansion into the sector much safer. In these early actions can be seen a precursor of the modern dukes' machinations – although the [[Imperium]] provided the ships, it was the Lagash League that bore the cost of campaigns against the local Vargr states, with the [[Imperium]] quietly moving into the power vacuum created.

Not all Vargr states of Deneb were hostile. The Atsak Federation was incorporated almost bloodlessly by a combination of diplomacy and blatant display of strength; the Federation was at the time in a state of near-collapse, which was exploited by the Imperial ambassador in a very devious manner. The results of this negotiation have caused problems for the [[Imperium]] ever since, as local worlds did not join the [[Imperium]] as members under the normal system. Instead, their leaders swore allegiance to the newly appointed duke as their overlord – but in his capacity as leader, not an Imperial representative. Today, these worlds have an unusual status as client states of the [[Imperium]], located within the [[Imperium]] and loyal to an Imperial noble but not directly tied to the [[Imperium]].

Settlement of the sector took place between years 80 and 250 or so, spreading spinward from Corridor and outward from major colonies set up on resource-rich or habitable worlds. Incorporation into the [[Imperium]] was immediate for some worlds but some did not join until the 400s.  The local Vargr states proved to be a major obstacle to expansion, resulting in a series of military operations known as the Vargr Campaigns, starting in the 220s.

In addition to naval operations, the [[Imperium]] deliberately targeted some areas for enhanced colonization, attempting to create lasting security by creating strong and stable enclaves that could pacify surrounding systems. One of these was the world of Vincennes, which was placed under the governance of the [[Humbolt family]].

While the Humbolts were pacifying the area around [[Vincennes]], ensuring the way was open for expansion into the [[Spinward Marches]], the nearby [[Pretoria subsector]] was targeted by megacorporate interests. At the time of its incorporation into the [[Imperium]], Pretoria already had extensive shipyards fuelled by the industry of resource-rich worlds. Imperial territory in Deneb reached its current extent in the mid 500s, and development continued at a slower pace thereafter. Many of the sector's worlds 'missed the boat' in this early expansion and, as a result, never received significant investment. These worlds generally remain backwaters to this day. Indeed, there is a general acceptance that if a world had not achieved prominence by the outbreak of the Civil War, it never will.

### THE CIVIL WAR ERA

The [[First Frontier War]], which ran from 589 to 604, was brought to a successful conclusion by [[Admiral Olav Hault-Plankwell]], commander of the Spinward Marches Fleet, despite a lack of assistance from the rest of the [[Imperium]]. Immediately afterward, he brought his fleet to Deneb's naval depot and began to rally support for a drive on [[Capital]]. Elements of the Deneb fleet supported him, although it is not clear how fully understood his intentions were at the time.

Arriving at Capital, Plankwell demanded an audience with [[Empress Jaqueline]] and personally killed her, assuming the Iridium Throne as the first of the [[Emperors of the Flag]]. His reign was short-lived and he was followed by a succession of fleet commanders and high nobles who claimed the throne by right of fleet control or assassination, only to be eliminated in turn.

Amid the chaos of the Civil War, the [[Second Frontier War]] erupted in the [[Spinward Marches]], drawing the Deneb fleet away to support the weak forces left by Plankwell. Ultimately, this was enough and under the command of the new Grand Admiral of the Spinward Marches, [[Arbellatra Alkhalikoi|Arbellatra]], the combined fleet returned in triumph to Deneb. From there, Arbellatra headed for [[Capital]] but chose a different path to her predecessors.

Rather than claiming the throne, she defeated all claimants and declared her willingness to act as regent until a suitable candidate could be agreed upon by the Imperial Moot. Perhaps as she had intended all along, Arbellatra was named Empress by the Moot in [[IY629]].

In the meantime, the situation in Deneb was chaotic. The gravely weakened fleet could not prevent Vargr raids from causing immense damage deep into the sector. Powerful worlds with their own defensive squadrons were safe enough but those lacking fleets of their own suffered raids that went uncountered for years. During this time, Deneb underwent its own miniature version of the Imperial civil war.

The conflict had multiple causes, including attempts by some subsector dukes to become sector duke, factional differences caused by support or opposition to Plankwell, Arbellatra or other Imperial claimants, and resentment over worlds left defenceless by fleet movements. There were several factions, creating a complex situation where alliances suddenly broke down and shocking betrayals were undertaken.

However, the good war quickly turned bad, with attacks on economic centres, shipyards and starports intended to weaken other factions. An alliance between Vincennes and Inar was countered by the other factions putting aside their differences to align against them. With more than half the Deneb fleet headed spinward to defend the [[Imperium]] against invasion, the remainder was drawn into ever more vicious fighting in its home sector.

The 'bad war' came to an end in [[IY622]], when the newly appointed regent [[Arbellatra Alkhalikoi|Arbellatra]] ordered the fleets of the warring factions in Deneb to stand down. Most did, returning to base and eventually being reintegrated into the Imperial fleet. Some refused to accept the regent, however. Among them were the [[Humbolt family]], Dukes of Vincennes and at one point almost rulers of the entire Deneb sector. The Humbolts were eventually chased down and their fleet destroyed in 628, although there are those who claim that the last stand was in fact a clever ruse. If so, the fleet and senior members of the Humbolt family were sacrificed to give the [[Imperium]] a clear target whilst other assets were hidden. Whatever the truth of this, all family members and high-ranking retainers who could be found were exiled from the [[Imperium]]. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

### THE POST-WAR ERA

Reconstruction after the end of hostilities was rapid and helped return stability to the region. This was a severe necessity, since an unstable Deneb imperiled the [[Spinward Marches]]. Lavish investment and genuine attempts to address grievances did much to heal the wounds inflicted in the bad war but there are those who still bear grudges to this day.

In the two centuries after the end of the [[Civil War]], no less than six Imperial research stations were created in Deneb. Among the fields of study were [[psionic]] phenomena and techniques, but by the late 700s psionics were viewed with grave suspicion and the research stations redirected their efforts. The [[Psionics Suppressions]] closed down all overt psionic research, although some of the institutes went underground and may have survived in some form.

Economic and technological development has continued, with long-established major worlds of the sector increasing in power and the backwaters left ever further behind. This has resulted in resentment and unrest but the grumbling of minor world governments can be safely ignored by those who wield power, at least most of the time. When one of the sector's major players begins giving the minor worlds what they want, others take notice.

The landgrabs and powerplays began in [[IY613]], at the height of the [[Civil War]]. At first the conflict was almost polite, with justifications for every action and statements of regret about necessity or blame being directed at others. Conventions of civilised warfare were respected and the early phase of the conflict is generally thought of as being a 'good war' – one in which the damage is limited and combatants try to behave decently.

Usually this comes to nothing; a backwater world that shifts allegiance and receives investment as a reward is not going to change the balance of power overnight.  Occasionally, however, a minor player manages to obtain meaningful concessions by the right gambit at the right time. This is the great hope of most backwater planetary governments; to benefit from the powerplays of the dukes without attracting a backlash.

For example, a letter of marque and reprisal may permit privateers to attack shipping in a particular system but require them to protect or at least leave unmolested ships registered at certain ports.

Whether this is respected by the captors depends a lot on circumstances.

## DENEB TODAY

Deneb is today renowned as a center for innovation and exploration. It is home to the [[Jumpspace Institute]], known throughout the [[Imperium]] as an innovator in starship propulsion technologies, and during the sector's formative years, the Institute was a sponsor of major exploratory efforts into neighboring sectors. Also based in the sector is the [[Sklar Astrophysical Society]].

In addition there are six Imperial Research Stations. Few sectors can boast of similar dedication to research and development, nor such diversity. The Denebian stations pursue a wide range of activities, from experiments in theoretical physics to undersea geological studies.

Another key characteristic is in government itself; there is no sector duke. Megacorporate interests prefer Deneb to be relatively independent of the Imperial hierarchy and the [[Imperial Navy]] finds it easier to deal with Deneb as a collection of subsectors rather than a united sector.
[[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|The Emperor]] sees potential disruption in a united Deneb; there is much truth in this, although it is also a habitual mindset derived from the region's difficult past.

The region beyond [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]] – [[Deneb Sector]] and the [[Spinward Marches]] – are sufficiently isolated that a powerful leader might find a secure base there, with a rebellion or even grab for the Imperial throne difficult to nip in the bud.  This is not paranoia; it has happened in the past. It thus suits the Emperor to keep [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] from becoming united, as several dukes scheming against one another is a lesser evil than one duke deciding to take a unified sector out of the [[Imperium]].

The [[Imperial Navy|navy]]'s high command agrees with this policy. "Case Blue 4408" is a nightmare scenario used in strategic planning, whereby a hypothetical Duke of Deneb declares independence and deploys naval forces to block the narrow approach through [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]]. The [[Imperial Navy]] could break through but the cost would be high. Even without a single leader in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], naval intelligence routinely watches warship redeployments for a buildup at the trailing end of the sector. Current planning is for a rapid-response force to seize key worlds in the region at the first hint of large-scale trouble, acting as a wedge to keep the door from being slammed in the navy's face.

Astute observers gauge [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|The Emperor]]'s concerns about events in Deneb by the movements of heavy squadrons in [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]]. A large-scale exercise near the spinward end of the sector usually indicates something serious is unfolding in Deneb.

The subsector dukes and other great nobility of [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] are often – in some cases constantly – at odds. Normally this is restricted to economic sanctions or cut-throat business practices, manipulation of voting blocks in the Imperial Moot and occasional rabble-rousing. Support of rebels and interference in attempts to put down dissent are more common than in other areas, leading to a situation where local conflicts have become proxy wars between the great nobility.

Direct large-scale conflict is fairly rare, as it attracts Imperial displeasure, and trade wars and armed clashes are accepted by the [[Imperium]] up to a point – better a short war and negotiated resolution than a dispute running for decades. The sector's great nobles must use their own forces to fight these conflicts; the Imperial armed forces receive political direction from the nobility but are not directly commanded and, in any case, are loyal to the [[Imperium]], not subsector nobility.

This does not stop the Dukes of Deneb trying to make use of the Imperial forces. Direct orders to go and attack a neighboring subsector are illegal and will be refused - and might result in a duke being removed from his position. However, some dukes are skilled at putting the forces assigned to their subsector in a position where they have to go along with the duke's plans.  Measures range from deception (faked intelligence, false-flag attacks and so forth) to innocuous requests to put a warship where the duke knows something is about to happen.

When open conflict occurs, Imperial forces attempt to remain neutral. This often puts commanders in the frustrating position of watching a clash whilst repeating endless requests for calm and restraint. These are politely ignored by both factions... who of course will also be loudly protesting the actions of the other side and demanding the navy stop standing idly by and actually do something about the heinous villainy of the opposing faction.

Many medals have been won under difficult circumstances in Deneb; warships shepherding crippled vessels out of a fight, firing only in self-defence despite extreme provocation, or peacekeepers under fire from both sides yet bound by orders not to retaliate unless specific and provably deliberate actions are taken against them. Careers have also been wrecked by split-second decisions that seemed correct at the time.

Service in Deneb is unpopular, not least because any senior commander is likely to be at odds with his subsector nobility from the day he is appointed. 'Playing the navy' is a skill most of the nobility possess and yet naval officers are expected to be polite and respectful to the nobles they know are using them.

Even if Imperial forces can be tricked or coerced into helping a duke fight his neigbours, most conflicts fall upon the household forces of the nobles themselves. Deneb's great nobility has more warships per capita than any other sector except perhaps [[Core Sector|Core]]. These ships tend to be small compared to the vessels of the Imperial Navy but their crews are often very experienced – indeed, navy veterans are actively recruited into household forces, usually at a higher rank than they left the Imperial forces with or at least a better salary.

When open conflict takes place, the [[Imperium]] takes action for any Rules of War violations but otherwise remains neutral. Many of the sector's nobles are in a continual state of cold war with each other, with occasional skirmishing. Mercenary groups of all types are contracted by multiple parties and corporations are often induced to pick sides. At the same time, no one dares attack an Imperial Navy base and no one interferes with, obstructs or provokes Imperial fleets without suffering severe consequences.

### THE IMPERIUM

Most of Deneb is Imperial territory and administered in the same way as other regions. The [[Imperium]] does not directly rule worlds, although special considerations apply where a planet or whole star system is Imperial territory. In these cases, those worlds with a large population have a government like any other inhabited planet, although it is answerable to the [[Imperium]].  Other 'Imperial Worlds' and smaller Imperial territories, such as a major naval base, are treated as installations rather than member worlds, with governance provided by the service using the base or a civilian administration operating on behalf of the population and service. These administrators are usually provided by the Imperial Bureaucracy and such territories are generally places where people go to work for a few years at a time rather than homelands.

A few institutions exist at the [[Imperium]]-wide level.  These include the standard calendar, services such as the Ministry of Justice and Imperial Navy, and the Imperial High Laws. The [[Imperium]] reserves the right to conduct foreign policy at the [[Imperium]]-wide level, although powers are granted to local officials to do as necessary without waiting months for directives from [[Capital]]. Thus, a subsector duke in Deneb cannot declare war on the [[Zhodani Consulate]], as this is an [[Imperium]]-wide decision but some officials are granted specific powers to deal with issues outside the borders as necessary.

### DUCAL POWERS AND PRIVILEGES

The great nobility of the [[Imperium]] are expected to deal with problems occurring in their own area of interest and are generally empowered to do so in whatever manner they think most suitable so long as they do not exceed their remit or break Imperial High Law. Each duke has powers appropriate to his station and location of his territory.

Thus, the Duke of Pretoria is empowered to conduct local foreign policy with Vargr worlds and states just beyond the Imperial border, up to and including the use of military force. He can negotiate treaties, make or cancel major trade deals, grant passage to foreign merchant ships or even warships... but he must be ever mindful that he answers to the Emperor for every decision. Too many small errors or one catastrophe can result in a duke being deposed and replaced by someone more competent. Politics in Deneb are such that some subsector dukes are actively working on schemes to cause just such a disaster for their neighbors.

Devolved powers of this sort are granted to those who make a case for needing them or in many cases come with the position. These 'standing' powers can be revoked at the Emperor's decision but normally remain in place for generations after they cease to be needed.
The Imperial Moot has seen many impassioned speeches and closely contested votes over a decision to revoke an ancient power now completely irrelevant, for no better reason than the holder of that power feels like he is losing face by relinquishing it.

Subsector dukes along the border have the power (it is usually called a privilege) to make deals and use force against worlds and states along the borders. Those further away do not usually have this privilege but may petition the Emperor to be given it. At present, for example, representatives from the Duchy of Atsah are conducting a years-long lobbying campaign for their duke to be given Privileges of Foreign Policy regarding the Vargr states to coreward. This is opposed by representatives of the Duchy of Antra, whose duke does not want someone else empowered to send a fleet across the border.

With no sector duke in place, matters that would normally be dealt with at the sector level either devolve to the subsector dukes or default to the standing [[Imperium]]-wide position. This has some interesting
consequences. For example, the Duke of Usani is entirely within his rights to negotiate a large-scale trade deal with a Vargr world over the border but the Duke of Atsah could embargo that world using his own powers.  This would not prevent ships from the Duchy of Inar from trading there and the Duke of Inar would normally grant passage to Imperial trade ships – including those from Usani – as a matter of course. However, the Duke of Atsah could make a case for enforcing the embargo, even firing upon or seizing Usani ships.

Normally such a matter would be ruled on by the sector duke but without one the case must go all the way to [[Capital]] for adjudication, which is likely to take months or years, on top of transit times. Some inter-duchy issues have been awaiting a decision for decades, either due to complexity or relative importance of other matters. This seems to suit the overall Imperial position; local dukes eventually find some kind of workable solution to their problems and, so long as there is little or no disruption on a wider scale, the endless squabbles of Deneb can be largely ignored.

## GOVERNANCE

Most of the governance of any sector takes place at a low level. World governments set their own laws, maintain forces for security and local defence, and conduct their own affairs. World governments have some limits on their behaviour but considerable latitude within them. Two worlds can even go to war with one another providing they follow the Imperial Rules of War.
When this happens, the local nobility will normally apply pressure to bring the conflict to a close though this is of course subject to the nobles' own agenda. Wars of conquest are not permitted; one world cannot conquer another although outposts on remote outsystem moons can, and do, change hands.

Self-governance is 'internal'. In other words issues that extend beyond a planet's 100-diameter jump limit are automatically of interest to the [[Imperium]], although for the most part, world governments are left to get on with their own affairs. When a dispute or wider issue breaks out, mediation is offered by the Imperial nobility. There is a clearly defined system in place for who deals with any given issue.

The noble associated with each world in a dispute (usually a baronet, baron or marquis) sends a delegation - or occasionally goes personally – to the court of the  next higher multiworld grouping. This is typically a viscount or count if the world is part of a county; if not the matter is dealt with at the subsector duke's court. If the matter is entirely within a given noble's remit then judgement can be issued. If not, there will be further back-and-forth discussion with representatives of the nobles involved until a solution is agreed. Of course, since the nobility do not directly rule worlds, a world government could reject the solution its associated noble has negotiated. This is rare and usually leads to intervention.

Interventions can take the form of warships in the sky and boots on the ground, although far more commonly economic pressure is placed upon the world. Interdiction (Red Zoning for political reasons) is an extreme way of compelling a world to accept a resolution but it happens from time-to-time. Although worlds are self-governing, the high nobility has the power to force compliance when necessary.

Which subsector duke hears a given world's petitions is thus of great importance. Those worlds that lie firmly within the boundaries of a duchy normally have little choice but the political situation in Deneb is such that worlds can sometimes choose which duke they will give loyalty to. This tends to anger a duke who has lost the support of a given world, so the ability of the new liege to protect the world from retribution – which might or might not be very subtle – is important when making such a grave choice.

Worlds in subsectors that do not have a duke in place have more choice – or rather, they can choose with less concern about consequences – than those located close to a ducal seat. However, the allegiance of all worlds in Deneb is theoretically up for grabs. Governance over a greater number of worlds gives a duke increased power and influence, and is seen as a worthwhile goal by most players in the sector's political games. For their part, world governments are very aware that the right choice can benefit them greatly but also know that ultimately they are pawns in the schemes of the great nobility.
Some worlds are extremely loyal and benefit from a close relationship with their duke. Others balance the pros and cons of cooperating with any given great noble. A duke that wants to maintain control over these worlds cannot lose sight of this fact.

> [!info]- The Dukes and the Fleet
>
> Major worlds under the control of the subsector dukes build and maintain the vessels of Deneb's fleet but these fleets have a chain of command terminating with the Emperor, not the local nobility. They cannot be used for resolving internal, regional, or sector-wide disputes without Imperial approval passed down the proper chain of command, no matter what the subsector duke might have to say on the subject. This is an Imperial law put into effect after the Civil War, where sector autonomy resulted in rapid successions – and assassinations – of some two dozen emperors.

### OPERATING IN DENEB

Businesses, shipping lines and mercenary units must be mindful of the local political conditions when operating in Deneb. An apparently lucrative and low-risk project can be suddenly derailed, putting participants out of business. Conflicts may come to a sudden end or expand greatly, changing the rules of engagement or compromising the participants' previously secure position.

The political dimension pervades all endeavors. For example, a mercenary unit might be hired to carry out an apparently simple task on a success-only contract, then have to move its schedule to a breakneck pace when peace negotiations break out. Client briefings often include an estimate of the time available before the likely political consequences occur and orders often include a requirement to complete a mission before intervention becomes a possibility. The most successful mercenaries, shipping operators and businesses are adept at forecasting the changeable political weather; those who just hope for the best usually run into trouble.

Who a given company or unit does business with can have serious implications. There might be a good reason why a client is paying high salaries or offering big bonuses; often this is because anyone taking the job can expect never to work again in an entire subsector.  This political dimension can work in favor of operators, of course. If a mercenary unit has no intention of ever working for a particular client then the big payment to take on a job against them – a job nobody else wants - might be worth it. Likewise, the only shipping line willing to run goods into a particular system will win friends there and might even be part of changing the political landscape a little.

The results of a decision tend to be important for individuals and companies but small and subtle on the interstellar politics scale. Breaking an embargo will not cause a duchy to collapse and one successful rebellion will not alter the course of history. For all that, those willing to go against the flow have a chance to make a real difference in Deneb – assuming they can survive the consequences of their actions.

## POWERS OF DENEB

Power is wielded in many different ways and from different sources. The Imperial Navy can cut off a world from outside trade and cripple its economy but a corporation supplying critical components can hamper the navy to the point where its choices are influenced - openly or otherwise. Likewise, the sector dukes and great nobility wield enormous power, with world governments, corporations and research centres having lesser or more localised influence.

Any use of power will fall somewhere on the 'influence-force continuum', depending on how open the wielder is willing (or needs) to be. Force is not just military action. A refusal to handle specific tasks by port workers is a use of force in this context – it is a direct and open challenge to those who need the work done.

Money, of course, buys power. Again this can be overt, in the form of warships and mercenary regiments, or it can be much more subtle. A promise of investment can buy the support of a world government; threatening to pull out of a critical project can induce compliance. In this context, corporations, and those members of the nobility that control major business interests, may influence the course of events in the sector more than those with the biggest fleets.

As a general rule, force can be used to obtain a short-term advantage but influence is required to cement the gains. This might not be the case if the powers of Deneb had free rein to do as they pleased, however they do not. A duke might get away with occupying a couple of worlds under the pretense of dealing with unrest or revolt but attempting to conquer half a neighboring subsector will trigger an Imperial intervention with a politely worded 'request' to visit [[Capital]] and present an explanation. If the [[Imperium]] ever became weak enough that it could not correct a duke who behaved this way – perhaps distracted by a major war elsewhere or wracked by internal conflict – then the subsector dukes might try direct conquest. For the foreseeable future, however, they play a careful game of political and economic manipulation, with open warfare used as a threat but rarely carried out.

## THE IMPERIAL NAVY

As with other sectors, the Imperial Navy maintains a three-tier system in Deneb. This consists of the sector fleet, the subsector fleets and the misleadingly named colonial fleet. There is also a reserve of ships that can be recalled or reactivated as needed, although this force has no command structure of its own. Once ready for service, ships of the reserve would be added to the relevant sector or subsector commands, or formed into new task forces under the command of senior officers assigned by the sector admiral.

The sector fleet, named for the sector, contains all capital ships assigned to the sector and most of the cruisers. Its task is to deal with large-scale threats and to this end the sector fleet is kept concentrated at its main bases, with assets parcelled out to local commands, as necessary, or detached to deal with major incidents. The sector fleet is a peacetime administrative apparatus. In wartime, additional fleets with specific designations are usually formed (such as battle fleets or strike fleets) using assets detached from the sector fleet, with the sector fleet itself remaining as a reserve and defensive asset for its home sector.

In addition to protecting Deneb from incursions by major [[Vargr]] forces from coreward, the Deneb fleet acts as a strategic reserve for the Spinward Marches. In the event of an attack by the [[Zhodani Consulate]] or some other power, heavy squadrons would be dispatched to reinforce the [[Spinward Marches fleet]] or formed into a battle fleet to deliver a powerful counterattack.  Meanwhile, additional forces would be expected to move up from [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]] and the Imperial heartland. This would inevitably take many weeks however, so the forces of the [[Spinward Marches]] and [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] would have to hold the line until reinforcements arrived.

At any given time, some elements of the sector fleet are absent from their bases, on joint exercises in the [[Spinward Marches]] or reminding the worlds along the frontier of the power and strength of the [[Imperium]]; a squadron of battleships or heavy cruisers on a goodwill visit makes a powerful statement but one that must be repeated from time-to-time. Other heavy units might be on internal deployment, visiting major worlds to show the flag and remind subsector dukes that their powerbase is insignificant compared to that of the [[Imperium]] itself. Smaller ships, in the destroyer and escort classes for the most part, will be out on patrol augmenting the strength of the subsector fleets.

Whilst the sector fleet is tasked with warfighting and deterring large-scale conflict, the subsector fleets are charged with keeping the peace and protecting commerce on the spacelanes. Most subsector fleets have one or, at most, two vessels in the cruiser or light carrier class as flagships, with most other vessels in the destroyer or escort class. These ships tend to be scattered all over the subsector on solo patrol or in small task forces, maintaining a constant armed presence on the spacelanes. Transit times to and from patrol stations, along with the need to conduct training and maintenance, mean that only a proportion of the subsector fleet is on-station at any given time, with a relatively small reserve of vessels ready at their bases to respond to a crisis. However, incidents too serious for a subsector fleet destroyer or escort squadron to deal with are rare and support is always available from the sector fleet's assets.

Where the sector fleet's commanders stand aloof from the politics of their local area, subsector fleets are subject to much stronger influence from their subsector duke. Some subsector fleets in Deneb are more or less in the pocket of the local duke, which in turn allows the sector command to be manipulated by way of requests coming up the chain of command.

The so-called colonial fleet (an archaic term from the early days of the [[Imperium]]) is a command structure overseeing all contributed forces that can be called upon to assist the sector or subsector fleets. These include the personal forces of nobles and planetary navies that include jump-capable vessels, experimental ships stationed at bases or research installations, escort ships operated by merchant lines, mercenary vessels on contract to the sector or subsector command, and any independents who have been co-opted. The latter often includes small merchant ships that receive a reserve auxiliary stipend, allowing the navy to call them to service as support craft and logistics assets. Scout Service ships are sometimes loaned to the colonial fleet to assist with naval operations.

Not all vessels of these types are part of the colonial fleet. Indeed, many nobles and world governments prefer to keep their warships private and not subject to orders from fleet commanders. Others 'keep a spare hat', as the saying goes, and pass in and out of colonial fleet service as the need arises. Although colonial fleet ships tend to be older or cheaper (in other words less effective) designs and their crews may not be trained to the standard of the Imperial Navy, they provide a useful resource to cover more patrol stations.

A vessel in colonial fleet service has a navy transponder code, and the full authority of the fleet, but is also subject to its rules, regulations and chain of command.  It can thus be important to observe which hat a captain is wearing, so to speak. A vessel in private hands can go places and do things that one whose captain is wearing his navy hat cannot.

The Imperial Navy's main base in Deneb sector is at [[Depot]], in a star system formerly known as Sika'im.

The [[Inar Subsector]] was chosen for its central location, positioning fleet assets and facilities where they could react quickly to an incursion but far enough from the border to make surprise attack unlikely. Despite the best efforts of the subsector dukes – particularly Inar – the sector fleet consciously maintains its distance from the nobility of the region, not least since it is the duty of the sector admiral to send his fleet against a duke who steps too far out of line. If a limited war heats up to the point that a duke considers using tactical nuclear or biological weapons, or he attempts outright annexation of worlds, the navy is expected to bring matters to an abrupt close.

### THE DUKES

The Imperial nobility does not directly rule worlds, except where a noble is also the head of the world government. Nor do the great nobility rule clusters of star systems or subsectors, as such. The nobility - officially at least – administers its territory on behalf of the Emperor and handles some aspects of governance on behalf of the worlds in its care. Thus a subsector duke is responsible for dispute resolution within his area of influence and deals with what might be termed foreign policy on behalf of his subsector. 'Foreign' in this case can mean the next subsector over, which will also be Imperial territory.

The duke will also provide direction to the Imperial armed forces in his subsector, suggesting which trouble spots should receive additional patrols and authorising military action against factions damaging to the stability of the subsector. The ideal is that the great nobility provides leadership and sees the big picture where a world government is more likely to concentrate on its own affairs. This ideal assumes the great nobility pursue the best interests of the worlds within their territory but the reality is that the Dukes of Deneb put their own position and agenda ahead of the well-being of their people.

The dukes and other high nobility are extremely wealthy and powerful, usually with business interests on many worlds as well as their own personal armed forces and privately owned territory. These assets are directly controlled by the nobles and can be used as they see fit, subject to restrictions imposed by Imperial High Law. A duke or other high noble can be stripped of their position but most of the great nobility come from old families who have held their positions for centuries.

Although dukes officially administer and lead, rather than rule, in practice the distinction can be hard to see. A subsector duke has sufficient influence that he can make life very difficult for a person, corporation or government that does not obey his orders. There may be no legal requirement to do as the duke says but it is an open secret that those who do not obey will find their contracts dry up and business collapses even if they do not face direct censure.

The ability of any given subsector duke to control his territory depends on his degree of power and influence - strength creates more strength, by giving the duke the means to harm those who do not obey him. Naturally, opponents will try to undermine the strength of a duke's influence in the hope of rendering him ineffectual – if corporation A feels it can ignore instructions to cut off trade with world B, the subsector duke cannot use this as a threat to force compliance. That in turn might cost him control over research installation C, based on world B, since the world government can no longer be coerced into applying sanctions to the research facility.

The subsector dukes, and other great nobility of the sector, know this well and are constantly watchful for challenges to their position. They know their power can be slowly chipped away, as well as catastrophically smashed in head-on confrontation, and they know they can do the same to their rivals. With no sector duke in overall control, each subsector duke makes his own policies. Maintaining position and increasing power is high on that agenda, as is weakening rivals.

Control over the sector's major worlds is the key to power in Deneb. Proximity is a factor, since a duke finds it easier to influence worlds that lie within his official area of responsibility. The subsector duke has control of 'Imperial money', a loose term for the assistance - most of it in fact non-financial but all paid for from the Imperial coffers – given to worlds by the [[Imperium]]. A good assistance package can improve a world's future; refusing one or ensuring assistance is inadequate or inappropriate can cripple an economy. This is a potent tool in controlling local worlds but a subsector duke cannot direct Imperial money to worlds outside his remit - at least not directly.

Control over more distant worlds is achieved by indirect means such as trade or industrial dependencies, creating businesses or straightforward bribery. Some dukes prefer intimidation, others work hard to earn the loyalty of their subordinates and those whose allegiance they want. The ultimate goal is to eclipse all other subsector dukes and become the senior noble in the sector. The title Duke of Deneb is within reach for at least some of the subsector dukes and they all want to ensure nobody else is given it.

## THE EIGHT DUCHIES

Each of Deneb's eight duchies is different, with local influences on its policies and practices. All have their own forces loyal to the duke and his family, and a large administrative staff who handle the affairs of the duchy.  These assets are by augmented mercenaries or freelancers as necessary. This is sometimes done to conceal the duke's involvement in an action but often the allegiance of freelancers is openly declared. Some mercenary units have been on contract to a duke for so long they have become a symbol of the duchy but, more commonly, assets are hired and fired as needed.

MAP OF THE  DUCHIES AND THEIR AREAS  OF CONTROL



### The Duchy of Pretoria

The Duchy of Pretoria lies on the Imperial border and must contend with Vargr raids coming from coreward as well as by way of the Aramis Trace, a cluster of star systems close to the Imperial border in the neighboring Aramis subsector. The duke's personal forces are sometimes sent into [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]] – not always with the blessing of its nobility – to deal with corsair bases or block well-used routes. The Pretoria subsector fleet cannot operate outside its home area without special permission but ducal forces are not subject to such restrictions.

The Duke of Pretoria is generally more concerned with the security of his borders than attempting to gain more power in Deneb, yet is concerned with such efforts on the part of others. He typically acts in co-operation with the Duke of Sabine, while affairs along the Aramis Trace are handled by Count Urnas.

Pretoria maintains a large ducal fleet by the standards of the [[Imperium]]. Most vessels are what might be termed 'corsair-killers', lightly protected but with heavy firepower for their size. The majority are small and of little value in battle with major warships. However, since the average corsair is a converted merchant ship or an escort-sized warship this is not a drawback. The fleet includes two obsolescent cruisers that are used to show the duke's flag across the border in Vargr space, along with a very old, but still capable, battleship. This vessel is often assigned to the subsector's colonial fleet but sometimes serves as a mobile ducal residence. The phrase 'like the Duke's yacht' is a common colloquialism in Pretoria subsector, denoting something far too big, powerful or expensive for its purpose.

### The Duchy of Antra

The Duchy of Antra is in a weak position and has been so for a very long time, in part due to the machinations of Inar and Atsah, who undermine the Duke of Antra's position at every turn. The problem is compounded by Vargr incursions across the border, which keep the subsector fleet busy. It is an open secret that Antra pays corsairs to stay out of its territory, which improves the security situation at the price of making the duke look even weaker than he is.

The Duke of Antra is particularly hostile to Inar, a result of a long history of blatant actions against Antra by Inar. By way of retaliation, Antra has taken to granting letters of marque and reprisal to corsairs and even pardoning captured raiders in return for an agreement to act against Inar. In this, the duke is sailing very close to the wind. Not only does he risk Imperial displeasure if 'his'
corsairs are deemed to be pirates rather than legitimate privateers but his actions risk a naval response from Inar, which will almost certainly ignite a shooting war.

Antra's ducal fleet favors multirole vessels, with room for a troop contingent aboard or to carry stores for disaster relief. Whilst this reduces the fleet's ship-for-ship fighting power it enables a flexible response to be made in many situations and ships with generous accommodation or the ability to carry a lot of supplies can stay on station for longer than vessels with more 'teeth'.

### The Duchy of Sabine

Lying to rimward of Pretoria, the Duchy of Sabine does not have an external frontier and can concentrate more fully on internal matters, which typically means power struggles with Inar and Vincennes. Relations with Pretoria, and with Rhylanor and Mora in the Spinward Marches, are generally cooperative.

Sabine's position is hampered by dissent between the ducal seat at Magash and the military center at Thengin.  Nearby world governments align themselves according to conditions – if there is a military threat then Thengin is suddenly more attractive but otherwise most governments follow the general lead of the Duke at Magash.

Sabine's ducal fleet favors a smaller number of destroyer-sized vessels over escorts. Ships are well-maintained and their crews highly trained by ex-Imperial Navy personnel hired as instructors. It is generally supposed that Sabine hopes to offset the technological superiority of Vincennes by investing in its people.

### The Duchy of Inar

Inar is the most powerful of Deneb's duchies, although the complexities of interstellar politics make it difficult to state an exact ratio. However, it is commonly accepted that Inar wields at least as much influence as the duchies of Atsah and Vincennes combined. Warships and regiments are easier to count and here again Inar can field at least twice the tonnage and numbers of its nearest rival. Raw figures do not necessarily translate to fighting power but the ability of Inar to show the flag in more places at once contributes greatly to its impact on the affairs of the sector.

Inar shares a border with [[Vincennes]], which is characterised by endless manoeuvring for position. In the past, these two powers were briefly allied but today their relationship is adversarial at best.

The ducal fleet contains a handful of cruisers supported by a large number of smaller vessels. As is typical of naval forces in private service, these vessels are mostly of older design but the Duke of Inar seems to have obtained two up-to-date Amara -class heavy cruisers.  These are shown off at every opportunity, often operating together or at the center of a task force including light carriers as well. Inar's ducal fleet actually outguns the local subsector fleet, although a confrontation is highly unlikely.

### The Duchy of Atsah

Atsah has strong trade links with Corridor and the Imperial heartland beyond, and gets first pick of goods coming into Deneb from that direction. This gives the duke considerable extra leverage, on top of an already powerful domestic position, and Atsah more or less dominates the Million subsector to coreward and can prevent rivals running trade convoys around Atsah's territory if it chooses to do so. Influence over the Dunmag subsector is less but still considerable.

One consequence of this is that whilst the Duke of Atsah has a very considerable private navy, it is stretched thin.  Like Pretoria, Atsah cannot use the Imperial subsector fleet to pursue its own agenda – although sometimes the fleet's commanders can be prevailed upon to assist Imperial forces in Million or Dunmag, and the duke makes sure he gets credit. Ducal forces spend a lot of their time dispersed on flag-showing missions or being seen to deal with local problems that the Imperial fleet and the other dukes have taken no notice of.

Atsah's primary naval assets are converted destroyers, most of which have had their armament reduced in favor of improved accommodation for increased time on station. These ships routinely undertake very long deployments, sweeping through several systems or accompanying large freighters, liners or convoys of smaller ships as they pass through surrounding subsectors. Maintenance of these ships tends to be skimpy due to their constant deployment but a can-do attitude prevails among their crews.

### The Duchy of Vincennes

Vincennes, the ducal seat of the [[Vincennes Subsector]], is one of the single most powerful worlds in the [[Imperium]], wielding twice the economic, industrial and military might of [[Starn]], the next most powerful world in Deneb.  The availability of TL16 goods allows the Duke of Vincennes to reward his supporters or weaken those relying upon equipment supplied and maintained by Vincennes. This high-tech carrot-and-stick approach works well but occasionally damages exports as end clients are reluctant to buy goods that might not be supported when they come to order spares.

The Duke of Vincennes has what might be termed as a robust policy regarding the affairs of his subsector and its surroundings. The duchy tries to have at least one finger in every conceivable pie and is not afraid to make an example of a world or faction that opposes it. This is particularly true for those who shift their support to the neighboring Duchy of Inar.

The Vincennes ducal fleet is a mix of standard and custom vessels, with many otherwise standard designs augmented with a TL16 components. Experimental ships or vessels acting as testbeds for emerging technologies are not uncommon, with the ducal fleet more than willing to try its advanced systems in combat.

> Those without a track record may have to take whatever work they can get. This can lead to being fed into a meatgrinder by unscrupulous clients or used to undertake distasteful tasks. The nobility of Deneb make use of mercenaries on a regular basis and will pay premium prices to keep a particularly good unit out of someone else's service.

Mercenaries of this sort are sometimes hired for an ostensibly valid task – such as protecting aid workers on a nearby world - and then suddenly paid off due to 'changing requirements'. This dumps large numbers of poorly trained, armed and often criminally inclined men and women into the local equation, with the result that at least some will turn to crime and banditry in order to make a living and get offworld.
>
> The 'routier gambit' is an effective and low-cost way of destabilizing an area and causing trouble for the opposition. Often, the local authorities will have no option but to hire some of the routiers to fight their former comrades, with predictably poor results.

### The Duchy of Usani

Although it contains the sector capital, [[Deneb]], the Duchy of Usani is politically and economically weak. Its astrographical position, on the shore of the [[Great Rift]], is in some ways an advantage – there is little to worry about in that direction – but it does limit trade from the Imperial heartland. Goods from trailing arrive by way of shipping from Dunmag as a result of the sparsity of worlds in the rimward end of Atsah. The combination of a three-parsec gap and manipulation of trade by the [[Duchy of Atsah]] pinches off the flow of commerce from this direction.

As much as possible, Usani prefers to ally with the Duke of Inar against Vincennes. However, its weak position means its stance must shift from time-to-time. Relations with other duchies can vary considerably, with Usani doing what it has to rather than purely acting in its own best interests.

The Usani ducal fleet contains few warships, mostly small escorts, although it does operate a number of armed merchant cruisers and merchant carriers. These vessels are well suited to commerce protection – and some would say also to raiding the commerce of other subsectors – but would not stand up to a major warship.  However, their ability to carry cargo whilst maintaining a deterrent presence on the spacelanes makes having a fleet of sorts attainable to the cash-strapped duchy.

### The Duchy of Zeng

The Duchy of Zeng is in a similar astrographical position to Usani but benefits from good relations with Trin in the Spinward Marches. Trin is not a competitor for the title of Sector Duke of Deneb, for obvious reasons, so deals with Zeng in straight economic-benefit terms.  The concentration of most of the duchy's worlds into a central cluster also has significant advantages in terms of trade and political influence.

Zeng is highly influential in the Gulf subsector and officially administers the handful of systems in Macon.
The duchy is seen as 'not really a player' in the great game of dominance over Deneb. Lying out on the fringes and distant from the sector's politics in more than just astrographical terms, Zeng is not perceived as a threat by the other duchies and thus enjoys better relations than most others. It generally cooperates with Usani and Atsah, and has a neutral position towards the other duchies most of the time.

Zeng's ducal fleet is typical, with a single old cruiser as flagship and a handful of destroyers of varying designs, supported by a much larger number of escorts and patrol vessels. Most of the time these ships are seconded to the colonial fleet and serve as commerce protection assets with the Imperial Navy.

## CORPORATIONS

All of the Imperial megacorporations have interests in Deneb, just to varying degrees. The megacorporations produce such a variety of goods, and handle such huge volumes of trade in items, information and financial assets, that their influence can be felt almost anywhere.
On any given world, at least some of the goods in the shops have been produced in megacorporate-owned factories or transported on ships built or operated by the megacorporations. In many cases, starports have been built with megacorporate money.

At the very least, these huge firms have an interest in keeping markets open and increasing their share - possibly at the expense of their rivals. Any political machinations that affect their business will be opposed by the megacorporations to the fullest extent and they have a variety of means at their disposal. All megacorporations and most larger corporations are associated with noble families that have very considerable influence.

Although their holdings are more dispersed than those of a sector duke, the megacorporations are more powerful in most ways. Their wealth and ability to influence governments through economic pressure are immense.   Megacorporations also have their own ships and security forces – or can hire them on the mercenary market – and are quite willing to use them.

Some megacorporations have major interests in Deneb and can be considered additional players on the political field. Even subsector dukes are wary of a direct clash with megacorporations, with the result that megacorporate vessels will sometimes sail blithely through an armed standoff and industrial enclaves are safe havens even whilst a ground war is raging nearby.

## MINOR STATES AND POWERS

Outside the duchies, but within the Imperial border, most worlds are individual members of the [[Imperium]], although some are part of multi-world counties. The nobles who administer these counties have nowhere near the power wielded by an Imperial duke but manage to exert some influence over surrounding systems. There are also individual worlds powerful enough to exert influence. These have nobles assigned to them but it is the world government that holds the power, not the nobles who act as representatives to the [[Imperium]].

Parts of the sector lie outside the [[Imperium]] and the attitude of these worlds varies considerably. Some are Imperial client states, either because they wish to be or because the [[Imperium]] has made them dependent for strategic reasons. Others change their allegiances.
Many of these worlds are populated primarily or wholly by Vargr and are heavily influenced by the politics of the larger Vargr states to coreward.

There are also a number of powerful entities in the sector that are not states or world governments. Like corporations, these organizations, movements and networks exert influence in many areas and may have enclaves within the territory of a duchy or other major power.

These include

- The [[Humbolt Family]]
- The [[Lurent]]
- The [[United Followers of Augurgh|UFA]]

## PLACES OF INTEREST

Deneb has a number of unique locations whose existence may be known several sectors away. Most notable of these is the supergiant star Deneb itself, which is sufficiently bright to be used as a navigational calibration point from hundreds of parsecs away and is visible in daylight on many worlds. A segment of the Great Rift runs through Deneb and is notable for the opposite reason – it is a region with few or no stars that presents a major barrier to navigation

### Phenomena

A number of stellar and interstellar phenomena exist, notably the giant star Deneb and Minde's Star in the [[Inar Subsector]]. Both are used as calibration points by navigators, for different reasons. Deneb is visible from a great distance and easily detectable by instruments, whereas the unpredictable variations in the luminosity of Minde's Star make it stand out as an anomaly.

In addition, there are other phenomena of interest to Travellers. Most are of a typical sort – rifts and mains – but there are a few exceptions.

These include

- [[Jump Bridge]]s
- [[Lurent#Planetoid Ships]]
- The [[Dunmag Sargasso]]
- [[Naval Fuel Depots]]
- The [[Pagamin Graveyards]]
- [[Gas-Sharks]]
- [[Imperial Research Station]]s

#### RESEARCH STATIONS

Deneb has six Imperial research stations, an usually high concentration for any sector. There is no standard form for a research station; some are large complexes on remote planetoids, others are chains of universities located in major cities. The only thing these facilities have in common is that they are far greater in size and capabilities than the typical corporate laboratory or university research department and that they have a charter from the [[Imperium]].

Most research stations concentrate on a narrow remit, and are leaders in their field. In some cases, the nature of research undertaken at a facility is subject to strict secrecy and the station is off-limits to unauthorized visitors. Rumors of superweapons projects and incredible revelations on the nature of the universe abound but most of what goes on in these stations is relatively mundane.

Research stations are normally – but not always – located in remote areas where access can be easily controlled and typically have their own landing area not available to casual visitors. Armed security is the norm, and there are stiff penalties for anyone entering a facility without permission. It is an open secret that much of what goes on in these places is different to the public-consumption version and occasionally accusations start flying that a facility dealing with medical research might actually be making biological weapons.

The staff of these facilities are tight-lipped, offering only the standard explanation that cutting-edge research costs a lot of money and there are those who would like to steal data or beat the Imperial authorities to the patent office. Thus a habit of secrecy is maintained even where not necessary, making it harder for data thieves to determine which installations are working on something they want to steal.

There are many research laboratories throughout the sector run by corporations, noble houses and world governments but only six have the Imperial charter.

##### Research Station Alpha

Research Station Alpha is located on [[Arcanum]], two parsecs from Deneb in the [[Usani Subsector]]. Arcanum has been interdicted by the [[Imperium]] since 500 due to a biological contaminant pervading the entire ecosphere.  The contamination takes the form of spores from a yeast-like species which has a symbiotic relationship with much of the native flora.

The source of contamination has resisted all attempts to culture it artificially or transplant offworld, and the unique combination of factors that allow it to thrive on Arcanum has never been established. Humans exposed to spores become dependent in the same manner as local life and since the source species will not grow elsewhere, leaving Arcanum is inevitably fatal within a few days. However, the relationship has its benefits too, as the symbiosis results in more or less doubling the individual's remaining life span.

Research Station Alpha is a sealed and carefully controlled environment that studies this species and its effects. The main laboratories are in orbit, with a groundside installation run by a skeleton sample collecting and analysis staff. Occasionally a staff member is accidentally exposed, leading to a choice whether to continue working in the 'open' part of the groundside installation or retire among the world's population, a stable TL6 society that does not interact with offworlders, except for a small number who undertake necessary work or volunteer as test subjects.

##### Research Station Beta

Research Station Beta is located on [[Starn]] in the [[Inar Subsector]]. Since 685 it has hosted a research and development facility, although this was not always designated a full research station. The installation began as a testing facility for the Imperial Navy and later gained a tactical and analysis center to become Research Station Beta. Additional departments dealing with large-ship construction techniques were added, catering to the corporate shipbuilding and operations marketplace.

Research Station Beta is located in the 'mainworld' asteroid belt and has grown to incorporate facilities on several large planetoids and dwarf planets. Some areas of the facility are strictly off-limits but others serve as a showcase for emerging technologies or are accessible to those on contract to sponsoring megacorproations. This creates a complex security situation, with the research station's patrol vessels forever chasing off prospecting or mining ships that have wandered too close – or claim to have done so.

##### Research Station Gamma

Research Station Gamma is located on [[Maelstrom]] in the the [[Geniishir Subsector]]; the world was chosen for its unwelcoming conditions and location off the main trade routes, providing effective passive security to the installation. Research Station Gamma specialises in robotics, artificial intelligence and applications of decision-making technology. This focus is common knowledge, to the point where a revolution led by artificially-intelligent domestic appliances and industrial machines has become a common trope in local entertainment shows, with a thinly disguised station Gamma as the usual source.

Research Station Gamma is known to be undertaking parallel research into a number of possible brain models for artificial intelligence, including pure electronic systems, biological systems and a variety of highly exotic possibilities. A revelatory news story a few years ago claimed that 'clever pond weed' had been found on an unspecified world outside the sector and transported to Research Station Gamma to create an artificially intelligent biological network. This tale has been dismissed by spokespersons from Research Station Gamma as both preposterous and actually less weird than some of the things they have tried.

##### Research Station Delta

Research Station Delta is located in the [[Aerfor]] system, just outside the Imperial border in Million. The system is officially listed as a client state of the [[Imperium]], reflecting the fact that it is of sufficient strategic importance to be worth fighting over. In addition to the small security force of system defence boats and patrol cutters, the Imperial Navy maintains a guardship deployment in the system to remind all and sundry of its status.

Research Station Delta was set up in 760 to study the system's unusual composition. Several bodies have high concentrations of heavy elements, with superheavy elements in small deposits. It is thought this is the result of a supernova event in the very distant past but why Aerfor and other bodies in its system formed this way when nearby worlds did not remains unclear.

Not all of the system's bodies have these characteristics.  Three of the four gas giants (and their moons) do not but these are all thought to be captured bodies due to their highly eccentric orbits. These orbits have perturbed the system's three planetoid belts, causing a complex scatter of small bodies outside the belts proper and resulting in the terrestrial planets taking a pounding over the millennia. Vessels from the research station can be found all over the system, sometimes spending months searching for a planetoid that simply is not where astrophysics predicts it must be.

##### Research Station Epsilon

Research Station Epsilon is located on [[Saarinen]], at the extreme spinward edge of the [[Sabine subsector]]. It is a major center for underwater planetological studies and, unlike many research stations, has an extensive teaching and training arm. Indeed, Epsilon trains underwater explorers and scientists from very different areas of expertise and is considered a center of excellence for field science.

According to the official history of the station it has always been a physical-sciences center but records are said to exist of a time when Epsilon was a [[psionics]] research installation. Rumors tell of a connection with the semi-mythical [[Order of the White Star]], an order of knighthood open only to members with psionic abilities. An order of that name did exist but details are sketchy and there is no proof that psionic knights ever existed in the [[Imperium]], nor that Research Station Epsilon was associated with them.

##### Research Station Zeta

Research Station Zeta is located at [[Pashus]] in [[Zeng Subsector|Zeng]].

Its field of interest is jumpspace phenomena and the development of improved jump drives. As such, its work is highly classified and security even more strict than at most other installations. The research station maintains a number of experimental starships and launches expeditions into the Great Rift to investigate the effects of jumping in very sparse regions of space.

Zeta also undertakes research into temporal physics in general, and the relationship between time and jumpspace in particular. It is thought by some scientists that the jump-6 barrier can be broken once the relationship between time and jumpspace phenomena is established.
Work in this field follows the controversial theories of [[Ashak Moroyanga]] whose unexplained death in 881 brought an end to a career marked by erratic brilliance.

## MINOR RACES

The Deneb sector is home to several minor races.  Some are quite commonly encountered away from their homeworlds; others are more obscure. Members of even low-tech societies sometimes travel or are recruited by agencies and services for their special skills. It can be interesting for Travellers who have previously encountered a member of an unusual species living as a high-tech citizen at a starport to visit his homeworld and find that its inhabitants are still in the stone age.

Individuals from these minor races are as varied as anyone else, although social and cultural values tend to diverge more from the mainstream of interstellar society on backwater worlds. Communities away from the starport region may have had little outside contact in their entire history, possibly resulting in an entirely unique culture.
