# Psionics

The [[Lore]] replacement within [[Fated Travels]] is [[Psionics]].  The use of mighty mental powers (or simple Jedi mind tricks) has long been a part of science fiction, and has always existed within [[Classic Traveller]].   Within [[Fated Travels]], the [[Psionics]] ability uses the [[Will]] stress track to determine the current capabilities of a psionic character.

## Caveats

[[Psionics]] are an [[Extras|extra]], and they have the potential to disrupt everyone's enjoyment of the game.  It is important for the player to remember that the character is part of a larger story, and that the idea is that everyone is having a good time.  Don't be an asshole.

The skill requires permission in the way of an aspect, as well as acceptance from the larger group.

Finally, it should be noted that [[Psionics]] are illegal within the [[Third Imperium]].  It is punishable in a wide variety of ways and severities.  The [[Zhodani]] have a much different view on it, as do some of the other races and smaller polities, but for the most part the only major players that are widely accepting of it are the [[Zhodani]] and the [[Droyne]].

## The Psionics Skill

The skill rating in [[Psionics]] is the character's PSR (Psionic Strength Rating).

**Special**: The [[Psionics]] skill gives you additional mental [[Stress and Consequences|stress boxes or consequence slots]] in the same manner as, and in addition to, [[Will]]. Average (+1) or Fair (+2) gives you a 3-point stress box. Good (+3) or Great (+4) gives you a 3-point and a 4-point stress box. Superb (+5) and above give you an additional mild consequence slot along with the additional stress boxes. This slot can be used to mitigate psionic harm (a common event for psionics), either from "winning at a cost", being under mental [[Attack]], or stress that arises from specific abilities.  Normal mental stress and consequences may be used to mitigate psionic damage, as well.

They can _also_ be used to mitigate ordinary mental stress, but such use requires the character to _also_ accept equivalent _Physical_ stress.  In the event that a character has sufficient Mental stress to absorb a hit due to their [[Psionics]] rating, but not enough to take the Physical hit, they are \[technically] [[Taken Out]] by the _physical stress_, if it matters.

Note that since [[Psionics]] must be at least Average (+1) to obtain any ability, every psionic character with abilities has at least 1 1-point psionic stress box and 1 2-point psionic stress box, and 1 3-point psionic stress box.

A character with Superb [[Psionics]] and Superb [[Will]] would have 2 3-point and 2 4-point mental stress boxes and 2 additional mild consequences.  They should be noted separately, and psionic damage should come from the stress boxes and/or consequence gained from [[Psionics]].

### Psionics and [[Will]]

The [[Will]] skill will often be used to counter psionics.  This seems correct, given that the psionic character uses the Mental [[Stress and Consequences#Stress Tracks|stress track]] to determine if they are able to continue to perform their mental shenanigans.  Each ability has a difficulty based on what is being attempted and the range at which it is being done.  Performing an ability may have a detrimental affect on the character's mental well-being that manifests as Mental stress and/or consequences.

On the positive side, the training received at the [[Psionics Institute]] allows the character to tap otherwise unavailable reserves.  In this case, [[Psionics]] acts as a _totally separate skill_ for adding to the Mental Stress track [[#The Psionics Skill|(see above)]] .  For this reason, powerful psionics usually have both high [[Psionics]] skills as well as high [[Will]].  And since the [[Psionics]] skill adds to the Mental stress track like [[Will]] does, the character can (potentially) have exceptional mental fortitude.

## The Psionic Abilities

The following abilities may be available to a character:
Once a character is determined to be psionic (via an Aspect or testing after play starts), they must determine their talents.  Unlike most other parts of a Fate game, this has a degree of randomness to it.

The character rolls [[Psionics]] against the value of each ability in the chart, in whatever order they wish.  The skill level of [[Psionics]] is listed for each ability. Each subsequent roll is at +2 to the target.  The character may _PERMANANTLY BURN (!)_ a single [[Refresh (FST)]] to get +2 or re-roll during this process.  The character must exceed the target (not tie) to select that ability.

| Ability            | Target | Required Level |
| ------------------ | :----: | :------------: |
| [[#Telepathy]]     |   +3   |   Average +1   |
| [[#Clairvoyance]]  |   +3   |   Average +1   |
| [[#Telekinesis]]   |   +4   |     Fair +2    |
| [[#Awareness]]     |   +5   |     Good +3    |
| [[#Teleportation]] |   +6   |    Great +4    |
| [[#Special]]       |   +6   |    Great +4    |

For each ability, the character either has the capacity or they do not.  It is entirely possible that a character spends points on being psionic and has no abilities.  In this case, the character will have either [[#Telepathy]] or [[#Clairvoyance]] (their choice) but will require some form of artifact as a focus to utilize it.

Once a character's _possible_ talents have been determined, they must be purchased using [[Refresh (FST)]].  The first level of a given ability costs 1 [[Refresh (FST)]].  Each subsequent level costs `(current level+1)/2` (round up).  Psionics can be really costly.
