# EDININA

Edinina is a moon of the very small gas giant Karimissaak, whose name is often translated as 'Laughable'. The mainworld has an eccentric orbit that takes it through Karimissaak's feeble ring system, causing meteor showers and dangerous levels of radiation. Despite this, the world is home to a few hundred souls, most of whom are employed in petrochemical extraction from the gas giant's upper atmosphere. The Industrial Collective of Edinina, to give the world's highly democratic society its proper title, has contracts with Imperial corporations that send refinery ships every few months. Other than these regular contacts, the system receives few visitors.

A desultory campaign to have the [[Amber Zone|Amber]] travel classification removed (awarded due to the conditions on the mainworld and surely well deserved) has been undertaken by low-end lawyers at the courts of the sector's senior nobles. Those few ships that do pass through are routinely pestered to join the campaign, which the locals rather optimiztically hope will open up their world to immigration and investment.
