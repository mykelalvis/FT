# Introduction

Bounty hunters dwell in the grey area between law enforcement and criminals, often seen by the general public as little better than those they track down. Danger, action and glory entwine to create a life filled with near-misses and risk, with these trained hunter- killers relying on rewards outweighing risks. Bounty hunters receive their marks from a diverse range of employers, whether they be criminal organisations, corporations or noble patrons. The skills a bounty hunter possesses must be leveraged in order for them to succeed and if they are deadly enough and reliable to boot, their reputation alone may well precede them.

Part mercenary, part private investigator, bounty hunters travel tirelessly from one bustling starport to another on the heels of their mark. Thought of as little better than elevated mercenaries, these individuals are well aware of the perils in their line of work. As the mark seeks refuge, the bounty hunters’ mission is to ensure no sanctuary remains safe for long. Employing talents of interrogation, investigation and unrelenting violence, they question family, friends, associates and contacts to gather leads and determine who is aiding the mark. Each interaction brings them one step closer to their target and their next payday.

However, the path to a successful bounty is rarely smooth. Resistance may arise from the mark’s associates or the mark themselves, and the hunter must be prepared to counter with force. Additionally, other parties may be interested in the mark’s capture or demise, leading to conflicts with law enforcement or rival bounty hunters. In some cases, the challenge lies not in capturing the mark but delivering them safely to their destination while being pursued by other hunters.

A bounty hunter’s reputation is crucial. The higher a bounty hunter’s reputation, the more likely they are to receive higher pay and increased cooperation but the chances of being hunted by a rival increase dramatically. On the other hand, a poor reputation results in fewer jobs and less support, and perhaps a desire to take out hunters above them. Building a reputation is often more critical than Credits and a retired bounty hunter can earn a decent living from book and vid-show deals, if they live long enough.

This book delves into the multifaceted world of bounty hunting within Traveller, providing the tools needed to incorporate bounty hunting into ongoing games or make it the central focus of an entire campaign.

## The Science Fiction Bounty Hunter

The concept of the bounty hunter is not exclusive to science fiction, tracing its roots back to 13th century England and, later, 18th century America. Popularised by Western movies throughout the 20th century, Westerns often featured bounty hunters alongside cowboys and outlaws. More recently, characters like Boba Fett from Star Wars and Din Djarin from The Mandalorian have captured the imagination of audiences, showcasing the cold nobility, honour and competence of these skilled hunters. Other depictions exist; for example, the titular character of John Wick exemplifies many aspects seen within the genre.

Bounty hunters have become a staple in popular culture, featured in TV series, movies and roleplaying games. Their brutality and diverse moral compasses make them fascinating characters, whether hunting criminals due to a sense of justice or as a pursuit of wealth and reputation.

## Bounty Hunter Travellers

While anyone can claim to be a bounty hunter, newcomers quickly learn how different it is from other professions. Reputation is paramount, influencing the jobs they take and the partnerships they form. Hunters must also decide whether to join a guild or operate independently, serving a single organisation or working as a lone contractor.

In addition to honing skills and securing the best gear, bounty hunters must also consider their personal style. A signature look can instil fear in targets or blend seamlessly into the background. Some hunters may leave a calling card at the scene of a capture, perpetuating their personal myth. This builds into their reputation, with some known only by a codename, calling card or the flair with which they deliver their marks. Bounty hunting Travellers with a high enough reputation may be spoken of only in hushed voices telling tales about acts committed in the course of their work.

## Definitions

There are several terms used in bounty hunting that are somewhat similar in meaning but pertain to different aspects of the profession. These are listed here to avoid confusion.

BOUNTY The bounty is the reward for completing a contract. In essence, another term for a bounty hunter would be reward seeker.

HUNTER A shortened term for bounty hunter.

MARK The mark is the person or object the bounty hunter seeks when they accept a contract. They are often criminals or people who have done something to upset someone with wealth and power.

REPUTATION This is a measure of a Traveller’s personal competency in their profession. Although it is especially relevant to bounty hunting, it could be made to apply to any career, profession or even hobby.

CONTRACT The contract is a job offered to a bounty hunter. This may be a formal, legal document with the full weight of interstellar law behind it, a dossier containing all information an employer thinks a bounty hunter will need to capture a mark, or simply a set of verbal instructions. Regardless, a contract will lay out what a bounty hunter is expected to accomplish and how they will be rewarded for its successful completion.

## Refereeing Bounty Hunters

This book offers guidance for Referees to adapt their style and tone to fit a bounty hunting-focused campaign. It covers topics such as setting up competition between hunters, creating recurring characters and incorporating bounty hunting into existing campaigns. Additionally, it provides tools including contract generators, pre-made bounty hunters and maps of safe houses, hideouts and bases of operations to inspire and streamline the introduction creation of adventures.

Bounty hunting is a career much like any other, albeit one rather strange to enter. For most, bounty hunting is not a life they choose. It is dangerous, lonely and many hunters die before they achieve fame or notoriety. However, the pull of Credits is enough to drag many a would-be drifter to this line of work and disgraced ex- marines or spies may find it a useful career transition.

Some careers set a Traveller up for a life of bounty hunting better than others, such as the Agent, Drifter, Rogue and Scout. Despite the career’s lack of uniformity or steady procession, there are a number of things every Traveller must learn and try to master if they want to become a successful bounty hunter. Most will become bounty hunters out of necessity - their bills are catching up to them, and they need a quick way to earn Credits, although some will choose to become bounty hunters from a sense of honour or justice.

# Becoming a Bounty Hunter

## Bounty Hunter

Bounty hunters live in the grey area between legal and illegal, moral and immoral. Generally serving whoever pays them the most or offers the best benefits, these are the people who track down skip-tracers, criminals and even rival bounty hunters. Whilst some abide by a code of honour, others are ruthless in their work.

Qualification: INT 6+ 
DM+1 for every previous career 
DM+2 if last term was in the Agent or Rogue careers

![[BH-5027.jpg|200]]
# Reputation

Reputation is, at its core, a measure of professional competency. This is an occupation where employers are constantly changing, there are no official ranks and the only thing those issuing contracts truly care about is how effective the hunter is. For a bounty hunter, earning and maintaining a high reputation is paramount.

This might help determine whether someone is willing to offer higher profile contracts, the bounty they are willing to pay for successfully bringing in the mark and whether people are intimidated when they hear that a specific hunter is after them. Hunters with the highest reputations could become minor celebrities in their own right and might eventually abandon bounty hunting altogether to become a crime boss, local lord or other public persona.

Reputation (REP) is a characteristic, which stands alongside the existing ones (STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, SOC and PSI). Like other characteristics, REP has a maximum score of 15, regardless of how well one does.

While one could compare REP to SOC, it is important to note that SOC is a measure of privilege either born into or gained throughout a career, while REP is a measure of how effective an individual has been in their profession. A noble, for instance, might be of high birth and therefore have a high SOC but may have no transferable skills. Those whose worth is based on REP are constantly being re-evaluated. REP is changeable and, for many, shifts frequently.

### Gaining Reputation
For a starting Traveller, REP starts at 0. At low levels, REP will be a hindrance, not an asset. Also, at low levels, Travellers are more likely to lose REP than gain it. Fortunately, the lowest REP they can have is 0 and any additional negatives acquired cannot reduce it to lower than zero.

A Traveller can gain REP in one of a few ways:
- They can acquire REP when rolling on the [[#Bounty Hunter Events table]].
- They may gain REP when making a check on the [[#Reputation Change table]]. These are tied to qualifying events that occur during adventures.
- They also gain REP when the Referee feels they have earned it. The Travellers might achieve something noteworthy in a campaign, serve a particularly challenging contract, or impress someone influential.

## Using Reputation

Reputation is subject to change throughout a bounty hunter’s life. On the positive side, the Travellers might bring in a mark for a High Priority bounty. On the other, they might have a run of bad luck and a mark finds a way of permanently eluding them.

In general, REP takes a long time to build and once a good one is established, it usually takes time to destroy.

Travellers should roll on the [[#Reputation Change table]] any time they do something that could have an effect on their REP. It is ultimately up to the Referee to decide when this should be but the following is a non-exhaustive list of circumstances that would likely prompt a roll:
- The Traveller accomplishes a High or Critical Priority contract
- The Traveller gains an Ally with very high SOC
- The Traveller outwits several competitors when bringing in a mark
- The Traveller causes a lot of collateral damage when serving a contract
- The Traveller fails to apprehend a High or Critical Priority mark
- The Traveller offends the wrong person
- The Traveller is embarrassed or foiled by a mark

Rolls on the [[#Reputation Change table]] can be modified by the circumstances involved in the roll, usually by the event that triggered it in the first place. Only one circumstance can apply a DM for any single roll (use the highest DM applicable). Examples are shown on the [[#Reputation Modification table]], although the Referee is free to invent others during an adventure.

### Making a REP Check
Throughout adventures the Referee may ask Travellers to make REP checks. A higher REP will allow them to take on high-paying and exclusive contracts, while a lower one may result in only being able to take open calls. A higher REP might also allow Travellers to negotiate a higher bounty, convince a mark to go with them peacefully, or persuade people to give them information without resorting to violence.

## Roleplaying Reputation

Reputation, in a game, can manifest in myriad ways. It may be something as small as people giving the Travellers information more easily, fans noticing their whereabouts and coming to get an autograph, or security personnel looking the other way as they pass by armed to the teeth. Its effect on the landscape of any adventure should not be understated, as at its base REP is what allows a bounty hunter to act as a bounty hunter.

Should the Travellers’ REP fall too low, they will not be given the best contracts and be consistently belittled by fellow bounty hunters, if any attention is paid to them at all. Their work will be drudgery, with little notoriety and few Credits to be gained. However, as soon as their reputation starts to grow, they will find themselves in a much better position both financially and socially.

Although the bounty hunting career has no formal advancement or rankings, that does not mean there are no hunters held in higher regard than others. Those with the greatest reputations are more akin to celebrities than lower esteemed compatriots and will need to take on a considerably smaller amount of work in order to maintain their financial position. The lower-rung hunters, on the other hand, may find themselves taking on multiple marks at once just to keep their bills paid.

The Referee should feel free to play on these differences of social stature, using things as simple as how the hunters are treated when they meet a client, negotiate a contract or undertake work to express the difference that a high reputation can have on their career. Bounty hunters with a low reputation are a dime a dozen and will not be afforded any great respect or assistance when attempting to capture a mark. However, as the Travellers’ reputation grows, they may find that marks hand themselves in more easily when faced with an opponent of great notoriety. This causes the bounty hunter’s reputation to become somewhat self-perpetuating, with notorious marks giving up more easily rather than facing the horrors the bounty hunter may be known for.

The mechanical effects of reputation should guide the roleplay of a group, used to enhance experiences of the Travellers rather than limit them. Should the Travellers be doing something distinctly cool, but fail their REP check, consider allowing them to continue along the path they are on, albeit with a few complications. Travellers will find that REP is progressively harder to attain. Once they have begun to make a name for themselves, Travellers will have to engage in more excessive acts and outperform themselves with each mark in order to continue building their reputation.

## Reputation and Negotiation

One consideration when negotiating a private contract is the minimum REP required for the job. This is not a hard and fast value that must always be adhered to and if the hunter lacks the desired REP, they may attempt to qualify for a job anyway. To do this, they must make a REP check, with the difficulty based on the difference between the hunter’s REP and the desired REP. If they fail the check, they lose REP -1, although REP cannot go below zero.

|REP Difference| Difficulty|
|:-:|--|
|1-2| Average (8+) |
|3-4| Difficult (10+) |
|5-6| Very Difficult (12+)|
|7-8| Formidable (14+) |
|9+| Impossible (16+)|

### Bounty Adjustments
When a contract is created, the issuer has an amount they are willing to pay. In some cases, such as when dealing with law enforcement, that amount may not be negotiable. However, some issuers may be willing to go higher if the bounty hunter has an excellent reputation and is known to deliver results. Likewise, the issuer may want to hire a bounty hunter of good reputation but the only ones available are those with no reputation, or a poor one, and they might adjust the bounty downwards but hire whoever is available.

Travellers have the option to accept a contract with the bounty exactly as offered but may try for greater compensation. When doing so, depending on their REP, they may run the risk of negotiating poorly and adjusting the bounty downwards rather than up. When a Traveller wishes to negotiate the bounty on a contract, roll 2D and apply your REP modifier, then consult the [[#Bounty Negotiation table]].

# Being a Bounty Hunter

This chapter discuss options bounty hunters have in terms of operating independently, or joining a guild or corporation, as well as the benefits of each. The Referee is free to alter these as they see fit. Examples are provided in the Bounty Hunting Agencies chapter, starting on page 109.

Private organisations, whether guild or corporation, facilitate the process of handing out contracts, for a fee. Sometimes, bounty hunters may stay with an agency for the duration of their career, with extended service granting higher paying contracts and guaranteeing regular work.

As with other organised groups of bounty hunters, sometimes operatives may be tasked to hunt down marks that would otherwise evade lone hunters. Agencies are able to assign multiple hunters to a mark, allowing them to work in tandem, and they often have a large database of hunters from whom to choose. Assignments are given based on reputation and skillset, with pairings based on complementary talents.

To join a bounty hunting agency typically requires a background check and interview, as well as a joining fee. The agency will also usually take a percentage from the fee of every successfully completed contract. Sometimes, these percentages can be extremely predatory, intended to keep the bounty hunter indebted to the agency for the duration of their career. In return, the agency provides the bounty hunter with suitable contracts, collects payment from clients, provides repatriation bonds and grants other benefits which vary between organisations.

Joining an agency usually requires paying an annual registration fee, which can vary from Cr2000 up to Cr250000 or more for the most exclusive agencies, and then making an Average (8+) REP check, although this can vary too. Smaller agencies may waive this fee initially, either increasing the per- contract percentage or spreading it throughout the course of the year with any remaining balance paid at the end, with interest. This is another method more predatory agencies may use to control their hunters.

Joining an agency may take anything from a month to a year to complete, depending on how rigorous they are in their vetting process.

There are benefits to joining a bounty hunting agency beyond a regular assignment of contracts. These may be generated randomly using the tables in the guild and corporation sections of this chapter, with one roll made for every full three points of REP the bounty hunter has being typical. Alternatively, the Referee may create their own benefits for specific agencies of their invention.

![[BH-5031.jpg]]
## The Independent

Going solo or operating as a very small team is the ultimate way to live for many bounty hunters. They find and negotiate contracts, establish their own reputations and do the job on their terms. Each is free to set whatever moral boundaries they wish and if presented with a contract that would cross those, have the freedom to ignore them.

Unlike agencies, there are no advantages beyond this freedom when going independent. Bounty hunters will pay for any gear needed, arrange for their own legal defence if they break local laws and cover all expenses.

As an independent, there is no protection from competitors; in fact, if you possess a high REP, competitors will consider beating you to a mark a point of pride, which can build their own reputation and detract from yours. Whereas working under an agency would mean there are others looking out for you, as an independent you must be prepared to defend yourself. On the other hand, you have the freedom to propose strategic partnerships with competitors that might be against agency rules.

## Guilds

Many bounty hunters choose to work as part of an organised guild. In some sectors there are multiple guilds in competition with one another and each is constantly on the lookout to recruit the most capable hunters. For many, guilds are worthwhile because they provide organisational support that does not exist for independents. This might be the provision of equipment, discounts on weapon and armour repair, an increase of reputation, clear rules for cooperation and competition between hunters, and more.

Guilds are often planet- or system-bound, and can become well known in their region of space. Other guilds are based on starships, swooping into highly populated systems to send members out to serve several contracts before heading off for greener pastures.

In terms of leadership, most guilds are autocratic in nature, with one person, or a select few, at the top making all the decisions. They typically earn their position by being the eldest or most accomplished bounty hunter who also has the respect of the majority of members. Despite this, leaders must remain vigilant, for there are those beneath them who would take their place if given opportunity to seize it. Occasionally, bounty hunting guilds are more democratic in nature, but the Credits earned at the top are enough of an incentive for someone to consider overthrowing the existing order.

The guild assesses its membership and offers incoming contracts to the hunters believed to be the best equipped. They give High and Critical Priority contracts to the most skilled and prolific hunters while lower priority contracts go to those still struggling to establish reputations. This means that upward mobility can become stagnant, with lower profile bounty hunters often relegated to middling contracts for the duration of their time in the guild.

Guilds have very specific rules regarding conduct. Some are willing to offer more than one contract at a time but will not issue more until those already active have been served. Most guilds will expel hunters if they capture a mark and then refuse to turn them over.

The [[#Guild Benefits table]] can be rolled on when joining a guild (one roll for every full three points of REP is typical), or the Referee may create their own list of benefits for specific guilds.

The [[#Guild Holdbacks table]] determines how much of each bounty the guild keeps upon a successfully executed contract. At the Referee’s discretion, this percentage may be decreased as a hunter’s REP increases.

![[BH-5034.jpg]]
## Corporations

Corporations sometimes hire bounty hunters, either by issuing contracts to independents and guilds, or keeping employees on payroll who serve the same purpose. These employees tend to have corporate titles that do not mention bounty hunting, preferring instead more sanitised names; perhaps security operative, special actions specialist or corporate enforcement agent. Field operative is particularly common. These individuals are normally retained by corporations that have difficulties with employees embezzling Credits, taking trade secrets and fleeing, whistleblowing when the corporation is not in compliance with local regulations and other activities that hurt profits.

They are typically assigned as individuals to specific divisions or might be a unified team that serves the entire company. The organisational structure is relatively moot since their job is the same and essentially bounty hunting. Oftentimes lower ranking workers will have little knowledge of their existence, the bounty hunters being required to keep their presence to a minimum. They may be given identification cards that mark them as technical support workers or office assistants to control how visible they are to the wider company.

Corporate bounty hunters are the last port of call for many companies, dispatched by either their direct supervisors or, in rarer circumstances, members of the board or those in senior positions. Contracts are therefore not issued in the traditional sense and will instead appear as a case file, with the bounty hunter compensated as part of their salary rather than payment upon completion. There is generally less competition within their ranks, as salary is adjusted based on their time within the company and performance, and there is little crossover between the marks they are sent after.

There are a number of advantages to corporate employment, such as the steady salary. Rather than experiencing the peaks and valleys of windfalls followed by periods of few marks, the corporation pays regardless of work. Most corporations tie pay to results in some fashion and there are often bonuses during field missions of special importance. In addition, operatives have the resources of the entire company behind them, both financial and political.

The downside is that freelance work is greatly frowned upon, if not outright banned. Additionally, if not involved in corporate politics, operatives have little choice in the missions they are given.

At the end of the day, field operatives are bounty hunters who have traded freedom for the umbrella of a corporation. Amongst the lowest levels of operatives, missions may be critically underfunded and personnel are treated like grunts. At the top of the corporate ladder, however, comes wealth and luxury beyond the imaginings of most Travellers.

The salary paid to field operatives can vary immensely but pay equal to Cr1000 x REP per month is not unusual for successful corporations, and can rise to Cr10000 x REP or more for the highest level operatives. Pensions are also available, with every four years of employment counting as a term, as described on page 48 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. Operatives with REP 10+ count every year in employment as a term for the purposes of pensions.

In addition, the [[#Corporation Benefits table]] can be rolled on when employed by a corporation (one roll for every full three points of REP is typical), or the Referee may create their own list of benefits for specific corporations. While corporate operatives do not receive bounties as such, instead taking remuneration by way of salary, their valued employment can also be recompensed via bonuses on important missions. This is always at the discretion of the corporation and is treated as a percentage of that month’s salary. The Referee can roll on the [[#Corporation Bonuses table]] or simply pick a bonus amount if a successful mission is deemed sufficiently important.

## Patrons

Bounty hunting for a patron may work differently than belonging to a traditional agency and is usually the focus of independents. Extremely wealthy patrons are capable and often willing to go far beyond what the typical guild or corporation is prepared to do. On the other hand, there are very few actually willing to get their hands dirty by placing contracts on individuals who have crossed them. Bounty hunters in the service of these individuals often become something more akin to enforcers and are usually on the wrong side of the law.

With this in mind, it is worth noting that not every bounty hunter-employing patron is a mobster. Some are civic-minded and work hand-in-hand with law enforcement to solve problems of violence and corruption. Others are less concerned with backing up the proper authorities but instead seek to assemble elite teams of hunters for the purpose of earning Credits. In essence, they act as exclusive guilds who require no dues but take a percentage on every bounty and typically only pursue the highest profile contracts available.

Because patrons vary considerably and are not structured as other agencies, the benefits of employment vary greatly. It is not unheard of for them to provide very expensive items to use in the line of work, such as a starship. They may also provide budgets that some hunters would consider outrageously large in relation to the size of the bounty, or might be so well connected that tracking a mark is made considerably easier than it would be working for more traditional agencies.

In almost all cases, hunters do not petition patrons directly and making the mistake of doing so is usually one way to ensure a candidate will never be picked. Instead, those patrons who hire bounty hunters are keenly aware of the field, either through their connections or the bounty hunters they already have working for them, and are aware when a hunter has reached the higher echelons of reputation and ability.

While working for a patron has many rewards, it is often the most challenging path to take. For the resources they are investing into their bounty hunters, these individuals expect results and an unhappy patron is quick to sever ties with anyone failing to do their job.

Worse, if a bounty hunter were to be fired and fail to return any property the patron loaned them, it is likely a contract would be put out on them. Many of these patrons have used bounty hunters more than once, and will often have contacts they have previously done business with ready should anything go awry. Additionally, should the bounty hunters share identifying information regarding their patron, they can expect similar consequences.

### Timeline Incentives

One of the things a hunter might try negotiating for in an offered contract are timeline incentives. In other words, if they serve the contract and bring in the mark quickly, they receive a bonus above and beyond the agreed bounty. Not every issuer is willing to entertain this, especially law enforcement agencies. Contracts that already have a time limit are more likely to allow this incentive.

If the Referee decides the issuer is willing and able to negotiate a time-sensitive bonus, they must decide what time threshold merits it. A typical amount is the mark being returned in half or a quarter of the original time limit.

The level of bonus can be determined by the bounty hunter making a Difficult (10+) Diplomat or Persuade check (REP), with the Effect resulting in the level of bonus, as shown on the [[#Incentive Bonus table]].

### Tracking

Tracking a mark requires a series of steps the hunter must take to locate the mark before attempting to apprehend them. These steps may involve persuading people (in whatever manner works) to give information, looking at financial records, analysing logs at spaceports, looking at security data, or other steps specific to the case. This is the part of bounty hunting that is not too different from being a private investigator.

There are two primary ways to structure a trail to the mark. The first and easiest is the chain.

#### The Chain
The chain is a series of steps that must be taken in sequence to catch up with the mark. Each step offers one or more clues leading to the next and after following a number of steps, the hunter arrives at their mark’s location and makes an attempt to bring them in. In many ways, this is essentially a scavenger hunt where the mark is the prize at the end. The structure assumes the bounty hunter will be successful at every step but there may be ways to bypass steps and ‘get ahead’.

The chain structure has several advantages, namely that it is relatively easy to set up, establishes a clear and concise narrative structure for the adventure, and it is relatively easy to steer the hunter back onto the trail if they miss a clue or link in the chain.

> _For example, a bounty hunter takes a contract to apprehend a hacker who gained access to a major bank and walked away with a fortune in stolen and otherwise irretrievable Credits. This contract was issued by local law enforcement, who provide the hunter with a set of clues. A few of these are red-herrings, which could throw them off the trail, such as the fact that the hacker spent a great deal of time at a bar on the seedier side of the city, and another that one of their close friends is part of the banking industry - neither of which leads to any useful information. The final clue is that the mark has a son with a rare genetic condition which is fatal over time._
> 
> _The investigation leads to the son and his mother, who have been estranged from the mark for some time. However, the mother is aware of a scientist on a remote world who has been studying the condition and working on a treatment that could save the lives of people with it. Unfortunately, he has not been able to find any organisations willing to fund his research. This leads to the scientist, who will admit to the hunter that he had recently received an anonymous donation that was enough to conclude the research. One final clue is that the mark transferred the Credits via an agency that required his physical presence at a kiosk in the spaceport._
> 
> _The hunter arrives at the spaceport kiosk and talks to the proprietor, a man who seems less than honest and not willing to share any information he might have. On the way from the kiosk, the hunter is attacked by a group of rough characters who were called by the proprietor to discourage them from following up further. This leads to a chase where the hunter either stops their opponents from interfering further or escapes. In either case, this sets up a second confrontation with the proprietor and the hunter is more likely to meet him at a place where he is more vulnerable, such as his home. This leads to the proprietor divulging that the mark is still in the starport and the place he can be found._

_At this point, the hunter has all the information needed to find the mark and attempt to bring them in. It does leave some questions to be answered, such as whether the theft of the Credits was justified, whether the scientist has a valid treatment for the genetic condition and whether or not the bounty hunter should actually fulfil this contract. However, those are matters to be worried about after the mark has been confronted._

#### The Flowchart
The second structure is the flowchart. Like the chain, the flowchart has a series of ‘story hubs,’ which are the main steps passed through to reach the conclusion. However the flowchart does not pass from one to the next in a linear fashion. Instead, when a story hub is reached, there are a number of possible actions that can help or hinder progress.

> _For example, a bounty hunter might investigate the former abode of the mark and while there, some thugs confront them. From there, a few things might happen. They might attack and defeat the hunter. The hunter could defeat them, or may find clues hidden in the house, or might miss them. If the hunter is beaten up by the thugs, they are driven from the house and miss the clue, at which point they need to find an alternate route to the next story hub. If they defeat the thugs, the bounty hunter might convince them to reveal what they know of the mark’s whereabouts. If the bounty hunter finds the clue planted in the house, it might lead them to secret banking records showing plans to take a trip to a nearby star system._
> 
> _The first path away from the story hub (attaining no new information) leads to a set of possibilities that will put the bounty hunter back on the right track. What these are, specifically, are likely centred around another story hub. The second possibility (getting the thugs to talk) might reveal that the mark was headed for the starport the last time they saw her. This then leads the hunter to either look up departures and destinations from records they must hack into, or they might get that information from a Contact at the starport. Either of those paths leads to the next world the mark fled to._

The flowchart approach allows bounty hunters to follow different leads, or their intuition, and might lead to different parts of the adventure at different times than would otherwise be allowed by a chain structure.

This may feel more like an authentic investigation and therefore more satisfying. The disadvantage is that it requires the Referee to think of the consequences of each encounter and prepare material ahead of a session, which can require improvisation when bounty hunters make logical but unexpected choices.

![[BH-5041.jpg|300]]
### Dead or Alive

Most popular depictions of bounty hunting showcase contracts where the mark can be returned either dead or alive. Whether a bounty hunter prefers one option over the other is down to their own personal outlook and any affiliations they may have. Some guilds refuse to accept dead marks, forcing their bounty hunters to be more restrained when securing a mark. A group of armed personnel bringing in a corpse looks bad, after all.

There does exist a type of bounty hunters who only bring their marks in dead, preferring to shoot and subdue rather than approach situations with more tact. They often have a fearless reputation, with names spread across the subsectors they operate in. However, there have been a notable few whose actions have caught up with them, finding themselves at the legal mercy of different governments. Defence often relies upon the crimes the mark is alleged to have committed, but a few well-placed bribes can go a long way to acquittal.

Although it may fit the trope of bounty hunters to include both solutions to a contract, Referees should be aware that contracts involving crimes such as petty theft will generally not require the death of the mark. Offering different resolution styles to the Travellers will keep bounty hunter contracts interesting, ensuring they cannot just walk in and open fire upon any marks they encounter. Capturing marks alive is exponentially more complicated than bringing in a corpse, with the Travellers required to put more effort into planning and executing their detention. Referees should give the Travellers enough information to be able to locate and arrest their mark without overloading them.

# Contract Work

For the newcomer, there must be a realisation that there is more to bounty hunting than simply employing relevant skills, confronting a mark, and hauling them in. Unless the contract is publicly released, you have to negotiate it, which is a job in itself. You must then track your mark, overcoming obstacles and if you lack other leads, you may need to figure out where your mark is headed based on little more than their last known trajectory.

There is an art to bounty hunting. Successful hunters know this. Those who have reached the pinnacle of reputation have mastered it.

### The Contract

Contracts may originate with patrons, guilds, corporations or anyone who can pull together the Credits required to hire a professional to do their dirty work. Most contracts are perfectly legal, however some can be underhanded and allow litigation against whoever accepts it. Bounty hunters should be careful when accepting a contract from a new person or organisation, as they allow for loopholes that mean they may never get paid.

All contracts share common information, used to help the Travellers identify their targets, listing information required to track down the mark, what the contract was put out for and how dangerous they can expect it to be. Additionally, there is a short brief for the Referees used to flesh out encounters. Referees should be open to creating their own contracts using the format provided, or they can pick one of the contracts from this book. When handing out contracts, the Referee should give the Travellers the contract by way of transmitted document or during a briefing.

In many ways, a contract is like a short adventure and full-length adventures can be derived from a single contract. The following is the format used for contracts.

Contracts have two portions, one intended to be given to the Travellers, with the other containing additional information that the Referee will need.

## Traveller Side

### Mark
This is the name of the mark(s) to apprehend that the contract has been issued for. If the mark is unknown, they will be listed as such.

### Bounty
This is how many Credits are being offered for bringing in the individual (or finding a place or thing that must be located). The amount may vary depending on the status the mark is returned in, which will also be mentioned here. For example, some bounties pay a larger amount if the mark is brought in alive and a lower amount if dead.

### Wanted For
This is why the target is being sought for apprehension and may be anything from skipping a debt to mass murder or genocide.

### Priority
This is how important the contract is to the issuer. Priority is tied to the amount offered for the bounty and will be defined as Low, Mid, High or Critical. Low Priority is often used for bail jumpers who committed petty crimes, while Mid Priority is for individuals who have committed violent acts but are not considered a threat to the public, or who have stolen a large amount of Credits. High Priority is reserved for violent criminals who pose a threat to the public. Critical Priority marks pose a dire threat to society, the government or an organisation; for example, an admiral who has defected and knows all the backdoors into the software of naval warships.

### Issuer
The issuer is the organisation or person issuing the contract. In some cases, particularly when the contract is being handled through a guild, the issuer may be listed as classified.

### Known Associates
This is a list of people known to have links to the mark in the past. In the case of alternate contracts, it might be people associated with the place or thing the bounty hunter is being asked to find.

## Referee Side

### Reputation

This is the minimum REP needed to qualify for taking on the contract. If it is listed as REP 0, anyone can attempt it.

### Last Known Location

This gives the bounty hunter a starting place to begin their search. If it is an alternate contract where the goal is to find a location, this is left blank.

### Short Description
This is a brief that gives the Referee any information they may need.

### Information

This is what happens when the Travellers attempt to find the mark and can include locations or individuals.

### Complications

This 1D roll can be used to change the details of the contract, making it more complicated for the Travellers to complete.

## Negotiating the Contract

One of the major differences between a successful and unsuccessful bounty hunter is how well they negotiate contracts. This is where REP influences the size of the bounties but it is not the only factor.

These are guidelines only but they are good to keep in mind when designing contracts or making common- sense adjustments to the contract generator. Contract negotiation can vary greatly, depending on who is posting the contract. For more information on how REP affects negotiation, look to page 10.

### Law Enforcement
Law enforcement must typically petition a bounty amount from the government it belongs to. Sometimes this is on a case-by-case basis, while others might have a dedicated budget allocated to bounties, and need only consult government officials if a particular bounty is high-profile. Because they have little to no room for negotiation, law enforcement usually makes their contracts public where both independents and guild members can pick them up. In all but high-profile contracts, bounties will be on the low end of the scale.

Contracts will deal primarily with criminals rather than threats to governments or entire worlds. For this reason, Priority will typically be Low to High, as

Critical contracts will be handled by the government’s own agencies. Likewise, law enforcement on most worlds lacks the authority to make a contract classified. Contracts can be viewed as a public notice, usually on datanets, even if a bounty hunter or organisation has been directly contracted.

Criteria to hire a hunter can be as simple as ensuring they are licensed and willing to work for the bounty offered. Sometimes law enforcement agencies require that bounty hunters register with their planetary government, with an official document that states they are allowed to engage in this type of ‘work for hire’. Reputation is a lesser consideration and so many bounty hunters get their start by accepting law enforcement contracts. However, lists will be kept of bounty hunters who failed or caused mishaps, effectively blackballing them from future contracts.

Because of the resources available to law enforcement that are not available to the public, they are often able to provide more leads. They might be able to provide a bounty hunter with information that the mark boarded a liner to another system on a specific date, whereas another agency might not know this and require the hunter to use other methods to follow the mark. Law enforcement is also likely to have a more comprehensive list of known associates and their criminal histories.

### Bail Bondsman
Bail bondsmen are the lowest issuer of contracts that a bounty hunter is likely to work with. When a suspect is arrested, they are taken to jail and on many worlds judges review each case to determine if they pose an active threat or are more likely to behave themselves while awaiting trial. For those not considered threats, the judge typically releases them on bail. While this system usually works, some are not willing to wait around to have their freedom taken away and instead choose to run. This is when bail bondsmen hire bounty hunters.

The Priority of these contracts are usually Low but sometimes stray into the Mid-range. They are also more likely to be privately issued. Many courts give bail bondsmen time to capture an individual attempting to flee justice but there is also likely to be an end-date, after which the matter is referred to law enforcement, so contracts are usually listed with a time limit. Status is almost always Alive and if too many ‘accidents’ happen, the bondsman might find their licence revoked.

Known associates can be important since they are usually close friends or family who acted as guarantors when the bail was posted who may have put up considerable collateral such as a vehicle, home or starship, and are unwilling to part with this property so the mark can flee. For this reason, they tend to be a bit more helpful than otherwise might be expected.

Generally speaking, bail jumper contracts tend to require fewer steps to track and have less opposition since the mark is not often privileged and lacks allies to make pursuit difficult. They are more likely to try to lay low in some seedy location in a population centre where they can live cheaply and get lost in the crowd. For the vast majority of bounty hunters, this type of job is typical. Reputation requirements are rarely high, marks easily tracked and often surrender when confronted, but the pay is less than great.

### Corporate
When corporations issue contracts they are almost never attempting to bring back someone who poses a threat to society but instead is in possession of something that belongs to them, whether that be new technology, schematics, a prototype or embezzled Credits. Corporations will hire outside bounty hunters, although they may also have an in-house security team. These in-house people typically receive the higher-profile marks while contracting work focuses on those likely to cause minimal damage to profitability.

Contracts tend to run from Low to High Priority but almost never Critical. Sometimes years of research are on the line and if a competitor manages to obtain data, they could beat the corporation to market with a revolutionary new product. There is simply no way to recover that sort of loss, so marks in these situations tend to be of High Priority. By comparison, petty thieves are not tolerated simply out of a sense of property ownership and embezzlers once trusted with valuable corporate resources earn themselves a special degree of wrath.

These contracts are almost always privately issued and classified as covert. Corporations do not want outsiders to know when they have been double-crossed by someone inside. The official line is that these matters should be left to law enforcement when laws are broken and the courts when valuable research has been taken. The truth is that corporations have reasons of their own to take direct action from time-to-time, and once marks have been apprehended, their disobedience is often dealt with in a much harsher manner; ranging from having portions of their memories erased to killing them and dumping the body in construction zones where they are unlikely to ever be discovered.

They typically want marks brought in alive, for two reasons. The first is to assess the damage the mark has caused. The second reason is that killing in the field is against the laws of most worlds and if the mark is to be dead, they would prefer to do it quietly. Additionally, hunters who undertake these contracts are often asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, which are rigorously enforced.

Bounties on corporate contracts tend to be higher than normal. If losses are high enough to merit a contract for outside bounty hunters, it is considered as any other investment; resources will be allocated to assure success but not so much that it eclipses profits. If the cost is simply too great, it is more likely to be written off as a loss or assigned to an internal team.

![[BH-5045.jpg]]
### Government
Government contracts are rare and only afforded to the most trusted bounty hunters. Alternatively, a government may approach a guild and subcontract the work out to them. This has some advantages; guaranteed pay, ironclad contracts and, sometimes, governmental backing. However, more often than not, governments stay far away from any hunters they have contracted.

Government-employed operatives require stringent background checks and minimal criminal history, or at least ironclad proof they have fully reformed. They are almost always hired by elected officials or people appointed by them, who must frequently justify actions in the field to oversight agencies within government. If a bounty hunter causes a public incident, collateral damage or political embarrassment, they can become the source of media attention and cause politicians to lose their positions - possibly the worst crime imaginable, in their eyes. Operatives are therefore expected to act responsibly and lawfully at all times, even when in enemy territory. Plausible deniability is a phrase that will be heard often during mission briefings.

When a government employs a bounty hunter, there are strict protocols put into place to corral their actions. If using outside agents, governments are only interested in two things: getting results and covering their involvement. They will contract people that would be least likely to work for them and may not even disclose that they work for a government.

### Organised Crime
Organised criminals have their own enforcers pursue those who have abused trust and attempted to flee but when enforcers are unable to get the job done, bounty hunters are brought in. These criminals are particularly nasty to marks when they are brought in. A high value is placed on loyalty and when someone betrays that trust, it is not just about damage to the organisation or family; it is a matter of maintaining respect. When a mark is turned in, they are rarely seen alive again.

The Priority of contracts from a criminal organisation is almost always Low to Mid-range. Most groups deal in petty crime, such as peddling drugs, fencing stolen property and running protection rackets. Occasionally, they grow large enough to branch into greater things, such as drug manufacture or weapons trading, and this can greatly increase Priority for the worst transgressors.

Expected REP among bounty hunters varies wildly. Those at the lowest end can always find work on the wrong side of the law, despite the fact that they may

become little more than glorified henchmen. On the other hand, when egos and stolen money collide, the leaders of a criminal organisation might demand only the very best bounty hunters. This is where some of the higher reputation hunters thrive, with their names passed around as if they are the stuff of legend.

Status on these hunts is just as much Dead as it is Alive and if the hunter kills the mark, so be it; the criminals may want them dead anyway. Likewise, bounties offered are usually average. Criminal organisations want to pay exactly what it costs to get the job done and not a Credit more. Higher bounties are only issued when the mark has done something to personally offend a crime boss, at which point bounties can rocket when driven by revenge and ego.
![[BH-5051.jpg]]
### Patrons
While some patrons might hire bounty hunters to increase their own wealth, others do so out of a sense of civic duty, justice, revenge or some other motivation known only to themselves. Contract Priority ranges from Low to Critical; a patron might be angry enough at a petty thief that they are willing to spend more than the theft was worth to get even. The matter might be something that means a lot more to the patron however, such as an individual who has obtained information that is unflattering or scandalous.

Patrons vary hugely in social status and wealth, and some otherwise ordinary citizens may try to contract a bounty hunter out of sheer desperation. Such patrons rarely have much money, few contacts in the bounty hunting world, and virtually no choice as to whom might accept the work.

## Contract Generator

Every contract can be created as an adventure by the Referee. However, what follows is a quick contract creation system that, with a few dice rolls, can put together the structure of a contract that can either spark the imagination towards a full-blown adventure or be used ‘on the fly’ if the Travellers’ actions require a contract in the middle of a game with no preparation.

To begin with, roll 2D on the [[#Client and Priority table]] to establish who is issuing the contract, then roll 1D to determine its Priority. After that, the Referee can pick and choose which subsequent tables to roll upon to flesh out the contract, inserting their own creations and ideas at any point. Should the Referee decide they want a little different, they may also roll on the [[#Variant Contracts]] table for more ideas.

![[BH-5054.jpg|200]]

# Contracts

This chapter presents pre-created contracts a Referee can use in a bounty hunting campaign, much in the same way as other Traveller books present patrons or mercenary tickets. Each is an adventure seed the Referee can build upon, integrating it into their own campaign by using existing locations and characters, or stringing contracts together to create a brand new bounty hunter-centred campaign from scratch.

Each contract presented here has suggested bounty payments, a brief description of how the contract should be presented to the Travellers and further details the Referee can use to flesh out a full adventure and introduce [[#complications]]. They are sorted by Reputation, allowing the Referee to choose which contracts may best suit their Traveller groups.

MARK: Sormon Halley WANTED FOR: Murder BOUNTY: Cr7000 Alive PRIORITY: Low (★) ISSUER: Law Enforcement KNOWN ASSOCIATES: Debrie Russo (girlfriend), Rylat and Arban Halley (parents), assorted schoolfriends and local addicts

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 2 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Site of a roadside drive-by shooting.
> 
> Sormon is a minor suspected of lethally shooting a drug dealer, Perdit Loeper, in a deal gone sour before going on the run in a stolen vehicle. Law enforcement has hired bounty hunters to track the boy down and bring him in before Loeper’s associates find him first. Sormon is well known to the youth justice system and local addiction programmes, and was quickly made a suspect in this case from witness statements.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|The Police >| | The police have a rough description of the vehicle, which matches one belonging to Sormon’s parents. |
>| | They provide evidence from the scene that Loeper discharged his own weapon several times before he died. The Vehicle - Following up leads on the stolen vehicle will eventually bring the Travellers to a dingy multi-storey parking lot where the vehicle has been abandoned. |
>| | Loeper managed to perforate it all the way down one side and there is a large amount of blood on the inside. |
>| | The blood is dried now and if the Travellers are observant, they will notice that it has preserved two sets of prints, only one of which matches to Sormon. |
>| | If they have the means of sampling DNA themselves, they will find that the blood in fact belongs to Debrie, Sormon’s on/off girlfriend and known criminal partner. |
>| | There is also evidence (perhaps glove boxes hanging open and the indentation from a knee in the already-dried blood on the back seat) that someone else has been here before the Travellers arrived. The Area - This is a dense, downtown area but a long way from their known haunts and families. |
>| | The two local hospitals will likely be under watch by law enforcement. |
>| | There is also a mobile clinic nearby, from which Sormon once received addiction treatment, as well as a pharmacy, veterinary centre and medical college. |
>| | The hospital nearest to the parking lot is where the Travellers will eventually track them down. They are dealing with scared teenagers, not criminal masterminds. Confrontation - If the Travellers have wasted time running down false leads, there is a chance that they arrive too late, finding both kids executed in Debrie’s hospital room. |
>| | If they have done their work well, they will make it to Debrie’s room just in time to confront Loeper’s partner. |
>| | Faced with one or more armed Travellers, he will attempt to run rather than fight but will shoot back if pursued, endangering hospital staff and patients as well as the Travellers. |
>
>Regardless of what becomes of Loeper’s partner, the Travellers will be rewarded for finding Sormon and Debrie alive. If the would-be assassin can be turned in alive as well, the police might be haggled into paying an additional Cr3500 for the unexpected boost to their closure statistics.

The vehicle was fitted with a police-issue GPS and black box, meaning that Officer Mullins and his long-suffering partner, Lethin Buckley, know exactly where it is. It has been driven into the mountainous region beyond the town where old and well-armed clans govern their own affairs and have little truck with government.

Officer Mullins suspects that this is revenge for his arresting a Prazak elder on a petty vandalism charges a few months earlier.

> 
> REPUTATION: 2 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Any town capable of sustaining a restaurant.
> 
> Efes is a bustling fast-food restaurant in the centre of town but one long suspected of playing fast and loose with the municipal zoning bylaws. The alleged infractions range from illegal gambling, to money laundering, to scrapping stolen domestic robots, but multiple inspections have failed to uncover anything incriminating. Without the manpower (or probable cause) to put the premises under official surveillance, the local police district has reached out for a group of ‘private citizens’ willing to go into Efes wearing a wire and coax one of the staff to say something, anything, incriminating.
> 
> While no one involved in soliciting this operation is going to come out and explicitly say as much, it should be clear to the Travellers that what they are doing is legal-adjacent at best. They have been hired to entrap a potentially innocent man in order to provide the local police with legal cover to ramp up their own surveillance operation. The officers that the Travellers are working for are themselves clearly quite shady, either over-zealously crossing an obvious line or downright corrupt themselves. The Travellers can be morally okay with this or not but if they accept the contract then they should be doing so with their eyes wide open.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Stake Out| The Travellers might watch in shifts and tailstaff as they come and go, or they could attempt to ingratiate themselves with staff and customers, trying to coax out something incriminating with a combination of charm and persistence.
>| | Whatever approach they choose to take, their efforts will come to naught. |
>| | The staff lead perfectly boring and ordinary lives while nothing overtly criminal takes place at the restaurant. |
>| | The Travellers might begin to wonder if they have consumed a lot of deep-fried fowl and sugared beverages for no good reason. |
>| | The Travellers will begin to notice a pattern of odd behaviour amongst a subset of the regular clientele. 
>|The Clientele | They come into the restaurant, exchange a few words with the manager, receive what looks like a receipt and then leave without apparently buying anything. |
>| | This happens too often to be easily explained away. |
>| | The next time such a customer comes in to speak with the manager, the Travellers are alert to it. They may be too far away to capture anything on recording devices but the individual is clearly distraught about something. |
>| | They look much relieved, however, when they leave the restaurant clutching their receipt. 
>|Following | If the Travellers choose to follow this customer, they will be led to a garage where they will find that Efes is indeed a front - for a robot repair co-op, sidestepping onerous intellectual property laws to fix obsolescent domestic robots. |
>
>The Travellers have all the information they need for the law to escalate their action against Efes but, knowing what they know, they have a decision to make. They could simply shrug their shoulders and take the corrupt officers’ Credits, or they could destroy their recordings and let the innocent (if technically illegal) operation continue unchallenged. They could even choose to try to expose the corrupt practices of the officers who hired them, leading to more exciting adventures down the line.

> 
> In the course of a store robbery gone wrong, Ravi assaulted a law-enforcement officer with a knife. The officer’s injuries were not serious and they are expected to be back on duty in a couple of days, but their colleagues are turning over every rock in their hunt for the culprit. Ravi also happens to be a low-level enforcer in a powerful local crime syndicate and they have been feeling the squeeze of the manhunt on their businesses. They have put the word out, through bounty hunting guild intermediaries, that they want Ravi Aguado found and persuaded to turn himself over to the authorities.
> 
> The syndicate are adamant that Ravi be captured alive as the suspicious death of their prime suspect will only draw further unwelcome attention. The police are also firmly on Ravi’s trail but should be thought of as a ticking clock in the background as opposed to an out and out rival to be overcome. Both sides want to see Ravi brought in but the Travellers only get paid if they can get to him first.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The Syndicate | The issuers provide the Travellers with a list of known associates far more exhaustive and accurate than anything the police have.|

>| | Ravi’s friends point the Travellers to a new girlfriend living in one of the seedier parts of town, an open-air dirt track where he regularly goes to race custom trucks and the home address of his parents where he has been known to crash when things got heated or he has needed money. |
>|The Girlfriend| This is a dead end; they have only been dating for a couple of weeks. |
>|The Track | During the daytime, the track is empty. |

>| | They have had no contact with Ravi since he went on the run. |
>| | Poking about, the Travellers will see that Ravi was scratch-building a car in the garage and his room is filled with disassembled electronics and spare parts. |
>| | Ravi’s parents will respond to this observation by recalling that their son had always dreamt of working maintenance on a spacecraft and had apprenticed at a garage not far from their house. The owner had been something of a mentor but cut off all contact after Ravi’s fall into crime. |
>|The Garage| The Travellers arrive at the garage just in time to see a banged-up sports car roaring off the lot. |
>| | If the Travellers came to the garage on foot then they will have no hope of catching him; he will eventually be run off the road by the police and the Travellers will get nothing |
>| | If the Travellers possess their own transportation, then they will have a chase on their hands and a series of opposed Drive checks of escalating danger, culminating either in Ravi’s escape or the Travellers successfully running him off the road. |
>| | They may learn later that Ravi’s parents called the garage immediately after their departure to ask if Ravi was there, giving the Travellers intentions away. |

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> REPUTATION: 3 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Planet in an undeveloped system, far from population centres and trading routes. Iden Zanti is used as an example but can be placed on any hot world with a dense, poisonous atmosphere.
> 
> For three years, Hadia has been leading a solo research mission on the surface of, studying the language of the native alien species, a low-technology but intelligent people known as the Chard.  Hadia sent monthly progress reports to her colleagues via the geological survey team that is currently exploring the system, but she missed her last communication window and her colleagues, familiar with her routines, are worried. 
> Iden Zanti is too far for the scientists to get to themselves and the usual mail route to the geologists will not arrive there for several weeks. Instead, they have raided their research budgets and hired bounty hunters to investigate their colleague’s disappearance.
> 
> Iden Zanti belongs to an undeveloped system, far from any population centres and the usual trading routes. It is a hot world with a dense, poisonous atmosphere necessitating the wearing of protective suits and pressurised vehicles while exploring the surface. The native Chard have only achieved TL1 but are physiologically adapted to the conditions. There is no starport but rudimentary docking provision can be found on an orbiting platform belonging to the geological survey. It is largely automated with a rotating crew of about a dozen, most of whom are scattered across the wider system. This will be the Travellers’ first port of call.
> 
> The geologists do not have much information for them. They have not seen or heard from Hadia in some time but claim this is not unusual and that it is not their job to chase her up. It is clear that there is not much love lost between Hadia and the geologists; their survey is commercially funded and there have apparently been disagreements between Hadia and the geologists with many refusing to accept the Chard as not all that smart at all and rubbishing her attempts at deciphering their language. Whenever anything goes wrong on Iden Zanti, the geologists are quick to point the finger at the Chard and this case is no exception.
> 
> Hadia’s academic colleagues will be saddened to learn the outcome of the Travellers’ search but they will take comfort from the knowledge that the results of her life’s work will endure.

>| The Chard | Hadia was living in a habitat module on the outskirts of a Chard settlement. |
>| | According to her reports, the Chard are a peaceful species lacking even the concept of mortality or violence, but they are baffling and somewhat eerie, and it is easy to see why the geologists distrust them as they crowd around the Travellers, pulsing and signalling in incomprehensible ways. |
>| | The Chard are a gelatinous life form who communicate by generating ripple patterns in their thoracic sacs. This defeats even the most advanced universal translation software that the Travellers might have with them and making obtaining useful leads from the Chard impossible. |
>| | Any scanning equipment that the Travellers brought with them will reveal no sign of Hadia.|
>| Hadia’s Hab| Searching Hadia’s habitat, the Travellers find evidence that she had made some progress on deciphering the Chard’s language, but the notes on her computer are incomplete. |
>| | It might be possible to fill in some of the gaps to come up with a working translation but Hadia has devoted three years to this and was an expert in her field. |
>| | The Travellers will know, from information given to them by Hadia’s colleagues, that Hadia prefers to write her notes longhand and these notebooks are marked by their absence. |
>| | Her pressurised ATV is still parked outside the habitat but her protective suit is missing. |
>| | Hadia’s computer will also reveal that she has been in daily contact with someone in the geological survey - something that they curiously failed to mention. |
>| | The contents of the messages are encrypted. If the Travellers can break the encryption then they will learn that Hadia had been in a long-term intimate relationship with a geologist named Boruc. If they are unable to access the messages, they will learn the name later as they will undoubtedly want to challenge the survey team to ask about the messages. |
>|Boruc| Boruc is currently working on the surface. |
>| | The Travellers can take the abandoned ATV to him where he will confess that he did indeed break into Hadia’s module and steal her notes, hoping to find a way to speak with the Chard and find out what happened to her. |
>| | With Boruc’s help and Hadia’s unabridged notes, the Travellers will finally be able to communicate with the Chard. |
>|Where is Hadia? | In her excitement at finally cracking their language, she lost track of time and did not make it back to her habitat before her oxygen supply ran out. |

> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Scientific colony on a remote moon - Orcadas Base is used as an example.
> 
> Orcadas Base is a scientific colony, established on a remote moon to monitor a once-in-a-generation seismic event. Decades of preliminary work and preparation have been thrown into disarray, however, by native alien raiders who have been growing ever bolder in their attacks. The outpost is well-armed and the field scientists well-trained in self-sufficiency and basic survival, but they are not soldiers and with the event they have been preparing for mere weeks away they cannot spare the manpower to confronting these attacks. To this end, the lead researcher and de facto mayor has hired a group of bounty hunters to fight the raiders off while they race to get their instruments back in working order.
> 
> The outpost’s needs are two-fold. They need to get damaged scientific equipment back into working condition very quickly and keep raiders from breaching their perimeter. The Travellers can assist with the first, if they can convince the scientists of their aptitude, but they are primarily here to fight, freeing the hosts to attend to the repairs themselves.
> 
> Orcadas Base is well-defended. The raiders have TL3 equipment, wielding primitive firearms and attacking from coal-fired ATVs but attack in great numbers with the tactical acumen to use this to advantage; their goal, after all, is not to fight the Travellers but keep them occupied while they make off with Orcadas Base’s valuable hardware. The natives will subject Orcadas Base to ever-escalating attacks, the Travellers barely holding them at bay before attacked again. With each attack, the scientists fall further and further back with their repairs. It will eventually become clear to the Travellers that they cannot go on this way. If they want to defend the outpost, they will have to go on the attack.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Orcadas Base | It is compact, with a titanium steel perimeter barrier, sentry towers and remote-controlled gun drones. These were originally intended as a defence against the harsh environment and predatory wildlife but will serve the Travellers well as a stronghold.|
>| | The scientists do not know where the natives live. |
>| | The base was designed to be self-sufficient, the site chosen in part for its supreme isolation. |
>| | The lead researcher theorises that the natives’ heightened aggression might be invoked by the very increase in seismic activity that they are studying. |
>|The Terrain Beyond |There are several deep tracks left by fighting vehicles that could easily be followed. |
>| | The aliens have set up a military encampment several days hike, or a single day’s off-road drive, from Orcadas Base. It is home to over 1,000 aliens and almost all are soldiers. |
>|Approaching Aliens| The Travellers could identify and capture a leader, destroy an important munitions store, or sabotage the ATVs that the raiders rely on to launch their attacks. |
>| | The Travellers could try what the scientists apparently never have and talk with the raiders. This option might well appeal to an experienced Traveller but with no prior knowledge of the species and their culture, establishing a dialogue will be challenging. |
>| | Attempts at peaceful resolution will remove the element of surprise, making subsequent efforts more difficult. |
>
>If the Travellers are able to delay the aliens’ attack, by whatever means, long enough for the scientists to take their measurements, then Orcadas Base will reward them in full. If not, the scientists will miss their window with decades of hard work and sacrifice going to waste.

MARK: Hacked Fabrication Chamber WANTED FOR: Counterfeiting currency BOUNTY: Cr30000 Alive PRIORITY: Mid (★★) ISSUER: Planetary Revenue Service KNOWN ASSOCIATES: N/A

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 4 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Any world with advanced fabrication.
> 
> Local law enforcement and revenue collection agencies have reason to suspect that a hacked domestic fabrication chamber is being used to produce counterfeit Credits somewhere in their jurisdiction. The small number of counterfeit Credits in circulation has made it difficult to track the culprit down and suggests that they are dealing with an amateur, perhaps even a prankster, rather than a criminal with genuinely malicious intent. This has made it difficult for law enforcement to come up with a list of suspects. The counterfeiter’s current activities have been mostly harmless but the revenue service is concerned about the potential repercussions to the planetary economy should the operation be scaled up, or should more serious criminal players get their hands on it. For that reason, they have called in outside assistance to help chase down leads and sift through data, and will pay for any information that leads to an arrest.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The Planetary Revenue Service (PRS)| The Travellers will not meet the PRS themselves and are instead acting as external, and therefore unaffiliated, contractors. |
>| | The Travellers are provided with extensive and current databases of tax-and- spend data covering every adult that should flag up anyone spending beyond their means. |
>| | The problem, as with any large dataset, is dealing with the huge number of false positives guilty of more prosaic forms of tax evasion and fraud. |
>| | The PRS are aware that it takes an individual of rare ability to work-around the in-built restrictions on a commercial fabrication chamber and has compiled a list of potential culprits. |
>| | Law enforcement officers have picked up rumours of criminal gangs, tipped off by an informant. Following or questioning the criminal element might also lead the Travellers to the fabrication chamber. |
>|Three Options | Sifting through PRS tax records will turn out to be a bust. As the Travellers will eventually discover, the counterfeiter is not an adult and so has no tax records.
>| | Shadowing the gangs’ will throw up no definitive leads although it might help the Travellers narrow their investigation to a few favoured haunts or a particular district. |
>| | Chasing up on the PRS’ list of computer experts, however, will eventually lead the Travellers to a high school student called Thea Breen.|
>| Thea Breen| Thea Breen fits the profile perfectly; a computer genius with no disciplinary troubles, and hence not on anyone’s records, and something of a recluse, which helps to explain why no one has been able to find her. |
>| | The Travellers can pay a visit to her house but her parents refuse to let them inside without proper identification. They will have to talk their way past or call for police backup, which buys Thea time to slip out and run away. |
>| | A search of Thea’s room shows a small fabrication chamber that has quite obviously been tampered with. |
>| | Using a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check, the Travellers will be able to determine that this fabrication chamber could make Credits, guns, explosives and anything else that a girl on the run might need. She could be considered armed and potentially dangerous. |
>|Tracking| Now that they have a name and face to work with, it is easy to pull up Thea Breen’s records and track her movements. She has not gone far, running to her local high school a few streets away where she has holed up in the science laboratory. |
>| | The Travellers will have given the PRS more than enough to get paid but it is quite likely that they will get swept up in the excitement of the manhunt or simply want to see it through to the end.|
>| The Laboratory | The Travellers (with armed police backup, if they successfully deduced the fabrication chamber’s function) surround the school and go in. |
>| | Thea refuses to come quietly and has fabricated a swarm of small hunter/killer robots who will fight the Travellers corridor-by-corridor. |

MARK: Braff Uberwald WANTED FOR: Murder BOUNTY: Cr35000 Alive PRIORITY: Mid (★★) ISSUER: Law Enforcement KNOWN ASSOCIATES: Suds (best friend), Zofi (cousin), Tenkard (bar tender at favourite bar), Philina Wang (previous bounty hunter)

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 4 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: The apartment of Philina Wang
> 
> Braff is wanted on suspicion of several murders, all the result of bar fights with Braff claiming that he acted in self-defence. He was briefly captured by a bounty hunter, Philina Wang, but managed to escape her custody and go back on the run. The authorities want him brought in alive to stand trial for his crimes.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|To Begin| The authorities provide them with an exhaustive list of known associates, as well as the location where the previous bounty hunter, Philina, was holding him prior to his escape. |
>|Philina |A visit to this address will reveal nothing helpful, in part because Philina is present and determined to keep the Travellers from poking around.|
>| | She will do everything she can to try to warn them off the case, alluding to Braff’s violent crimes and prodigious physical strength, and puts them on notice that she has every intention of finding Braff herself and fulfilling her original contract. |
>|Seeking Information| Braff has no address of his own. He has spent the last few years serially unemployed, commuting between a small handful of regular bars and the couches of various friends and family. |
>| | Most of these are unhelpful to the point of being downright obstructive but a few are sick enough of Braff’s freeloading to help the Travellers, if they can be assured that whatever they say will not get back to Braff. |
>| | Braff is a creature of habit. He likes to be in familiar places. On the run, he will often retreat to somewhere he feels safe, surrounded by people he knows. He likes his routines. |
>| | Researching Philina’s file, the Travellers will discover that Philina originally apprehended Braff in a boarded-up old bar where he had briefly worked as a bare-knuckle fighter, before the authorities closed the place down. |
>|The Bar| The Travellers find Braff squatting in the old bar but Philina is already there, waiting for Braff to come out so she can hit him with a stunner in the open. |
>| | Philina is not about to back down and the Travellers can either agree to split the bounty with her (although she will not be haggled below a 50-50 split) or fight her too, although this will alert Braff to their presence. |
>| | Braff is a big, violent character, an expert unarmed combatant who has already killed six men with his bare hands and he will not go down easily. |
>| | Going into the bar to get him out is going to be extraordinarily dangerous but, with Philina’s help, might just be possible. Otherwise, the best bet might just be to wait him out and hope to catch him by surprise. |
>
> The authorities will pay out the full bounty as soon as they have Braff in a cell, which the Travellers can then split with Philina, or not, as they choose. If Braff should be killed, then the Travellers will get nothing.
>
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
>| 1-2| Everything is as presented.|
>|3| Philina is unwilling to barter with the Travellers to share the contract and must be fought.|
>|4| As in 3 but Philina’s reports on Braff cannot be found anywhere and the Travellers must work on police casework alone. |
>|5| Rather than let the Travellers take over her contract, Philina has alerted Braff that there is a rival group attempting to take his bounty, causing him to become hypervigilant. |
>|6| Braff has overpowered Philina, taking her stunner to use as a secondary weapon if needed.|

MARK: Marzel Voss WANTED FOR: Dating the boss’ daughter BOUNTY: Cr40000 Alive / Cr32000 Dead 
PRIORITY: Mid (★★) ISSUER: Peda Kiljek KNOWN ASSOCIATES: Jodi Voss (mother), Rosa Glas (bodyguard), Onfrey Goro (marriage clerk), various criminal associates and drinking buddies

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 4 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Leaving Peda Kiljek’s house
> 
> Marzel Voss was a low-level enforcer for the Kiljeck crime family. Unbeknownst to his criminal associates, he was involved in a long-running secret relationship with the boss’ daughter, Liane Kiljek. Peda Kiljek, the head of the family, wants them both found. Marriage, on this world, is an irrevocable commitment and so as far as Peda Kiljeck is concerned, Marzel Voss has to die. Liane Kiljek, however, is to be returned unharmed.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The Enforcers| Peda Kiljek has loyal enforcers watching all of the public transit stations and roads, and they are confident that Marzel and Liane have not made it out of the city.|
>| | The Kiljeks do not have a lot to go on beyond that but Peda can provide the Travellers with a few likely leads to get them started. |
>| | Marzel is known to spend his free time at a seedy bar popular with the Kiljek family’s thugs. |
>| | He also has an ailing mother to whom he regularly delivers money to pay for care visits and physiotherapy. |
>|The Bar and Mother| The bar provides no further clues. Marzel’s criminal associates are more interested in teasing out everything the Travellers know than they are in being helpful themselves. If any of them knew where there former friend was, then it is clear they would be claiming the bounty for themselves. |
>| | His mother, too, is a dead-end as Marzel has not yet been gone long enough for her to miss his Credits. The Travellers could watch her and wait, but Kiljek is too impatient to accept that, regularly sending goons to follow them and check on their progress. |
>|Other Leads | Liane has no family other than Peda. The Kiljeks are tight-lipped about it but Peda purportedly executed Liane’s mother after she turned informant against him. The rest of her extended family disappeared soon after. |
>| | The only other person who knew her well was her bodyguard, Rosa Glas, currently under effective house arrest while Peda comes up with a suitably horrible punishment for her failures. She claims no knowledge of Marzel and Liane’s tryst, or of their marriage, or where they might have hidden themselves afterwards. |
>| | The final lead is the city clerk who officiated and signed off on the couple’s wedding. He cannot remember the wedding in question but is able to present the Travellers with the marriage certificate. |
>| | An unfamiliar name, Hildur Banik, is listed as the witness. As they are already in the city hall, it only takes a quick look through the records to discover that Hildur Banik is the name of Liane’s aunt, on her mother’s side, who is perhaps not so dead after all. |
>| | The images with the files reveal (accounting for age and some cosmetic surgery) that Hildur Banik is, in fact, Liane’s bodyguard, Rosa Glas. 
>|Rosa Glas| Rosa starts shooting the moment the Travellers return to her house. She lost her sister to the Kiljeks and refuses to lose her niece too. |
>| | The Travellers have her surrounded and out-gunned but Rose is a skilled combatant with a defensible position inside the house. |
>| | Once they get past her, they will find Marzel and Liane barricaded behind a concealed door. The couple will beg the Travellers to let them go, offering to match Peda Kiljek’s bounty if an appeal to their mercy is insufficient. |
>| | If the Travellers instead honour the original warrant and bring Marzel back dead, then they will have to shoot their way through both Marzel and Liane, all while somehow ensuring that Liane herself survives the fight unharmed. |
>
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
>| 1-3| Everything is as presented. |
>|4| Marzel’s mother has been dead for a number of months.|
>| 5| Liane hates her father, and has been working with Marzel on a plan for both of them to escape the criminal organisation.| 
>|6| Rosa does not immediately shoot the Travellers, instead asking them to help her get Liane and Marzel offworld. She offers to increase the bounty payment to Cr50000 in exchange for them both being taken to safety, alive.|
>
>On receipt of Marzel Voss’ body (or some other convincing proof of his demise), Peda Kiljeck will pay the bounty in full. If Liane Kiljek should be harmed in any way, then he will pay a lesser bounty in line with the severity of her injury. If she should be killed, however, then the Travellers should know enough about Peda Kiljek by now to not go back to him expecting a reward.

> 
> REPUTATION: 4 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: A technologically advanced world, with genetics labs, cloning facilities and DNA scanners
> 
> On the face of it, Kenelm’s death in an air/raft collision eight months ago was an open and shut case. There was a body whose death and identity were confirmed and investigators deemed the collision as accidental. Kenelm’s life insurance policy paid out to the next of kin. A week ago, Kenelm’s face and DNA print appeared on a routine scan passing through the downport.
>
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The Scan|- Speaking to port security, the Travellers will find that the face and DNA print do match Kenelm Chaudry. Gytha, Sivush and Kandake - Can be found at home. They are still grieving.
>| | Gytha will explain that Kenelm lost his job at a genetics laboratory some time ago and they had been struggling financially before his death. |
>| | If handled sensitively, Gytha will add her husband had contemplated suicide and had been seeing a therapist. |
>|The Therapist | The therapist will inform the Travellers that suicidal thoughts will not invalidate a life insurance policy. |
>| | All discussions she had with Kenelm are confidential. |
>| | She has not seen Kenelm since their last session before his death. |
>| | All correspondence went through the laboratory where he worked, up to and including the session before his death.|
>| The Genetics Lab | Kenelm had been visiting the lab at night for several months after his termination, with the last visit a week before his death. |

>| | After their last recorded visit, they are seen leaving with a third figure carried between them. This person’s face is covered by a hood and cannot be identified. |
>| | The staff at the laboratory are reluctant to let the Travellers poke around but a little resourcefulness should allow them to figure out that the laboratory is registered provider of healthcare services involving medical cloning. |

>|Diina | No-one can be found at Diina’s home. |
>| | Her neighbours tell them that Diina has had a relative matching Kenelm’s description staying with her for about eight months and that she drove him to the downport a week ago. |
>|The Downport| Browsing the downport’s passenger manifests will show that Diina purchased two one-way tickets, for herself and for a Yasin Chaudhari. |
>
> The Travellers have now identified a ship, an alias, a co-conspirator, a destination and clear evidence of insurance fraud in the form of the illegal use of medical cloning facilities to plant a lifeless clone of Kenelm Chaudry in an air/raft accident. The Travellers now have all the information they need for Zenithal Insurance to reclaim their payout to the Chaudry family.

> [!info]- Referee's Information

REPUTATION: 4 SUGGESTED LOCATION: Viscountess Dearbhla’s city estate

Taymuraz, eldest son of the incredibly wealthy Viscountess Dearbhla LXIV, was released on bail pending trial, charged with several counts of public indecency, vandalism of a high-end restaurant and the assault of a fellow diner. Having failed to turn up to his pre-trial hearing, the courts have posted a warrant for his re-arrest. Taymuraz is not thought to be dangerous but, given his high-profile and obvious financial means, he has been deemed a significant flight risk.

>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The City Estate | Taymuraz has been supposedly staying at the estate whilst awaiting trial and the viscountess put up the family yacht, Bird of Paradise, as collateral against his bail.
>| | Dearbhla is not as helpful as someone standing to lose a yacht would be expected to be. |
>| | The servants, on the other hand, tell the Travellers that Taymuraz was there the previous night, drinking with one of his rich friends, Gerolf Szoldos. Both youths left in the early hours in Gerolf’s luxury grav car. |
>|Other Associates | The Travellers get no answer and find the property empty. |
>| | Taymuraz’s known associates are conspicuously absent from their homes. |
>| | If the Travellers check in at the starport, they will be told that none of them have passed through but the starport staff laugh and remind them that Taymuraz hardly needs to go through starport check-in - he has the family yacht berthed at his country estate.
>|The County Estate| The Travellers find the Bird of Paradise missing. |
>| | The staff inform the Travellers that Taymuraz and his friends turned up just before dawn for a joy-ride around the star system. |
>| | The viscountess was informed but ordered them not to tell everyone, expecting Taymuraz to come back but there has been no contact since. |
>| | The staff worry that Taymuraz could have got himself into some kind of accident as he and his friends were all very drunk when they went aboard and set off without a crew. The Bird of Paradise - They will find the ship, sailing erratically around the outer system. |
>| | Attempts at hailing the Bird of Paradise are met with a tirade of drunken insults. Taymuraz and his friends are young, entitled and armed with lasers - rarely a good combination. |
>| | If the Travellers try to disable or board the Bird of Paradise then they will respond, returning fire with laser turrets and attempting evasive manoeuvres. Their shooting is poorly aimed however and their attempts at manoeuvres are more a danger to their own ship than the Travellers are. |
>| | Taymuraz and his friends continue to be abusive even after the Travellers force their way aboard but do not otherwise resist. |
>
>The Travellers can take Taymuraz into custody and commandeer the Bird of Paradise’s bridge for the journey back to the starport. Once there, they can turn Taymuraz over to the authorities and receive the bounty.

## Buried Treasure

MARK: Hettir the Swift WANTED FOR: Grand Larceny BOUNTY: Cr85000 Alive or for the treasure 
PRIORITY: Mid (★★) ISSUER: The Order of the Dove and Thorn KNOWN ASSOCIATES: None

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 4 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: [[Gohature]], [[Spinward Marches]]
> 
> Hettir is a former pirate captain who, for the brief time her corsair ship was plying the stellar main, was the bane of merchant shipping. Her crew disbanded and went their separate ways after a major antiquities heist made all their fortunes. The other members of her crew have all turned up or died over the years but the famous treasure has never been found and Hettir, despite being a ghost for nearly 30 years, has remained on various organisations’ most-wanted lists. She recently resurfaced on Gohature in the form of an antique coin, part of the infamous three-decades-old heist, was turned in at a provincial bank.
> 
> The treasure’s rightful owner wants Hettir brought back to them but justice is secondary to the return of the lost cultural artefacts. They want her alive to tell them where the treasure has been hidden but if bounty hunters can locate it for them, then they really will not care what happens to Hettir.
> 
> |Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|The Vault| The coin is being held in a secure vault, in a small-town bank on a small-town world, where it will remain until its rightful owners can claim it.
>| | The Travellers have been granted permission to inspect the coin but cannot remove it from the bank. |
>| | Staff can tell them that the coin was deposited by someone from AgriMax, an agricultural supplies wholesaler. |
>| | Forensic examination of the coin reveals three recent sets of prints or DNA traces; one belongs to a cashier at the bank. They will have to travel to AgriMax to investigate further.|
>| AgriMax| AgriMax is more of a giant warehouse than a store, with orders coming in and going out in bulk, processed by robots. |
>| | The Travellers can track down Vlastim by asking around AgriMax’s limited number of human employees. Vlastim - Vlastim will remember seeing the coin as he had to check it was legal tender but he has no idea where it came from as ordering, dispatch and payments are all processed automatically. |
>| | If the Travellers are able to win Vlastim around, he might let them take a look at AgriMax’s records, narrowing their search down to just a handful of big farms. |
>| | The Travellers could try their luck with lower lever employees, the robots, or retrieving the information by more underhanded means. If they cannot, they must visit the dozens of giga-farms supplied by AgriMax. |
>|Aeroponics| The Travellers will eventually get a hit on Hettir at an immense aeroponics facility. |
>| | There are a huge number of people there, amidst the dense foliage and mist, and the Travellers will have a difficult time working through them. |
>| | If they are less than discrete then Hettir may spot them and slip away, never to be found. |
>| | If they are more careful, then they will eventually corner Hettir in the central processing facility that also doubles as her family home.|
>| Cornering Hettir | She will surrender when challenged but beg for the chance to hug her granddaughter goodbye before going with them. |
>| | If the Travellers allow her request then she draws a weapon concealed in the infant’s clothes and starts shooting. |
>| | The rest of the family will come out of the aeroponics mist to join in the fight and the Travellers will have a challenge bringing Hettir in alive. |
>| | If they can convince Hettir that their employers are only interested in the treasure and not her, then she can be talked into standing down. |
>
>After being shown to the treasure, the Travellers will have everything they need to claim the bounty. Of course, as a notorious pirate, Hettir is wanted by a lot of other parties and, if the Travellers are willing to go back on their word and shoot their way through Hettir’s family, there is no doubt still a lot of Credits somewhere.
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
>| 1-3| Everything is as presented.|
>| 4| Security has been implemented at the aeroponics facility, meaning the Travelers must stow any weapons before they enter. |
>| 5| None of AgriMax’s non-robot employees speak Galanglic. |
>| 6| The employees at the aeroponics farm have been made aware to keep an eye out for visitors, making them all the more suspicious.|

She has since been transferred to a maximum-security prison on the worlds moon, Rumex, while she awaits a show-trial on espionage charges and a very public execution. Marquess Jyoti Sharmirrisharma of Trane, Mistress of the Order of the Dover and Thorn, has tried all of her diplomatic levers but the world's impersonal bureaucracy is intransigent; they are determined to make an example of Ahanh and drag Jyoti’s name through the mud in the process.
> 
> A rescue is the only option left.
> 
> The Rumex prison is a maximum-security facility built to house the most violent offenders and high-level political prisoners. It is surrounded by airless rock, has no artificial gravity and boasts a state-of-the-art sensor grid. It is heavily defended by armed guards stationed within the prison and regular interceptor sorties of the moon’s surface and neighbouring space. It is in constant communication with a sister facility planetside via laser. This can only be intercepted by physically crossing its beam and any interruption will trigger a swift and overwhelming response from the planet.
> 
> The Marquess has drawn up a plan for how a prison break will go but it is the Travellers who need to pull it off.

>|The Control Room | They can do this either by coercing a guard into revealing it, or overcoming the computer’s security software and discovering it that way. |
>| | Holding onto the control room will remove the prison guards’ tactical advantage of centralised command and monitoring, at the cost of splitting their forces. |
>| | The Baronet is in a wing reserved for political prisoners and terrorists. |
>| | The easiest way to get her out is to remotely open all locks from the control room but this will release a horde of angry prisoners that the Travellers will have to fight their way through. The other, more discrete but potentially more difficult option, is to blow open Ahanh’s cell with explosives or find a guard with access they can use.|
>| Breaking Out| The Travellers must fight their way back to their ship and blast their way out. |

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 5 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: IISS Station Epsilon
> 
> Red Jelica was a bounty hunter with the Golden Cloak guild, well-known for taking on the most dangerous contracts permitting, or demanding, the termination of the mark. Now, it seems, she has allowed her predilection for shooting first and asking questions later to go too far. She is wanted for a string of murders, each more gruesome than the last, culminating in that of her mark, a detached duty scout discovered in an isolated, one-man supply depot. Jelica’s ship has been impounded by the IISS and bounties placed upon her and her crew. The Golden Cloak finds itself in the unusual situation of putting up Credits for the capture of one of its own. They want Jelica and her crew brought in alive if possible but would rather see her quietly eliminated than let the IISS damage the guild’s reputation with a trial.
> 
> |Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Starting Clues | Jelica’s last contract was for Emond Darvish, a retired scout doing detached duty in a small depot on this out-of-the-way planet. He was suspected of minor financial misdemeanours before assuming his role.|
>| | The scouts, who double as law enforcement, have Jelica’s ship and pilot in their custody. |
>| | Akadiy explains that Jelica’s reputation for creating bloodier messes than she can clear up have made it harder for her to find paying work, hence taking on this contract in the first place. |
>|Emond’s Station | Emond’s station is deep in the forests and the Travellers arrive to a bloody scene. |
>| | The body has been removed but is still a gruesome sight. |
>| | The area is too remote for there to have been any witnesses but the Travellers will not have to look too hard to find blood trails, tracks and other physical evidence pointing them further into the forests. |
>| | The scouts inform them of automated logging depots scattered around, supplying IISS bases with timber and it is possible that Jelica and her remaining crew have fled to one of these.|
>| The Logging Depot | The trail leads to a remote logging depot. It is loud and unsettling, impossible to see or hear anything for the gigantic, dangerous-looking robots constantly sawing down trees. |
>| | The Travellers find Bernadine’s body, shot-up against a log-pile. Another trail of bloody footprints leads them to Saeeda, shot once in the chest and still alive. |
>| | As soon as the Travellers stop to tend to Saeeda, Red Jelica springs her trap, opening fire. |
>|Red Jelica | Red Jelica is alone but well-armed and highly skilled, and has prepared her ground well. |
>| | She is smart enough to know the guild does not want her taken alive, so has already called in the IISS. |
>| | At some point during the firefight, a small but heavily-armed detachment of scouts will swoop in to grab her. If the Travellers have been unable to subdue her by this point then they will have to either talk the scouts into letting them have her, fight them off and damn the consequences, or accept the inevitable and let the scouts carry off their smirking prize. |
>| | They could always plan to spring Jelica from the over-stretched scouts’ custody at some later date but this will be a whole new adventure. |
>
>The Golden Cloak will pay the full bounty in exchange for Jelica or suitably convincing proof of death. If the Travellers fail to get to Jelica before the scouts do, and fail to liberate her afterwards, they will get nothing.
>
>|1D |Complications|

They have a penchant for killing victims in ghastly ways before displaying them in pseudo- ritualistic fashion around the swamps where they make their hideout.

## The Whistleblower

MARK: Jana Kell WANTED FOR: Theft BOUNTY: Cr80000 Alive PRIORITY: Mid (★★) ISSUER: Lagut Chemotrophics KNOWN ASSOCIATES: A mysterious contact on Atsah, Deneb

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 7 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Departing [[Lagut]] Highport on the subsidised liner Maiden Voyager.
> 
> Professor Jana Kell is a prominent scientist who has stolen a trove of commercially sensitive research notes from a corporation biolab and fled the system. Lagut Chemotrophics believe that she intends to sell the research to a regional rival, Denebloc Biosystems, potentially costing them billions of Credits in lost patents. They have posted a large reward for the recapture of both Professor Kell, and the research, and are prepared to back bounty hunters materially, financially and legally, to ensure that it is done.
> 
> Lagut Chemotrophics will provide the Travellers with a significantly faster ship (assuming they do not already have one) and a trained crew, capable of completing the journey in a fraction of the time. They are to beat the Maiden Voyager to Atsah or, better yet, intercept her at one of the refuelling stops in order to seize the professor in less public circumstances.
>
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Where To?| Professor Kell made efforts to cover her tracks but the computer experts at Lagut Chemotrophics have been able to reconstruct her communications in the weeks prior to her disappearance.
>| | The professor had been sending and receiving regular mail packets via the x-boat network from someone on the distant world, Atsah. |
>| | As this is the headquarters of Denebloc Biosystems, one of Lagut’s closest rivals, the corporate bosses have to believe that she intends to sell the research to Denebloc. |
>| | Lagut Chemotrophics have unambiguous surveillance footage, electronic boarding records and eyewitness testimony that Professor Kell boarded a subsided liner, Maiden Voyager, bound for Atsah. |
>| | The liner will need to make several stops, taking several weeks. |
>|Tracking the Liner| The Travellers, with the assistance of the Lagut Chemotrophics crew, must first attempt to track its likeliest course towards Atsah. Success or failure will be based on a series of Astrogation checks and the Referee’s discretion. |
>| | It might be a good idea to string the Travellers along with a few near misses before finally allowing them to catch up. |
>|Interception | The Travellers intercept the subsidised liner as it manoeuvres out of the highport towards the 100-diameter distance to enable its jump drives. |
>| | As a private vessel in Imperial space, the Travellers have no authority to challenge the Maiden Voyager and its captain is reluctant to allow them aboard or answer any questions about his passengers. |
>| | The Travellers could attempt to persuade or threaten the captain, disable the Maiden Voyager with their ship’s weapons, or attempt to board the liner and snatch Professor Kell themselves. |
>| | It is important to bear in mind that they are not ambushing the Maiden Voyager in deep space - they are a few hundred thousand kilometres out of the highport and the Maiden Voyager’s captain will undoubtedly be signalling his distress to other ships in the vicinity unless the Travellers actively prevent him from doing so. |
>| | The Travellers will find to that Professor Kell is no longer aboard the liner. She transferred to another, faster ship after her first stop. |
>|Atash| Speaking to the starport workers, the Travellers will learn that Professor Kell arrived about a day before them.|
>| | Throwing around some Credits and doing a bit of old-fashioned investigating, the Travellers will be able to trace the professor to a hotel on the outskirts of the downport. |
>|The Hotel| The Travellers will find Professor Kell sitting in the plush hotel lobby with two others: A nervous-looking woman and a large, surreptitiously armed man who is clearly some kind of bodyguard. |
>| | The Travellers might try to wait to catch the professor alone, or risk confronting her now before she can hand over any of Lagut Chemotrophics’ secrets. |
>| | When challenged, Professor Kell will reveal that the woman she was meeting was an investigative journalist working to expose unethical research practices that she oversaw in Lagut Chemotrophics’ labs. |
>
>At this point, the Travellers have everything they need to bring the professor in, but whether or not they should is for their own conscience to decide.
>
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
>| 1-3| Everything is as presented.|
>|4|Professor Kell was speaking to a rival corporate agent all along.|
>|5|Professor Kell cannot be seen in the lobby and the reception staff must be persuaded or bribed to tell the Travellers where she is staying. |

## Heresy

MARK: ‘Saint’ Nthander Porras WANTED FOR: Religious dissent BOUNTY: Cr700000 Alive / Cr350000 Dead 
PRIORITY: High (★★★) ISSUER: Church's Intelligence Wing KNOWN ASSOCIATES: Carsten Moin (disciple)

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 7 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Any overly religious world.
> 
> Saint Nthander is the prophet and leader of a wayward cult that the world church has deemed heretical. Their inability to eliminate him or prevent the spread of his teachings has caused whole regions to secede from centralised religious control and some places are already in open religious war. A member of the Church’s intelligence wing, wary of heretics and sympathisers, has instead outsourced the contract to bounty hunters. The Church would prefer Nthander alive so his heretical dogma can be subjected to public scrutiny and ridicule but if dead is the only way, then dead will suffice.
> 
> The intelligence wing is aware of a convoy of pilgrims bound for the heretics’ territory, where a prominent disciple of Nthander called Carsten Moin is believed to have anointed himself de facto governor. Rather than simply block the convoy, the intelligence wing has instead smuggled the Travellers in amongst the pilgrims. This means that they will have to go without most of their weapons and equipment. They are there in place of real people scooped up by intelligence agents beforehand and so will need to be on top of their assumed identities and convincingly knowledgeable about the doctrinal arguments being waged across their planet. The slightest slip will expose them as Church spies and make it impossible to complete their mission. Their initial goal is to ingratiate themselves to Carsten in any way they can and then use him to get to Nthander.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Gaining Trust |At the convoy’s destination, they are greeted by Carsten and his acolytes.
>| | Carsten wants a job or jobs completed before trusting the Travellers fully; a test of commitment to the faith rather than a sadistic attempt to trip them up and so should be tailored to their skills. |
>| | He may ask them to examine the blueprints of an experimental sensor design stolen from a Church facility, conduct a geological survey, plan the layout of a new village or ambush a military convoy. If they do well, then Carsten will finally agree to take them with him to see Nthander. |
>|Researching Faith | The Travellers will have heard rumours of Nthander’s preaching and read his pamphlets, hoping to find some clue as to his whereabouts. |
>| | The Travellers learn from Carsten that Nthander never stays in one place for long and does not plan his journeys, going where his faith calls him. |
>| | The Travellers will learn there is a holy town, the birthplace of their cult, that he always returns to induct new converts to the faith. This is where Carsten takes the Travellers. |
>|Induction | The induction ceremony involves being led up from the town in small groups to an area of volcanic springs. |
>| | Converts must undergo physical and spiritual hardships before being ceremonially stripped and going one-by-one to speak with Nthander. |
>| | This is the perfect opportunity to get to Nthander alone. It will be extraordinarily difficult to carry a concealed weapon under these circumstances, giving Travellers with natural weapons such as claws or other innate advantages a significant edge. |
>| | Any signs of a struggle will elicit a violent response from the faithful. |
>| | The Travellers may need to shoot their way through a countryside swarming with religious fanatics to make it back to Church territory. |
>|The Handler | As this assignment took place off the official Church books, the Travellers have to take steps to ensure they deliver Nthander directly to their intelligence wing handler. |
>| | If the Travellers are picked up by regular Church forces with Nthander they are more than likely to end up sharing in the unpleasant fate this world reserves for heretics. |
>
>Assuming they make it safely back to the intelligence wing, with Nthander either in their custody or dead, then they will have earned their promised bounty and the eternal gratitude of the Church.
>
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
> |1-3| Everything is as presented. |
> |4| The mainstream church is backward and holds some reprehensible beliefs, with Nthander’s sect being more progressive. |
> |5| As in 4, but the representatives of the Church are rude to any non-human Traveller, often refusing to speak to them or look them in the eye. |
 >|6| Nthander’s forces are all armed to the teeth and predisposed to violence.|

> 
> REPUTATION: 8 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: The bedroom in Tobias Szakwinder’s campaign headquarters.
> 
> Tobias Szakwinder is the leader of an extremist populist party predicted to do well in the forthcoming elections. His home is a fortress, staffed night and day by campaign teams working across time zones, and yet someone, somehow, managed to break into Szakwinder’s bedroom while he was sleeping and leave a note on his pillow telling him exactly when, where and how, the writer was going to kill him - in one week’s time, at the holovised presidential debate and by stabbing. Szakwinder’s team have tightened their own security but kept this from the authorities for fear they will call off the critical final debate with their man still needing one last push to carry this election over the line. Szakwinder has instead called in bounty hunters and he wants the best, not only to keep him alive through the debate but to find out who the would-be assassin is before they have the chance to carry out their threat.
> 
> They have exactly one week in which to do it.
> 
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |
>|--|--|
>|Locked Room| Szakwinder’s security team have performed their own thorough sweep of Szakwinder’s room without finding any evidence and clearly resent having bounty hunters brought in to check their work.
>| | The doors and windows were all locked and never opened. |
>| | Motions sensors cued to Szakwinder’s exact biosignature never triggered. |
>| | There is a busy office right outside, none of whom saw anything, and guards stationed at every door in pairs who will tell the Travellers the same thing. |
>| | An analysis of the note yields no prints or DNA other than Szakwinder’s and it appears to have been written using a pen that belonged to him and that was on his bedside table when he went to bed that night. |
>| | The handwriting style, however, is completely different to Szakwinder’s. |
>|Motive| With no clear insight into the means by which Szakwinder’s assailant got into his room, the Travellers must instead look into motive. |
>| | Szakwinder’s hardline policies have offended everyone from certain alien species and megacorporations, to psions and intellectuals. |
>| | He has received thousands of death threats over the course of the election campaign, all of which the Travellers will have to wade through. |
>| | They will come across a strikingly similar case in which a prominent citizen received a note detailing the time and means of his death, which was duly carried out at the allotted time. |
>| | Despite the bizarre circumstances, it did not receive widespread media coverage and was deemed to be a suicide as he was alone when he died and the only hand that had touched the knife was his own. |
>|The Other Victim | The Travellers will learn that the earlier victim was a vocal critic of a new psionics campus and had campaigned vociferously for restricting the rights of psionically-gifted individuals. |
>| | Enquiring with the family or the original investigating officers will get the Travellers a look at the ‘suicide note’ in the older case, which turns out to be a decisive piece of evidence. |
>| | The handwriting on the note is clearly different from the victims but it is an exact match to that left on Szakwinder’s pillow.|
>| The Assassin|The assassin is a powerful psion, one who uses telepathic abilities to make their victims kill themselves on command. |
>| | There are experts on hand who will inform the Travellers that such telepathic suggestion is short-ranged; the assassin will have to be physically present at the live debate in order to influence Szakwinder. |
>| | Szakwinder uses his influence to get the Travellers into the debate audience but it is up to them to find a particularly potent psion. |
>| | They need to do so without alerting the psion or acting so suspiciously that event security ejects them, all before the psion is able to plant a suicidal suggestion into Szakwinder’s mind. |
>
>If they succeed in saving Szakwinder’s life then he will gladly pay the bounty in full. Either way, anti-psion sentiment arising from the scandal is enough to sweep Szakwinder’s party to power.
>
>|1D |Complications|
>|:-:|--|
>|1-4| Everything is as presented. |

> [!info]- Referee's Information
> 
> REPUTATION: 9 
> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Capital, Core
> 
> The Imperial Duke, Celsus Konrad, was kidnapped by pirates whilst travelling back from the Imperial Moot on Capital aboard his yacht. The family have already gathered the MCr20 demanded by the pirates as ransom and just need someone to deliver it.
> 
> On the face of it, this is a straightforward operation, amounting to moving a large stack of Credits from Point A to Point B, but there are a lot of moving parts and an awful lot that can go catastrophically wrong.
> 
> The Travellers have been instructed to go alone and unarmed. There are any number of ways to conceal a weapon, of course, but any perceived intention of foul play or any attempt to involve Imperial authorities will at the very least lead to a shoot-out with the pirates and, most likely, the summary execution of Duke Celsus. In the ensuing diplomatic incident, the trashing of the Travellers’ reputations will look relatively inconsequential.
>
>|Location/ Individual(s)| Information |

>| | The pirates transport the Travellers to an asteroid belt in an underpopulated system. |
>| | The pirates are waiting at anchor aboard a small but heavily-armed warship. |
>| | The Travellers are instructed to take a shuttle across where they will be met in the airlock to hand over the Credits in exchange for Duke Celsus. |
>| | They will be left with the shuttle while the two pirate ships leave the system with their Credits. |
>| | This is the moment of maximum tension, which should be reflected in the frequency and difficulty of the checks that both Travellers and pirates, and Duke Celsus himself, are called to make. |
>|If it Goes to Plan| The Travellers hand over the MCr20 and board the shuttle with the Duke.|
>| | The two pirate warships depart with their ill-gotten gains and the Travellers can look forwards to several weeks on a belter colony trying to arrange passage back to the highport where they left their own ship.|
>| If it Does Not| The Travellers are forced into a firefight with a well-armed pirate crew using whatever weaponry they have been able to smuggle aboard. |
>| | If the Travellers survive the opening exchanges, the group must fight their way to the shuttle with the Duke and try to lose vengeful pirates in the belt. |
>The Konrad family will pay the Travellers on the safe return of Duke Celsus to his fief. Should they fail to recover him alive, then the family will, at the very least, expect the return of the ransom. The Travellers will not be paid for this but can expect to find a hefty bounty placed on their own heads should they fail to do so.

> [!info]- Referee's Information

> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Junidy, Spinward Marches
> 
> The Female With the Nacreous Ring is a renowned portrait by an unknown Vargr master, most famous for being seized by the Dzarrgh Federate in one of its many on-again, off-again wars with the United Followers of Augurgh. Several charismatic warlords on the Augurgh side of the feud have risen to power on the promise of liberating the cultural treasure from vile Dzarrgh paws.
> 
> It was a serious coup for the Junidy Imperial Art Gallery to get permission to include the famous painting in their upcoming exhibition of the Vargr masters, one that would undoubtedly court controversy and attract many millions of visitors to the exhibit. However, with only days to go before the grand opening, and just before the portrait was due to be verified, The Female With the Nacreous Ring was found to be missing from the secure vault where it was being stored. The gallery could not involve the Junidy authorities, or the Dzarrgh Federate without endangering their own reputation and triggering a major diplomatic incident, and so approached local bounty hunting guilds for individuals capable of resolving the matter quietly. They will pay handsomely, and with no questions asked but cannot stress enough that wherever the bounty hunters’ enquiry takes them, no one can know that the painting has gone missing.
> 
> The Travellers will have earned this contract partly for their investigative skills and discretion but also for knowledge of fine art and their ability to navigate high society. The gallery has a number of suspects, most of whom are important individuals who do not take well to answering other people’s questions. The United Followers of Augurgh sent a delegation to the exhibition, presumably with the sole interest of making trouble. There are Imperial Navy brass in attendance who would love nothing more than to stoke conflict between two Vargr polities; and then there is Junidy’s governor, a shrewd if unpopular dictator who had never approved of the gallery hosting a celebration of Vargr culture in the first place.

>| | An analysis will reveal it to in fact be ash, comprising elements typically found in common Vargr pigments and canvas.|
>| The Delegation | The Dzarrgh seem to know that the painting is missing, despite the gallery’s efforts to keep the theft a secret. |
>| | Asking around the lower ranks of the delegation, exploiting their Diplomacy, Art and Carouse skills, using their knowledge of Vargr customs, and the clues gleaned thus far, the Travellers will be able to ascertain that The Female With the Nacreous Ring that the Dzarrgh Federate delivered to the gallery was, in fact, a forgery. |
>| | The original was destroyed centuries ago but the Dzarrgh Federate could not admit to it without loss of face. |

> Orho is the elusive head of the terrorist network known as Purge. Although long-stripped of his title and evicted from his fief by the navy, he is still commonly referred to, by foes as well as followers, as ‘Baron’ Orho. A polymath and genius, Orho was the mastermind behind several deadly attacks on worlds across the subsector, generally involving the use of biological or robotic weapons to cause maximum civilian casualties without endangering himself or his followers. Central to Purge thinking is the belief that Humaniti has been allowed to spread too fast and must be cut back to allow native species to thrive.
> 
> The authorities have been hunting Orho for years without success - until now.
> 
> Law Enforcement have received information from a well-placed intelligence source that Orho is in a heavily-guarded compound on a remote world. According to this source, Orho and his entire inner circle are there planning Purge’s next attack, a virological weapon they plan to drop onto a heavily populated subsector capital. The navy has assembled a crack team of marines to conduct a daring drop on the compound and eliminate Orho, but they are short on resources and time. They need experienced help. The marines will take care of the fighting but they need cool-headed bounty hunters to ensure that Orho does not escape, the weapon is secured and that any vital evidence pertaining to his current plans is found and not destroyed in the fighting.
> 
> This is an unusual warrant in the sense that the Travellers know exactly where their mark is going to be at the outset and, as such, is heavier on fighting and lighter on the investigative work that might ordinarily precede it. That is not to say that gunplay is all the Travellers can expect. Searching for Orho and securing vital evidence while under fire will be no easy task. There is also the small matter of a deadly virological weapon hidden somewhere in the compound; if Orho or one of his lieutenants realises that the game is up they will almost certainly attempt
> 
> The Travellers travel to Orho’s base with the navy, spending the weeks-long voyage studying intelligence reports and rehearsing the attack alongside the marines in scale mock-ups of sections of Orho’s compound. The marines are ill-disposed towards the Travellers from the outset. They do not like or trust mercenaries and it does not help that the Travellers are being paid an awful lot more than they are. They will push and test the Travellers at every opportunity. It is up to the Travellers to win their partners around and it will make things more difficult for everyone later if they do not at least try.

>| | When that proves impossible, he decides to trigger his virus bomb. If allowed to go off it will kill everyone in the compound instantly and wipe out the rest of the planet over a matter of days. |

> SUGGESTED LOCATION: Red Zone system
> 
> The commercial freighter Silver Lining was caught on the sensors of an Imperial Navy picket ship as it jumped from a system under strict Red Zone interdiction. A military investigation risks reputational damage as well as stiff legal and financial consequences. The corporation that owns the freighter has pulled strings to buy itself a few weeks’ grace in which to discretely resolve the affair itself.

The Travellers are free to speculate but the impressive showing of Imperial might should dissuade them from indulging their curiosity.

>| | She speculates that the freighter crew could have jumped into the system in error after taking damage from an attack, then set down to conduct emergency repairs before limping off in search of a starport. |
>| | The Silver Lining’s jump-4 drive puts several systems within its reach but ruling out those with low-class starports or without suitable repair facilities allows the Travellers to narrow the search to just one. |
>| The System| If the Travellers contact the starport authorities to enquire after the Silver Lining, they have no record of her.|

# Refereeing Bounty Hunting Campaigns

Whilst bounty hunting campaigns feature a cycle of securing contracts, chasing quarry and collecting bounties, they also brush against morally grey conundrums, enduring adversaries and captivating storylines. A well-crafted bounty hunter campaign will be a thrilling, dynamic and memorable experience for Travellers and Referee alike.

Imagine the bounty hunters faced with a decision between capturing a valuable target or saving innocent lives. This ‘trolley problem’ type dilemma will force the Travellers to think about what type of people they want to be and impact the campaign’s trajectory and the relationships they have formed with characters and factions alike. To compound the complexity, consider introducing enduring foes aiming to obstruct the Travellers at every opportunity; competing bounty hunters, criminal masterminds or corrupt officials. Overcoming these obstacles requires strategy and adaptation on the part of the Travellers.

As the campaign evolves, Travellers may unveil broader storylines linking individual bounties. These overarching plots could lead them to confront formidable criminal syndicates, expose political subterfuge or avert galactic disasters. The Referee, by intertwining these elements, can craft a rich interconnected narrative that keeps the Travellers invested and anticipating the next twist.

Happy hunting!

## The Moral Quandary

One of the key challenges for Travellers lies in questioning the moral righteousness of their actions. This question is complex because moral perspectives differ; some might believe that if a contract has been issued, it must be justified. Others may examine a situation and realise that while the contract may be legally valid, the underlying justification is flawed. It is possible that the contract issuer is part of the legal system but has succumbed to bribes and the allure of power. Alternatively, the contract issuer may be performing their duties diligently, issuing contracts based on existing evidence, but the evidence leads to an incorrect conclusion. What happens if, during the investigation, the Travellers realise that the contract itself should never have been issued? Do they still pursue the mark? Do they turn them in and collect the bounty, or do they find a way to take a moral stand?

Another possibility arises when the mark is truly guilty of the accused crime but their actions may have been justified. Consider, a mark is accused of killing three people in a bustling club. Security cameras capture footage of the mark pulling a gun out from their jacket and shooting three strangers, seemingly leaving no doubt of their guilt. However, upon closer investigation, it becomes evident that the victims were privileged individuals who had come to this part of the city solely for their own amusement. Their intention was to find targets they considered inferior and torment them, resulting in them attacking the mark. In this situation, does the hunter bring in the mark, knowing full well that the justice system is likely to hold them fully accountable and incarcerate them, or do they let them go? Alternatively, they could conspire to fake the mark’s death, allowing them to safely escape offworld and start a new life.

This case involves the mark causing death but circumstances are far from straightforward. They generate enough sympathy for the mark that the Travellers might seriously question whether it is right to bring them in. Some may believe that their job is simply to capture the criminal and deliver them for trial, assuming that if the mark truly was a victim, the evidence will set them free. This idealistic approach assumes the justice system is fair and treats everyone equally. On the other hand, a more cynical Traveller may have enough experience to know that this person will not receive a fair trial. The prosecuting attorney is interested only in securing a conviction, intentionally suppressing evidence that contradicts the notion that this person is anything other than a cold-blooded murderer. In that case, the Travellers will know that if the mark is handed over, a much higher price for their crimes will be paid than they deserve.

Moving beyond simple crimes, the Referee can present the Travellers with other moral questions. For instance, a contract may be issued by a corporation against a teenage boy. The contract alleges that the boy was caught vandalising corporate property via surveillance footage. However, as the Travellers delve deeper into the case, they realise that things are not as they seem. The site of the vandalism has been thoroughly cleaned, leaving no crime scene to investigate. Upon analysing the surveillance footage, it is revealed that it was skilfully manipulated, meticulously crafted to appear authentic. At this point, the Travellers may continue investigating due to the consequences of breaking a contract, or they may be curious to uncover why the corporation is targeting this individual. When they finally apprehend the mark, they are confronted with a story of how he was raised in a laboratory and owned by the corporation for research purposes, effectively rendering them both slave and test subject. Perhaps they were born with rare genetic markers that could manifest into unusual psionic talents, or maybe they were deliberately engineered with that outcome in mind. If the Travellers bring the boy back to the corporation, he will not stand trial and due process will be non-existent. Instead, he will return to a life of corporate ownership, unless he manages to escape again. Do the Travellers deliver the boy to a life they know is morally wrong by most standards, or do they dare break the contract and help the boy escape his fate? If they bring the boy in, the Travellers become just as complicit in denying his personal freedom as the corporation. Can they live with that, or will they prioritise doing what is morally right even if it means sacrificing their reputation and the guild they work for?

Assuming the Travellers decide to do what is morally right, what are the consequences of that decision? Perhaps the bounty hunting guild they belong to has a strict policy against becoming involved in a mark’s specific situation. The guild may issue a contract for the Travellers themselves, intending to bring them in to face the consequences of breaking the contract. To make matters worse, the corporation will not simply accept the fact that the mark now has the Travellers’ assistance to evade capture, and may increase the size of the bounty and dispatch other bounty hunters to track them down. Additionally, this may result in the Travellers losing REP, making the jobs they take from this point onwards less valuable. Now, the Travellers are wanted by both the guild and the corporation with former colleagues hot on their trail, all because they did what was objectively the right thing.

There are numerous ways to create a moral quandary and it is one of the simplest storylines to present to your Travellers, trapping them in a seemingly unwinnable scenario. The question becomes whether the Travellers will choose to do what is right. If they do not, where does the story go from there? Even if the Travellers hand over the mark, the corporation may subsequently decide that the boy now knows too much and must be eliminated regardless. If the Travellers survive an assassination attempt clearly orchestrated by the corporation, will they change their mind about assisting the mark, or will they do whatever it takes to remove the target from their own backs?

## Truly a Villain

Sometimes, professionals in any field find themselves entangled in situations they should not have stepped into. For bounty hunters, accepting a contract comes with the expectation that they will serve it diligently, not returning to the issuer until they have either succeeded or another hunter has apprehended the mark. However, there are times when the mark proves to be more formidable than anticipated. They are not simply on the run but a true villain capable of making the Travellers’ lives challenging in numerous ways over an extended period.

Villains may be highly skilled individuals who know they are being pursued and take extensive measures to protect themselves, hiring thugs, negotiating special protections and creating obstacles that make capturing them exceptionally difficult. Alternatively, they could be violent, amoral individuals who value no lives other than their own, using their disdain for ordinary people to catch bystanders off-guard and force them into aiding malevolent plans. Another type of villain is the mastermind, who may have been caught engaging in illicit activities but still harbours grand schemes. They might seek to overthrow a government, incite a war, commit mass murder or perpetrate other heinous acts. In the midst of this, the Travellers become unlikely heroes, possessing either crucial information or the necessary skills to foil the villain’s plans. By the end of the story, capturing the villain to collect the bounty might be the least rewarding aspect of their involvement.

It is important to remember that not every mark is a villain and not every villain is a mark. The true villain may not be the one the Travellers are pursuing but someone else entirely. It could be the person who issued the contract, a third party who actually committed the crime, or a powerful individual using the contract to eliminate a personal inconvenience.

Defeating a villain entails more than just tracking them down. It involves investigating their activities, uncovering nefarious schemes, overcoming obstacles they place in the Travellers’ path and ultimately confronting them, ideally leading to a dramatic reversal where their plot is thwarted.

For example, imagine a contract being issued for a convicted murderer who has escaped from prison. Initially, this individual killed to cover up other crimes, which involved blackmail, theft and an attempted hostile takeover of a corporation. Even outside of prison, they possess significant wealth, loyal allies and resources that not only aid their escape but reignite previous schemes, endangering the lives of past victims and those who put them away. This individual poses a threat to society because they believe they have the right to take whatever they want and kill anyone in their way.

When the Travellers enter the story, their job extends beyond finding and capturing the villain. They must strive to prevent further harm. Sometimes this may not be possible and the Travellers must navigate a trail of bodies and shattered dreams until the final confrontation. In either case, the Travellers face not only external threats but also their own flaws and inadequacies. The opposition they encounter is likely more complex than mere hired thugs. Perhaps the villain’s hideout is an expansive lair; they are aware of the Travellers’ approach and have the opportunity to kill them from a distance, but prefer to lure the Travellers into meticulously prepared traps, making their survival highly unlikely. Capturing the Travellers may not even be particularly difficult; the villain can confine them in a locked room, subject them to knockout gas, or incapacitate them in other ways. Yet, the villain’s ego demands they taunt the Travellers, explaining the righteousness of their actions and emphasising the hopelessness of the situation.

Ultimately, a bounty hunter campaign centred around a central villain presupposes over-the-top action. The villain possesses a dastardly master plan that threatens almost everyone except themselves. They have a distinctive personality that goes beyond being a mere caricature of evil, and their plan carries a significant chance of success. Once the contract is resolved, returning the villain to the prison from which they escaped becomes a terrible idea, as they are likely to break free again and resume their malevolent pursuits.

## Space Western

The space western genre shares many elements with campaigns centred around a villain, with the notable distinction that bounty hunters operate in a frontier territory of space. Local law enforcement may exist but could be weak, corrupt or ineffective. The resolution of conflicts in such territories is often determined by cleverness, survival skills and the ability to rally local support rather than legal or moral authority. It relies on the same tropes as traditional westerns, with the only difference being the setting; by substituting spaceships for horses, aliens for cowboys and laser guns for six- shooters, the stories essentially remain the same.

- The **lone wanderer** trope, where a cowboy- like character wanders into a town and gets entangled in conflicts, is one of the iconic western themes. While the lone stranger dynamic can be challenging in a group-based game like Traveller it can still be achieved by setting the game in one location and focusing on one specific problem, with the lone stranger being just one of the Travellers. Alternatively, the lone wanderer trope could be embodied by the group of Travellers, with some event in their previous life bringing them together and causing them to settle in the frontier and use their skills for the better.
- **Revenge** is another powerful trope in westerns, where someone seeks justice against those who have wronged them. In a space western, revenge can be a driving force for either the Travellers or other characters they encounter. It adds depth and motivation to the story, creating compelling conflicts and character development.
- The **trusty steed** trope in westerns usually involves a loyal horse that accompanies the protagonist on their adventures. In a space western, the trusty steed can take the form of an alien creature, starship, grav bike or any vehicle that holds personal significance for the Travellers that becomes their mobile base of operations and an integral part of their identity.
- The **frontier sheriff** trope represents the establishment of law and order in remote areas. While the sheriff and the bounty hunter are both prominent figures in westerns, they are rarely the same person. The sheriff can be one of the Travellers in the campaign or a significant character who either aids or opposes the Travellers’ pursuits. The sheriff’s role can provide additional complexity and conflict to the story.

A good Referee should carefully select the tropes they want to incorporate into their space western game, as they significantly influence flavour and atmosphere but aside from these, the choice of storyline further shapes the flavour of the space western. The wide range that can be adapted to western settings makes it a versatile genre. Heist stories, where the Travellers aim to steal something valuable or thwart criminals attempting the same, work particularly well in a space western. Other common storylines involve attempts to force someone to give up their property, protection rackets, or outlaw gangs causing trouble in a remote region.

To incorporate the Travellers into these storylines, they can be hired by the wrong side, thus setting up a moral quandary. The mark might be the true owner or a person important to the victim, their freedom serving as a bargaining chip in the struggle for valuable items. Alternatively, the Travellers may be hired to apprehend the person attempting to extort valuables from the victim, making thwarting their plan part of the contract’s service. The Travellers might also become inadvertently entangled in a local drama that has no direct connection to their contract but requires their involvement.

Incorporating the space western genre into a bounty hunting Traveller campaign offers an exciting and fertile ground for storytelling. The vast array of possible storylines, coupled with the motivation provided by classic western themes, creates a dynamic and engaging experience. By drawing inspiration from favourite westerns and adapting their storylines to a science fiction setting, the Referee can create an immersive and thrilling space western campaign.

## The Seedy Underworld

The seedy underworld is an intricate theatre that bounty hunters must navigate in their line of work. It is not enough to simply understand it; bounty hunters often need to become part of the underworld to gain the information they require. This requires understanding that the underworld functions like an industry, with leaders, followers, rules and respect to be bestowed upon certain individuals.

Various industries can be fully infiltrated by organised crime, such as the entertainment industry. Mobsters may fund projects, exert influence on talent recruitment and supply illegal goods and services to those involved. Similarly, seemingly unrelated industries like public sanitation can serve as fronts for money laundering, while also providing criminals with disposal capabilities and access to critical information about people’s habits and movements.

Many individuals in the underworld hold legitimate jobs, which can be anything from janitors and teachers to high-ranking government officials. These jobs serve as fronts for illicit activities or provide specific skills and access that are valuable to crime lords. This diversity highlights that criminals can operate within any sector and even law enforcement officials can be corrupted.

Members of the underworld do not offer protection to others solely based on membership in the community. Information is exchanged for various reasons, such as rivalry, future favours or financial compensation. Travellers need to establish trust and connections within the underworld to gain this valuable information.

Entering the underworld for the first time as an outsider is risky, as those involved know that letting the wrong person in can jeopardise freedom or lives. However, recruitment is a constant process due to operatives frequently being sent to prison. Starting at a low level and proving loyalty through favours and illegal acts can lead to climbing the ladder and taking on more important roles. Travellers who gain importance within the underworld may find themselves inundated with wealth and offered positions, leading them to shift away from bounty hunting.

Travellers on the fringe of the underworld will be viewed with some degree of distrust due to their bounty hunting profession. However, it is understood that they are not part of law enforcement and only pursue individuals already in trouble with the law or powerful organisations. Meanwhile, law enforcement officials often know bounty hunters, either personally or by reputation, and may turn a blind eye to minor criminal activities they are involved in.

Loyalty is crucial in the underworld, as criminal organisations rely on trust and allegiance to maintain their operations. For Travellers, staying loyal (or at least respectful) to key individuals ensures their place and ability to continue working. However, they must be cautious not to cross certain lines, as mob bosses may forbid them from pursuing individuals with extensive knowledge about their organisation, unless the aim is to eliminate them permanently.

Establishing clear boundaries and open conversations with superiors are essential for Travellers to understand whom they can and cannot pursue in the underworld. By navigating complexities of loyalty, trust and alliances, they can continue their work within the underbelly of society.

## Recurring Characters

Recurring characters play a vital role in keeping a campaign engaging and dynamic, ranging from innocent individuals needing protection to contract issuers, patrons, law enforcement members, underworld figures and more. Determining whether a character should make a single appearance or become a regular in the campaign depends on their potential to provide valuable information and services or become the central focus of the story.

In some cases, seemingly minor characters can become essential to the campaign’s storyline. For example, the Travellers may initially encounter the adult daughter of a lawyer who is being hunted by both a crime organisation and her father’s former bosses. While the initial focus may be on protecting her, she can later become a recurring character who holds valuable information, connects the Travellers to key individuals, or finds herself in trouble that requires the Travellers’ assistance. This unexpected development can shape the trajectory of the campaign.

Another type of recurring character is the sidekick. Although Travellers are usually each other’s sidekicks, additional talents may be required for specific missions. Hiring a hacker, heavy weapons expert or other specialist can provide comic relief and temporary assistance. After completing a mission, these sidekicks can return in later adventures, either due to their skills being needed again or finding themselves mired in their own troubles.

Recurring characters with unique personalities, outlooks on life, or distinctive traits can add colour and depth to the campaign, serving as informants, specialists, or simply providing a unique perspective on events. While their appearances should remain light, they can contribute to the richness of the universe.

Characters with a destiny can introduce intriguing storylines. These individuals may possess strong political convictions, religious beliefs or talents that attract attention and enemies. Their role in the campaign leads them on a specific path, which often culminates in their death. This can motivate the Travellers, who must decide how to handle the loss, whether by seeking revenge or carrying on the deceased’s cause.

The most obvious recurring character is the villain, who can assume various roles within the campaign. They may initially appear as an ally, providing contracts or information to the Travellers, only to be revealed as a corrupt member of law enforcement or criminal manipulating the Travellers for their own gain. Villains can also be individuals with clear goals, working relentlessly against the Travellers, leading to multiple confrontations and challenges throughout the campaign. Their appearances should be memorable and information about their motives and past actions should be revealed gradually, keeping their presence intriguing.

It is important to strike a balance with recurring characters, making their appearances significant and memorable while avoiding overuse. Their involvement should drive the story forward, add depth to the world and create interesting dynamics for the Travellers.

## Interactions Between Bounty Hunters

The relationships between bounty hunters can indeed be complex, ranging from friendly alliances to bitter rivalries. Inherent distrust among them often prevails, even when they work together. One bounty hunter can gain an advantage over another by simply following them and seizing an apprehended mark by force. However, there are circumstances in which bounty hunters agree to collaborate.

The need for assistance and increased chances of success is a common reason for bounty hunters to work together. If a contract is particularly valuable, multiple parties may be interested in collecting it and, in such cases, bounty hunters may interfere with each other’s efforts, resulting in direct confrontations, destruction of transportation or theft of resources. Working with partners helps mitigate the risk of interference and evens the odds. One bounty hunter can pursue leads while the other safeguards transportation, or they can collectively handle a mark’s numerous allies. Working together ensures greater efficiency and minimises the mark’s opportunity to escape. Additionally, collaboration gives them an advantage over other bounty hunters competing for the same contract.

Bounty hunters belonging to the same guild may choose to ‘play nice’ and work together when assigned the same contract. By splitting the bounty evenly, they adhere to their guild’s rules and maintain their standing within it. However, even in these cases, one hunter might try to escape the partnership or betray the guild’s trust once the job is completed.

The need to investigate multiple leads simultaneously can also prompt bounty hunters to team up. This approach helps them avoid wasting time on dead-end leads and keeps them a step ahead of others who are working alone. Working together allows them to share findings and progress more efficiently.

Ambushing a competitor is a frequent occurrence in the field. Setting up an ambush gives one bounty hunter the opportunity to engage in combat or negotiate a lopsided partnership, coercing another to work with them but under unfavourable conditions. These partnerships often dissolve after completing the job, especially if there is an unequal power dynamic and the lesser partner seeks to even the odds or break away entirely.

The resulting chaos in the field, with bounty hunters fighting on multiple fronts against both the mark and rivals, can make completing the contract more challenging. Partnerships that fall apart can escalate into rivalries; bounty hunters who feel swindled out of their fair share may seek revenge. Retaliation can take various forms, such as physical harm, disabling transportation, disarming, damaging reputations or attempting to revoke a rival’s guild membership. The goal is often to hinder their rival’s ability to conduct business or damage their standing among employers and targets.

In rare cases, long-term partnerships can form, resulting in significant outcomes. These partnerships can disrupt the power dynamics within a guild, allowing bounty hunters to fend off political attacks and gain the confidence of lower-ranking members. With majority support, they might even overthrow the guild leader and take control, inheriting the associated wealth. Lasting partnerships can also lead to the establishment of new guilds or independence from the guild system altogether.

Partnering up on a long-term basis can accelerate reputation-building and enhance opportunities. Working together enables bounty hunters to accomplish more, which attracts the attention of contract issuers and increases their chances of securing higher-paying jobs. A proven track record as a successful partnership increases the likelihood of being hired for crucial captures.

Overall, relationships between bounty hunters can be volatile but when partnerships work, they yield significant advantages and opportunities for those involved.

# Equipment

Surprisingly, and contrary to many over-blown vidshows, there is not a great amount of custom equipment used by bounty hunters. When they wish to become better equipped, if they can afford it, bounty hunters simply purchase better quality gear. The equipment they use is usually similar to that the average Traveller might own.

That said, there is some equipment that is both unusual and of particular use to bounty hunters, although not necessarily exclusive to them.

## Bounty Bot
Guilds may keep these to hand, although they are not well maintained in less established or profitable entities. Although not particularly intelligent, these robots have facial recognition that can be programmed to recognise the face of any given mark, granting bounty hunters working with it an extra gun. Capable of simple tactical planning, bounty bots are meant as an aid to a bounty hunter and some independent crews might keep a couple in storage should the need arise.

## Disguise Detector
 Marks who wish to remain free often employ subterfuge, such as taking on unusual affectations including wigs, facial hair and facial prosthetics. Alternatively, others wear such affectations normally and then remove them when eluding capture.

The disguise detector can be paired with any optical device, such as a scope, camera or cybernetic eye. If this card-sized device has been programmed with existing pictures of the mark, it can aid in seeing through whatever disguise they are wearing via facial recognition software, as well as a weak field emitter that can penetrate masks, plastics and so on, but not metals. If the emitter is used and the mark is equipped with a scan detector, they will be alerted to the fact that they are being observed. However, it is not fool proof.

When opposing a Deception check with Recon, this device grants DM+2 if the target is using a disguise.

Item TL Kg Cost Disguise Detector 9 — Cr3500

## DNA Detector
 DNA detectors can determine whether a specific individual has passed through an area. At all times, almost every species is casting off DNA in the form of dead skin cells, sweat, hair, exhaled gases and other biological elements their particular body chemistry emits. This then spreads in the form of dust before breaking down completely. The DNA detector is a small device, easily portable, that constantly samples the surrounding atmosphere. When it detects specific DNA, it sends a signal to its owner, informing them it has found a positive match.

The DNA detector is most often used in busy locations with a lot of traffic, such as starports, markets and sporting arenas, although sometimes the hunter just wants to know if the mark has been present at a less busy location. DNA can usually be detected in non-recycled air for up to two weeks before it degrades, so a positive hit when the bounty hunter plants the device does not mean the mark is present currently, and it usually takes the device 3D hours to find, separate and analyse DNA samples from the atmosphere.

Inference Camera: This camera can be used to ‘fill in the gaps’ between what the camera takes and what else may be there, generating the most likely objects within 0.5 metres of the framed shot. This can never be completely accurate and bounty hunters must be cautious when using information gathered from this device. Additionally, the device has the capability to display the image as a three dimensional holographic projection.

Jump Analyser Software: This software can be used to detect potential jump destinations as a ship begins to jump. It is able to determine the direction of the jump and contains a collection of ship classes and their standard jump drive signatures in its database. To track other ships, the user must make a Difficult (10+) Astrogation check. The jump analyser software grants the user a DM equal to its software level. If the ship being tracked is actively trying to mask its jump, this becomes an opposed check with the target ship’s own astrogator. If a ship is non-standard, customised or has simply been tweaked through maintenance over decades, there can be a margin of error, resulting in a negative DM applied at the Referee’s discretion.

Neural Pulveriser: A neural pulveriser is a device that sits over the front half of a skull and bombards the brain with a variety of non-lethal particles, having a notable effect on humans, Aslan, Vargr and many other species. This has the effect of shutting down synapses related to higher functioning while leaving the deep functions that control basic life sustaining activities like heartbeat and breathing to operate normally. Once an individual has one of these fitted and active, it feels to them like a peaceful sleep. This state can be resisted with a successful Very Difficult (12+) END check. If the person wearing the neural pulveriser is injured while wearing it, the pain can penetrate this mental state and, with a new END check, cause them to regain enough awareness to remove the device themselves.

## Restraints
 These are all personal restraints used to detain a mark. Rope, zip ties and rigid handcuffs are all used to restrain the detainee at the wrists, while higher Tech Level restraints become substantially more difficult to escape. Full-limb restraints spread the detainee’s hands and legs, securing them in casings secured by electronic locks. These are usually found as mounts within a vehicle or building. At higher Tech Levels, restraints are subtler, such as the head casing which incorporates a neural pulveriser.

Detainees can escape some restraints with a successful STR or DEX check but more advanced models require someone not restrained to break them with either a Mechanic or Electronics (computers) check.

## Rocket Pack
 Purchased as much for style as practicality, the rocket pack is the stuff of retro vid- shows - quite literally, a rocket worn on the back to enable the user to leap large distances. In use, the rocket pack increases the user’s movement to 20 metres and enables clearance of any object up to 10 metres in height. Its use is not recommended in areas with a ceiling lower than this. The rocket pack contains enough fuel for three such jumps (it cannot be used for flight), with a refill costing Cr500 and it can be used with any armour except battle dress.

A DEX check is required to land safely, with failure indicating the user has crashed into something or landed very badly, suffering 2D damage that will not be reduced by armour.

High Gravity conditions reduce movement to 10 metres and height clearance to six metres. Low Gravity increases movement to 30 metres and height clearance to 15 metres. With careful use and short bursts from the rocket, use in Zero Gravity can allow an effective movement of 30 metres for a period of ten minutes.

A modified version of the rocket pack can be found with diligent effort, mounting a single shot rocket in a vertical mount (see the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 132, for the TL8 rocket launcher).

Single-Shot Pistol: Originally designed as a last-resort weapon, this miniature laser handgun was intended to fire just a single shot. The grip of the device contains the power pack and at lower Tech Levels parts of the weapon will usually melt from the heat of the shot. More advanced versions can fire two shots before melting. The weapon is small enough to easily be hidden, with most of the casing made of non-metallic materials in order to hide it from any scanners or metal detectors that may be present, inflicting DM-4 to any Electronics (sensors) or Recon checks made to locate it. They are designed to be used in close quarters, with a miniscule range compared even to a stunner.

The low-velocity bullets are designed to lodge inside bodies, clothing, vehicles and the like, functioning as a miniature projectile trackers. The range the data can be transmitted over is low at 250 metres but allows a bounty hunter to see the bullet’s final location on any electronic sensor system or datanet-connected computer.

Stun Grapple: This rifle-like device, intended to be used in close quarters, fires a small net which can be electrified when the user presses a second trigger located at the side of the grip. This pushes a strong electrical current through the net, sustained for six seconds. When hit by a net, the target must make a Melee (unarmed) check opposed by the attack roll. If failed, they are immobilised. The target can escape the net by making a successful Average (8+) DEX check (1D rounds).

### Bounty Hunter Identification

Normally limited to one system, these identification cards are mostly used by guilds that are well established. They provide a degree of authenticity to the hunter, and can soothe stressed relations with local security firms or law enforcement. However, outside of the system in which they were issued identification cards are functionally useless and may cause more trouble than they are worth.

# Vehicles

Whilst most bounty hunters will use regular vehicles, there are a number of specially designed or converted options available. Some may be loaned out by guilds, as the cost for purpose-designed bounty hunter vehicles can become prohibitive. Most Travellers will never see some of the custom bounty hunter vehicles but those ruthless enough in their ambition may be able to procure one someday, if they live long enough.

## Cryo-truck

Once a regular pickup truck, this has been retrofitted to place a cryoberth in the truck bed. A metal sheet can be pulled over the top and a gun port in the rear of the cabin allows bounty hunters to protect their cargo. Although not done with any great finesse, the cryo-truck does exactly what it says on the tin. Freeze the mark, keep them relatively safe and unfreeze them upon delivery.

## Exfil Ornithopter

This ornithopter was designed to exfiltrate bounty hunters and their marks quickly. What it lacks in comfort, it makes up for in firepower and capability. Although it does not provide an ejection seat for the marks, it is likely the bounty hunters would be able to recover enough of them to prove the contract was completed if necessary. The ease of transporting the ornithopter, due to its folding wings, makes it a hit amongst the more danger-driven bounty hunting groups.

## Stealth G/Bike

Simple in concept but effective in execution, the stealth G/bike has become a staple of bounty hunters across Charted Space. Small enough to weave through traffic, fast enough to evade any would-be pursuers, and cheap enough not to break the bank, what this bike lacks in equipment it makes up for in manoeuvrability. The camouflage and stealth systems help the rider become almost undetectable, especially on lower-tech worlds or those with outdated sensors.

## Submerisble Command Hub

This submersible vehicle can be deployed to any body of water and act as the command centre for a group of bounty hunters. With life support to keep them submerged for 400 days, a mini-galley, fresher and three bunk beds, a crew of six will find it a survivable, if not comfortable mobile base of operations. For contracts that require longer-term planning, this makes an ideal method of covertly surveilling a mark, so long as there is water nearby.

## Transport Bus

A lightly armoured but more than capable all-terrain vehicle, this ‘bus’ was designed to shuttle eight captives (four in cryoberths, the others shackled) to a ship or end destination. Not designed for longer travel than an overnight trip, thanks to the addition of the bunk, bounty hunters will still be required to source food and bathroom breaks. The systems are stable enough that planetside crew are able to communicate with offworld counterparts and the vehicle can be tracked and monitored from a ship if required.

Most bounty hunters simply convert pre-built ships to their own purposes. This can include stripping staterooms to be replaced with brigs, or adding exterior locks to the doors of each room to turn them into comfortable cells. Additionally, many will add breaching tubes or forced linkage apparatus to more easily board their marks’ ships.

# High Guard: Bounty Hunter

There are a few specially constructed designs but these are more commonly built and owned by guilds and leased to bounty hunters on a contractual basis. Often these will last over a period of service, perhaps one or two years, but more specialised variants may be deployed by contract instead. Longer serving bounty hunters within a guild may become eligible to purchase the ship over an extended period.

## Coyote Type: —

A converted Type J seeker mining ship, itself a variant of the ubiquitous scout/courier, the Coyote is designed to be operated by a single bounty hunter. One stateroom has been converted into a brig for the transportation of prisoners. The remaining stateroom has been turned into a double-occupancy space, allowing the Coyote to support a second bounty hunter. An Exfil ornithopter (page 91) replaces the original prospecting buggy, providing much needed mobility and firepower in the field.

Additional modifications include a clutch of probe drones, forced linkage apparatus for seizing ships, a concealed compartment for smuggling

small, high-value items (including people) through customs and the fitting of beam lasers into the originally empty turret. Enough cargo space remains to allow for further customisation to the tastes of the bounty hunting owner.

The most visually obvious exterior alteration is the stacking of an auxiliary reaction drive above the original manoeuvre drive. The Type J is not slow for a civilian ship of its tonnage but the short-term boost from a powerful secondary drive allows the Coyote to match the thrust of significantly faster vessels, allowing it to chase down fleeing ships before they can escape into jumpspace.

The Montreal will not win many awards for aesthetics but it carries everything a larger group of established bounty hunters need to confront an unknown and hostile galaxy. The bare bones of a functioning spacecraft - fuel tanks, power plant, engines - can all be found in the main body with everything else in boxy modules attached by sturdy crystaliron struts. One forward module houses a suite of facilities including a library, laboratory, workshop and fully-equipped medical bay, making the Montreal essentially self-sufficient and, provided they have enough skilled crewmembers, capable of responding to almost any mission. The command module, housing a briefing room, main bridge and well-stocked bar, provides space for five individual

staterooms, allowing several bounty hunters to travel together in comfort if not in style. There is also room devoted to barracks accommodation, for those occasions when the ship’s own crew is insufficient and a few extra hired guns are welcome.

The Montreal is well-armed with three turrets and while its tonnage grants a certain staying power, it is not well- armoured and projecting modules can be vulnerable to damage. The Montreal is perhaps better viewed as a mobile base, arriving at a system beyond the reach of civilian sensors before deploying its own extended arrays to build a thorough chart of the system and its dangers. Whatever they are, the Montreal almost certainly has the facilities to deal with them.

## Poignard Type: —

While the Montreal makes for a useful base of operations, it is cumbersome to pilot in atmosphere and too fragile to endanger in the sort of close- range engagements where boarding actions (a space-travelling bounty hunter’s bread and butter) take place. This is where the Poignard comes in. Designed to be an all-purpose assault boat, it is equally suited to shuttling a small team down to a


planet’s surface or forcing entry onto a fleeing ship. Although it retains the profile of a standard ship’s launch, the Poignard has been upgraded in almost every way. It has been up-armoured and given a serious boost in thrust, enabling it to outrun all but the fastest of ships. Its stealth coating and upgraded cockpit controls, meanwhile, help to ensure that it arrives at its destination in one piece.

This standard launch has been retrofitted to include a brig, briefing room and some cabin space. Despite the price increase, it is still feasible for smaller groups, although it is double the price of the standard model. The versatility of the interior space means

it can be customised as necessary and some groups have taken to replacing the briefing room with an additional brig. Whilst this launch is not suited to longer journeys, it is an effective method of transporting marks from planet-to-planet.

# Agencies

These agencies can be placed in any Traveller universe. In Charted Space, they will work well in areas such as the Spinward Marches as it is still a frontier area and (on occasion) war torn. The Trojan Reach would also work well. In both sectors, there are plenty of ways for someone to escape local justice and flee, which necessitates specialists to track them down in sometimes hostile territory.

## Horizon Bounties

Horizon is one of the more reputable bounty hunting agencies on Louzy, at the trailing edge of the Jewell subsector in the Marches. The Louzy Boom of the mid-600s, when the Imperium’s Fleet Asset Replacement Programme brought jobs and investment to this barely habitable world, is long gone. The ensuing slump has left a scattering of severely overcrowded cities, endemic poverty and petty crime, and a number of derelict mining concerns which planetary law enforcement lack the resources to police effectively, if at all. This made it a fertile ground for an organisation like Horizon.

However, Louzy is not exactly awash with Credits. Its own citizens, over-skilled and under-employed as they are, are well known for their willingness to do almost any paid work. The term ‘Louzy Work’ is used across the subsector to describe low-paid and physically demanding dog work that nobody else is prepared to do. As such, even well-run and outwardly professional outfits like Horizon find themselves in stiff competition with an army of freelancers prepared to do the same work for the equivalent of a warm meal. Horizon’s bounty hunters are more ruthless on average, familiar as they are with the cutthroat nature of the professional landscape on Louzy.

TYPE : Guild 
LEADERSHIP : Thanau Nuri - owner, chief operating officer, and any other senior roles as and when they need filling 
BASE : Goedz’ Diner, Nuri’s usual table, Louzy downport 
REGISTRATION FEE: Cr500 
REGISTRATION CHECK: Easy (4+) REP check 
HOLDBACK : 15%

The [[#Horizon Benefits table]] can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP) when joining the guild.

Horizon Bounties is the baby of one Thanau Nuri, a flamboyant former IISS operative (Communications Branch) who, benefitting from one of the many short-lived regeneration programmes attempted by the planetary government, decided to take his skills to Louzy and set up his own firm.

In order to keep overheads low, Horizon employs few permanent staff and keeps no offices. All business is done at a front window table of Goedz’ Diner in the downport, where Thanau Nuri (in one of his signature loud shirts) is something of a local fixture. This is also where prospective bounty hunters will come for an interview with Nuri himself, usually over an all-you- can-eat buffet served by the fawning Vargr proprietor. These interviews are informal affairs and Nuri has been known to ‘forget’ the usual registration fee or to haggle himself down to some nominal offering in lieu, such as a bottle of rare offworld liquor or the promise of a night out the next time they are both on Jewell. He is similarly lax in most aspects of his business and it is a wonder, in Louzy’s competitive market, that he remains in business at all. However, those who know the bounty hunters under the guild understand their fierce loyalty to the man who keeps them above-water. They are as brutal in defending each other and the guild as they are when catching marks.

There is a particularly widespread rumour that Horizon is, in fact, a front for an intelligence gathering operation from the Zhodani Consulate, and it is certainly true that a Traveller spending any time with Horizon will be presented with seemingly mundane delivery and collection excursions into Zhodani space. If Nuri is a spy, however, then he is surely not very good at it, for half of the downport believes him to be one. Unless, of course, that is simply what he wants them all to believe.

The usual contracts handed out to Horizon’s newest bounty hunters are low-paid and unglamorous but there are plenty of them. These can involve anything from apprehending truants from the courts, evicting armed stowaways from outbound merchant ships, or investigating the sorts of low-level crime that a better resourced security force could probably handle themselves. Build enough reputation, however (or catch Nuri in a particularly expansive mood), and a Traveller might find themselves with a lucrative contract from one of Horizon’s corporate third-parties.

The bigger corporations divested themselves from Louzy decades ago but there is still a great deal of proprietary equipment, advanced technology hardware and mothballed industrial facilities hidden away in far-flung areas of the planet. Louzy’s mineral wealth has not gone anywhere after all; it is simply waiting for another Frontier War to make it financially viable again. As such, the corporations are able to offer serious Credits for the services of a bounty hunter able to track stolen equipment through subsector black markets, pursue spies and saboteurs, or to simply sit on an abandoned site for a week or two and switch the lights on to satisfy some local bylaw about occupancy of a valuable claim.

These contracts are highly competitive and Horizon’s most notorious bounty hunters have been known to literally fight over them on occasion. Perform well, however, and the corporation might ask for the Traveller by name next time. They might even make enough Credits for the prize that half of Louzy is hustling to earn - a one way ticket anywhere else.

## Shadowsun

The Aramis subsector may have many legitimate claims to galactic fame but people in Charted Space know it as the principle route by which Vargr corsairs (and independent pirates operating on their coattails) enter the Spinward Marches and Deneb. The powerful 214 th Fleet were supposed to put a stop to this but with their bases at Paya, Natoko and L’Oeul d’Dieu, along the subsector’s rimward edge, the perception that the Imperium has all but given up on its less valuable coreward systems has refused to go away.

Shadowsun is one of a number of independent organisations who, in the absence of a firmer showing from the Imperial Navy, have stepped up to ensure that the region is not completely lawless.

TYPE : Guild LEADERSHIP : Hierarchical paramilitary BASE : Junidy REGISTRATION FEE: Cr3000 REGISTRATION CHECK: Difficult (10+) REP check with DM+1 for Travellers with military backgrounds and an additional DM+1 if their former career was with the Navy or Marines HOLDBACK : 25%

The Shadowsun Benefits table can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP) when joining the guild.

Shadowsun maintains a small base of operations on Junidy, one of the more prominent worlds on the border with the Vargr Extents, but few of its members actually reside there for more than a few weeks at a time. As well as being within jump-2 range of more tempting targets of opportunity in the region, Junidy’s IISS waystation and secure x-boat route both provide invaluable sources of intelligence. Shadowsun has no formal affiliations with the IISS but has plenty of sympathisers amongst local staff to receive tip-offs, off-the-books maintenance on its ships, and even old spacecraft that might otherwise have been bound for the scrapyard. Most of Shadowsun’s contracts are issued by free traders who have banded together to offer a bounty. Some even come from wealthy officers within the sector fleet admiralty who, although their own hands are tied by local politics, are neither unaware nor wholly ambivalent to the lawlessness activity in their backyard.

Most Shadowsun bounty hunters are ex-military personnel. Absent any visible Imperial Navy presence, many consider themselves the region’s de-facto navy, sporting matching uniforms and comporting themselves as genuine military in spite of scuffed combat armour and second-hand ships. Naval officers and those who have served as marines, are especially sought after as the bulk of Shadowsun’s operations will, at one stage or another, come down to ship-to-ship combat or a boarding action against a potentially hostile ship.

Although combat experience is considered a vital prerequisite to membership, it is far from the only skill a Shadowsun bounty hunter can expect to need. It is a rare pirate ship that will risk a straight up fight even with Shadowsun’s cobbled-together navy, and Vargr-backed corsairs in particular have become ever more creative

in their attempts to infiltrate Imperial space. Typical ruses range from plotting elaborate sequences of jumps to bypass Imperial patrols, fake transponders, hiding in plain sight amongst a genuine Vargr merchant fleet - anything to sneak through the patchy defences of the Aramis subsector and into the rest of the Imperium. Keeping one step ahead of such ruses involves keen investigative skills and high-level astrogation as much as out and out gunplay. As such, any Traveller bringing demonstrable skills to the table can find a place in Shadowsun but they should expect a frosty reception, at least at first, from their battle-hardened colleagues.

Organisationally, Shadowsun is run along traditional military lines, with a clearly defined chain of command and senior officers responsible for accepting and assigning all contracts. The current commanding officer is a retired Imperial Marine colonel named Ramon Guerra, a stern and charismatic Sylean whose every utterance is afforded the weight of commandments penned using Imperial Stationary. Advancement through the ranks can be achieved through merit, long-service and proven commitment to the cause but fostering good relationships with one’s superiors does not hurt either.

Shadowsun’s distinctive yellow and black uniform is well known in most starports in the region and for the most part thought well of by local populations who appreciate the work they do and the hardships they face. Waging a constant cat-and-mouse campaign with hand-me-down ships and a shoestring is not every soldier’s dream second career. Win the right contracts and the money can be good but for most, if not all, Shadowsun is a vocation, not a living. The endless rounds of free drinks from the traders in Junidy starport are all the reward they need.

## Outward March

Have you ever dreamed of dodging asteroids while pushing the drives on your ultralight fighter to the max in pursuit of a pirate lord? Of shooting up a dive bar full of low-life frontier hoodlums? Of leading a high-speed air/raft chase through the rush hour streets of bustling megalopolis? Of storming the fortified moon base of a rogue duke before making off the with the aesthetically appealing sophont in distress?

If so, then Outward March is the organisation for you; not merely a bounty hunting agency but a genuine bounty-hunting experience.

Go beyond the rest.

Go Outward...

TYPE : Corporate LEADERSHIP : Corporate franchise structure, with a network of semi-independent ship captains answering to the company head office BASE : Arden REGISTRATION FEE: Cr500000 REGISTRATION CHECK: Difficult (10+) SOC check HOLDBACK : 50%

The Outward March Benefits table can be rolled on (one roll for every two points of SOC beyond 8) when joining.

For as long as there has been space travel, there has been a galactic super-wealthy paying fortunes for a carefully curated taste of adventure and free license to  cull the megafauna on some backward planet. On those same worlds, as coincidence would have it, there is often no end to the rogues, renegades and assorted frontier ne’er-do-wells that some government or other will pay to be rid of.

Officially, Outward March is as it has always been; a luxury cruise operator providing thrill-seeking tours and wilderness safaris to the more adventurous end of the market, but its business model has undergone something of an evolution. As Outward’s promotional holovids proudly say, once you have hunted sentient quarry, there really is no going back. Nowadays, the company is better known (in the right social circles, at least) as the premier provider of bespoke paramilitary services and experiences to elite clientele. Soliciting contracts from a network of contacts across its operating region across the Spinward Marches and into the Trojan Reach, it then handily quadruples its take by charging wealthy holidaymakers extortionate sums for the thrill of executing them on its behalf.

It is a business model that, thus far, has proven highly lucrative.

The company’s head office is based on Arden, on the Imperial/Zhodani border, from which it operates a loose franchise of luxury safari ships. Although originally an Imperial-registered corporation, the neutral flag of the Federation of Arden has proven to have advantages when it comes to crossing borders and flouting whatever regional shipping laws it does not like.

For most first-time bounty hunters, however, the only point of contact with the greater corporate structure will be the team of bright-liveried stewards who welcome them aboard and the captain with whom they might occasionally dine.

Skill levels amongst Outward March’s ‘bounty hunters’ are, as one might expect, highly variable. Some may have voyaged on one of the bounty cruises many times before, or have real-universe experience to prepare them for this kind of work, while others may have never held a gun before in their life. Fortunately, the safari ships, as well as catering for every need their pampered clientele might require over the extended duration of their stay, also feature a fully equipped gymnasium or swimming pool, and state of the art training simulators. Included in the ship’s complement of staff are qualified instructors who are always on hand to train an eager but unskilled bounty hunter in everything from basic survival to hand-to-hand combat and spacecraft operations.

Each safari ship ordinarily caters to five or six passengers which it will then carry on a pre-plotted tour of a specific region, picking up pre-arranged bounties at their frequent stops. These excursions will be led by an experienced (and often famous) bounty hunter, poached from a more serious-minded agency for three times the salary and a cushier lifestyle. Their main job is stopping their trigger-happy charges from getting into more danger than they have paid for and keeping collateral damage to a minimum. It is also their responsibility to ensure that the contract actually gets filled once the mayhem starts. Few last more than a single tour, as there are only so many indignities that a professional can take but most clients adore their misanthropic squad leaders, finding their gruff manner and undisguised disdain for social betters all part of a hard-bitten charm.

Contracts issued through Outward March are, without exception, of the most high-paying and glamourous kind; disgraced nobles fleeing Imperial justice; kidnapped royalty; hologenic Vargr corsairs with bases in exotic locales - the sort of high-stakes escapade that the average noble might have seen in a trashy spy or action holovid. Outward March takes a 50% cut on all bounties to cover its own operating expenses, with the remaining share divided equally amongst the bounty hunters and their squad leader. This rarely comes close to covering the exorbitant up-front cost of the ticket but for the majority of Outward March bounty hunters this is quite beside the point. Most will probably never even cash the Credit chit, instead mounting it proudly on their walls as a trophy of their time on the frontier.

## Quorum

Establishing an independent bounty hunting organisation usually requires a unique blend of skills, the right contacts, and a hefty outlay of Credits. Sometimes, as was the case with Quorum, all it takes is the chance meeting of two heavily-armed women on a deep-sea submersible habitat.

Seo-Hyan and Zorbay came to [[Mora]] independently in pursuit of the same contract, a gunrunner suspected of supplying high-tech weaponry to Solomani Movement extremists on a dozen worlds. The contract was big enough to buy either one of them a healthy retirement and the spacecraft to get there, but rather than wasting ammunition on each other, as the prospect of a MCr10 bounty might have led other bounty hunters to do in their place, the two women instead chose to co-operate, halving their reward in exchange for doubling their chances.

Their adventures became something of a TAS legend and Seo-Hyan and Zorbay became firm friends. They remained close even after serving their contract and going their separate ways with their shares of the bounty, and later found their way back to Mora, this time together.

Reaching the age where most bounty hunters would consider retirement, the two women instead decided to pool their modest fortunes into founding Quorum, envisioning it as an egalitarian organisation where everyone can expect an equal share of the guild’s income and every member’s voice has an equal say in its decisions.

TYPE : Guild LEADERSHIP : Democratic, with an equal share of all profits BASE : Mora REGISTRATION FEE: Cr15000 REGISTRATION CHECK: Very Difficult (12+) REP check HOLDBACK : 100% (Quorum pools all earnings, paying out an even share monthly to all of its members)

The Quorum Benefits table can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP) when joining the guild.

Prospective recruits are generally approached by Quorum rather than the other way around. They might be bounty hunters with a well-established name or, just as likely, unusually skilled Travellers whose paths crossed with a Quorum bounty hunter.

By Quorum’s unwritten rules, the induction of a new member requires consensus from the entire guild. The limitations of interstellar communication being what they are, this seldom occurs in practice but every Quorum agent within the local system can be expected to weigh in with their say. Quorum is a small agency with members who are protective of its reputation and extremely selective about who they allow in. Applicants are expected to advocate for themselves and can expect a fierce grilling on everything from their resume, skills and moral rectitude. Even at this stage, admittance is far from a done deal.

Once finally admitted into the guild, the new bounty hunter is immediately accepted as an equal. Not even Seo-Hyan and Zorbay (still very much active, despite being well into their nineties) count themselves above anyone else.

[[Mora]] is densely populated and hyper-industrialised, with several billion citizens crammed into a handful of mega-cities on the planet’s few large landmasses. Seo-Hyan and Zorbay purportedly founded their agency there for its ocean views, diverse culture and (both of them native Sword Worlders) its constitutional matriarchy. [[Mora]] also has no police force or emergency rescue service of any kind. Critical activities such as border security, orbital control and basic law and order or undertaken by the [[Imperial Army|Army]], with local volunteer groups often picking up the slack but that still leaves plenty of work in-between for agencies like Quorum to turn a profit.

Jobs can be many and varied. Typical cases might run from tracking down a driver who did not pay for his gas to tackling a smuggling cartel. Historically and astrographically, [[Mora]] is the Imperium’s gateway to the [[Spinward Marches]] and contracts issued here will often take Quorum bounty hunters far offworld, the guild enjoying quid pro quo relationships with the captains of hundreds of subsidised liners and free traders operating along the most common trade routes.

Individual bounty hunters are free to accept whichever contracts they please but Quorum tends to be more stringent in their criteria than most. They often work for free on causes deemed worthy, knowing that so long as someone in the guild is serving a genuine contract they will not go a month unpaid, and will turn down contracts that appear unfair or predatory, however rich the bounty. Again, this is entirely down to the conscience of the individual but Quorum prides itself on integrity. A consensus of agents is enough to induct a new member and is enough to eject one who brings the organisation into disrepute.

## Standard Galactic Bank 

### Collections Department
A spacecraft represents an astronomical investment in Credits, one that only governments, the very rich and large corporations can afford to purchase outright. For mere mortals, the dream of owning a spacecraft is achievable only by taking out a mortgage with one of the many galactic banks offering such products. Repayments on a typical free trader will likely set a Traveller back more than Cr180000 each month for the next 40 years and that is without considering essential running costs and maintenance. It is no great surprise then that the combination of multi- million Credit liabilities and possession of a jump- capable spacecraft does not always lead individuals to making the best of choices.

Some attempt to abscond on their debts, hoping to make new lives for themselves in frontier regions, but most are kidding themselves if they think there is anywhere in [[Charted Space]] beyond the reach of the banks.

TYPE : Corporate LEADERSHIP : Subsector field offices, each with its own chief, ultimately answerable to [[Standard Galactic Bank]]’s head office on Ankod, in the Core BASE : Most systems in Charted Space hosting a Class A or B starport REGISTRATION FEE: Cr8000 REGISTRATION CHECK: Difficult (10+) REP check HOLDBACK : 95%

While the idea of staring at screens all day is not going to get every former law officer’s pulse racing, there are advantages to being a corporate employee rather than a traditional bounty hunter. The pay is excellent and the perks are not bad either. All expenses travel throughout the subsector is usually part of the job, while particularly experienced tracers working major cases might be granted the use of company spacecraft to expedite the serving of their contract. Collection agents take cases assigned to them by their superiors and are paid a monthly salary ranging from Cr1000 to Cr10000 x REP per month, depending on experience and skills. Standard Galactic is a firm believer in performance-related incentives, however, and agents keep 5% of all successfully served contracts, often paid in the form of Ship Shares instead of Credits. With contracts occasionally running into the hundreds of millions of Credits, one major win is often all that stands between a good collection agent and wealth beyond most Travellers’ dreams.

[[TravellerCore#Pensions|Pensions]] are also available, with every four years of employment counting as a term. Operatives with REP 10+ count every two years in employment as a full term while they have REP 10+.

Runaway crews generally take great pains to avoid being caught and will, at the very least, have renamed and repainted their ship, while those who have really thought about what they are doing and have Credits to spare will have performed more thorough refits, having almost certainly swapped out the transponder. Following a trail of electronic receipts and maintenance logs requires serious investigative work and patience, and once they are finally caught with their backs to the proverbial wall in some frontier system, crews may not surrender without lasers being fired. In their own minds, they have already gone too far to back down. In desperation, some may resort to actions that risk destroying their ship and themselves along with it before surrendering themselves to Standard Galactic, and a successful collection agent will often be as skilled at persuasion as they are at forensic accountancy or astrogation.

The [[#Standard Galactic Bank Benefits table]] can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP) when joining the corporation.

Individuals hired by the bank to track down debt- avoiders are a specialised type of bounty hunter known as skip tracers. Smaller institutions with a dozen or so branches across a subsector or two will generally outsource this work to dedicated agencies but behemoths like Standard Galactic have the financial firepower and reach to take these operations in-house. Those on Standard Galactic’s payroll go by the more sanitised title of collection agents and are usually assigned to regional offices where databases of absentee spacecraft and their crews are updated weekly by Standard Galactic’s own jump-6 courier network. Collection agents are responsible for monitoring all space traffic in their area and following up any potential flags on their databases.

### Standard Galactic Bank Benefits

| 1D |Benefit  |
|:-:|--|
| 1| Standard Galactic provides you with equipment, weapons and armour. The number of items and their value have no limit but they are not of the agent’s choosing - access is granted by an administrator who may be in another star system and items are expected to be returned. If you have REP 10+, choice of items becomes your responsibility and they are regarded as permanently assigned to you - this may include augments.  |
| 2| Unlimited middle passage tickets (for yourself alone, plus any apprehended marks) while serving a contract. Successful operatives in good standing with their employer may simply have unlimited middle passage tickets even when not serving a contract, and the very best may have the option of high passage.  |
| 3| Legal defence fees with no upper limit are covered if you engage in criminal activity while attempting to serve a contract. In addition, medical fees with no upper limit are covered if you are injured while attempting to serve a contract.  |
| 4| 2D [[TravellerCore#Ship Shares\|Ship Shares]].  |
| 5 |You are granted access to all Standard Galactic offices and installations (although not always free access throughout such installations) across the region a contract is being served. This grants access to facilities present and use of the installation as a safehouse if needed.  |
| 6 |Standard Galactic grants you the use of a repossessed spacecraft for company use only. Such ships invariably have storied pasts (and aggrieved prior owners) and Referees are encouraged to be creative. The value and type of spacecraft is not of the agent’s choosing - access is granted by an administrator who may be in another star system, and it is expected to be returned. If you have REP 12+ then the choice becomes yours (although still limited to the spacecraft available) and it becomes yours to keep, provided you make monthly mortgage payments. |


## Vigil

Centuries of psionic suppression have left most Imperial citizens woefully ignorant as to what a psion can and cannot do. There are telepaths who read and manipulate a person’s thoughts, clairvoyants who know the darkest secrets and teleporters who pass in and out of locked homes with impunity. ‘Psionic paranoia’ has become an academically recognised phenomenon on worlds such as Esalin, Mongo and Louzy, often flaring up into witch hunts and purges before simmering down for a year or two, until the next incident sets off the mob again.

Vigil is an organisation that thrives on ignorance and fear. They specialise in hunting rogue psions and Zhodani spies, and in an area where the scars of the Fourth Frontier War remain fresh, there is rarely much distinction made between the two. Their methods are not dissimilar to the witch hunters of ancient Terra. The advanced trappings of their craft may have evolved,

but with basic human nature going unchanged for the better part of 200,000 years, the work remains very much the same.

TYPE : Guild LEADERSHIP : Discrete cells overseen by an absolute leader known as The Watcher BASE : Nakege REGISTRATION FEE: Cr2500 REGISTRATION CHECK: Routine (6+) REP check HOLDBACK : 30%

The Vigil Benefits table can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP) when joining the guild.

Vigil was originally based on the subsector capital of Jewell but quickly made itself unwelcome with rabble- rousing activities and aggressive tactics. The military government promptly outlawed it, forcing relocation to the smaller world of Nakege, two parsecs to trailing. This world is sparsely populated, with a dry and inhospitable environment, little to no law-enforcement activity and an unusually low Tech Level. Its Class D starport and Amber Zone travel code dissuades all but the roughest of tramp traders, making it the perfect location for an organisation like Vigil to settle and thrive.

Few Vigil agents have the means to travel where and when they please. Most will be active in a single system, or else hitching around the subsector backwaters with tramp traders grateful for the opportunity to scrape a few extra Credits out of marginal routes and who will not ask too many questions. Agents usually operate independently or in small cells, for their own protection as well as that of the organisation as a whole. It also makes it difficult for any individual agent to get ideas above their station.

The organisation is run by a figure known only as The Watcher. Reports differ on whether The Watcher is male or female, human or alien, one individual or many. Any contact that a Vigil agent has with The Watcher will be in the form of a slip of paper slid anonymously under a door or a few seconds of distorted audio on a disc somehow slipped in the agent’s bag. Contracts come directly from The Watcher but how they always know where their agents are, and exactly when they are arriving, is a mystery that has kept many a Vigil agent awake at night.

## Order of the Dove and Thorn

Marquess Jyoti Sharmirrisharma of Trane is of old Vilani nobility, her bloodline running unbroken through thousands of turbulent years of human history to the First Imperium. She has inherited tremendous wealth and influence but since achieving her majority has come to the realisation that her levers of power are mostly ceremonial and have little effect on real universe problems. Jyoti has little sway over the participatory democracy of her own fief and none at all over worlds in its immediate vicinity.

Frustrated by the iniquity, corruption and violence that the Imperium’s hands-off approach to governance tolerates, she founded the Order of the

Dove and Thorn. Members swear to uphold truth, champion justice, defend the weak and safeguard sentient life in all its forms.

TYPE : Patron LEADERSHIP : Marquess Jyoti Sharmirrisharma undertakes all important decisions, leaving the day- to-day running of affairs to her Huscarles BASE : The Marquess’ Palace on Trane in the Glisten subsector or, more commonly, the Marquess’ grand yacht, Electrum REGISTRATION FEE: Cr12500 REGISTRATION CHECK: Very Difficult (12+) REP or SOC check HOLDBACK : N/A

The Order of the Dove and Thorn Benefits table can be rolled on (one roll for every full three points of REP or SOC, whichever is highest) when joining the Order.

Bounty hunters with the Order of the Dove and Thorn are hand-picked by the Marquess herself or head-hunted by a trusted agent from her Hurscarles regiment. Many will be lower-ranking nobles themselves. The Marquess knows her fellow nobles, all of whom have sworn the same oath of loyalty to the Emperor as herself.

Individuals without peerage or with titles below that of knight are not technically permitted to become members of the Order but it is not unheard of for the Marquess to simply attach an individual to the household of a knight who is a member. For all intents and purposes they are a member, but a subordinate one, and it is unlikely their noble colleagues will let them forget it.

Although not a pacifist organisation by any means, the Order of the Dove and Thorn is of the philosophy that violence only perpetuates violence. Even the most intractable of problems, they believe, can be resolved with the right argument and an open mind. As a result, the Order’s membership is largely made up of diplomats and negotiators instead of soldiers, pilots and investigators. There is a strong duelling tradition in the Imperial nobility, however. They make extensive use of concealed weapons and personal energy fields, and a mild-mannered agent of the Order is to be underestimated at one’s peril.

The Marquess governs the Order as a benign dictator, freely soliciting the advice of her fellows but decisions are hers alone and are final. Contracts are selected by her and bestowed at her grace, usually going to those she deems best suited to the task, but for all her noble aspirations, she is still human and favouritism often plays a part.

Her intention has always been to right the galaxy’s wrongs but judgements are based on idealism over practicality and what looks wrong to a Vilani noble on her grand yacht is not always so to those further down the social hierarchy. As contracts are issued on her whim, it is far from uncommon for the Order of the Dove and Thorn to arrive unexpectedly, and very often unwanted, at the scene of a dispute. Their willingness to circumvent existing government and law enforcement jurisdictions when their oaths demand them to do so often leads to conflict with other agencies. The Order has been known to facilitate the escape of political prisoners, champion the rights of repressed minorities and foster revolutions, even flouting Imperial law by harbouring desperate psions or breaking naval blockades of Red Zone systems in order to save a life or right an injustice.

The monthly stipend paid out by the Marquess is not as great as one might expect. Most knights are independently wealthy and may have small fiefs of their own to provide an income. Salaries range from Cr500 to Cr2500 x REP per month, depending on experience and skills. What members of the Order of the Dove and Thorn will never lack for, however, is a patron who will support her bounty hunters to the hilt, with near-limitless resources at her disposal.

|2|The Marquess provides equipment, weapons and armour from her extensive personal armoury. Pick D3 items with a maximum value each of Cr10000. |
|3|Receive DM+1 to REP checks for tasks not involving the Order directly, due to the overall reputation of the Order. |
|4|The Marquess maintains an extensive fleet of yachts and other vessels, and can grant unlimited high passage tickets (for yourself and companions, plus any marks) while serving a contract. |
|5|You are granted access to Order of the Dove and Thorn hostels across the Glisten subsector. This grants access to facilities present and use of the installation as a safehouse if needed. This may include access to Trane Huscarle barracks and use of Huscarle troops and equipment if you have REP or SOC 10+. |
|6|The bonds of fellowship within the Order provides you with a network of mutual support. Add D3 Allies from amongst your fellow members of the Order and gain DM+1 to SOC or Diplomacy checks while in pursuit of a contract.|

# Safe Houses, Hideouts, and Bases of Operation

This chapter contains locations that can be inserted into a bounty hunter-themed campaign, as places the Travellers or their agency can use as headquarters, where marks can hide with some measure of security or where the Travellers conduct investigations when on the trail of a contract.

These locations can be used time and time again with little work. For example, a mining outpost might seem like a location that is needed just once for a specific adventure and then never used again, but perhaps it is constructed to specification by a mining company. Maybe, from one to the next, the layout is the same but customised to the needs of the surrounding environment, or perhaps it has been converted from a mining outpost to a pirate base, scientific research station or has become a temporary survival shelter for desperate colonists.

## C0N-TAL

C0N-TAL is an organisation that runs a network of ‘host’ ships in many areas of Charted Space. They mainly operate in and near the Third Imperium but their ships have been seen dotted across the Vargr Extents and even Zhodani space. They have not, as of yet, encroached into the Aslan Hierate. They remain unaffiliated with any government, with the members asked to leave any political affiliations at the doors of their ships.

The organisation has a few ships throughout many subsectors in Imperial space, meaning that jumps between host ships are relatively easy to make, if time consuming. They are mostly discounted by large corporations and the IISS, as they do not carry any weaponry and deemed non-threatening. Officially, C0N-TAL is listed as an Imperial corporation providing hospitality services throughout the Third Imperium, and they turn over enough of their revenue to the government to be continuously overlooked by anyone who may investigate their operations.

Most of their ships are well-maintained, especially those that see regular use or are in more densely populated areas of space. Some may be larger or smaller but there are a few mainstays; enough beds to sleep at least 15 visitors, a brig large enough to store whatever bounties they may be holding and docking clamps to allow ships to attach and board. The only requirement is that any visitors to the host ships follow the organisation’s rules, most notably being that no violence can occur on or within the vessels. The repercussion for breaking this rule is steep, with the individual who broke it forfeiting their life, often in gruesome ways. Some notorious bounty hunters are known to use C0N-TAL host ships regularly and there have been rumours that Konstantin Lyan continues his annual payments on the off chance he will need to use one again. Some younger bounty hunters who have heard the stories of him and wish to build their own equally horrifying reputations use this service for that reason.

Annual registration costs Cr500000 and gives the individual a card that can be used at over 100 locations throughout Charted Space. These cards are coded to expire every year on the date of creation to ensure that bounty hunters re-register as members, which has caused a few incidents of being locked out of a host ship. However, for the most part the system runs smoothly, with incidents few and far between. Any breach of the cardinal rule relies on the heavily armed staff and equally equipped guests to intervene, which they often do with glee.

C0N-TAL may approach bounty hunters whenever they get a notorious enough reputation to require somewhere safe to stay, but they maintain offices on Capital for any would-be interested parties who seek them out. They do not ask questions about the people who use the service, understanding the requirement for secrecy that most of their clients have. The most information they keep on file is their name and a record of their payment, the name being mostly optional. Many of their clients go by pseudonyms and the risks of breaking and entering into one of these ships deter any attempts. C0N-TAL prides themselves on privacy and regular visitors to certain ships will be remembered by the crew anyway.

In order to run such a large scale operation, over countless lightyears of space, each ship is operated and maintained by the pilot, with other permanent crew members taking part in the daily operations and

### CON-TAL HOST SHIP

Most of these ships are minimally staffed, with the pilot chipping in to help the engineer, the steward occasionally doubling as a medic, and so on. For the most part, they run without fault and are regularly assisted by the guests they take on. This is one of the smaller versions but each comes with five docking clamps, allowing ships of 201 to 2,000 tons to attach to the host ship. The crews may decide to

disembark or board on their own ships but the host acts as a mediator and safe haven for bounty hunters of different affiliations. Throughout the C0N-TAL fleet there are a number of rules that must be followed in order to access the host ships, in return for safety being guaranteed whilst docked or on board. For most bounty hunters, the respite given on these ships is worth the cost of following the organisation’s rules.

management. The ships are leased to each crew on an individual basis, and are manufactured at a number of shipyards throughout Charted Space. Registration fees are used to cover the cost of the ship, with the central company taking its dues once every two to three years on average, the ships and crews making their way to designated shipyards to both pay and receive repairs. These ‘hub’ shipyards then transfer the money back to Capital whenever possible. It is an inelegant and lengthy affair but works well enough. At times there are up to 1,500 registration paying members, bringing in C0N-TAL MCr750 annually, although logistics mean it is more likely to be gathered unequally, some ships paying more or less, and some paying in instalments of three/four years at a time due to their remote locations. The ships are paid a stipend intended to last for up to five years each time they return to a shipyard, with any balance paid during additional visits. For example, if one were to travel to a shipyard then return three years later, the balance of three years would be paid out to them to keep them going for an additional five.

## SMH-LZY-55N

Built by Sternmetal Horizons to mine for rare-earths, 55N (named for its latitude on the planet Louzy in the Spinward Marches) has been closed down for over 400 years. The nearest settlement is the old corporation town of Dust, 200 kilometres south. A subway train used to link the two but it is no longer operating and although the tunnel itself still exists, it has not been maintained in centuries. Dust has become little more than a ghost town. A few dozen citizens inhabit an arcology complex excavated to house hundreds, subsisting off the remaining trickle of corporate Credits which they readily supplement with bribes from outsiders who make the long, desolate journey to SMH- LZY-55N from time-to-time.

Sternmetal Horizons always intended to revive the site when the economic conditions were right and most of its equipment and technology was left in situ. SMH-LZY-55N is isolated and challenging to reach, but it is no great secret and ever since Sternmetal Horizons’ departure it has proven to be a magnet for scavengers, bootleg mining outfits and criminals in need of somewhere far away from the major arcology-cities to lie low.

The only viable way to approach SMH-LZY-55N is with a VTOL-capable aircraft or grav vehicle but even that is fraught with peril. The landing pad has been exposed to Louzy’s harsh elements for hundreds

of years and there is not much that still works as it should. The approach lighting system has been dulled to the point of uselessness and the radio beacon is glitchy, often transmitting incorrect or downright dangerous guidance data to incoming craft. A pilot approaching 55N is advised to be wary and pay greater credence to their own senses than whatever their flight computers have to say.

Sternmetal Horizons left in place a custodial security system with a limited suite of monitoring tools. Its primary task is to keep SMH-LZY-55N’s essential systems running and to ping Sternmetal Horizon’s GEO satellite with periodic condition updates. To this end, the system includes control software for a suite of Sterndroid maintenance robots capable of performing basic repair functions. With the right knowhow or override codes from Sternmetal Horizons, a Traveller might be able to assign one or more of the Sterndroids to their own tasks but this is largely dependent on the day-to-day vagaries of the caretaker’s creaking operating system. The gradual accumulation of software errors over time has left the Sterndroids more than a little eccentric. Their occasionally erratic behaviour and eerily near-human appearance are more unsettling than overtly threatening, although Sterndroids have been known to react forcefully to visitors who imperil the security system’s core custodial duties.

Sternmetal Horizons routinely contracts with local agencies to investigate anomalous reports from its caretaker security system. Often, this will be as simple as performing routine repairs on the facility’s communications and updating the base software. The transmitter dish is surface-exposed and prone to malfunction while the Sterndroids’ programming (in order to protect their own longevity) prohibits them from venturing above ground to conduct maintenance on the array.

Occasionally however, the system will have alerted the company to something altogether more sinister. This could be an attempted hack of its software, an unauthorised entry or removal of hardware, even a serious mechanical fault or seismic episode that potentially threatens the entire facility. It is not always possible to determine what, exactly, the problem is before a group actually touches down and experienced Travellers should go in hoping for the best whilst equipped for the worst. They will be far from any outside help or chance for resupply once they arrive, and will have to make do with what they have or what they can scavenge from the mine itself.

### Sterndroid Maintenance Robot

The Sterndroid is a humanoid robot designed by Sternmetal Horizons to fill in for a human in the absence of a suitable worker or in particularly hazardous conditions. Its manipulators are designed to operate in human spaces using human tools. Its general intelligence allows it to perform base maintenance but its abilities are limited compared to more sophisticated models, and while it can process complex verbal instructions it lacks the hardware to respond in kind.

Although durable and capable of manipulating weapons as easily as tools, the Sterndroid is not designed for combat and suffers lag in receiving instructions from SMH-LZY-55N’s security system.

SMH-LZY-55N is a pyramid with only the very apex (housing a basic landing platform, airlock and communications array) exposed to Louzy’s thin, tainted atmosphere and frequent desiccating storms. The rest of the facility is below ground. A single elevator shaft runs through it all and if that should fail, which it often does, then there are manual overrides as well as maintenance tunnels used by the Sterndroids, but it is an arduous journey to make by foot and all too easy to become lost in the maze of crawl spaces and conduits.

The uppermost floor is a visitor processing area. It comprises a few small rooms and its total floorplan is only slightly larger than the landing platform above it, with security desks and offices formally occupied by the mine’s senior management. Also on this floor, behind a magnetically locked and force-shielded door with no obvious means of accessing, a Traveller might glimpse the row upon row of bulky computers that house the facility’s security caretaker.

The next level down is substantially larger, incorporating habitation and recreation facilities for several hundred workers as well as the terminal of the now-defunct subway line from Dust. It is eerily pristine. The chairs in the cafeteria have been left neatly stacked on top of tables. Computers hum gently with standby lights on. Hygroscopic grit cakes the live camera feeds from the surface.

The fusion power plant, buried deep below ground, is still operational, meaning that SMH-LZY-55N, theoretically at least, has all the power it needs but brownouts and intermittent outages are common. The scale of disrepair is beyond the scope of any single group of Travellers, however well-prepared or skilled, to make right and even the most routine of tasks will often necessitate innovative workarounds.

Generations of squatters, scrappers and past expeditions of Travellers have left their own indelible mark on SMH-LZY-55N’s internal wiring. There is not much left that still works as it should.

Small, satellite communications facilities dot the surface. On those rare occasions when the dust storms subside, they are visible from observation terminals on the upper floors; weathered lumps of concrete and plastic, half-buried in regolith. SMH-LZY-55N’s electronic library can provide information on them but this is invariably out of date. Most have been looted by locals, risking the overland journey from Dust, although the better protected or harder to access sties may still contain useful information, equipment or the last redoubt of a criminal on the run. They typically contain geological or meteorological instruments, emergency battery storage for the unlikely event of complete power failure and spare parts. They are accessible only by foot, requiring protective gear, careful planning and great determination on the Travellers’ part.

The fourth level and below belong to the mines themselves. They are still hugely toxic, with chemicals pumped in from the surface to leach minerals from the rocks, forming pools and lakes that are powerfully alkali and impossible to get around. Radioactivity from the mined elements, even after 400 years of radioactive decay, remains potent enough to kill after a few hours of exposure. In spite of its inhospitable environment, the mine workings are also home to valuable mining equipment, chemical stores and the only parts of SMH- LZY-55N’s operating system that actually still works, being the site of the fusion power plant. Accessing these levels requires rad-hardened clothing that is also tough enough to withstand the chemical burns and abrasions of traversing a mine. Sternmetal Horizon manufactures its own proprietary mining suit, examples of which can be found throughout SMH-LZY-55N but rarely in serviceable condition.

In addition to the threat of armed scavengers and wanted fugitives lurking deep below SMH-LZY-55N, the mines have become a haven for the local wildlife. Louzy’s native flora and fauna is exceptionally hardy, tolerant of the radioactive environment and the extreme pH of the drinking water. The alkali lakes abound with protists and algae, which in turn foster strange bioluminescent insects and the vertebrate creatures that prey on them. For the most part, these are harmless to a group of Travellers but the rat-like twiggeth can be aggressive if surprised while corkscrew worms (so named for their peculiar burrowing action) have a taste for human blood and leave a soporific toxin in the bloodstream that will leave a person feeling groggy for hours afterwards.

### Sternmetal Horizons Mining Suit
A Sternmental Horizons mining suit is unwieldy and uncomfortable but it is incredibly hard-wearing, able to withstand the harsh conditions found under SMH-LZY-55N. It comes with a mobile comm, Geiger counter and light intensifier goggles, is self-sealing and provides life support for up to 12 hours.

More consequential by far, however, is the damage that the wildlife has done to the hardware and electrics that far down. The security system, despite innumerable software updates designed to address the problem, seems perfectly content to let the creatures have free reign of the lower workings. Below a certain level, even lighting and basic life support fails, and it is anyone’s guess what dangers and rewards lie buried there in the darkness.

## Rakkar the Sly’s Corsair Base

Kashi is a small, rocky moon orbiting the gas giant, Narax. It is tidally locked, gliding through semi-darkness in Narax’s vast shadow. It has a day-night cycle of a sort, however; Narax’s roiling atmosphere reflects much of its incident radiation onto its own system of rings and moons.
‘Day’ on Kashi is defined as the period in which its orbit carries it out from behind Narax’s dark side to bask in the gas giant’s albedo. It is arid and extremely cold. The liquid water necessary to sustain Kashi’s peculiar biome comes from the periodic melting of frozen aquifers, driven by the tidal stresses of the orbit around Narax.

The planetoid is swathed in filamentous microorganisms with a highly efficient photochemistry, capable of absorbing every last nanometre from the visible spectrum. The world appears so black that, without Narax or some other body behind it, it can be all but invisible.

Most of the local biota exist as photosynthetic strands, exploiting the moon’s low gravity to drift above the surface and compete with one another for light. Others have adapted to fill a chemotrophic niche, waiting for the daily freeze-thaw cycles to carry them to new habitats or refresh old ones. There are no large multicellular organisms of any kind and Kashi’s lifeforms are, for the most part, too alien and frail to be a direct threat to a visiting Traveller. They can, however, easily become an unintentional nuisance. Microbial filaments are fine enough to clog sensitive equipment while the moon’s abundant, radiation-hungry photochemistry can interfere with the ultra-shortwave radio bands used in common communications equipment. The moon’s Vargr inhabitants have learned to use medium wave frequencies that fall beyond the native flora’s absorption maxima.

The Gvurrdon sector is mostly non-aligned but the Thirz and Thoengling Empires both have interests in the region, and it is a major route for trade between the Third Imperium, Zhodani Consulate and the various Vargr polities.

Rakkar the Sly sited her base on Kashi for four principal reasons. Its location along the rimward edge of Gvurrdon puts it within easy striking distance of rich Imperial worlds in the Aramis and Pretoria subsectors. Narax provides a vast resource of unrefined fuel as well as a massive gravitational hazard to any pilot without the local knowledge and skill to navigate it successfully. Its powerful magnetic field also serves to cloak Kashi from long-range sensors and even the authorities on the mainworld of Ksunekso have little idea that a base is there. It is also far enough away from the larger corsair bases on Ortseus and Ganokoulovaenu that Rakkar and her crews can operate in relative obscurity.

Ksunekso is a poorly developed system, offering little by way of trade or interest. There are few legitimate reasons for a Traveller to make the journey, other than to tangle with Rakkar and her corsairs. They may have been hired by a rival corsair group to track down her secret base, negotiate with the infamous corsair queen or plot an attack. They might also have accepted a warrant for her assassination or arrest from an Imperial shipping company driven to the brink of bankruptcy by her raids. Alternatively, if their goals are more acquisitive and their intentions less than honourable, then Travellers may make the hazardous journey to treat with Rakkar the Sly and seek a berth on one of her crews.

The corsair base is situated in a patch of cleared biome near the equator where daytime surface temperatures can sometimes climb a degree or two above freezing and liquid water is relatively abundant.

The central compound rises through the long, tendrilous fingers of the microfilament webs like a model castle covered in spiderwebs. Outbuildings radiate out from the main structure and include armouries, generators and communications arrays. There are also extensive downport facilities equivalent to a Class D starport, complete with goods-handling, warehousing and refuelling infrastructure, and a small detachment of corsairs providing security. The downport also has its own fuel refining operation, substantial enough to keep Rakkar’s ships fuelled as well as turning a profit on the open market on Ksunekso. Structures are draped in inky black microbial mats, their absorptive properties providing both a visual and broadly effective electromagnetic camouflage. The base is invisible from orbit and difficult to locate even from the ground unless someone has a good idea what they are looking for.

The main structure boasts artificial gravity and atmosphere control but these are largely absent from the outlying buildings. Vacc suits are needed to venture outside but the gravity takes some getting used to and Rakkar employs a fleet of sealed vehicles to traverse the base.

Most of Kashi’s corsairs are based in the relative comfort of the central compound, with anywhere between 30 and 150 being in situ at any given time. The loud, colourful atmosphere generated by the boisterous Vargr is in stark contrast to the phantasmagorical landscape beyond the compound’s walls. The interior is bedecked with colourful hangings, the furs of exotic beasts, holo-prints and precious objects, the plunder of several sectors all tastelessly displayed to garish effect. Corsairs advertise their status in the style of their clothing and the trophies they carry, routinely swaggering about the base in vividly-coloured armour, toting large weapons with outlandish modifications.

### Kashi Rover

A slow, lumbering, all-terrain monster, this vehicle has been modified with eight huge wheels to improve traction and enough mass to remain on the ground even under low-gravity conditions. Its crew cabin and passenger bay are separately enclosed and fully pressurised, preventing airborne strands from finding their way inside and supplying life support for up to a day. However, accommodations are more functional than comfortable. The vehicle’s mass provides some protection against small arms fire but it was not designed for combat and offers little protection against heavy weapons. With its poor speed and limited range, the Kashi rover is used to transport people and cargo over short distances where atmospheric conditions make travelling by foot difficult or dangerous.

A group of uninvited Travellers looking to enter the base undetected will have few good options. Set down too far from the perimeter and even the most wilderness- savvy Traveller is liable to become hopelessly lost. Come in too close, however, or attempt the base’s own spaceport, and they will instead run afoul of the corsairs’ anti-aircraft and anti-orbital defence batteries. The central compound bristles with missile launch bays and beam laser turrets while a dedicated silo, adjacent to the communications array, houses a large ion cannon bay for the disablement and capture of unwelcome guests.

Kashi’s orbit, meanwhile, is filled with sleek corsairs. Heavily-armed ships with suspicious captains slink in and out of the system all the time, constantly on the lookout for spurious transponder identities or out-of- date passcodes.

The best approach may be to approach brazenly and hope to not be blasted out of the sky, or resort to some form of trickery.

## Oblang and Blint’s

Oblang and Blint’s is the name of a venerable auction house, located on the archipelago mega-city of Jeer on the planet Mora. The area is renowned for pristine littoral views and simulated ocean smells, and is consequently home to some of the finest restaurants and most exclusive clubs on the entire planet. Oblang and Blint’s certainly belongs in that category. Its offerings cater to the wealthy elite of the Spinward Marches, counting oligarchs and nobles and even the subsector duke himself as patrons.

Mora is the Imperium’s gateway to the Spinward Marches and, although the relationship is rarely considered in such equitable terms, the sector’s gateway to the Imperium. Goods flow in both directions and often stop to change hands there.

Rare and luxury items regularly find their way into the hands of Oblang and Blint’s, destined for display in the homes of its discerning clientele, but this is only its legitimate front. Brokers working for Oblang and Blint’s routinely scour the starport and dive bars frequented by tramp traders for illicit goods. The mere fact of their illegality is attractive to a certain type of buyer and can be guaranteed to multiply the final price at auction several-fold.

Many a trader in possession of ill-gotten merchandise will make specifically for Mora, ignoring closer markets and laxer regimes in favour of an easy sale in the brokerages of Oblang and Blint’s.

For Oblang and Blint’s most important guests, there is a VIP lounge upstairs from the main hall where carefully vetted clients are invited to bid on almost anything that the blindingly wealthy mind could imagine.

Mora is a civilised world with a lengthy list of restricted goods and activities, which Oblang and Blint’s is in a position to tactfully ignore for two main reasons. Firstly, the super-wealthy seldom see themselves as obliged to play by the same rules as everyone else; like starports and open space, they are above such trivialities as planetary laws. Secondly, Mora has no law enforcement to do anything about it anyway; basic order is maintained by the army and while the upper ranks of Jeer’s divisions are certainly aware of Oblang and Blint’s law-bending activities, the planet’s oligarchy government (most of whom are patrons) makes it worth their while to not take too keen an interest. Local vigilante groups, meanwhile, even if they could be made to care about these kinds of abstract crimes, would be lucky to get within a kilometre of the front door, never mind the exclusive upstairs rooms.

It takes a certain amount of status and Credits simply to get into the building. A substantial sum of money has to be put up at the door just to get past security. Any unspent Credits are returned on departure but it is a gesture of means; this is an elite establishment and it caters to elite clientele.

The auction house is divided into sumptuously decorated rooms, each catering to a particular area of interest, such as artworks, cultural antiquities, rare literature and religious artefacts. There is a bar, gym, two restaurants, regular performances by noted musicians, complementary chauffeur service and a hotel for offworld guests who would rather make use of Oblang and Blint’s facilities than return to their own yachts.

Access to the VIP lounge generally involves getting an invite from an existing member, or greasing the right set of palms amongst the management or staff.

The staircase is blanketed with security cameras and discrete body scanners, with strong doors at the top and bottom that it would take dedicated cutting equipment or high explosives to break through. There is more security at the top to subject first-time visitors to a more conventional frisking, confiscating electronic devices or concealed weapons.

### Amoured G/Car

A luxurious armoured transport of the kind more commonly seen ferrying VIPs around major cities, the vehicles used by Oblang and Blint’s are driven by a chauffeur, usually with two security guards and a small item of cargo. Its windows are tinted and the body is black. Otherwise, it looks normal enough but closer inspection might reveal how the extra weight of its armour strains the grav plates. The G/car is armoured against small arms fire and will offer limited protection even against heavy weapons. When up against serious firepower, however, its main advantage over other forms of transport is the ability to turn hard and accelerate to get quickly out of the line of fire.

The auction room is arranged in a circle with a ring of comfortable, informal seating around a holo-projector at the centre. Hanging screens display each lot’s main particulars. There is an open bar to one side, operated as a loss-leader and small change compared to the venue’s real income stream. Floor-to-ceiling windows (glazed with superdense glass) offer panoramic ocean views. Security is ubiquitous but also discrete, with smart people in smart suits wandering casually amongst the guests with holstered sidearms and stunners. They are well-trained and very well paid, resolving issues with a polite word or veiled threat before resorting to force.

Should a Traveller visit hoping to game the system, they will quickly discover that Oblang and Blint’s runs a tight ship. Lots for auction are displayed holographically over the central table, only physically brought to the hall after a winning bid has been lodged and the Credits transferred using the house’s own secure terminal. Items are transferred from one of many secret storehouses, delivered by an armoured grav car which parks in a reserved lot directly adjacent to the auction hall.

Bids are registered through handheld devices distributed amongst the attendees on admission. Each is keyed to the individuals gene-print, brainwave pattern and pheromone signature, and programmed to automatically lock their user out if they detect signs of duress or fraudulent intent. Biometric devices such as these are not immune to hacks or spoofing but it is extraordinarily difficult. Several layers of in-built interference block all in- and outgoing communications except for those originating from a single computer terminal which is constantly monitored by security.

Travellers might have any number of reasons for attending an auction at Oblang and Blint’s. A wealthy benefactor might have commissioned them to bid on their behalf in order to preserve anonymity, or their intention might be to infiltrate the auction on behalf of a wronged party, tasked with buying back misappropriated cultural treasures or making off with them in a daring heist. They could be amassing evidence on behalf of some offworld agency or for the purposes of blackmail, or they might just be looking for a good time and the chance to spend an enormous amount of Credits on something rare and semi-legal.

## Idill Downport

Conveniently located on the Spinward Main at the intersection of the Jewel, Lanth, Regina and Vilis subsectors, Phlume is a popular refuelling stop on the big megacorporate and sector trade routes. The subsidised merchants and cargo carriers tend not to do much business with the planet itself, instead berthing at the highport and allowing their crew to enjoy a little shore leave while they prepare for the next jump. The big operators do the bulk of their buying and selling on the major, high population worlds such as Regina, Knorles and Arden further along the Main.

Independent tramp traders, operating in the margins, will often land at the rough and ready downport on the island of Idill, bringing in manufactured goods and consumer electronics in exchange for fresh produce and livestock. These smaller ships will often be berthed in the downport for several weeks while the merchants tramp around Idill chasing brokers and rounding up goods.

Second only to farming and fishing, Phlume also boasts a lucrative tourist industry, offering hunting safaris and ocean cruises to match all budgets. Phlume is home to a menagerie of dangerous and exotic wildlife but larger creatures prefer to avoid humans and keep away from the more heavily settled islands like Idill. The regular stream of independent tourists, guided tours and crew on shore leave contribute to the population churn in and around the downport.

Phlume’s position at the edges of Imperial space make it a magnet for another, less desirable class of visitor. Heading spinward along the Main from Phlume, there is a convenient jump-1 corridor to the neutral Federation of Arden and from there, just a few parsecs further, to the Zhodani Consulate. Political refugees, marginalised individuals and criminals on the run flock to Phlume looking to beg, steal or barter for passage across the

border. Their presence has given rise to an unsavoury shadow economy of petty criminality, trafficking and extortion that has left the port authority overwhelmed.

The steady influx of offworld law officers and bounty hunters are regarded by most people as being worse than the criminals they pursue. While it may well be unfair to claim that all foreign agents will accost locals in the street or shake down startown businesses accused of aiding and abetting fugitives, the actions of a few have tarred all offworld authorities with the same brush.

Phlume’s participatory democracy has, meanwhile, been hopelessly split over what to do about the issue. They have a vested interest in appeasing their neighbours and are wary of how rising incidences of crime and the sight of transients sleeping rough around the downport might discourage tramp traders and tourists, but there is also plenty of sympathy for those fleeing autocratic or repressive regimes elsewhere. Phlume is wealthy, in spite of its small population and lack of advanced industries, and there have been tentative moves towards offering blanket amnesty to refugees whose alleged crimes break no local laws. The world has an abundance of space and a great need for workers in its fisheries and fields but for now at least, all that Phlume’s debating chambers have been able to come up with is talk, leaving the port authorities and frustrated locals to deal with the problem on their own.

Idill Downport is rated as Class C, with full cargo and repair facilities and berthing for several dozen spacecraft. Despite the services offered and the volume of traffic that passes through on a daily basis, Idill has a definite frontier feel. The towering stacks of

containers and huge warehouses are sun-beaten and corroded by salt, while tropical flying animals wheel and caw. People wander, seemingly wherever they please, carrying weapons openly. The port authority guards are sun-tanned and stand-offish, toting paramilitary-style submachine guns and speeding around the port in open-topped vehicles.

The downport is connected to its nearest town, Eyams, and its farms by road and by rail, but most long-term visitors to Phlume leave by ferry. A vast seaport directly adjoins the downport with the two virtually indistinguishable from one another, sharing a common customs and arrivals area, although Travellers are advised to remember that while the downport is technically under Imperial jurisdiction, much stricter planetary laws apply to the harbour. Misunderstandings are commonplace but port officials, although often exasperated by the inability of tourists to read a sign, are generally understanding.

Most tramp traders and shore-leave parties, however, never leave the greater downport area. They mix in the bars and hostels that fill the seedier parts of the downport, renewing old acquaintances and enthusiastically making new ones, trading stories with locals and making the most of the warm sea air and sunshine before their scheduled departures. For offworld law officers and bounty hunters, these places are also a buyer’s market for information. Anyone planning on fleeing the Imperium to one of the neighbouring polities is first going to need a ship willing to take them and the downport dive bars are where a person generally has to go in order to find one.

The port authorities keep records of ships bound for Consulate or Federation worlds as they require additional paperwork and checks and, although these registers are not exactly public record, it should not be beyond the wit of a Traveller to obtain them. From there, it is a simple enough matter for a streetwise investigator to stake out a particular tramp trader captain’s favourite bar and hope to get lucky.

Phlume is generally welcoming of offworlders but anyone who goes around the downport bars asking probing questions is likely to see their welcome turning cold very quickly. Most of the locals are, quite frankly, entirely fed up of officious outsiders pitching up on their world and poking around in their business. Instead, they are rather more sympathetic to individuals that governments have, for one reason or another, driven away and will actively aid them where they can.

Local volunteer groups run soup kitchens and hostels in disused warehouses, even helping refugees to find work on Phlume, but most are desperate to leave the Imperium far behind them. Those with the Credits or the means to earn them will try to buy passage with traders heading spinward. Those who cannot may attempt to stow away in cargo containers or sneak away with a shuttle-load of returning tourists.

### Fugitive Psion

Only the most desperate of fugitives, those with bounty hunters breathing down their necks and whose offences guarantee them the harshest of sentences on their homeworlds, risk fleeing to the system highport.

Leaving Phlume behind might feel like a step in the right direction but it is a sideways move at best, taking fugitives no closer to the promised land beyond the Imperial border. For many, the transition from downport to highport can feel quite literally like the walls closing in around them. The facilities are considerably leaner, amounting to little more than a spartan common area with a smattering of self-service food kiosks and an information desk. Security is several orders of magnitude tighter than it is planetside. There are fewer places to hide and fewer people willing to hide them, while the crews of the big cargo carriers, with distant megacorporate masters to answer to, have less leeway or incentive to take on passengers even if they could be persuaded to consider it. To make matters worse, the security systems on these ships are often superior to those found aboard the average tramp trader, making slipping aboard undetected practically impossible.

A patient bounty hunter will often deliberately drive their marks towards highport, knowing that, once there, they will be as helpless as a rat in a trap.

### Grand Yacht Electrum

The Electrum is Marquess Jyoti Sharmirrisharma’s home away from home and, when her political duties pull her away from her ancestral seat on Trane, the headquarters of the Order of the Rose and Thorn.

Fifty-percent bigger than the standard Type Y yacht, the Electrum harbours a few unpleasant surprises for anyone expecting a one-sided encounter with a raffish noble’s pleasure boat. A pair of pop-up turrets mounting twin pulse lasers can be deployed from the ship’s underbelly and these, coupled with a point defence battery, heavy armour and combat-oriented software, make it a match for anything short of dedicated combat craft. Its manoeuvre drives are powerful, allowing it to outrun most things it cannot outfight, while its jump range allows the Marquess and the Order of the Rose and Thorn freedom from the Spinward Main.

Much of the Electrum’s extra tonnage is taken up with hangar space for the Marquess’ pinnace, the Dragonfly , as well as an armoury for five marines drawn from her personal Huscarls regiment. An upper deck, extending to the stern, harbours the Marquess’ personal stateroom, a dedicated bridge and conference facilities where Jyoti Sharmirrisharma regularly hosts visiting nobles to debate the priorities and strategy of the Order.

Straddling the roles of diplomatic yacht and light corvette, the Electrum packs a lot of ship into a relatively small profile. It is a package that comes at significant cost but the Maquess’ noble fief provides ample wealth to pay for it.

The first section of this chapter introduces renowned bounty hunters to insert into campaigns, while the second provides other characters who could be involved in bounty hunting-related adventures. Referees have the flexibility to incorporate these characters in various ways; they could compete with or collaborate with the Travellers in serving contracts and collecting bounties, or they may perform a more ambiguous role, maybe working with the Travellers initially but betraying their trust later in the adventure. Others may be simple adversaries or provide local colour on newly visited worlds.

Konstantin is a vicious bounty hunter, known to be hired only by the Imperium’s elite. He has since ‘quit the game’, retiring in the hopes of finding a quiet life. He was known throughout the underworld at the height of his career as a force of nature in his own right. Any bounty hunter who attempted to challenge him would find themselves and whoever they were affiliated with wiped from existence. Konstantin was known to be honourable however, and would not target anyone who fell outside of his moral code.

There are a few things that might pull him back into the world of bounty hunting. He has no real use for Credits at this point, having earned millions throughout his time hunting down terrorists, murderers, thieves and shutting down entire organisations. His daughter, Irena, studies in Capital, thanks to her father’s connections, and there have been a few threats made to her life thanks to his line of work throughout the years. These threats have either been eliminated or proven unsubstantiated, with Konstantin expending considerable effort to protect Irena.

Seo-Hyan and Zorbay are co-founders of the bounty hunting agency, Quorum. Both women are now well into their nineties but remain active within the organisation they helped found, determined to live up to their egalitarian ideals and contribute their fair share of the agency’s income.

Seo-Hyan is Solomani human while Zorbay descends from a desert-adapted human Minor Race known as the Jonkeereen. Both are native Sword Worlders, their experiences as women in a chauvinistic society leading them both to seek adventure and fortune elsewhere, and informing their keen sense of fairness and justice.

The pair occasionally work alone but will most often be found together, Seo-Hyan’s streetwise nature and people skills perfectly complementing Zorbay’s survival instincts. Neither is quite as physical as they used to be but the skills that have seen them last longer in the profession than most of their peers have been alive are as sharp as they ever were. Their equipment is the best that legal Credits can buy and there are few bounty hunters, alive or dead, with better reputations than Seo- Hyan Gim and Zorbay.

EQUIPMENT Weapons: Autopistol (3D-3) Armour: Diplo Vest (+3) Equipment: Mobile Comm, Portable Computer/4

Dakarai mustered out of the Imperial Navy after three terms of service as flight crew after failing to gain a commission. His lifelong fascination with spaceflight and a dream of one day commanding a ship of his own led him to the corporate sector and a career with the Collections Department of Standard Galactic Bank.

His day-to-day duties involve electronic intelligence gathering, cross-referencing ship traffic reports from all over the galaxy against lists of ships and crews overdue on their mortgages, but Dakarai is keen to get out of the office and back onto the bridge of a

starship on the flimsiest of pretexts. His willingness to chase down any lead, however slight, does not always go down well with line managers looking for methodical investigative work and less frequent use of the corporate expense account, but it has brought him some spectacular successes and made him something of a favourite with the bank’s upper management. His most notable success was the retrieval of a MCr60 yacht, the Daisy Chain, which had been missing for almost 40 years. Dakarai chased her down on a hunch, assembling a team of marines and personally commanding the patrol corvette that finally caught up to her after a months-long chase across a dozen systems.

His tendency to disappear for months at a time, and his inability to play corporate politics, have hampered opportunities for progression, but he is a gifted bounty hunter with a natural talent for the work. The lack of professional recognition does not trouble him greatly. He has been putting his Credits towards refurbishing an old scout/courier, the White Queen, and reckons himself one big result away from owning her outright and putting the bounty hunting life aside for good.

Selima abandoned a promising career in the Imperial Marines not out of a hunger for riches or adventure but from a desire to make a real difference to the people of the Aramis subsector. She had seen firsthand the scourge of piracy in the Spinward Marches and, all too often, how ineffectual the Imperial Navy was at stamping it out, hamstrung by local politics, shifting priorities and the remoteness of the sector from the

Scoundrels Gallery centre of Imperial power.

Dakarai Metin

Trading one strict hierarchy for another, she signed on with the paramilitary bounty-hunting guild, Shadowsun, which has dedicated itself to hunting down Vargr Corsairs and other unaffiliated pirates in the Aramis subsector. Her courage under fire and willingness to put her life on the line for her ship and crew has earned her the respect of fellow bounty hunters. She has been put forward for promotion on more than one occasion but rejected the offer every time. Selima is more comfortable leading from the front, her foot in the breach; that is where she feels she can make a difference and she trusts her superiors in Shadowsun to keep on putting her in the right place to do so.

Hrorawoao’s career as a bounty hunter began with a duel, or rather, with a duel that did not take place. He was a minor lord in Aslan society, possessing several small continents on a trading world and the vassalage of a dozen lesser lords. When a bounty hunter of the Third Imperium crossed his territory in pursuit of a warrant without first presenting herself to his throne and begging his leave, Hrorawoao insisted on a duel to put right the snub to his authority. As a female, Aslan tradition dictated she find a suitable male to fight him in her place. When she refused to do so, insisting on fighting the bout herself, Hrorawoao was left in a quandary; face the derision of his pride by fighting a female (a human female no less) or take the insult to his honour and let the issue slide. He reluctantly chose the latter and the bounty hunter left his territory with her mark a few days later.

Her name was Ebrin Leela and Hrorawoao has been obsessed with her career and exploits ever since.

Hero worship is a central pillar of Aslan culture and although he will fight anyone who suggests he left his lands to the care of his sons and brothers in order to emulate a human female, this is exactly what he has done. He travels the Trojan Reach and rimward extents of Imperial space with his boisterous crew of hangers-on in tow, picking fights in every bar and taking on the most dangerous contracts available to demonstrate his strength and daring. With every contract he gets one step closer to the long-awaited rematch and the chance to prove once and for all that Hrorawoao is the best.

From a young age, she immersed herself in the wilderness, honing her skills and becoming intimately familiar with nature’s secrets. At the age of 18, she joined the Scout Service, where her exceptional abilities shone through. Samara’s dedication and impressive performance on crucial missions earned her commendations and recognition among her peers.

It was during her time as a wilderness guide for law enforcement that Samara’s involvement in bounty hunting began to take shape. Her experience navigating the wilds and her exceptional tracking skills proved invaluable in assisting law enforcement agencies in their pursuit of criminals.

Samara’s reputation as a skilled bounty hunter has flourished over the years. Her meticulous investigations and remarkable success rate have garnered her respect and admiration within the bounty hunting community. She is known for fearlessly taking on perilous assignments, never backing down from a challenge.

his disciplined nature and constant readiness. Highly dedicated to his profession as a bounty hunter, Jonah possesses a strong drive for challenges and is willing to go to great lengths to achieve his goals.

Although he occasionally works with others, Jonah prefers to take on leadership roles, drawing on his background as a disciplined marine. Having been born on a small colony world in a remote system and raised on a farm, Jonah joined the local militia to escape his pastoral life. Through determination and hard work, he honed skills as a soldier and caught the attention of the Imperial Marines, who recruited him into their ranks. Jonah’s commitment and competence allowed him to participate in various conflicts, earning the respect of both his peers and superiors. As a result, he steadily rose through the ranks.

However, Jonah grew restless with taking orders and fighting in other people’s wars. This restlessness ultimately led him to leave the military and embark on a new path as a bounty hunter. His military background, marked by discipline and combat proficiency, provided a solid foundation for his new profession.

Over the years, Jonah has built his reputation by successfully apprehending notorious criminals and fugitives. He takes pride in accepting dangerous assignments and is known for his ability to see them through, even if the outcomes are occasionally messy.

Harlan is an average-sized man with a solid, muscular build, and his choice of attire typically consists of camouflage fatigues or cargo pants, along with sturdy boots suitable for the demanding environments he often encounters. He exudes an air of confidence and projects the image of a tough individual, which aligns with his personality.

Harlan can be described as a bit of a bully, particularly when it comes to asserting his dominance over those he works with. He prefers to be in control and ensure that he calls the shots within his team. This has led him to abandon partners in the past if he felt they were not contributing their fair share, as he knows he can earn more Credits by side-lining them. Harlan believes that such actions send a message to other bounty hunters, making it clear that they must work hard to earn their place on his team or risk being left behind.

Despite his relatively short period as a bounty hunter, Harlan has achieved significant success. He quickly gained notoriety when he emerged seemingly out of nowhere and successfully tracked down and apprehended several high-profile fugitives. One of his most notable accomplishments was capturing Kaelen Roarke, a wealthy fugitive who had amassed his own private army. Harlan spent months navigating the seedy underworld of the galactic fringe, employing strike and fade tactics to neutralise Roarke’s henchmen before bringing him to justice.

Victor’s ability to engage others in conversation often results in them inadvertently divulging more information than intended, providing him with valuable leads to track down targets. A consummate professional, he approaches bounty hunting with a methodical and precise mindset. Victor prefers to work alone, as he lacks the patience to engage in the game of trust and potential betrayal that accompanies team dynamics.

However, when circumstances require him to enlist assistance, he ensures that his teammates sign legally binding agreements before embarking on the mission.

Victor’s background traces back to a remote world, where he enlisted in the Imperial Navy as soon as he was eligible. Although initially struggling to deliver exemplary performance, he persevered and ascended through the ranks. Before retiring, he had served in various capacities such as security officer, scout and pilot. Following a tragic training accident resulting in the deaths of two cadets, Victor sought new challenges and turned to bounty hunting as his next venture.

Throughout his career, Victor has established a reputation for competence and success. His notoriety grew when he successfully apprehended several high-ranking members of the notorious criminal syndicate known as the Two-Headed Serpent. Renowned for his attention to detail and his ability to outmanoeuvre targets, he excels in the art of disguise, frequently undertaking undercover operations to establish proximity to his marks. Victor’s notable accomplishments and track record have solidified his standing within the bounty hunting community. His meticulous approach, resourcefulness and determination have propelled him to the forefront of his profession, earning him recognition as a skilled and accomplished hunter.

Jack is pragmatic to the core, not inclined to spend much time pondering moral or philosophical dilemmas. Every job he accepts involves a calculated assessment of risk versus reward. He is primarily interested in the Credits he can earn, not seeking recognition or accolades. This reputation has made him a safe bet for contract issuers, as if Jack takes on a job, there is a good chance it will be accomplished with little blowback. While he primarily

takes low-priority contracts due to being new in the profession, his track record of success is gaining attention. When not hunting marks, Jack can often be found in seedy bars, enjoying drinks and the company of others of a similar nature.

While young and relatively inexperienced, Jack consistently completes contracts successfully, even in the face of complications or competition. Although he may not yet possess the reputation of more seasoned bounty hunters, he is gradually gaining a following among those who know him and some are coming to believe he has the potential to become one of the best in the business.

Jack Peters

A mild-mannered and slightly greying Sylean academic with doctorates in inorganic chemistry and exobiology, Sillo is far from most people’s picture of a typical bounty hunter. His late career change came about when his laboratory ship (engaged in long-term research studying abiogenesis in planetary ring systems) was attacked by pirates. The ship had no defensive capabilities at all and the crew had no weapons. Sillo’s pilot, astrogator, research staff and students were all slain. For Sillo, it was not the years of research lost, not the valuable equipment stolen or destroyed, nor even the friends taken that stoked an uncharacteristic hunger for revenge; it was the fact that he, himself, was not considered worth killing. He swore to track the felons down and ensure they faced justice.

Sillo has since discovered that investigating a crime is not fundamentally different to conducting scientific research. One begins with a hypothesis which one then devises experiment after experiment to disprove, adapting or reformulating the starting hypothesis when necessary, until no possibility but the truth remains.

Using his refurbished and significantly tooled-up laboratory ship as a mobile base, he has assembled a crew of professional hunters, unsentimentally filling in the gaps in his own skillset. With diligence, patience and a methodical approach to analysing evidence, Sillo Frank has managed to track down and capture most of the pirates, developing the most unlikely of reputations

in the process. The captain responsible for ordering the massacre continues to elude him but he knows that it is only a matter of time.

Life’s breaks never really came for Joskar Dreen. Born into corporate serfdom on the toxic world of Nakege, he was uneducated, illiterate and naturally introverted. A life of unexceptional drudgery in the SuSAG chemical farms surely beckoned, if not for the workplace fire that killed his entire family and left him with burns that would scar for the rest of his life.

Joskar never accepted the results of the official investigation into the fire, which found it to have been caused by a combination of antiquated refrigeration equipment and human error. He decided to conduct his own ‘investigation’ into the accident, falling down a rabbit hole of anti-Zhodani propaganda and psionic scare stories, and uncovering a truth so terrible that Nakege’s corporate government had no choice but to try to keep it from its people; psions are out there, telepathically manipulating governments and using telekinetic powers to silence those who learn the truth.

His public denunciations of prominent local figures as Zhodani agents made him an outcast from what was left of his former life, but soon brought him to the attention of the bounty hunting organisation known as Vigil. Outlawed on many worlds on which it operates, Vigil specialise in rooting out Zhodani conspiracies and unmasking rogue psions in-hiding. As Joskar Dreen continues his career as a bounty hunter, hitching around the Jewell subsector with sympathetic tramp traders, he has found that the conspiracy goes further than he ever suspected.

A psion of immense natural ability, Nalasha could have had her pick of assignments within the Zhodani Consulate but her loyalty to the Driantia Zhdantia has always come before any ambition she might have for herself. As a young woman, she fought against the Imperium during the Fourth Frontier War

as part of an elite psionic terror unit, quickly making even her comrades uneasy with the intensity of her mental discipline and ruthless approach to war. By the end of the 16-month-long conflict, she was regularly being deployed to terrorise out-of-the-way worlds singlehanded, and when the armistice with the Imperium was signed and her compatriots went home, Nalash was asked to stay behind; ever loyal to the Zhodani cause, she agreed without hesitation.

Her duties in the Spinward Marches involve the encouragement of pro-Zhodani, pro-psionic voices throughout border systems and conducting remote espionage on high-value Imperial officials. Imperial counter-intelligence officers speak of Nalasha as if she is a ghost and for all they have on her she may as well be. Her ability to eavesdrop on a target without the need to be physically present or to plant electronic devices, sometimes before the event has taken place at all, make for a formidable agent. On the rare occasion that an intelligence agent has been good enough (or, more likely, lucky enough) to get close, her powers of teleportation invariably allow her to stay one step ahead.

Only rarely will her orders escalate to overt acts of sabotage or assassination but she holds few qualms about carrying out such instructions when called. She does not hate the citizens of the Third Imperium but does pity them for they are repressed and unevolved, sheep led wilfully astray. Her hatred is reserved for the Emperor and his nobles who would deny a people their psionic potential.

Calfron was forced into his career as a bounty hunter after a ruthless act of corporate cost-cutting mid- voyage left him stranded on a strange world in the Spinward Marches with no ship, no money and nothing but the basic kit he had on him with which to survive. Fortunately, Calfron had been a merchant marine aboard the commercial trader, New Prospero, and a rural sheriff before that, and had enough basic survival knowledge to make it through his first few days. Making enough Credits to buy passage home, however, meant trading with the Saurian natives and, as all he had to offer them was his services as hired gun and law man, this was what he did.

Calfron Heady

Calfron soon carved a niche for himself resolving disputes between the Saurians and their human neighbours, becoming trusted by both communities as an even-handed mediator. His reputation has grown to the extent that most offworld traders ask for him when in need of a reliable broker or expert guide. He has even been employed by the New Prospero on more than one occasion and never fails to be amused by the failure of his former crewmates to recognise him, not that he can blame them; he has adopted Saurian garb and taught himself to wield the primitive weapons most readily available on the planet. More to the point, he looks happy.

In truth, he has earned enough Credits to go home 100 times over but Saurus is his home now. He is fiercely protective of it, and the people who helped him build a new life there, and he has no plans to ever leave.

By the time Druke grudgingly acknowledged the passing of his 40th birthday, he had fought in a dozen warzones across the Spinward Marches, winning multiple citations in each and earning a reputation for being unkillable. When the army finally forced him to retire on a medical discharge, he did not know what he was supposed to do with the rest of his life. 

On his eventual return to his homeworld of Mora, he was disgusted by the petty lawlessness, low-level anarchy and poverty that seemed to be endemic to this supposedly wealthy planet. It had always been this way, of course, but returning after a 20 year absence allowed him to see with fresh eyes, and Druke decided he was going to do something about it.

He had found his purpose. The gangs who had carved up his neighbourhood between them soon found themselves under assault by a one-man army. Proud gang leaders set aside generations- old rivalries to fight him but Druke was relentless and left effectively half cyborg by his long service, almost impossible to kill with the street-level firepower available to criminals. The survivors of the broken gangs surrendered or moved out, but Druke is far from satisfied with his achievements thus far. He is a man on a mission. As his reputation has spread, more and more requests for his brutally direct form of aid have been finding their way to his simple apartment from all over Mora and beyond.

Suffice to say, Bastion Druke is only getting started.

Rango Dooley never set out to be a bounty hunter. From his own perspective he is simply unlucky, for it seems that he cannot set foot upon a new world without being drawn into some scrape or other. This could, at least in part, be due to Rango’s marked proclivity towards intoxicating beverages, games of chance and low company. It could also have something to do with an overly trusting nature and inability to always pay full attention to the verbal communication forms favoured by most sophonts he meets on his travel. It is also possible that to people with a certain kind of problem, a 4-metre- tall, 500 kilogram Lurent often looks like the solution.

Whatever the reason, Rango has unwittingly built quite the reputation for himself as his wandering cycle has carried him ever further from his homeworld. His irrepressible good humour and childlike sense of wonder at the marvels of Charted Space have made him countless friends, even as his biologically ingrained wanderlust prevents him from remaining in one place for long.

## CONTACTS AND ADVERSARIES

The following individuals are members of the underworld and can fit into a bounty hunting campaign in a number of different ways. For example, a gunrunner can be somebody who is providing assistance to a mark, a valuable contact who knows where people can be found, or someone the bounty hunter goes to for unique and professionally crafted equipment. A cunning gunrunner can be all three at the same time.

Often times, these people are the ones who run afoul of law enforcement. As such, they can also easily be used for the marks.

The Referee is welcome to customise each character to suit specific adventures, adding equipment or characteristics and skills as needed.

EQUIPMENT —

Assassins are trained individuals who specialise in discreetly eliminating targets on behalf of clients, which can include governments, corporations or those seeking revenge. They undergo rigorous training in combat, stealth and infiltration, enabling them to carry out their missions with precision. Operating alone, they employ many methods, from close- quarters combat to long-range sniping, and may utilise advanced technology or exotic techniques to accomplish their goals.

A trained assassin is dangerous and should be approached with caution. While their services may be sought after, hiring them comes with significant cost and legal risks. In many jurisdictions, both the assassins and those who hire them can face criminal charges, including murder, if caught.

A con artist is a skilled manipulator who employs fraudulent tactics to deceive and exploit others for financial gain or valuable possessions. They use a range of strategies, creating elaborate schemes or relying on charm and persuasion to gain their victims’ trust.

Con artists specialise in specific types of deception, targeting particular demographics and exploiting their targets’ vulnerabilities. They employ psychological tactics like flattery and gaslighting to manipulate victims and coerce them into parting with wealth or resources. To protect themselves, con artists often use fake identities and strive to avoid detection by law enforcement.

### CRIME BOSS

TRAITS: — STR 8 INT 11 Skills: Broker 1, Deception 2, Diplomat 1, Leadership 1, Persuade 3, Streetwise 2

DEX 7 EDU 7 END 10 SOC 7 EQUIPMENT —

Crime bosses are the middle managers of criminal organisations, exerting control over illicit activities such as smuggling, extortion and gambling. They try to amass wealth and power by operating from the shadows, running shell companies to launder funds and avoiding direct association with crime. While law enforcement may be aware of their identities, prosecution proves challenging due to their organisation’s structure and their defences.

They can adopt different management styles, either overseeing operations themselves or delegating tasks to trusted advisors, maintaining order and loyalty by relying on networks of informants and enforcers to handle rivalries and internal threats. Tactics like bribery, Scoundrels Gallery

intimidation and violence are employed to protect their positions and expand influence through alliances with other criminal groups or legitimate businesses.

Despite their influence, crime bosses face constant threats. Rivals seek to seize power and take control of their operations, while law enforcement remains determined to bring them to justice. As they navigate treacherous waters, crime bosses must remain vigilant, aware that any misstep could lead to their downfall.

### DRUG DEALER

DEX 7 EDU 4 END 9 SOC 4 EQUIPMENT —

Drug dealers are involved in the illegal sale of narcotics, usually mind-altering substances. Their operations can range from small-scale, single-location setups to extensive networks of suppliers and distributors spanning multiple locations. They face the constant threat of rival dealers or gangs seeking to seize control of the market, requiring them to protect their territory.

Enforcers are individuals employed by criminal organisations to enforce rules, maintain loyalty and protect the organisation’s interests. They use tactics such as coercion, violence and murder to carry out their tasks. Selected for physical fitness and unwavering loyalty, they perform duties that often overlap with common thugs, such as debt collection and contract enforcement. Successful enforcers may rise in the ranks and become leaders within the criminal organisation.

### FENCE

TRAITS: — STR 6 INT 10 Skills: Admin 1, Broker 2, Deception 1, Electronics (computers) 1, Streetwise 2

DEX 8 EDU 9 END 7 SOC 5 EQUIPMENT —

A fence is a clandestine operator who buys and sells stolen goods, operating in hidden locations to avoid detection by law enforcement. They specialise in dealing with stolen items and maintain connections with specific thieves or criminal organisations. Fences also establish relationships with legitimate businesses, such as pawnshops, to sell stolen goods covertly. They employ tactics like altering serial numbers and forging documents to make stolen items appear legitimate.

To maintain secrecy, fences use intermediaries and take precautions against surveillance or undercover operations. While successful fences can amass wealth and power within the criminal underworld, they must constantly remain cautious to avoid arrest and imprisonment.

### GAMBLER
Species Gender Age

TRAITS: — STR 6 INT 9 Skills: Deception 2, Gambler DEX 7 EDU 7 2, Persuade 2, Streetwise 1 END 7 SOC 6 EQUIPMENT —

Gamblers are professional game players who participate in high-stakes gambling scenarios to win Credits and support their lifestyles. They engage in a range of games, legal and otherwise, including card games and virtual reality simulations, relying on both skill and chance for success. Some gamble for the thrill, others for socialising and some to enjoy a life of luxury.

Successful gamblers possess extensive knowledge of the games they play and employ their own strategies to improve the odds. While legal gambling takes place in authorised establishments like casinos, illegal gambling occurs in underground venues. Gamblers must manage risks wisely to avoid substantial losses or falling to addiction.

### HACKER

A hacker is a computer expert who specialises in bypassing security measures and gaining unauthorised access to private data. They possess advanced knowledge of computer systems and networks, using their expertise to breach secure systems and extract sensitive information. Hackers may be hired to uncover hidden data, engage in corporate espionage or carry out cyber-attacks.

Using techniques like targeted phishing, hackers exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to restricted information, often by tricking individuals into revealing passwords or other confidential data. They rely on their technical skills in coding, programming and network administration, and stay up to date with technological advancements. Due to the legal consequences of their actions, hackers take precautions to avoid detection. They operate under aliases and ensure their locations cannot be traced.

### INFORMANT

EQUIPMENT —

Informants play a vital role in providing valuable insights on criminal activities and organisations. To protect their identity, informants may use aliases, encrypted communication methods and other advanced technologies to avoid detection by the criminals they are reporting on.

Being a successful informant requires the ability to gather reliable information while facing significant personal risk. Informants must maintain their cover identities and navigate the constant danger of physical harm, retaliation and even death if discovered. Although their motivations may vary, many informants choose this path out of a sense of justice and the desire to expose criminal wrongdoing. They work closely with their handler to manage risks and ensure their protection, as well as the security of the information they provide.

### LOAN SHARK

TRAITS: — STR 6 INT 6 Skills: Broker 0, Deception 1, DEX 7 EDU 6 Persuade 2, Streetwise 2 END 8 SOC 4 EQUIPMENT —

Individuals or organisations known as loan sharks provide loans, often referred to as hard money or private loans, to those unable to obtain financing through traditional means. These loans come with high interest rates and strict repayment terms. Loan sharks prioritise profits and resort to tactics such as intimidation, violence, extortion and racketeering to ensure borrowers repay their debts.

To conceal their operations and launder earnings, loan sharks may operate covertly using intermediaries or front businesses. They may also employ advanced technologies like encrypted communications or blockchain-based smart contracts to protect their investments. While charging high interest rates is not necessarily illegal, loan sharks face legal consequences for engaging in violent acts, blackmail or laundering.

Mercenaries are hired soldiers who undertake military operations for financial gain, working independently or as part of private military companies. Their responsibilities range from asset protection to leading military campaigns. Mercenaries undergo training in combat techniques and must adapt to fast-changing battlefield scenarios. However, their profession carries significant risks, including incoming fire and legal repercussions. Competent mercenaries manage these risks and navigate complex political dynamics in regions with competing factions.

Smugglers are skilled pilots who transport illegal goods across and between worlds, either independently or as part of criminal organisations. They rely on their navigational expertise and contacts to avoid detection by law enforcement, using tactics like falsifying documents and hiding contraband to evade authorities. Smugglers transport various illegal items and risk encounters with hostile entities and law enforcement. They build networks of allies and invest in their own ships for greater autonomy and success.

Common thugs are low-level enforcers for criminals, using violence and intimidation to carry out tasks assigned by their bosses. They rely on physical strength rather than intelligence or specialised skills but, despite their lack of sophistication, thugs are effective and can pose a significant threat. They serve as the frontline defence for criminal organisations, keeping unwanted individuals or authorities at bay through a combination of fear and force.
