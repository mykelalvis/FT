Mekee is a sparsely populated subsector marked by two stellar chasms and no fewer than eight small stellar clusters, each of which is referred to as a ‘county’ by the vacant office of the subsector duke. Mekee’s previous duke was killed in a duel with a high-ranking member of the peerage from Fornast. Duelling is frowned upon in the Core but reversion to the barbaric practice still occurs from time-to-time. Duels must be sanctioned by the Emperor and attended by an Imperial observer, and this only after a lengthy bureaucratic process and a great deal of paperwork is completed.The process typically takes 6–9 months. The hope  is that by making the code duello cumbersome and inconvenient, cooler heads will ultimately prevail and the whole thing will be called off. It usually works quite well but it obviously failed as far as the Duke of Mekee was concerned.

The subsector is now managed by the eight nobles who represent each of the counties. In truth, most of Mekee’s clusters are far too small to warrant the assignment of a count so several are barons and knights. By Imperial law the duke’s heir should have succeeded him as subsector duke but the ducal family had been besmirched by scandal and the Emperor temporarily suspended their patent. The leading nobles of each county come to Ushra once every 100 days in order to manage the subsector’s affairs. It is rare that all eight can make it to the meeting every time, so the rules have recently been adjusted so that a quorum is declared if six are present, although there is little administration to be done. Mekee is a disparate collection of small fiefs that have little in common with one another and it seems to get along just fine without a large degree of oversight. Nevertheless, rules are rules and the peers of the realm have obligations.

The most significant system in the subsector by far is Depot, which provides personnel, training, berthing and maintenance services for the Core Sector Fleet. The world of Depot Prime – or Uugnii, as the Vilani called it – is theorized to have been terraformed but never settled by the Ancients. Perhaps even more fascinating are the ruins of a multi-world civilization on Adguu Uun, Guun and Mukiid. There is a body of evidence that indicates these may be the remnants of a species that originated on one of the three worlds and reached the other two by sublight spacecraft. None of the artefacts that have been found appear to be of human origin and they are too recent to have been built by the Ancients who vanished approximately 300,000 years ago. The ruins on Mukiid have been reasonably well preserved but archaeologists are still uncertain about many things, including what caused this multi-world species to disappear from the galactic scene.

Most traffic from the Core subsector does not flow through Mekee, unless it is naval traffic making its way to Depot or scout ships travelling to the IISS way station on Ushra. Mekee is a backwater and traversing it is difficult for most civilian starships so most simply go around rather than through it. Merchants generally avoid Mekee like the plague, preferring instead to ply the Sylean Main to rimward or the Quadrant I Main to coreward. The only reliable commercial traffic through the subsector are bulk freighters from the Achenaar Antilles line, which keeps its worlds supplied with the goods that they need.

The Imperial Navy 3rd Fleet, headquartered at Muskoxah, has only three squadrons but a large number of auxiliary ships, mostly fleet couriers used to carry news rapidly to Capital from the spinward subsectors of the Core and beyond. Two of the squadrons are typical BatRons, which patrol the subsector when not otherwise engaged and one TankRon, stationed at Gipkikhar, which is present to lend assistance to fleet elements making their way outward from the Core subsector.
