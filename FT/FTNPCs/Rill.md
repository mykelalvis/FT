![[Rill_Portrait.png]]

[[#Rill]] is the ducal heir’s personal steward and attends to his every need during the expedition. During the jumps from [[Sirma]] to [[#Tinea-Fabre]], the Travellers come to know and appreciate old [[#Rill]]y’s excellent cooking. Even when the _[[Superb Starling]]_ is sputtering and stalling due to poor maintenance, at least they get to eat well.
