Currently available as a prototype, the Trepida is
intended to become the standard-issue heavy grav tank
in the Imperium. The Trepida is in trials at the moment
and has been deployed on Capital and other key
worlds of the Core sector. The tank has a crew of two,
a commander and driver/gunner.

Rapid-Fire Fusion Guns: The Trepida and other
classes of Imperial battle tank use a rapid-fire fusion
gun instead of the standard fusion gun installed on its
predecessor, the Invader. Rapid-fire fusion weapons

become available at TL14, are designated with the
prefix ‘RF’ and preclude the need for an auxiliary
automatic weapon.
