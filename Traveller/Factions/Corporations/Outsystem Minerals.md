# Outsystem Minerals

Followers of vid dramas could be forgiven for believing that most of the mining and mineral extraction taking place outside a mainworld’s gravity well is done by independent belters using ramshackle old ships, and that mining companies have nothing better to do than oppress and harass the belters. In fact, the bulk of mineral resources that reach the factories of major industrial worlds are mined by corporate bodies on an efficient, large-scale basis, often in areas that have little or no belter presence.

Outsystem Minerals is one of the many corporations that supplies mid-level industrial worlds with bulk minerals. It specialises in mining asteroids and outsystem moons, though it does have a few outposts on rockball planets here and there. Operations tend to be modest, with mining towns of perhaps 200-300 people on a major industrial world but to a backwater planet it can be an economic disaster. There is thus an element of politics about the deployment of mining platforms which may escape the casual observer. Rumours that a platform is due to pull out of a system can have significant effects on the local situation in terms of protests at the port as well as long-term economic ramifications.

Depending on the intended market some rigs are specialised for extracting one type of chemical. Others have multiple products. This is common where a number of chemicals are being extracted, each in in small volumes, or where a single rig is supplying a mainworld’s chemical industry. Most rigs also process hydrogen for their own fuel needs and often sell it to passing starships or ship it to a dry mainworld for sale at the starport.

Gas rigs are typically serviced by small transport ships including Free Traders, which bring in necessary supplies on contract but often ship additional goods for sale to the workforce. The availability of fuel and a willingness to trade with passing ships has ensured that some rigs have become regular refuelling stops for vessels passing through certain systems. There are many reasons for wanting to bypass the mainworld, not least of which is the possibility that it has a very poor starport. [[Jovian Chemical Extraction|JCE]] does not tolerate any conduct that will endanger its rigs or its personnel, but is otherwise quite happy to make an additional profit selling fuel to passing ships.

Working on a gas rig is of course dangerous, and [[Jovian Chemical Extraction|JCE]] pays its staff well. Those that have to go outside in heavily armoured suits are of course on a high salary, but even shopkeepers and plumbers who work aboard the rig receive a hazard supplement. JCE has a deal with various local navies and mercenary groups to refuel their ships for free if it has enough surplus fuel aboard a rig they visit, a move intended to create goodwill and ensure the protection of local armed forces. There are rumours that this courtesy is sometimes awarded to less reputable groups as well, but this has never been proven.
