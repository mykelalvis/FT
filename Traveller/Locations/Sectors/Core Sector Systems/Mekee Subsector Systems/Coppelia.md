Coppelia is the site of Research Station Gamma, which was founded in 882. An initial eight-person team was put in place to study the anomalous gravity field of the system mainworld. While most of the planet has a consistent 0.45G, regions of Coppelia, ranging in size from 10,000 to 500,000 square kilometres, have been seen to fluctuate from 0.3 to 0.7G. These gravitic disturbances last anywhere from a few seconds to several hours after which the region slowly returns to the median 0.45G.

As so often happens with unexplained scientific phenomena, the public suspects that the Ancients must be involved. A great deal of their technology was so advanced and was developed by a culture so different than that of Humaniti that the assumption is natural. However, there is no hard evidence that the Ancients had anything to do with the worldâ€™s gravitic anomalies. No actual Ancients sites have been discovered on Coppelia and none of the other tell-tale signs of their passing are present.

The research team was eventually expanded to 50 and a small downport was built for the scientists with a single landing pad large enough to dock a spacecraft of up to 100 tons. There is no highport at Coppelia but there are several satellites in place to measure  gravitic disturbances from orbit. In addition, one or more scientific craft are often present, usually Type-L laboratory ships that are uniquely suited for the study of such phenomena.
