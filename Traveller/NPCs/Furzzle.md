Little is known about Oblang and Blint’s current owner. He (or she, or possibly they) is a Llellewyloly, a radially symmetrical alien species only rarely encountered outside of their homeworld of Junidy. Why one would voluntarily choose to settle on a world so fundamentally contrary to its species’ biology as Mora is just one of the many mysteries that surrounds this individual. Where his money comes from is another.

Furzzle, as he has conveyed his name to be, can occasionally be found drifting serenely amongst his esteemed guests in an environment suit and grav belt, but will rarely reciprocate attempts at conversation. He seems affable enough, in an aloof sort of way but is inscrutable. Someone of a generous disposition might argue that this is the inevitable consequence of a physiognomy utterly lacking in facial expression but most clients of Oblang and Blint’s would agree on one thing: Furzzle is definitely up to something.
