### Asteltine

An average-size world with an exotic atmosphere unbreathable for humans, [[Asteltine]] is home to about 2,000 people whose origins vary considerably. People tend to come to [[Asteltine]] to work rather than live, so the population tends to be somewhat variable. Most residents are Imperial humans but there are small numbers of [[Darrians]], [[Sword Worlds|Sword Worlders]] and [[Aslan]] at any given time. There is some tension between these groups.

While [[Asteltine]] itself is an unpleasant world, the system supports a large belting and mining community. This was sufficient to support the development of a decent starport which employs nearly all of the world's inhabitants. The port is also used by ships plying the [[Spinward Main]] in the direction of the [[BtC-FiveSistersSubsector.jpg]].

For decades, [[Asteltine]]'s mining and ore processing industry has been a chaotic mess of small firms and entrepreneurial individuals. However, there are rumours that some of the larger corporations – or even the megacorps – might want to move into the system now that access has become easier.
