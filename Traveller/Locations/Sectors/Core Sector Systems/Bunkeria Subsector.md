Bunkeria was once home to a large portion of the Interstellar Confederacy, a multi-world polity that got its start during the Long Night. The string of Confederacy worlds extended from the Hektalus system in Bunkeria to Velpare in Cemplas, encompassing 32 star systems at its peak. The Confederacy looked as if it would pose a major challenge to the Sylean Federation for supremacy in the Core sector but its lack of unity was ultimately its downfall. Two wars determined the destiny of the Confederation, the first of which was lost to better  organised Sylean squadrons who routed disjointed Confederacy forces in the Battle of Velpare. The second was a brutal civil war in which the Confederacy lost its capital at Sketola to rebel forces. Sketola was eventually reconquered but the damage was done. The Sylean Federation was able to exploit the weaknessesof the Confederacy, causing it to collapse one year  before the founding of the Third Imperium.

The Interstellar Confederacy may have died long ago but its spirit and culture lives on. The worlds of Bunkeria have cultivated a flair for independence within the confines of the Imperium. Bunkerians celebrate Liberation Day to commemorate the reacquisition of Sketola from the rebels. The celebration includes festivals to honor famous war heroes, politicians and other historical figures. There are art exhibits, re-enactments of great battles, feasts and banquets and all sorts of other entertainments. Bunkerian worlds are drawn together by a shared history and heritage that unites them in ways that most subsectors are not.

Bunkeria is defended by the Imperial Navy’s 217th Fleet, one of the smallest numbered fleets in all of the Core with only two full-time squadrons. A rarity in the Imperium, Bunkeria’s 217th Colonial Fleet is actually larger than its numbered fleet with four full squadrons at its disposal. The ships of the official 217th are highly capable TL15 spacecraft with jump-4 capability while the Colonial 217th is composed of locally built ships that average TL13 and jump-3. Bunkeria’s Colonial Navy ships are some of the most colourful in the fleet, adorned with the martial regalia and names of heroes from their vibrant historical past. Because of how few squadrons it has, the 217th primarily patrols the worlds along the Sylean Main, while the 217th Colonial patrols the interior of Bunkeria including the Irlu and Dral Clusters.

Sketola is the capital of the subsector and headquarters of both the subsector and Colonial fleets. The economic powerhouse of Bunkeria is the F’rnow system, home of the sector-wide Achenaar Antilles Line, which was founded during the era of the Interstellar Confederacy and remains one of the most powerful corporations in all of the Core. Achenaar Antilles has over 1,000 ships in its fleet, most of which operate on the Sylean Main.

The Imperium is leery of Bunkeria’s independent streak but have been cautious not to spoil a good thing. In spite of its relatively small population, the spirited worlds of Bunkeria have done their part to help grow the traffic along the Sylean Main. Furthermore, the subsector is remarkably stable with only one world classified as an Amber Zone. While Bunkeria is certainly not the Core’s best and brightest locale, it has undeniable appeal and a seemingly bright future.
