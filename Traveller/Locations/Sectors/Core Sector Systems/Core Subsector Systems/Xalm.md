History & Background (Dossier)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This world is part of the "Shaaaki Cluster" cultural zone. Shaaaki were the product of a hybrid Vilani-Solomani culture, and once prosperous. However, two centuries into the Imperial era, the environment of Shaaak (modern Syroe "Syroe (world)")) had become severely degraded by unbridled industry. Emperor Martin II deindustrialised the planet and ordered a mass emigration of the Shaaaki people to several nearby worlds, among them Xalm.

### Imperial High / Landed Nobility

**Xalm**, as a member world of the Third Imperium, holds the estates of three members of the Imperial Nobility, who are charged with overseeing the world.

*   It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.
*   It holds the estate of an Imperial baronet.
*   It holds the fiefdom of an Imperial count.

### Starport

**Xalm** has a **Class D Starport**, a poor quality installation which has few of the expected amenities. There is unrefined fuel for starships and a limited variety of ship provisions. There is no shipyard of any kind, but there may be parts and technical support for doing minor services and repair. Ports of this classification generally consist of only a downport, unless this is a trade port or system with an hostile environment mainworld.

### Technology Level

**Xalm** possesses a Technology Level of TL–5.

*   Common _Communication_ technologies for this TL include: Telephone, radio, and television.
*   Common _Power Generation_ technologies for this TL include: Electricity, hydrocarbon internal combustion, and the most fundamental atomic energy.
*   Common _Transportation_ technologies for this TL include:
    *   _Land:_ Ground cars or automobiles and tracked vehicles.
    *   _Water:_ Large ships and submersibles with steel hulls.
    *   _Air:_ Early aircraft including seaplanes and very early unmanned rockets.

### Government

**Xalm** is governed by a _Charismatic Oligarchy_, like a charismatic dictatorship in that a larger group has asserted their right to rule. The group will have better rules of succession and may last longer or may transition to a non-charismatic dictatorship.

From [[IY1103]] to [[IY1105]], Xalm's president was a right-of-centre Orangist, but the Aglow Greens (socialist environmentalists) were gaining traction.
