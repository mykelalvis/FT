## STEPPEHAULER-CLASS MODULAR FREIGHTER

```
In the Datsatl sector, far from the Third Imperium, the Tijian Khaganate
had long desired to claim the riches in forbidden Ognar subsector. Its
rival, the Pirian Domain, had placed those worlds off limits and claimed
systems between the Khaganate and Ognar to block these worlds off.
Tiji, master of his empire, knew that higher technology could bypass
this obstacle, so he launched a crash development project. For a short
time his capital world's starports operated at TL16. An unrelated disaster
soon struck, crippling his technological base but not before he had a
small fleet of modular 'exploration freighters' capable of ferrying people
and equipment to Ognar, equipped with prototype 'hop' drives that could
jump 10 parsecs. They proceeded to set-up a route right over the Pirians,
who maintained their patrols with no inkling they were now obsolete.
Even once the Pirians discovered they had been simply bypassed, they
were unable to find out how for centuries after.
```

```
It would take longer for usable data on the hop drive to spread into the
Gakghang sector and further trailing, make its way across the venerable
Cheaters' Route, filter rimward sector-by-sector across the war-riven
Vargr Extents, and eventually reach the Spinward Marches.
```

```
The Steppehauler hull is a 14 meter diameter cylindrical tube with
spherical endcaps, able to land on worlds without a spaceport. From
endcap tip-to-endcap tip, it measures 152 meters. The central 138 meters
is a thin, flat spine flanked by two 500-ton hemicylindrical modules,
covered by an armored clamshell during flight, with a retractable strip
between the clamshell's halves that grant module access to space. On
the ground with the clamshell open, the upper portion opens high to let
two pop-up cranes (folded into the hull during flight) mounted fore and aft
of the modules to load and unload, while the lower portion rests on the
ground to help stabilize the ship. Using two 500-ton modules instead of
a single 1,000-ton module was done to dissuade the temptation to use
excessively-focused modules; the Khaganate has had a few occasions
to regret this choice but it has been an inconvenience at most.
```

```
The front and rear of the ship are divided into four decks; Crane,
Control (featuring the bridge and primary reactor), Spine (with the main
accessway through the middle of the ship) and Land (part of which folds
out to form the landing gear). The crew living spaces and ship supplies
are located fore; most engineering areas are aft. The accessway between
features three iris valves on either side to reach the modules and moving
walkways to speed access back and forth. Just fore and aft of this
accessway are top-to-bottom lifts (with ladders and iris valves in case of

power loss or hull breach), the top deck's worth of which double as the
dorsal airlocks and control rooms for the cranes. Primary access to the
ship is through ventral airlocks, which contain ramps that can unfold to
the ground when the ship is landed.
```

```
The default modules are unpowered cargo containers (the lack of power
does not reduce the cost of the hull, which uses extra bracing to make up
for the lack of active system integrity measures), holding raw materials
(usually ores hauled back to the Khaganate) or manufactured goods
(sometimes entire starships, disassembled for shipping). Alternate
modules include:
```

- Downport Module: A complete Class D downport. Almost Class C,
    lacking only sufficient docking space, which is constructed on site.
    Also provides basic colony services (intended to migrate to purpose-
    constructed buildings as the colony grows) and an observatory
    to further survey its system. A downport module is emplaced flat
    side down by the Steppehauler when unloaded at the destination,
    preferably near a source of water. Most of the Khaganate's land-
    grabbed colonies started with one downport module, one low berth
    module with colonists and 1,000 tons split between construction,
    mining and agricultural vehicles, prefabricated shelters, supplies
    and agricultural seed stock. Colony expansion modules, for the few
    things it was not cheaper (or possible) to manufacture locally, were
    constructed and imported the same way.
- Low Berth Module: Space being at a premium, this is the standard
    way to ship people, growing expanse colonies almost 1,000 people at
    a time. Medical facilities at each end take up to a month each to freeze
    and revive colonists on dismounted modules, while the Steppehauler
    flies freight. It is not designed to be entered or interacted with during
    flight. The module itself is unpowered just like the default module, with
    no powered doors, airlocks, internal atmosphere control or other basic
    systems. The fusion reactor only connects to the low berths.
- Carrier Module: Steppehaulers were seen as too valuable to risk
    in direct combat, but sometimes armed defence is necessary. The
    original design was to carry one of these modules, using the other
    for cargo. This module carries eight heavy fighters (see High Guard,
    pages 102-103), double-occupancy staterooms for the crew and
    enough support equipment to serve as a fighter base if dismounted
    near a source of water on a world capable of supplying spare
    parts (the intent had been to set-up modules within pipe distance
    of a downport, providing additional fuel processing and a pipeline
    for supplies while keeping ortillery strikes away from the starport).
    Unlike staterooms in the ship and torpedo module, this module's
    staterooms are double occupancy, each holding one fighter's crew.

- Torpedo Module: While Steppehaulers are normally unarmed, the
    module cradles have hardpoints for weapons mounting (seven
    for each module). Torpedoes became seen as a more practical
    alternative to fighters, firing from extreme ranges and coupled with
    planetary sensors to confirm the position of hostile ships. While the
    module has batteries, standard practice is to divert power from the
    maneuver drive and use Thrust 2 at most while firing the torpedoes,
    reserving the batteries for modest point defence.

# HOP DRIVE

```
Even with advanced technology, the jump drive has its limits. The next step
up, commonly called the 'hop' drive, is capable of much further distances.
```

```
For most purposes, a hop drive of a certain rating (such as Hop-1) acts
exactly like a jump drive of the same rating (such as Jump-1) except:
```

- The required TL17+ means it is unknown, even in theory, to most
    of Charted Space until long after 1105, although a few artifact ships
    have hop drive or similar. It is rumored that the Annic Nova has or
    once had a similarly powerful drive and that Duke Norris of Regina
    possesses another ship capable of long jumps.
- The minimum safe jumping distance is 1,000 diameters from the
    nearest gravity source, rather than 100 diameters. This makes
    powerful maneuver drives more important (a fact not realised with
    Steppehaulers until they were put to use, by which time it was too
    late to refit their engines).
- Hops cover 10 parsecs for each rating. This is a minimum, so jumping
    less than 10 parsecs takes the same fuel and time as jumping 10
    parsecs and 11-19 the same as 20. Hop-2 drives are able to jump
    merely 10 parsecs for the same fuel use and difficulty as a Hop-1,
    just as Jump-2 drives can imitate Jump-1. While a Jump-1 and a
    Hop-1 use the same amount of fuel, astrogation difficulty increases
    as if a full 10 (or if greater, rounding up to the next multiple of 10)
    parsecs were to be crossed, even for a short hop.

```
That last point means it is barely possible for talented sophonts to
astrogate a Hop-1, let alone higher. The usual response is to let the
computer do it, taking advantage of a computer's ability to run simulation
after simulation until it narrows to an optimal solution. The computation
cannot begin until the starship is in the system it wishes to jump from
and someone tells the computer where the starship will jump next (which
requires knowing the next destination, often the true practical limit unless
the ship is making freight runs along routes known in advance). Extra
bandwidth to run these simulations in parallel does not help, as failed
simulations build upon each other to lead to a successful result. Jump
control specialization (/bis) works for hop control too, providing +
Processing to run Hop Control.
```

```
The need for an astrogator does not completely disappear, as the software
must still be monitored, mostly at the start and finish of the process.
This is an Easy (4+) Astrogation (1D x 10 hours, EDU) check, with DM-
for each 10 parsecs or fraction thereof and the astrogator can do other
things during this check (the astrogator's actual time spent is 1D minutes
each at the commencement and conclusion). The high variability comes
from the simulations' randomness; sometimes the computer finds the
solution quickly; sometimes it takes a few days. A skilled astrogator can

## DEV LANDREL

```
An amateur xenoarcheologist, Landrel has long been fascinated by the
Ancients, whose star-spanning culture flourished some 300,000 years
before the rise of the Third Imperium. Landrel is the son of a wealthy
planetary official and is, himself, independently wealthy.
```

```
He spends his time following leads to possible Ancient sites and
organising private archaeological excavations under his own leadership.
```

```
Landrel is snobbish, vain and temperamental, given to impatience and
fits of explosive rage. This, coupled with his opinionated and stubborn
beliefs (even in the face of evidence to the contrary), leaves him poorly
suited to the work of archaeology. He is quite incapable of the painstaking
and exacting work found in field excavation and equally unable to master
the tact and diplomacy required in dealing with people – either fellow
archaeologists or representatives of officialdom.
```

```
Landrel's lack of patience is typified by his tendency to rush into jobs
without preparation or precaution, often on the spur of the moment and
with only the slightest excuse. He tends to feel that he, and he alone, is
competent in the field of the Ancients; all others, especially recognized
authorities in the field, he considers to be fools and dolts. He will brook no
delay in his work; he has been accused of undermining the foundations
of a 1,500 year old building – a memorial to the first colonists on Gram –
while digging for a rumored cache of Ancient artifacts that was alleged
to exist below. Instead, he discovered the wreckage of an early colonial
transport vessel, almost completely intact. The ship was of an age
such that it might have been the first colonization ship to reach Gram,
a priceless treasure. He did not bother to properly excavate or study the
ship but merely photographed enough of it to give him the basis for an
article in a popular magazine. The site was seriously damaged in his
continued search for artifacts and he is still wanted by the Sword Worlds
government for criminal destruction of public historical treasures.
```

```
Two basic urges lie at the root of Landrel's activities. First and foremost
is the desire to have his theories, which have received considerable
criticism, vindicated. Among his more controversial ideas, Landrel
refuses to accept the popular consensus that holds the Ancients to be
represented in present times by the Droyne. Landrel maintains that the
Droyne are merely the remnants of an unimportant servile race and
that the Ancients were, in fact, of a stock similar to Humaniti. He also is
convinced that he has clues to the location of the Ancients homeworld
```

- which he claims is now a free or wandering planet somewhere in the
Spinward Marches – which, if he could discover it, would once and for

all assure him the place in the annals of archaeology that he desires
above all else.
```

```
Landrel is also very much attracted to the material side of archaeological
discovery. He is known to have smuggled artifacts off planets where local
law would otherwise have limited his access to them; it is rumored that
he has engaged in out-and-out plundering of priceless storehouses of
archaeological lore merely to satisfy his own interest in antiquities. His
colleagues disdainfully refer to him as 'the Treasure Hunter' when they
mention his name at all.
```

```
The Travellers might come across Dev Landrel in any of a number of
ways. He may recruit them to act as his bodyguards during one of his
shadier exploits, such as an attempt to smuggle artifacts off-world. They
might be offered a job as escorts for an expedition he is putting together
into a wild, dangerous area where he believes Ancients artifacts to exist.
```

```
On the other hand, agents from the Sword Worlds or some other
defrauded government might approach the Travellers, asking them
to locate Landrel and bring him to justice. Personal enemies from the
scientific community may desire revenge for some slight or injury, or they
might seek to 'plant' the Travellers on one of Landrel's expeditions in
order to discredit him in some way.
```

```
There is also a chance that Landrel will simply appear as a chance
acqaintance, met aboard a starship or in a starport hotel or bar. In this
case, he might offer them jobs or the Travellers might be caught in the
middle of trouble when assailants attack Landrel. If the Travellers are
offered jobs with Landrel, there is a possibility that he will abandon them,
salaries unpaid, when he decides to move on to another excavation.
```

```
Lastly, there is a chance that Landrel will have artifacts of the Ancients
or art treasures in his possession when the Travellers encounter him;
in this case, there is a possibility that the Travellers will want to rob him
(in this case, Landrel should have a bodyguard or two to make things
interesting). It should be pointed out that the relics Landrel is usually
able to find are valuable for their artistic or historical interest rather
than being miracle gadgets of high technology. Referees should avoid
introducing gratuitous 'magical' items, as these will tend to upset the
balance of a campaign.

## STARS AND STELLAR OBJECTS

```
Travellers are often concerned exclusively with the mainworld of a system,
jumping from one starport to the next without giving much consideration
to the rest of the system. Here we start exploring the many interesting
things that can be found beyond the orbit of the mainworld and how other
bodies can affect the system.
```

```
The type of star, or stars, in a system can have a huge impact upon
conditions on the mainworld. Some star types make native life or
habitable planets impossible, although this does not rule out terraforming
or artificial environments. When detailing a star system, the Referee
should be mindful of the effects its star, or stars, will have upon the local
environment and how worlds in the system will have developed.
```

## EMPTY SYSTEMS

```
The way that Traveller designs star systems begins with a mainworld,
so by definition any system on sector maps includes at least some
planets. However, an 'empty' system can certainly exist. One way to
explain this is to say that the navigation databases show only systems
with planets, since there is no economic or political reason for visiting
a lonely star in deep space. A region of space generated using rules
that begin with star type can produce empty systems, which can have
implications for the wider universe.
```

```
The jump drive used in Traveller is extremely fuel-hungry and an empty
system may not have any suitable source of fuel. It would thus be a dead
end and deathtrap for vessels without a fuel reserve or tanker support.
An empty system in the middle of a main would be as big an obstacle as
an empty hex, which has implications for local trade and politics.
```

```
An empty system may not be completely barren; a lonely star might
have a few comets or dust clouds orbiting it. However, the vast size
of a star's neighborhood means that such bodies are unlikely to be
reachable by ships jumping into the vicinity of the star, effectively
making the system useless.
```

```
Referees may (and perhaps should) assume there are a few empty
systems within any mapped area. Most of the time these will have no
importance in the grand scheme of things and can be ignored. However,
a rogue planet captured by an otherwise lonely star might be an
interesting adventure location. Some empty systems were not always
so. A white dwarf, neutron star or black hole might have destroyed its
system, perhaps leaving a few fragments of planets or distant comets.
```

```
Whether or not the Referee chooses to place such systems on the map
is a matter of personal choice. A 'mainworld-centric' map does not really
need them unless they are the subject of an adventure but an exploration-
based game where the Travellers may not be able to detect whether the
star has planets might require many stars to be plotted and their system
only detailed when explored.
```

```
In short; traders, politicians and adventurers need to know about worlds.
Explorers need to know about stars.
```

## STAR SYSTEMS

# AND STELLAR BODIES

```
The term 'stellar body' is used here a little loosely to refer to anything with
mass on a similar scale to a star. Most stellar bodies are stars but a brown
dwarf (properly referred to as a sub-stellar body since it has much lower
mass and energy output) can fulfil the same role in some circumstances.
Likewise a black hole or similarly massive object could be orbited by a
collection of planets and other bodies in the manner of a star system.
```

```
A star system will contain one or more stellar bodies, one of which
is considered to be the main star of the system and known as the
primary. Mainworlds almost always orbit the system's primary, although
sometimes they are moons of a gas giant. If a system has more than one
star, the secondary system(s) will tend to have a much smaller number
of planets and other bodies than the primary.
```

```
In a single-star system, all major bodies orbit the primary or are moons
of a body that does. Matters are far more complex where there are two
or more stellar bodies. The presence of additional stars may make it
impossible for planets to form in some parts of the system.

# STAR CLASSIFICATION

## Stars are classified according to their energy output, size and mass. These

## factors give rise to two classifications; spectral class and luminosity. A

## combination of these two systems allows a star's characteristics to be

## presented in a form of shorthand

## A high-mass star has a greater gravitational attraction than a low-mass

## one and this is balanced against the internal forces created by processes

## ongoing within the star. One implication of this is the size of stars, as

## well as their eventual fate. Low mass stars simply burn out; higher-mass

## ones may undergo a violent contraction that can be lethal to life in nearby

## systems, possibly creating a black hole

## Spectral Class

## Stars are given a classification letter (O, B, A, F, G, K and M – Oh Boy

## An F Grade Kills Me) with a subtype of 0-9 indicating how far along the

## scale towards the next classification the star is. Thus an F5 star would be

## average for its type, while an F9 is close to being a G type

## Average star temperatures are given in Kelvin. 0 Kelvin is -273° Celsius

## and one Kelvin is equal to one degree Celsius. Mass, Radius and

## Luminosity are relative to Sol, Earth's sun, which is given a nominal

## value of one for all three. Thus an average A type star, as shown on the

## Spectral Classes table, is about three times the mass of Earth's sun and

## vastly brighter. A world orbiting at the same distance from this star as

## Earth is from Sol would receive a lot more stellar energy and will have

## quite different surface conditions

## Yerkes Luminosity Class

```
The Yerkes Luminosity Class groups stars of the same temperature
range into size classes, which gives a general indication of the star's
energy output as well as volume of space it occupies.
```

## Stellar Luminosity

```
Type Description
Ia Very Luminous Supergiants
Ib Less Luminous Supergiants
II Luminous Giants
III Giants
IV Subgiants
V Main Sequence Stars
VI Subdwarfs
VII White Dwarfs
```

```
A combination of luminosity class and spectral class is used as a
shorthand for a star's general characteristics. A type AII star would be a
bright blue giant while a type G2 V would be main-sequence yellow star.
The Referee can use this data much like the UWP codes for mainworlds,
to give a quick indication of conditions within a solar system.
```

# NEAR COMPANION STARS

```
A near companion star can be said to orbit the primary, although it might
be more accurate to say they orbit one another about a common point
defined by their relative mass. A planetary system might conceivably
include bodies that pass between loose companion stars but conditions
on such a world would be extreme and highly variable – living there
would be a real challenge, although temporary camps might be set-up
to extract minerals during the safer parts of the world's orbit. Companion
stars may both be orbited by a planetary system with the pair acting as
the collective center. This can lead to planets having complex orbits
and variable amounts of solar radiation depending on the position
of the companion star, which in turn can lead to extreme variance of
conditions making native life unlikely.
```

# DISTANT COMPANION STARS

```
A distant companion orbits at a great distance from the primary, often so
far out that it contributes relatively little stellar radiation to the main system.
Orbits may be perturbed to some degree by the companion's gravity but
on the whole a distant companion system can be treated as essentially
two separate star systems. The secondary may or may not have planets
of its own; if it does there might be multiple habitable worlds in the same
```

Mykel Alvis (Order #43737402)

## 23

```
system. It takes sufficiently long to reach worlds orbiting a far companion
that jump drives are a better alternative but the transit is possible in normal
space, enabling a distant-companion system to become a self-contained
environment where non-jump-capable craft are common.
```

# COMPLEX SYSTEMS

```
A complex system could have multiple stars all orbiting one another,
which would create very intricate orbital mechanics and potentially
difficult conditions on worlds in the system. It is possible for a very
complex system to have three or more stars orbiting one another or close
companions orbiting the primary and its distant companion(s). A system
that contains several stars all with planets would be an exciting find,
since it allows the development of a non-jump economy using resources
of several star systems. More commonly, a complex system consists of
a primary and distant companion plus additional close companion stars
and maybe very distant stellar bodies. These may be brown dwarf sub-
stellar objects or a rogue star. Such a body might be in the process of
being captured or may be passing through the star system without being
truly a part of it.
```

# MAIN SEQUENCE STARS

```
Main sequence stars make up the majority of stellar objects the
Travellers encounter. Characteristics can vary in terms of energy output
but the size and mass of these stars fall within a fairly narrow range and
conditions in their star systems are 'normal'. Earth's primary Sol is a
main sequence star.
```

Mykel Alvis (Order #43737402)

## 24

```
A main-sequence star system will be laid out in a simple manner compared
to other star types. Planets in the inner zone will receive too much stellar
energy for liquid water to exist and are thus unlikely to have life of a
sort familiar to humans. A zone exists in which the amount of energy is
about right and how far out this 'warm' or 'goldilocks' zone lies from the
star depends upon its energy output – a habitable planet orbiting a dim
red dwarf will be much closer than one orbiting a hotter star. Beyond the
warm zone is a 'cool' zone where a useful amount of energy reaches
planets located there and where exotic life is possible. Beyond this is a
much larger 'cold' zone where little stellar energy is received.
```

```
By convention, the cold zone is often referred to as the outsystem and
the cool, warm and hot zones as the inner system. This is more to do with
distances between orbits than temperatures; worlds in the inner system
orbit closer together than those in the outsystem. Thus a mining station
in the hot zone requires a relatively short transit time to the mainworld
compared to one in the far outsystem.
```

```
The situation is complicated when there are multiple stars in a system,
since worlds will receive stellar energy from more than one source.
Dim companion stars or very distant ones will not really affect the main
system, but bright or close stars may. Worlds could experience complex
metaseasonal changes, for example being a frozen wasteland when
orbiting far from the companion star but going though a warmer period
hundreds or thousands of years long when closer to the secondary.
```

Mykel Alvis (Order #43737402)

## 25

```
There are no special considerations for the Referee laying out a main-
sequence star system. If the mainworld has a breathable atmosphere,
life and/or liquid water then it needs to be in the warm zone and should
be placed first. Additional bodies such as planetoid belts, gas giants
and non-mainworlds can be placed wherever the Referee prefers,
in the inner, cool or cold zones. A mainworld that does not have a
breathable atmosphere and/or life can be placed anywhere in the
system at the Referee's preference.
```

```
Main-sequence stars are indicated by the code V after their luminosity
class. Thus a G5 V star lies roughly in the middle of the temperature
range for type G (white to yellow) stars and is a main-sequence star
of average mass.
```

# SUBGIANT AND GIANT STARS

```
Giant stars do not start as giants. They expand in the later parts of their
life cycle, passing through a subgiant phase and becoming giants before
eventually undergoing collapse. This means that a star that has formed a
planetary system will destroy at least part of it, swelling up to engulf inner
planets. The process takes millions of years but far longer is required
for a world to develop native life. Thus the life-bearing inner planets of
a giant star system will be gone and worlds of the outsystem will be
warmer than they had previously been but will not have time to develop
life. Any that exists must be imported during the warm phase.
```

```
The subgiant and giant phases last so long that in terms of civilization
they might as well be permanent. However, a very old giant star might be
beginning to collapse, which will make the region unhealthy for anyone
living in the system. Radiation flares, mass ejections and even nova
events are all possible, making it a place only scientists or prospectors
will want to visit.
```

```
Subgiant stars are indicated by type IV and giants by type III. Thus an
M5 III star is a red giant – huge but not especially hot – whilst a K5 IV is
an orange subgiant; hotter and still undergoing expansion. Such a star
might be in the process of destroying its planetary system or, if it is just
beginning to expand, conditions on its planets will be changing as the
amount of energy received increases.
```

```
Bigger and brighter stars – class II and I – are very rare. They are extremely
bright and can serve as navigational reference points for ships hundreds
of parsecs away. These stars burn through their fuel fast and meet a
violent fate as a supernova. The process takes millions of years but the
end can be catastrophic for life in the local region as radiation from the
dying star reaches them. Gigantic stars of this sort are unlikely to have
useable planets but there is always a chance they might have captured a
rogue or possess a few bodies surviving from their far outsystem.
```

Mykel Alvis (Order #43737402)

### 26

## SUBDWARF AND

# WHITE DWARF STARS

```
'Cool' subdwarf stars are similar to a main-sequence star of the same
class but are smaller and hotter due to their composition. 'Hot' subdwarf
stars are sometimes formed as a giant star begins its collapse or as a
result of interactions in a multiple star system. Hot subdwarfs are highly
unlikely to have habitable planets orbiting them. Both are indicated by
stellar type VI.
```

```
A white dwarf is the remnant of an old star that expanded through the
giant stage then collapsed again. Such a star will not have habitable
planets but may retain outsystem bodies. Any planets closer to the
star will have been destroyed in the giant phase. White dwarf stars are
indicated by stellar type VII.
```

## BROWN DWARF

# SUB-STELLAR OBJECTS

```
A brown dwarf is not really a stellar object, being more properly considered
a 'failed star'. It is essentially a body possessing far greater mass than a
gas giant but not enough to begin stellar fusion and become a star. A brown
dwarf gives out sufficient energy to warm any moons it may have and
could serve as the underpowered primary of a planetary system. Brown
dwarf bodies are hard to detect due to their lower energy output compared
to stars and may exist as companions to 'proper' stars – possibly in a very
distant orbit – or as independent brown dwarf systems in deep space. A
brown dwarf system can be used by the Referee to place an adventure
location wherever desired, without altering existing starmaps.

## THE IRKLAN

The Irklan are not an alien race, nor even a distinct human culture.
Instead, they a human religious sect from the desert highlands of Menorb
in the Spinward Marches (Regina 0203, C-652998-7). This sect is of
special interest because of their high stress on personal survival and
individual prowess in hand-to-hand combat. The ascetic subculture of
the Irklan is a rigorous training ground for body and mind, and members
enjoy an awesome reputation throughout the Regina subsector and
beyond as masters of stealth, unarmed combat and rigorous control of
their bodies and minds.

The powers at the command of the Irklan are somewhat exaggerated
by outsiders (which is encouraged by the sect); certain superstitious
natives of Menorb believe them to be sorcerers or mystics, while the
more sophisticated claim them to be psionic heretics. For this reason
they are often shunned, sometimes attacked without reason and always
feared. In actual fact, the Irklan are not so awesomely powerful as
popular superstition makes out, although their philosophy and lifestyle
grant them considerable talents.

## HISTORY

The origins of the Irklan are obscure. It is believed the sect dates back
to the earliest days of the colony, several hundred years ago. Menorb,
a poor world with little water and harsh conditions, presented a rugged
challenge to the first colonists and a traditional punishment for wrongdoers
was expulsion into the upland deserts, a hostile environment similar to
the Mojave Desert on Terra.

Few criminals survived expulsion and some who did seem to have
formed a group that became the nucleus of the Irklan. The derivation of
their name is not certain but Iraklion means 'band of brothers' in one of
the early dialects of Rhylanor, from which many settlers of Menorb had
their origins. This is the suspected root of the name.

In any event, the Irklan survived. Originally a simple nomadic subculture,
members of the Irklan gradually elevated the collected teachings of
survival in their harsh environment into a complex religion, one in which
personal survival was the highest proof of fitness.

The sect was forced to do so without the benefits of technology and
developed a dislike for such, believing too much use of technology
made one soft and incapable. Cut off from advanced weaponry, they
learned martial arts disciplines and the manufacture and use of primitive
weapons, such as bolos and blowguns. They also learned the techniques
of stealth and many aspects of basic survival.

As the settlement on Menorb grew, the Irklan tended to resist reintegration
into civilization and gradually withdrew into the depths of the harshest
highland deserts. This region was formally made a reservation for the
Irklan people by the government almost 250 years ago. However, the
reserve cannot hold all of their number and some members of the Irklan
leave their desert fastness to venture to other worlds, usually as part
of a personal religious quest in search of ever harder tests of personal
survival abilities. Those who leave Menorb tend to be the best of their
people (in terms of skills) and this has helped preserve the tradition that
the Irklan are inhumanly or even supernaturally powerful.

### BELIEFS

Irklan religious beliefs dominate their lives. They believe that all of life is a
great struggle, a test of worthiness. Those who survive are fit for a better
life in the next world, while those who fail lose all chance for the next life,
their souls perishing at death along with their bodies. The object of every
member of the sect is to live a long and glorious life, filled with triumphs
over every possible challenge both environmental and social. In the end,
however, they would rather die of natural causes than in combat, for
despite their deeds through life earning them merit, the idea of failing any
test of strength is repellent, implying unsuitability to survive.

There are a number of subsects in the Irklan religion, some holding that
even death by natural causes is a failure and that only a glorious career
capped by ritual suicide is the way to reach the afterlife. Other groups
are somewhat less rigid in their beliefs. The Irklan religion has nothing
of personal morality in its teachings. Because it stresses survival above
all else, the religion does not attempt to codify behaviour; anything that
helps a person survive is good, while those that shorten life are bad.
There are a complex set of taboos and rituals associated with some
subsects (some have commented that each individual Irklan is a subsect
all of their own) but some general rules can be applied to almost all
because of the relation to survival.

Thus, alcohol and narcotics of all kinds are forbidden, because of their
deleterious effect on the body. There are also complicated dietary
regulations, to assure an individual eats only those items that promote
good health and maximum fitness. Most members of the Irklan are
ascetic in the extreme, scorning money, power, technology and all the
other traditional goals of other societies in favor of concentrating on the
acquisition of merit by seeking out and overcoming challenges.

In the absence of a code of religious morality, the personal morality of
each individual is the only check on antisocial behaviour. Cooperation
is seen by some as a pro-survival trait, by others as a weakness. Thus,
some members of the Irklan lead a lone wolf existence, caring about
no one but themselves; others realise that the good of the whole is as

30

```
important as the good of an individual. The Irklan are generally distrustful
of outsiders but can be won over by a demonstration of individual prowess
or some other feat that indicates a suitability for survival.
```

### IRKLAN TRAVELLERS

```
The Irklan are a harsh and pitiless society, concerned with their own
ways and little more. Wandering Irklansa may occasionally be found,
working in risky and challenging occupations. Occasionally, they will
undertake an assassination, not so much for the money (although
most wandering Irklansa realise they
need money to survive in
Imperial society) but for
the challenge it presents
them. Irklansa killers
are not the sort who use
a sniper rifle from several
hundred meters. A challenge
requires that their victim
be confronted directly and
given a chance to resist in
hand-to-hand combat.
```

```
31
```

This means that when killing for hire, they will not strike from behind
or from ambush no matter how much the client wants them to. When
on the defensive, however, they will show no such scruples. A hunted
Irklansa will use every trick and trap in their extensive arsenal in order to
escape death. This characteristic makes them extremely dangerous to
police and security forces, and is the reason why the Irklan are careful to
conceal their affiliation from government officials.

Irklan tend to dress in dark colours, favoring black or dark shades of
green, blue and grey that disappear into the shadows. They will adopt
local dress when it suits their purposes but not compromise their ability to
fight or move freely with tight or over-fussy clothing, or needless frippery.
They prefer not to be in direct sunlight; as a desert people they have an
instinctive caution about the effects of being exposed to harsh sunlight.

Irklan favor personal weapons such as knives and blowguns, often
carrying several concealed blades. They have little use for (and openly
scorn) technological aids, which includes firearms and advanced
weaponry. Overall, they tend to be rather grim and may even appear
self-destructive, seeking out the hard way to complete a task or refusing
to take shelter from bad weather just for the sake of the challenge. For
their part, Irklan are openly contemptuous of those who live soft lives
coddled by technology and are unlikely to consider them anything more
than a potential liability.

##### Characteristics

Irklan Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their
characteristics: STR+1, DEX+1, END +1, EDU-2, SOC-

##### Traits

Irklan Travellers all possess the following traits.

Age Resistance: Irklan are supremely fit and receive DM+1 to all
rolls on the Aging table.

Control: This is an unusual trait, equivalent to the psionic talent of
Awareness. All Irklan have the equivalent of a PSI characteristic (but
only for this purpose) equal to their END and the Awareness skill at level

0. This trait is not be considered the same as psionic training.

##### Careers

The only career open to an Irklan is Drifter. Those who remain on their
homeworld must be Barbarians; those who interact with interstellar
society can choose to be Wanderers instead.

Any award of the Jack-of-all-Trades skill can be taken as Awareness
instead. Seafarer must be taken as Survival.

## SUBSIDISED MERCHANTS

```
The tramp trader starship is a staple of Traveller lore. A beaten up but
reliable old free trader plies the jump-1 mains seeking fortune and
adventure, buying low and selling high, taking on passengers and
picking up odd jobs along the way. The open-endedness of the tramp
trader campaign has broad appeal but there is an intriguing alternative to
the free trader that deserves its due; the subsidized merchant. Running
a subsidized merchant campaign is similar to the tramp trader trope with
some distinct differences and unique flavor.

The 400-ton Type-R subsidized merchant, affectionately known as a 'fat
trader' or 'subby', has a cavernous 201-ton hold, consuming just a bit
over half of the ship's displacement. The hold is two and a half times
that of a Beowulf-class free trader, enough to make a thrifty freelance
merchant salivate at the potential profits that could be made. However,
bigger ship means bigger expenses, putting the Type-R out of reach
for most Travellers. For this reason, subsidized merchants are rarely
sold to independent traders. Instead, they are typically purchased by
governments or corporations who then hire a qualified crew to operate
them and the two parties share the profits.
```

```
33
```

Subsidized merchants were created to fill the gaps not addressed by
megacorporate bulk freighters and independent free traders. Large
freight lines tend to travel the main routes and free traders chase the
biggest profits wherever they may be. Whilst these practices serve the
majority of the population, they leave a significant minority underserved
or even completely bereft of interstellar commerce. Subsidized routes
fill that void.

The standard subsidized merchant contract includes the following
provisions.

```
•  The ship is managed by a subsidy agency and wholly owned by
a third party, usually a conglomerate of planetary governments
or a corporation. If the ship has a mortgage, it is paid by the
owner. The subsidy agency is often a blind trust that operates as
an intermediary between the owners and crew.
•  The Travellers pay all maintenance, life support, crew expenses
and berthing costs incurred by the ship.
•  The ship is required to travel a specified route or operate in a
designated region 70% of the time. For the remaining 30% of the
time, the crew may use the ship as they wish and in the region
of their choice. However, they must have the ship back on its
subsidized route before their time is up.
•  The owner receives 50% of all revenue, payable at any Class A,
B, C or D starport.
```

The crew of a subsidized merchant typically have shares in the enterprise.
For example, a ship's captain might have five shares, the pilot three and
the engineer two with nominal or no shares given to other members of
the crew. The crew constitutes a board of directors who make decisions
regarding the use of the crew's portion of the revenues.

An operating fund is maintained to cover expected costs. Any
surpluses that remain after operating expenses are paid may be given
as dividends to shareholders or used for other purchases that are
approved by the board.

Some crews also maintain a 'shadow fund', which is kept separate from
the operating fund and may be used for such things as purchasing cargo
space on their own ship for the purpose of transporting speculative
cargo. Such cargo falls outside the realm of their contract and therefore
presents an opportunity for the crew to generate additional income not
shared with the owner. Subsidy agencies often frown upon this practice
but auditors rarely get involved unless the crew starts buying up large
lots on an ongoing basis.

The worlds visited by a subsidized merchant are usually underserved or
off the beaten path. Most worlds will be within one parsec of each other
to best utilise the ship's jump-1 capability. When necessary, two-parsec

34

```
gaps may be crossed by Type-R ships by using collapsible fuel tanks or
drop tanks to facilitate two consecutive single-parsec jumps.
```

```
Conditions for trade vary greatly. If they were ideal, no subsidy would be
required and the desired traffic would already be present. On the other
hand, when a conglomerate or corporation is willing to spend capital on
an expensive trading ship, the potential to acquire wealth is usually there.
It merely has not been properly exploited yet, or so goes the thinking.
```

```
Subsidized routes are sometimes purchased by outside parties. For
example, should a freight line see potential in a subsidized route, they
might attempt to buy the route from the current owners. The more
profitable the route, the more likely this is to happen.
```

```
The standard arrangement has the crew plying the subsidized route
70% of the time, which comes to approximately 37 weeks out of each
year. This leaves the crew only 15 weeks of independent operation per
year. Crews may optionally amass credit with the subsidy agency by
extending their subsidized tour. For example, in a given year, should the
crew extend their tour from 37 to 50 weeks, they will build up 13 weeks
of credit that they may add to their independent tour. In this scenario,
the crew would have 28 weeks to operate the ship independently,
giving them ample time to travel to a desired destination or region,
engage in trade and then return to their subsidized route. Crews have
been known to work long years of service to build up equity for a long
independent tour. Most subsidy agencies put a cap of 80 weeks on the
amount of independent operation time that can be earned but some
have no cap at all.
```

### THE BLOODSHOT CLUSTER

```
The Trin's Veil subsector of the Spinward Marches is a prime location
for subsidized routes. The subsector is completely removed from the
Spinward Main, the vast jump-1 route that blankets much of the sector.
However, the capital at Trin is the nexus of several small jump-1 clusters.
One of these is the Bloodshot Cluster just to spinward of Trin. The cluster
is named after the two smouldering red giants at Murchison and Raydrad
that hang over the region like a pair of red eyes.
```

```
The cluster features 11 worlds all within one parsec of each other.
The Viscount of Edenelt enlisted the Lord of Hammermium and the
Commandant of Katarulu to invest in a number of subsidized merchants
to operate in the region; the trio would very much like to help develop
the economies of their less well-to-do neighbors. In return for natural
resources, foodstuffs and common goods, they hope to gradually
increase the Tech Levels and wealth of other systems in the cluster.

### USING SHIP SHARES

If the conglomerate or corporation that owns the ship permits it, the
Travellers can obtain more favorable terms in their contract by trading
in Ship Shares. In such cases, Travellers may spend Ship Shares to
purchase a higher degree of route and revenue control.

Route Control purchases provide additional weeks with which the
Travellers may operate a subsidized merchant independently per year.
For example, if the Travellers purchase 10 weeks of Route Control, the
owner of the ship has 10 fewer weeks per year during which they dictate
which systems are visited. This gives the Travellers considerably more
freedom to travel outside the boundaries specified in the contract.

Revenue Control gives the Travellers additional percentage points of
the trade revenue earned by the ship. Revenue Control purchases are
on a sliding scale that becomes gradually more lucrative the more Ship
Shares the Travellers invest. For example, the standard contract gives
the owner 50% of all revenue year-round. If the Travellers spend 10 Ship
Shares on Revenue Control, they gain 5% more of the revenue. This
means that the owner receives only 45% of the total revenue and the
Travellers' share increases to 55%.

Ship Shares

```
Ship Shares Route Control Revenue Control
5 5 weeks +2%
10 10 weeks +5%
15 15 weeks +12%
20 20 weeks +20%
```

Ship Share purchases are always negotiated in increments of five and
non-refundable so the Travellers must exercise caution. Spending them
on route and revenue control should only be done if they intend to make
a long-term commitment.

Shrewd Travellers have been known to parlay Ship Shares into great
riches over time. Some have even spent those riches to buy their subby
from its owner after several years of service.

### CREAM OF THE CROP

Obtaining crew positions on a subsidized merchant is highly competitive.
Travellers are heavily vetted before they are even considered to crew
such a ship. No subsidy agency is going to take a risk on a Traveller with
a criminal history of any type. Travellers who have spent any time in the
Rogue or Prison careers have no chance to be hired unless clean records
have been properly forged and their pasts adequately obfuscated.
Furthermore, any Mishaps incurred during Traveller generation that
resulted in termination from a career will be investigated by the agency.
If a Traveller exited a career due to a Mishap, any Traveller can make an
Average (8+) Admin check (INT or SOC, 1D days) to clear the offending
Traveller's name so the hiring process can move forward.

In addition, at least one Traveller in a prospective crew must have
served in one of the three Merchant careers and achieved a Rank of
3 or higher. Subsidy agencies want experienced and reliable crews
led by qualified traders.

38

##### SUBSIDISED

### MERCHANT CAMPAIGNS

```
Campaigns based on the travels of a subsidized merchant are very much
like tramp trader campaigns. The Travellers fly their starship from world
to world, conducting trade and attempting to make a tidy profit. However,
a free trader is just that – free. The Travellers own all or a portion of the
ship and are free to make their own decisions regarding where they go,
who they take as passengers and what cargo they speculate upon.
```

```
Making a profit is of tantamount importance to the subsidized merchant
captain as well but there is another goal that is equally important –
establishing relationships. The more a subby crew gets to know its
stomping grounds, the more successful they become. Subsidized
merchants operate in regions ripe for economic development.
Conditions for trade are often less than ideal and the Travellers' choices
are narrowed to a specific set of worlds. Making a profit under these
conditions can be a challenge but subby captains have a saying: 'It's all
about knowing the game.'
```

```
On a free trader, you might keep on moving and never look back,
trading as you embark upon a grand tour of a sector and beyond. On
a subsidized merchant, the Travellers spend the majority of their time
making the rounds and getting to know the worlds and people of a region
until they become intimately familiar. The denizens of the starport bar on
Zyra know the entire crew by name. The scouts at the base on Conway
are excited to see the crew again and fill them in on all the rumors
going around. When they return to Edenelt, the marquis himself greets
the Travellers and wants to know how 'our little project' is going.
```

```
The subsidized merchant campaign is very much about treading over
familiar ground and being an agent of change in a little corner of the
sector. This type of campaign also has a built-in device to mix things up
and change the pace; independent tours. After their obligations to the
owner are met, the Travellers get to branch out to new regions of their
own choice, plying the mains or delving into uncharted territory.

## TRAMP TRADER

The tramp trader campaign is one of the lynchpins of Traveller. One of
your Travellers receives a free trader while mustering out and the others
pitch in their hard-earned Ship Shares gleaned from previous careers.
Lo and behold, they have a ship... but one with a six-figure monthly
mortgage. Once they factor in crew salaries, life support costs, monthly
and annual maintenance, and occasional battle damage, they might start
to wonder if ownership was really such a good idea.

Take heart, weary Travellers! Your ship's most important assets are
the cavernous space on the lower deck, where all manner of valuable
goods may be stored, and the empty staterooms on its upper deck. Both
promise to deliver wealth and prosperity beyond your wildest dreams.

Choosing the right trade route and employing a broker who is adept at
buying low and selling high can earn you all you need to pay off the
ship and earn a tidy sum for your Travellers to start buying all the high-
tech goodies they want. An enterprising Referee can use the Trade,
Spacecraft Operation and Space Combat chapters of the Traveller
Core Rulebook to put his Travellers into all sorts of interesting and fun
situations. Here are a few ideas to spice up your tramp trader campaign,
adding a few wrinkles that will both challenge your Travellers and add fun
to your gaming sessions.

## TAKING ON PASSENGERS

One of the best ways to earn Credits and add to the fun of a tramp
trader campaign is to put those staterooms to use. The Travellers should
note they must pay the life support costs for each and every stateroom
whether or not they are occupied, so should feel compelled to fill them
whenever they can.

Passenger care requires a trained steward, so hopefully at least one
Traveller has this very important skill. Steward is more than just cooking
and cleaning up after unruly passengers; it is a discipline and knowledge
of protocols and behaviours that one must exhibit to convey passengers
between the stars in comfort and luxury. Stewards have a unique array
of social and diplomatic skills that enable them to make the cramped
conditions of a starship feel like a comfortable home away from home.

The steward must provide varying degrees of service for each level of
passage. Attending Middle Passage passengers is a routine affair. Such
passengers are largely expected to take care of themselves with a single

40

```
level of Steward skill required to attend up to 100 passengers. High
Passengers require a much higher degree of service with a great deal
more care given to cuisine, entertainment and comfort during a jump.
Referees may portray High Passengers as difficult and demanding from
time-to-time. Most human societies are class-based on some level and
people like to enjoy the benefits of higher status. As a rule of thumb, the
more obvious differences there are in the levels of passage aboard a
ship, the easier the steward's job will be. For example, if the meals given
to Middle and High Passengers are identical, complaints are likely to be
more common from the upper tier of passengers. The more obvious the
distinctions between each level of passage, and therefore the greater
status enhancement, the less likely there are to be issues.
```

```
Referees should make use of the Exciting Passengers table on page
209 of the Traveller Core Rulebook to add spice to the cavalcade of
passengers who grace the hallways and commons of their ship but only
in moderation. If every batch of passengers contains a Zhodani spy,
eccentric noble or stowaway, the Travellers will quickly see passengers
as more of a liability than source of income. Passengers do not need to
be excessively 'exciting' to be interesting additions to your game.
```

```
41
```

Here are just a few ways to make your passengers interesting without
requiring them to be eccentric or disruptive:

- Ship Tours: One or more of the passengers requests a tour of the
    ship. Showing off the engine room, turrets, bridge or even cargo hold
    can provide an interesting aside. Have the more inquisitive among
    them ask lots of newbie questions. The event will test the Travellers'
    knowledge of their ship and make them feel more ownership over it.
- Card Games: Got a Traveller with the Gambler skill? What better
    way to bilk your passengers of more Credits than to hustle them in
    a game of cards. Beware, however, as this may limit good word of
    mouth and repeat passengers. 'I took Mid Passage aboard that ship
    once. The astrogator cleaned me out in a game of Gaashkhamla.'
- The Jump Space Monologues: Put that Art (performer, holography
    or instrument) skill to work! Jumps take a week and there is a lot
    of idle time for passengers. Entertain them with a combination of
    your Travellers' dramatic skills combined with the technology of
    the ship. Holographic controls and an Intellect program can go a
    long way to produce an entertaining experience for the passengers
    and Referee alike. Depending on the Effect of the Art check, a
    performance might even garner repeat passengers or a positive
    DM on the next passenger hunt due to word of mouth.
- The Galley: Food preparation and consumption can provide the
    impetus for many an adventure. The Travellers may have the
    opportunity to rent out an entire suite of staterooms to a group of
    high passengers who also happen to be foodies, visitors to the planet
    the Travellers are currently on and seek passage back home. They
    have heard of a local delicacy and will pay a premium to consume a
    fine meal that features this rare food. Put that Steward skill to work.
    Keep in mind that the desired food may require being slaughtered
    just before preparation, is very difficult or expensive to obtain, or
    even gets loose on the ship!

### LOW-TRAFFIC SYSTEMS

Travellers quickly learn to play by – and exploit – the rules. Many Referees
allow Travellers to run the Trade rules independently as the Traveller
Core Rulebook suggests, so they soon learn that high-population, high-
grade starport systems are the places where they can make the most
cash. Looking at the trade codes of each world gives them an inkling of
what goods they should buy (if available) and where they should go to
sell them. Whilst making tons of Credits is appealing to all Travellers, if
things become too routine it can take something from your campaign.

When Travellers are interacting with starport brokers, meeting fellow
spacers at the starport bar or chatting with potential patrons, insert
rumors and red herrings that guide them to less travelled worlds on the
trade route. While running the spinward end of the Collace Main, they
might discover the low-population, Class D starport world of Inchin has
a sudden need for advanced machine parts and biochemicals. Rumor

42

```
has it some prospectors have found previously undiscovered lanthanum
nodes in the desert world's outback and need gear to support a lengthy
expedition. But hurry! The Travellers will not be the only ones to learn this
rumor and they might have to race to the site to get the DM+4 on sale
price that is there for the taking.
```

```
Not every tip should lead to riches. Some are lies and misinformation.
Even when there is no pot of gold awaiting the Travellers in whichever
off-the-beaten-path system they find themselves, there will always be
opportunities present. Red herrings and false rumors can be a handy
tool for a Referee to get his Travellers to the site of an adventure.
```

```
Referees should take a moment to consider each and every star
system's UWP to consider what might be going on there. Low-population,
low-grade starports and low-tech worlds have the potential to be as
interesting as a highfalutin trade hub, if not more so. Opportunities for
trade should abound along the mains but they should not be limited to
the well-travelled trade magnets. Where there is risk, there should also
be reward. Which brings us to our next topic...
```

### THE COMPETITION

```
A truly great tramp trader campaign can be given a 6-G rocket boost if it
has great NPCs. The Travellers should have a tight relationship with their
favorite starport bartender, startown informers and speculative cargo
```

```
43
```

brokers. Such characters become part of the 'astrography' of the game.
The Travellers will be excited to get back to Tarsus where their good
friend the Planetary Tourism Advisor awaits them with a cold brew and
fresh rumors about developments along the main. Conversely... there
is the dreaded competition!

Trade is a highly competitive business and Travellers are far from the
only merchants running freight and cargo along the mains. The Referee
may generate, with as much detail as desired, several crews of traders
with whom the Travellers compete. The possibilities are endless but here
are just a few ideas for starters:

- A crew who runs almost the exact type of ship the Travellers do
    but have been earning a great deal more. What is their secret? Are
    their contacts better? Have they signed some kind of lucrative and
    exclusive contract with one of the megacorporations? Do they have
    some kind of genius AI robot broker? Are they smuggling illegal
    goods? Aspiring merchant princes will not rest until they know how
    they are being outperformed.
- Old friends from another crew have 'graduated to the big time', moving
    up from a free trader to a subsidized merchant. The Travellers look on
    with jealousy at that 201-ton cargo hold and the potential for wealth
    it portends, encouraging them to seek out a similar arrangement.
    Meanwhile, they find out just how tough it is to move up to the next
    level, that their old friends are always stressed out, on the verge of
    bankruptcy and beholden to investors. Furthermore, they no longer
    get to choose all their own stops. Investors require them to call on
    certain worlds they may have skipped when independent. Have the
    Travellers feel a sting as their old chums eat into profits by swiping
    large lots of freight or speculative cargo out from under them but
    also convey that it comes with a cost. Running a 'subby' means you
    become a company agent on some level.
- The Travellers discover that one of their trade nemeses is also an
    opportunistic pirate, using a double pulse laser turret to terrorise and
    steal from fellow traders. It could be that they are commerce raiders for
    one faction or another, have fallen on hard times and taken desperate
    steps to keep the Credits flowing, or maybe are just wicked and enjoy
    stealing from merchant brethren. Whatever the reason, they now pose
    a double threat; competition for trade goods and the possibility that
    they will attempt to steal from the Travellers. The pirates' actions are
    also causing a general distrust of tramp trader crews in the region, so
    it behoves the Travellers to set things straight... one way or another!

The Referee may optionally employ various crew skills to get a jump on
the competition. Good Broker skills are not the only ones in play. A hot
rumor might have the trader community racing to a given world where
robotics and radioactives have suddenly become a hot commodity.
Opposed task checks between competing traders might determine
who gets to the site first. Whose ship has the most thrust to get to the

44

```
100-diameter limit first? Or will they risk the 10-diameter limit? Is there
time to make a hasty jump to the next system? Use the Going Faster or
Slower rules on page 60 of the Traveller Core Rulebook as the astrogator
and engineer work quickly to give their team a competitive edge. Even
after making every effort possible, the race to the site might result in
a tie, pitting the Travellers directly against their competition. Have the
ships' brokers make opposed checks to obtain the precious cargo. The
Travellers should be encouraged to come up with inventive or devious
task chains to get the jump on the competition. The tramp trader campaign
is a dog-eat-dog world and having Travellers compete for success will
add richness and flavor to the game whether they win or lose.
```

```
Any number of factors can be put into play that serve to enhance both
competition and cooperation between the various traders. NPC trader
ships will take on a personality all their own; some will become enemies
and some friends. Perhaps the Travellers work together with a friendly ship
to transport a large block of freight that otherwise would have required a
bigger ship... perhaps only to have those self-same NPCs compete with
or betray the Travellers on another job. Events like these establish a level
of camaraderie and sometimes enmity that enhances the communal feel
of the Travellers' chosen trade route or stellar main. They add colour and
depth to the dots, lines and UWP codes on the starmap.

## ICE CRAWLER

(Palarthropodia gelidus)

When researchers first encountered the ice crawler on the frozen plains
of Furioso (Alderamin 0717, Solomani Rim), they were at first unsure
whether they had discovered a new and extremely alien form of life or an
incredibly sophisticated example of unknown alien technology. The ice
crawler is in fact a life form but one unlike the typical animals encountered
on orthodox worlds.

Furioso is a giant, frozen world with an insidious atmosphere consisting
largely of hydrogen but with significant amounts of methane and
ammonia present as well. Life in this strange environment is bizarre by
human standards and the ice crawler is a good example of Furioso's
unique biology.

Ice crawlers have flat, low-slung bodies, reminiscent of a Terrestrial
caterpillar in shape, measuring some three meters in length and
suspended between five pairs of jointed, exoskeletal legs. An eleventh
'leg' extends behind the creature; each leg ends in a polydactyl foot
padded with microscopic grippers that ensure firm footing on any surface

- even glass-smooth ice.

Four modified legs ring the creature's anterior end (there is no head
as such) and act as shovels, scrapers and rock lifters, throwing rocks
into a ventral 'hopper' ringed by muscular rock crushing 'teeth'. The
creatures are sheathed in a glittering, steel-hard exo skeletal armor; this
gives them the almost artificial appearance that so confused the first
observers. However, spongy organs are present all along each side of
the creature, just above the leg body joints. These organs, ranging in
colour from brown to dull orange to bright red, are the analogues to lungs
for the ice crawler; which 'breathes' hydrogen. No muscular action is
involved in this process; hydrogen is diffused through the spongy tissue
and sequestered and collected chemically within the creature's body.

The ice crawler metabolises rock. They have a dual poly-chain silicon-
carbon biochemistry, using silicon in some biochemical reactions and
carbon in others. Carbon comes from the breakdown of the methane
present in the atmosphere, while silicon is liberated by heating and
reduction reactions from ingested rock. In this environment, the silicon
breakdown process is very dangerous, for when silicon is broken from
rock, it liberates oxygen, which is poisonous to the ice crawler and
produces a potentially flammable mixture in a hydrogen atmosphere. For
the most part, ice crawlers immediately combine this liberated oxygen

46

```
with atmospheric hydrogen in special organic reaction chambers within
the body. The exothermic reaction, although apparently not essential to
their body chemistries, acts as a sort of organic 'supercharger'. As the
animal is, at best, sluggish and slow-moving, this process brings about
unexpected results. This reaction serves as a chemical 'pick-me-up' (as
one observer put it) that can send the usually torpid animal thundering
across the ice in random directions at unexpectedly great speeds (swap
the Slow Metabolism (-3) trait for Fast Metabolism (+2) and increase
Speed to 8 meters). Over the ages, however, some species developed
an even more unique method of using oxygen liberated during the
breakdown of silicon from ingested rock. These creatures can store
oxygen in nearly pure form. When threatened or frightened, they can
direct jets of oxygen and hydrogen through an anterior orifice located
between their handling legs. This stream of hydrogen and oxygen is
ignited catalytically, turning the beast into a living flamethrower. The
effect has been reported to cause serious damage to the protective suits
of scientists studying the animals.
```

```
This most interesting defence mechanism was developed as a protection
against another of Furioso's life forms, the meter-long predatory
carnivores known popularly as ice spiders. These vicious pack-hunting
carnivores are virtually identical in body chemistry but metabolise other
life forms, rather than rocks, for supplies of carbon, oxygen and silicon.
```

```
Both creatures will ingest humans (and anything else slow enough to get
in their way) and are considered quite hazardous. At this time, nothing
is known of their life cycles, since researchers cannot study them for
prolonged periods of time in Furioso's insidious atmosphere. There have
been growing speculations, however, that the ice spider may actually
possess a form of rudimentary intelligence, a possibility that has intrigued
many xenosophontological investigators in recent years and inspired
several expeditions to the icy wastes of Furioso.

### SAQ'SE'QAN

```
The saq'se'qan is an extremely intelligent alien parasite that feeds on
the mental waves generated by ill will and aggression. While unable to
verbally communicate with members of other species, it has significant
psionic powers that enable it to manipulate its victims into hatred and
strife. Nothing brings the saq'se'qan more joy and substance than a
domestic murder-suicide.
```

```
An adult saq'se'qan resembles a fat and grumpy purple hyrax whose
mood swings tend to be more comical than intimidating. This amusing
appearance combined with the creature's high intelligence, apparent
fondness of children and longevity can lead the uninformed buyer to
consider it the perfect pet – a mistake that will cost at the very least
marital happiness and possibly the lives of the entire family.
```

```
A healthy saq'se'qan can fetch a price of up to Cr2000 from a client who
is unaware of the creature's sinister nature and up to Cr10000 from a
client who is aware of it and intends to use it for unwholesome purposes.

### KHAL'OMAN

The khal'oman is a bizarre creature that can cause dreams to manifest
by gently touching a sleeping creature. In the wild, khal'omans prey on
the dreams they summon, which makes them popular pets for people
who suffer from night terrors and insomnia.

The latest rage, however, is to immobilise khal'omans in such a way that
will enable them to create dreams but not to devour them. The results
are phantasmagorical parties where dreams and reality intermingle to
create an experience survivors will never forget. These parties are not
only illegal due to their frequent fatalities and mental traumas but also a
common target for animal rights groups' raids because of the stress and
pain it inflicts on the captured khal'oman. This has led most governments
to ban khal'oman import for non-medical purposes.

An adult khal'oman looks like a melon-sized jumble of colourful and
luminescent strings that pulsate with ever-changing ghostly lights. Some
strings hang loosely from the creature's body; their touch will end dreams
but is quite harmless to real creatures.

It is unknown where or how these creatures multiply and all attempts to
cause them to reproduce outside their native planet have failed.

A healthy khal'oman can fetch a price of up to Cr10000.

## CRITICAL VECTOR

```
The Brufort system (Deneb 0368, C669642-6) is off the beaten path.
It is a rich world, flush with natural resources but its location far from
the sector's trade routes has isolated it from the majority of interstellar
traffic. The best it can hope for is the occasional visit by a wandering
free trader or the punctual arrival of a bulk freighter on the tail end of its
route. Nevertheless, the Travellers find themselves jumping to Brufort
on a tip that it is a hot market for mid-tech common manufactured goods
(computer systems) and construction polymers.
```

```
As they emerge from jump, the Travellers are probably eager to find a
broker and make the sale but when they attempt to establish contact with
the downport they are surprised to discover that Brufort is experiencing
planet-wide panic.
```

```
Almost a week ago Brufort's Spacewatch satellite array detected a 50
kilometers wide asteroid coming into the system from high out of the
ecliptic on a collision course with the mainworld. Initial calculations had
the enormous bolide making impact within 10 days. An impact from
a body of its size would cause titanic tsunamis, firestorms, an impact
winter and the death of every last person on the planet.
```

```
President Emyla Gharja hastily dispatched the system's two aging
corvettes to tackle the problem. The crews of the corvettes took a great
deal of explosives with them, intending to redirect the asteroid using
strategically placed detonations. Radio transmissions indicated the
corvettes had matched vectors with the asteroid when contact with the
ships was suddenly lost and both disappeared in a massive fireball that
was seen from the surface of the planet.
```

```
In an extreme stroke of bad luck there were no other ships in the
system who could help. Five days later, the Travellers' ship has arrived
in system. Its detection by Spacewatch has been quickly relayed to
the planetary government and leaked to the press. The desperate
populace see the Travellers as their last hope for survival. After a brief
conversation with starport control the Travellers are contacted by none
other than President Gharja who begs them to act on Brufort's behalf.
She informs them that if they are able to somehow deflect the asteroid,
thereby saving the lives of its four million inhabitants, they will be able
to name any price the planet can pay.
```

```
51
```

##### REFEREE'S INFORMATION

Brufort is experiencing an existential crisis of epic proportions. The sleepy
backwater has become a chaotic free–for–all with rioting in the streets
and recrimination towards a government that has let everyone down.

Shortly after the call from the president, the Travellers are also contacted
by several functionaries from various levels of government and industry,
begging them for passage out of the system. Many of these individuals
have access to large amounts of wealth and offer to pay the Travellers
exorbitant sums to get them and their families off world before the
cataclysm. Situations like these can bring out the worst in people and
the Travellers witness a sickening degree of cowardice and desperation.
It might provide some degree of consolation for them to note that the
president herself intends to 'go down with the ship' and does not request
any special favors. She merely wants their help to save her planet and
its people.

### DEFLECTION

The Travellers have a number of options. Given the destruction of the
corvettes, they might decide that trying to deflect the asteroid is too
dangerous and opt to simply save whoever they can. This will be a
difficult undertaking since any landing on the planet results in a panicked
rush to the landing site and hordes of people attempting to get aboard.
The richest people on Brufort will pay MCr1 or more per person to get off
planet but the poor security of Brufort's low-tech communications network
means that any attempts to coordinate an escape are intercepted by
other members of the population. The scene on the ground is desperate
and frightening. Should the Travellers attempt to land, there is a high
probability that their ship will be mobbed and damaged or destroyed.

The best thing the Travellers can do is to attempt to deflect the asteroid.
The crisis is too far along to use more subtle means of 'nudging' it into
a new course but it is not too late to use more forceful methods. With
a large enough explosion or series of explosions, the Travellers might
be able to deflect or even fragment the asteroid, saving Brufort from its
impending doom.

If the Travellers' ship carries missiles, they may be fired at calculated
points on the surface of the asteroid in an attempt to redirect it. Roll 1D
for each missile fired, add up the total and consult the Time to Impact
table. The closer the asteroid is to Brufort, the more points must be
accumulated in order to destroy or divert it.

52

```
The most effective way to deflect the asteroid is to use explosives either
detonated from a short distance or planted on or beneath its surface.
```

```
Should the Travellers choose this method, they must first approach the
asteroid; there is cause for concern considering the last two ships to try
this were incinerated. The Travellers should approach with caution.
```

```
Have the ship's sensor operator make an Average (8+) Electronics
(sensors) check upon approach. A successful check reveals the
asteroid has loose bodies of rubble orbiting it. This may have been what
destroyed the corvettes. To fly close to the asteroid, apply the Effect of
the Electronics (sensors) check to a Difficult (10+) Pilot check (DEX,
2Dx10 minutes). Success indicates the pilot is able to approach without
problem. Failure with an Effect of 0 to -2 indicates the ship impacts the
rubble and suffers 2D damage. Failure with Effect -3 or worse results in
3D damage.
```

```
The Travellers have an increased chance of success if they can find a
deep crevasse or cave on the asteroid and plant the explosives within it.
Finding an appropriate place requires a task chain.
```

```
53
```

First have the Travellers make a Difficult (10+) Electronics (sensors)
check (INT, 1Dx10 minutes) to identify their options. Apply the modifiers
from the sensors table on page 19 of High Guard, doubling the DM for
Improved or Advanced sensors since those include densitometers. Apply
the effect of the Electronics (sensors) check to a Difficult (10+) Science
(planetology) or Profession (belter) check (INT, 1D+1 hours). This time
is spent surveying the asteroid using the ship's sensors to determine
which placement is optimal. Failure means the Travellers must start the
procedure over, starting with the initial Electronics (sensors) check.

After finding the right spot, the Travellers must don vacc suits and travel
to the asteroid, requiring 1D hours to explore the site and prepare it
for the operation. After this it then takes 1D hours for two Travellers
to unload one ton of explosives, carry them to the detonation site and
place them. Each additional two-person team can carry an additional ton
during the same time period. The Referee should have each Traveller
make periodic Average (8+) Vacc Suit checks (DEX) to avoid accidents.

If the Travellers have one or more nuclear warheads obtained from
missiles or another source, 1D hours are required to place every six
warheads. Planting the explosives and setting a detonator requires an
Average (8+) Explosives check (DEX or INT, D3 hours).

The entire process is long and challenging. The Travellers might begin
to feel the effects of fatigue after long hours of intense labour. Apply
appropriate negative DMs to their checks if they are unable to rest or
otherwise enhance their ability to work through exhaustion.

After getting back to their ship, the Travellers may detonate the explosives.
Roll 1D, adding DM+1 for every ton over two tons planted and check the
Time to Impact table for the results. Missile warheads count as one ton
for every six used.

### FUSION EXPLOSION

An alternative method of deflecting the asteroid is to create a fusion
explosion. For the Travellers' purposes, this more than likely means
detonating their ship's power plant. Whilst this generates a great deal of
energy for deflection and is highly effective, it means the destruction of
their starship and should only be considered as a last resort.

### TIME TO IMPACT

At the time of the Travellers' arrival, there are only four standard days (96
hours) remaining before the asteroid hits Brufort, divided into eight 12-
hour periods that are used to determine the effectiveness of any attempts
to deflect the asteroid in the Time to Impact table.

54

```
The asteroid is travelling at a rate of about 30 kilometers per second or
108,000 kilometers per hour toward the planet at a distance of 10,368,
kilometers as the Travellers' arrive in the system. Use this information to
determine travel times to and from the asteroid for the Travellers' ship.
```

```
Roll 2D to determine the success or failure of the Travellers' attempts
based on the periods remaining before impact and the method of
deflection attempted. In the case of a missile attack, simply add the total
points as described earlier.

```

```

### FRAGMENTATION

```
Regardless of the method used to deflect the asteroid, there is a chance
that it will fragment into pieces each time an explosion is detonated near
or beneath its surface. For each explosion, roll 2D adding DM+1 for
each previous explosion. The asteroid fragments on a roll of 11+ if the
explosion occurs on or near the surface or 9+ if the explosion occurs in
a cavern or crevasse. If the roll was exactly one less than the required
number (10 or 8) the asteroid splits into two large halves and millions of
pieces of smaller rubble.
```

```
If the asteroid has not been successfully deflected, the two halves both
hit Brufort, wreaking as much or more destruction as a single intact
asteroid. Additional attempts to deflect both pieces may be made but
time and explosives may well be running short at this point. However, if
the Travellers are successful at diverting at least one of the halves, they
may reduce the damage to Brufort and save some lives.
```

```
55
```

### DEFLECTION

A successful roll on the Time to Impact table indicates the asteroid has
been deflected and catastrophe has been averted provided that it has
not fragmented. If the asteroid has fragmented but is still two full days or
more from hitting the planet, the fragments disperse enough to prevent
significant damage to Brufort with only a bright and exciting meteor
shower to show for it. However, if the asteroid is deflected when there
are fewer than two days remaining and it fragments, many pieces strike
Brufort causing an extensive and deadly meteor shower on the planet.
This causes a great deal of destruction and loss of life, although far less
than if the entire asteroid had made impact.

### COMPLICATIONS

Each time the Travellers land on Brufort they risk being overrun by
mobs or frightened business people and bureaucrats attempting to buy
passage off planet. They may very well need to make at least one landing
to obtain explosives and other required materials. The Travellers may be
able to get President Gharja to send government forces to help protect
them and their ship during landings but as they get closer to zero hour it
becomes increasingly difficult to avoid the effects of the growing panic.

If additional landings are required, members of the militia might attempt
to rush the ship or privileged members of society might hatch a desperate
plan to hijack it. The Travellers may be able to talk their way out of such
a situation with a Very Difficult (12+) Persuade or Diplomat check but
violence may be required.

### AFTERMATH

If the Travellers successfully deflect the asteroid, they are showered
with great rewards for saving the day. Jubilant crowds meet them at
the starport with a heroes' welcome and parade, provided no loss of
life occurred. Even if they only partially save Brufort and fragments hit
the planet, causing some destruction, the survivors will be grateful for
their efforts.

Once all is said and done, there may be another matter to attend to; who
gets to lay claim to the type-M asteroid, or fragments thereof, and all the
nickel-iron riches it contains! This may well be an adventure in itself.

## CASE STUDY: A FIFTH FRONTIER WAR?

```
The following document has been declared Unclassified and Unrestricted.
It is reprinted in its entirety from the 1105 Compilation of 'Proceedings:
The Journal of the Imperial Navy Staff College'. Opinions are those of the
original author and do not represent any official policy or position of the
Staff College or the Imperial Navy.
```

```
A Fifth Frontier War against the Zhodani Consulate is inevitable.
```

```
The question is when and how, rather than if and why.
```

```
The Zhodani Consulate is not inclined towards territorial expansion but
has an aggressively defensive mindset. Its leaders apparently believe
that in the long run it is better to fight a war on their terms than try to
shore up a worsening situation until conflict erupts with their forces not
at full readiness. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that a threat – real
or perceived – such as the Imperium will be carefully watched until an
opportune moment to strike presents itself.
```

```
That moment is now.
```

## ZHODANI MOTIVATIONS

```
If there is no territorial motivation then the desired outcome for Zhodani
planners must be the elimination of a threat – in this case the Imperial
presence on their borders. A campaign into the heart of Imperial space to
break the power of the Imperium is so obviously beyond the capabilities
of Zhodani forces that it would not be contemplated. A more modest
goal would be to create a buffer zone of Zhodani client states, at least
20 parsecs deep, and impose treaties upon the Imperium that will limit
Imperial influence in the region thereafter.
```

```
This could be achieved by an invasion of the Spinward Marches and
Deneb sectors, securing key systems and destroying the Imperial forces
based there. De facto control of the Spinward Marches and a credible
threat to Deneb would be enough to force a negotiated settlement.
Zhodani planners might even be ambitious enough to try for Corridor.
This would give them control of the choke point created by the Great Rift.
A powerful fleet based forward in that region would cut off all Imperial
territory 'behind the claw' and allow the Zhodani Consulate to create a
heavily defended exclusion zone.
```

```
This may be the ultimate long-term goal of Zhodani planners; to use
the natural astrographic features of the region to permanently block out
```

```
57
```

Imperial expansion. Areas behind this 'Corridor Barrier' need not be directly
controlled; a region of small non-aligned states just powerful enough to
resist Vargr incursions would suit the Zhodani Consulate's purposes.

Be that as it may, it is unlikely that Consulate planners would expect to
punch all the way through to Corridor in a single campaign. A more limited
set of war aims is likely, based around pushing the Imperial border back
several parsecs.

### WAR START SCENARIOS

The Zhodani Consulate is known to have links with various Vargr groups
and the Sword Worlds Confederation. It is conceivable that these
allies, who have proven unruly in the past, might undertake actions that
lead to escalation. However, this scenario seems unlikely – indeed,
it is in the interests of the Consulate to rein in their allies unless war
fits the Consular agenda. The likelihood of a conflict occurring in this
manner is therefore low, as is the threat level since escalation would
allow activation and movement of reserves. Given the low probability of
success, it is unlikely in the extreme that the Zhodani Consulate would
commit to a large-scale conflict.

An intervention to protect an ally is a more likely scenario. This would,
in all probability, occur if a new Sword Worlds/Darrian conflict erupted. It
is not possible to say how highly the Zhodani value their Sword Worlder
associates but intervention is possible to prevent the collapse of the

58

```
Sword Worlds Confederation. Likewise, it is possible that the Consulate
would intervene to protect certain Vargr groups that have traditionally
provided a useful distraction of Imperial resources.
```

```
However, the planned or unplanned escalation scenario is not, at this
time, likely. Instead, we face the threat of a surprise Zhodani attack at
a time when their forces are at full readiness and ours are dispersed
in peacetime deployments. Given that the Zhodani Consulate has a
history of eliminating threats along its borders and clearly considers the
Imperium to be such a threat, it is desirable from the point of view of
Zhodani planners to undertake a campaign when the opportunity arises.
The present dispersion of our fleet creates a perfect opportunity to make
rapid initial gains, creating at the very least a strong bargaining position
if further advances are not possible.
```

```
In short, the criteria for a Zhodani attack on the Spinward Marches are
as follows:
```

1. Necessity: A threat must be perceived either in the long or short term.
2. Desirability: The potential gains must be worth the losses that will
    certainly be taken.
3. Opportunity: Circumstances must exist whereby there is a strong
    chance of success.

```
All these criteria are currently fulfilled. Therefore it seems probable that
the next Frontier War will be fought for control of the Spinward Marches
and that it will be fought within five years.
```

### IMPERIAL DEPLOYMENTS

```
It is obvious that it would not be possible to turn the Spinward Marches
into a giant fortress and that the forces deployed to the sector are
capable only of holding key worlds – and then not indefinitely. However,
the current deployment of the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet invites
defeat in detail by a concentrated enemy force, which will rapidly overrun
border regions and reach second-line deployed forces only a little behind
couriers warning that war has broken out. We quite literally risk losing a
significant portion of our fleet at its moorings and the rest in futile actions
against impossible odds.
```

```
There are two possible strategies for holding the Spinward Marches.
Both require concentration of heavy assets. A forward strategy places
a significant part of the sector fleet's capital ships close to the border,
acting as heavy reinforcements for the defences of 'fortress worlds'
along the frontier. This permits a rapid counterattack that might blunt the
enemy advance and allow forces from other sectors to reach the combat
zone. However, there is a real risk that forward-deployed forces might be
bypassed or attacked by surprise.
```

```
59
```

An alternative strategy is to concentrate heavy assets well back from the
frontier and maintain an increased patrol presence to locate intrusions.
This strategy permits heavy blocking forces to be moved into position
and the axis of an enemy advance to be determined. The chance of
losing heavy assets to a surprise attack is greatly diminished, albeit at
the price of allowing the enemy to make rapid early gains.

Both strategies have their risks and advantages, whereas our present
deployments have neither. Warship deployments are currently dictated
more by internal politics than strategic necessity. Powerful dukes routinely
demand a battleship – or a battleship squadron – to be deployed in their
subsector for reasons of prestige, or 'request' cruisers to patrol safe
trade lanes for the sake of demonstrating influence. At the outbreak of
war these ships have to be summoned to a concentration point, delaying
or weakening our response to an invasion.

It may be that our internal political situation is so bad that we need to
pander to the whims of senior nobles who are putting their egos and own
interests before those of the Imperium. If so, it would appear to be the case
that in order to have a Spinward Marches sector to defend, we must render
it indefensible by dispersing the fleet in these 'political deployments'.

Our admirals must tread a fine line between antagonising nobles,
and thereby creating dissent, and remaining ready to protect the
worlds of the sector. The only way to achieve this is to correctly
predict the opening movements of an enemy force and maximise
the effectiveness of those ships that are available whilst others are
gathered from political deployments.

### LIKELY ZHODANI STRATEGY

The likely goal of a campaign into the Spinward Marches is to capture
key economic and political centres and destroy the ability of the Imperial
Navy to defend its territory. This makes every high-technology or
industrial world a target, along with every naval base. However, some
goals are more necessary than others for political or strategic reasons.

The Jewell Cluster is an obvious target. Strategically its fleet bases are
a threat to Zhodani territory, whilst its astrographic isolation makes it
an obvious and useful territorial acquisition in the event of a negotiated
peace. It is entirely obvious that a powerful strike will be made at Jewell
and the surrounding worlds at the very beginning of the war. The cluster is
heavily defended and can be reinforced from the major fleet base at Efate.
However, Efate is also a primary target and likely to come under early
attack. The decision to send reinforcements or hold them to defend the
base could dictate the fate of the Regina and Jewell subsectors.

###### Spinward Marches Sector

Regina Aramis

Lanth Rhylanor

```
Zhodani advance on Efate and on the Lanth and Rhylanor subsectors
```

###### IMPERIUM

62

```
An obvious Zhodani strategy would be to attempt to isolate these
subsectors by ambushing reinforcements moving up to assist in the
defence. We can therefore expect an attempt to bypass the Jewell
Cluster and similarly well defended worlds, establishing forces along
the likely path of reinforcements. This might be with heavy fleet
assets, if the Zhodani hope to destroy reinforcements, or could be
lighter raiding vessels sent to disrupt the movement of supplies and
ground forces. Cruiser and destroyer actions can be expected as
deep as the Rhylanor subsector early in the conflict, even if capital
ships do not penetrate so far.
```

```
Zhodani interest in the Aramis subsector is unlikely to be great and the
'long left hook' scenario is highly unlikely. In theory, a large force could
transit through Vargr space and hook into the rear of Imperial forces
by way of Aramis or Deneb. However, this would take the force out of
contact with its base for a very long period. A change in plans could derail
this strategy or make war inevitable when decisions to abort the attack
would be more beneficial. Significant numbers of Vargr raiders and the
occasional Zhodani ship will be encountered in this region but Aramis will
be essentially a 'destroyer theatre' at most.
```

```
A drive on the major Imperial Navy base at Macene in the Rhylanor
subsector, and perhaps Rhylanor itself, is a possibility. The loss of the
repair yards at Macene would greatly reduce the navy's capability to
sustain a protracted engagement. An advance in this direction would pull
Imperial reinforcements from other theatres, perhaps fatally weakening
the Jewell/Efate campaign.
```

```
Involvement by the Sword Worlds Coalition is likely. If so, their initial
targets will be the three 'Abyss' naval bases at Lanth, D'Ganzio and
Ghandi. This will effectively isolate the Vilis subsector and allow it to be
annexed in due course, whilst clearing the flank of an advance towards
Lunion and ultimately Mora. If this were to happen, the minimal result
would be a complete hiatus on reinforcement for the Jewell/Efate region.
Reinforcements arriving from Deneb and Corridor sectors would be
pulled into a defence of the Rimward/Trailing corner of the subsector,
again weakening the Jewell/Efate campaign.
```

```
All these major offensives will be made against a backdrop of commerce
raiding and attacks on the ships, ports and holdings of the great nobility
of the sector. If the fleet continues to bow to political pressure in wartime
as it has in peace, we can expect to lose a significant number of the
sector fleet's major warships to guardship deployments and politically
expedient detachments. These ships will be effectively out of the fight
until it is time to mop them up and the Zhodani know it. Their strategy
will involve manipulation of our internal politics to weaken the fleet in
this manner.
```

```
63
```

### COURSE OF THE CONFLICT

The Zhodani Consulate will strike by surprise, perhaps during some crisis
or internal problem but quite possibly with no indication of a build-up.
Fleets will be assembled back from the border where they are unlikely
to be detected, accepting a few more weeks at combat readiness as the
price for an initial hammer-blow. We can expect reports of raiders all
across the sector and in some cases there will be information blackouts
caused by raiders intercepting our couriers.

The overall strategy is likely to be a two-pronged pincer, with the coreward
arm initially aimed at Regina and the rimward arm driving on Lunion. The
coreward pincer will have to deal with the fortress worlds of the Jewell
Cluster and Efate; the rimward one will need to clear its flank at Lanth.
This, therefore, is where the first fleet actions will occur. If these assaults
are not successful we can expect an attempt to cut off these regions and
force us to counterattack before they are taken – drawing our fleet into
an engagement on the enemy's terms.

If these campaigns are successful we can expect a second-stage
offensive against Macene and Rhylanor in the coreward theatre, and
against Mora to rimward. By this time reinforcements from Deneb will
be arriving. The enemy will expect this and threaten critical areas such
as Mora, or even Trin, in order to force us to deploy there. The likely
outcome of this plan is at least the loss of key worlds throughout the
Jewell, Regina, Lanth and Lunion subsectors, with a real possibility that
our reinforcements will be defeated so soundly that we lose Mora as well
or have to negotiate an unfavorable peace to avert catastrophe.

### CONCLUSIONS

There will be a Fifth Frontier War and we will lose it.

How badly we lose depends on measures taken today. Our admirals are
so entangled in the political webs of the sector nobility that they are doing
the enemy's work for them. If war never comes, this will have been the
correct strategy as it reduced internal tensions. If war does come... when
war does come... it will be the ruin of us all.

## MARITIME VEHICLES

```
The maritime environment is often overlooked by Travellers and
governments alike. Focus is usually on moving from one planet to
another, and getting around on its surface, but sometimes that surface
is largely covered with water. Maritime travel and commerce tends to
become less important once grav vehicles are available but it is still
necessary to secure the seaways. The ability to hunt sneaky starship
crews who have hidden their ship underwater may also be useful.
```

## ADB-

## COASTAL PATROL CUTTER

```
The ADB-602 is a standard design used, with local modifications, on
many worlds. Its primary tasks are coastal patrol, territorial and fishery
protection plus general law enforcement. The ADB-602 is used by 'wet'
navies, coast guard and maritime law enforcement agencies. It is lightly
armed and thus not well suited to a straight combat role but on many
worlds vessels of this sort are the only maritime combatants available.
```

```
As a coastal patrol vessel, the ADB-602 is not designed for long-term
operations, although it is quite capable of operating in open waters.
Conditions for the crew of six are fairly cramped below decks but most
of the upper deck is designed to be used as working or moving-around
space. This enables the vessel to pack in survivors from a rescue at need.
Basic living facilities include a pair of the tiniest bunks imaginable, a fairly
decent galley and a few odd corners useful for stowage of small items.
```

```
Armament is typical of small patrol craft, with a pair of 25 millimeters
light autocannon in a dual mount forward and a quad-mounted light anti-
air missile launcher aft. Both are remotely controlled from the craft's
tiny bridge. Each of the open bridge wings mounts a general-purpose
machinegun for law enforcement self-defence purposes. The hull is
lightly armored with flexible composite materials, giving reasonable
protection against small arms fire. Against heavier weapons the cutter
relies on electronic countermeasures and decoys.

### ADB-511 STRIKE HYDROFOIL

```
From the same design bureau as the ubiquitous ADB-602, the ADB-
511 is a short-range, high-speed craft intended to intercept and destroy
maritime threats. A handful of these boats can be a credible deterrent to
large warships of lower Tech Level, which in turn makes such vessels
rare. For the price of a maritime cruiser, a flotilla of imported vessels
could sink several ships from beyond the range of their guns, making
the investment less attractive. Balkanised-world governments intending
to fight a war in distant waters may require true warships but for the
most part defensive craft are a more cost-effective option. Manoeuvring
at almost 250 kilometers per hour in calm waters, missile hydrofoils are
virtually unhittable with conventional guns.
```

```
These craft are built for speed rather than endurance and exist mainly
to bring missiles within range of the target. The missiles are on fixed
container-launcher mounts offset to port and starboard at the rear of the
vessel and are aimed in the general direction of the enemy by pointing
the whole boat. Once a targeting lock is achieved the missiles are self-
guiding and the launching craft withdraws at high speed.
```

```
For general patrol work, a 25 millimeters autocannon is mounted on a
remote controlled turret forward of the bridge/control space and there
are machineguns on the bridge wings. Self-defence capability is limited
to decoys and high speed for major threats, and light composite armor
over critical spaces. This is sufficient to protect against small shell and
missile fragments, and possibly small arms fire, but more powerful
weapons will easily penetrate the hull.

### KAVARII-CLASS AEROSPACE

### DEFENCE SUBMARINE

```
The Kavarii-class is designed to provide a mobile aerospace defence
capability on worlds with significant amounts of surface water. It offers
advantages in terms of both deterrence and strike capability; an enemy
cannot know for sure if all surface-based missile launchers have been
eliminated, nor if there is a launch platform in range of incoming ships.
Submarine-launched aerospace defence missiles can be added to the
salvoes fired from static installations or held in reserve to ambush enemy
transports and supply ships during invasion.
```

```
Two separate sensor packages are carried; one for underwater use and
one for orbital tracking and targeting. Missiles are often launched using
targeting data handed off from other platforms but the Kavarii-class is
quite capable of generating its own targeting solutions. This requires
extending a sensor mast above the water surface, whereas tracking
data can be received at greater depths. The underwater sensor package
is more basic but suffices for navigation. The Kavarii-class can engage
underwater targets but generally slinks away rather than risking its
missile capability in an unnecessary fight.
```

```
A high degree of automation permits a relatively low crew requirement but
all the same the vessel is as cramped as any submarine in any world's
history, with the exception of the large missile bay that takes up half the
hull tonnage. Much of the rest is given over to a fusion power plant that
allows the vessel to remain submerged more or less indefinitely. It is
necessary to come up to a shallow depth for missile launch, and almost to
the surface when using the sensor mast, but otherwise this vessel remains
in the depths where its stealthy, near-silent design makes it hard to detect
from underwater and virtually impossible from above the surface.

# TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

## PRANGS, DINGS AND CRASHES

##### A GUIDE TO STARSHIP MISHAPS

```
Starship pilots normally prefer to land their craft in the same place and
with it roughly the same shape as before touchdown. The old adage that
'any landing you walk away from is a good one' is probably setting the
bar a bit low. A better guideline might be 'a landing that does not cost you
money or repair time is acceptable'. However, there are those for whom
the dings in their ship and the starport fines clocked up for taking divots
out of the landing pad are a badge of honor.
```

```
There are many ways to damage a starship without the slightest hostile
intent on anyone's part. Most are relatively minor but any situation
involving hundreds of tons of out-of-control metal has the potential to
make a very bad day for everyone concerned.
```

```
In the parlance of pilots, a ding is an incident that causes minor physical
damage, usually to the outside of a vessel. The actual damage is also
referred to as a 'ding' if it takes the form of a dent or other physical
scar on the hull. A prang, to most pilots, is an incident that causes
physical damage to the vessel or its occupants but does not reduce the
functionality of the vessel by any significant degree. A crash is a situation
that does impair functionality or poses significant threat to life and limb.
Accident investigators have different terms for these situations, of course,
but 'prang' sounds better in a pilot's bar than a 'class four unscheduled
foreign-body interaction'.
```

```
The amount of damage caused to and by a vessel in an incident
depends on its speed and circumstances of the collision. The mishaps
noted here assume, for the most part, that craft are engaged in low-
speed manoeuvring and not intent on causing catastrophic damage
to themselves or any other vessel. Collisions and mishaps of this sort
typically occur in orbital space or close to a port, in areas where ships
are expected to slow down to a sensible speed. The following speed
categories are used as a general indication of a vessel's velocity and the
amount of damage it is likely to do to itself.
```

```
Extreme: The vessel is going far too fast to enter orbit without a hard and
sustained braking maneuver. Any ship going this fast in orbital space
will attract both attention and alarm.
Fast Transit: The vessel has been accelerating hard for some time or is
arriving from a fast interplanetary transit without slowing down. A system
defence craft boosting to intercept a contact, or a ship making an urgent
run (such as a smuggler or fast courier), might be travelling at this rate.
```

```
71
```

Transit: A vessel moving in or out between jump point and orbital space
will normally be moving at 'transit' speed.
Slow Transit: Slower vessels or ones moving cautiously will typically
be manoeuvring at this rate. Traffic control will normally object to ships
moving faster than this pace within its controlled area.
Orbital Transfer: Standard speed at which ships enter and leave orbit,
or maneuver in orbital space.
Slow Transfer: Cautious maneuvers of a sort normally used in crowded
orbital space.
Port: Movement within the confines of a port is normally carried out at
this speed, balancing brisk and efficient against safety.
Slow Port: Careful movement within the confines of a port, typically used
by large ships and in crowded areas.
Creep: Extremely slow movement such as in final docking or when
making small adjustments to position.

###### Speed and Severity

```
Speed Cumulative Thrust Severity
Stationary 0 0
Creep 1 D
Slow Port 2 1D
Port 4 2D
Slow Transfer 8 3D
Orbital Transfer 16 4D
Slow Transit 32 5D
Transit 64 6D
Fast Transit 128 7D
Extreme 256 8D
```

The amount of cumulative Thrust required to go from one speed class
to another is determined by subtracting the current value from the
desired value. This also applies to deceleration. So, if a vessel wanted
to decelerate from Transit to Port speed, this would require 64-4 = 60
cumulative Thrust. Obviously a 4g vessel could do this a lot more quickly
(60/4=15 rounds) than a 1g ship. A pilot could leave their deceleration too
late and fly into the ground...

Typically landings are made at Slow Port speed, with a final deceleration
to Creep. Takeoffs usually involve a smooth acceleration to Port
speed to clear the docking area before further acceleration is applied.
However, not all pilots observe these niceties. It is possible to come
in at Orbital Transfer speed until the ship is almost on the pad then
brake hard, although this is uncomfortable for the passengers, crew
and everyone watching alike.

72

### USING SEVERITY

```
When a vessel suffers an incident, roll a number of dice as shown on the
Speed and Severity table with the following modifiers, applying any other
special considerations noted below and consult the Prangs table.
```

```
Passengers and crew prepared for impact. DM-
Passengers and crew fully prepared for impact, for example
strapped into seats or crash frames.
```

```
DM-
```

```
Vessel is hit from an angle other than along its main axes. DM+
Vessel strikes relatively soft surface such as soil and grass. DM-
Vessel strikes yielding surface such as water. DM-
```

```
For example, a pilot decides to show off by making a landing approach at
Slow Transfer speed and ends up slamming the belly of the ship into the
grass short of the landing area. Base Severity Index is 2D, -1 because
the crew have time to grab something, -1 for the nice springy turf but
unfortunately +3 for hitting at an awkward angle – ships tend to be more
resilient along their main axes. The pilot rolls 2D+1 and consults the
Prangs table.
```

##### Minor Collisions

```
There are few circumstances under which a ship would or even could
deliberately ram another with the intent of causing serious damage,
however there have been instances of pilots 'giving another vessel a nudge'
in crowded areas. Most collisions are accidental and occur at relatively low
speed, however. A low-speed bump can occur when docking at an arm or
boom, or clipping the side of an orbital port's docking bays. This is unlikely
to do much harm, although it may dent the hull or scrape off an antenna
and will more than likely earn the pilot the displeasure of the port operator.
```

```
In the event of a minor collision, the speed of the fastest-moving vessel
is used unless it is obviously inappropriate, such as when a vessel
sideswipes another travelling at the same speed in the same direction.
Such a collision would normally be taken as occurring at Creep or Slow
Port speed. In the event that one ship 'nudges' another to move it or
shake the occupants about, the same Severity is used for both craft but
the results may be different if one crew are braced and prepared and the
other is not. Collisions with buildings, the ground or large animals are
considered to be much the same as hitting another ship, although a light
building might be considered a yielding surface.
```

##### Hitting Atmosphere

Hitting atmosphere whilst going too fast can be harmful to ships and
their occupants. This can occur for various reasons; an inopportune drive
failure on approach to a world, perhaps, or a spectacularly bad piece of
course plotting that results in arrival at high speed. Atmosphere will not

```

cause a problem at Slow Transfer speeds or less, and ships already in
atmosphere do not suffer these effects. Thus a vessel accelerating hard
up to orbit does not need to worry about a potential prang; one coming
down from orbit unwisely fast does.

Streamlined ships can enter atmosphere safely at one speed class
higher (Orbital Transfer); unstreamlined ships at one class lower (Port).
Once the craft has entered atmosphere it can accelerate again; it is the
sudden deceleration caused by hitting the outer layers of atmosphere
that causes the hazard.

A very high-altitude aerobraking maneuver might be used to try to
shed excess speed or just because the pilot thinks it looks cool. A
vessel may decelerate by an additional amount of Thrust equal to
twice the Effect of an Average (8+) Pilot check. However, if the check

```
is failed the craft is considered to have hit the atmosphere and may
suffer a prang. A failed aerobraking check counts as 1D of cumulative
decelerating Thrust; a desperate pilot might deliberately turn the ship
to present maximum air resistance and hope the damage is less than
striking the ground would cause.
```

##### Bad Take-offs and Landings

```
The normal Pilot check to put a ship on the pad (starport landing)
is Routine (6+) difficulty. It is possible to make the task easier by
extending the time taken but in a busy port this may not be possible.
Traffic control needs to get ships on the ground or out of their airspace
as quickly as possible, so parking like a geriatric turtle may not be
acceptable. Thus most ships make their approach under smooth
deceleration and final movements at Slow Port speed.
```

```
If a pilot wants (or needs, or is forced to) come in hot, DM-2 applies for
every speed category above Slow Port. The actual landing must still be
made at a survivable speed but it is possible to streak in, decelerate hard
and drop gently onto the pad to the admiration of onlookers. It is also
possible to end your days as a hole in the ground. Likewise, pilots who
take off and accelerate smoothly away make traffic controllers happy.
Those who buzz the tower under full throttle do not.
```

```
If a Pilot check to take off or land is failed, determine the Severity of the
incident with the negative Effect of the failed check as a positive DM. So,
if a pilot takes off at Port speed but loses control for some reason, with
an Effect of -3 on the Pilot check, Severity is 1D+2 for Port Speed and an
additional +3 for the extremely poor Pilot check.
```

### PRANGS

```
Most incidents do not result in a prang or crash but whenever a ship
suffers a mishap such as a failed Pilot check for atmospheric entry or
take-off, there is the potential for people to get hurt and objects broken.
Determine the Severity of the incident and apply the results from the
Prangs table.
```

```
The Personnel Outcome column indicates the difficulty of an Athletics
check to avoid being bounced off something or struck by a lose object.
Failure results in the indicated damage being taken. Success reduces
damage by 1D+Effect, which for lesser prangs likely means no damage
is taken. Personnel strapped into proper seats or crash frames (good
quality stateroom beds have one) do not need to make this check and
reduce damage by 2D.

## INTERCEPTORS

```
The conventional System Defence Boat is intended to operate from a
patrol station in orbit or be based out of an installation. This is not always
feasible, however; if no suitable orbital or offworld base exists then SDBs
have to launch from ground installations. For small, low-gravity worlds
this imposes only a slight delay in deployment but a ship that must climb
out of a deep gravity well is vulnerable to a fast-moving intruder and may
fail to make an intercept in time.
```

```
Various solutions to this problem have been tried. Some are doctrinal,
such as keeping system defence craft in orbit and rotating crews with
support vessels. Others are technical, the simplest of which is to provide
SDBs and other craft with a boost system to assist getting into orbit
as quickly as possible. SDB crews also use boost systems for extra
acceleration when pursuing hostiles or making an early intercept.
```

## JAVELIN LIGHT GUNBOAT

```
The Javelin is designed for short-range interception rather than long
patrols. It is officially designated a gunboat rather than system defence
craft as it is designed to be carried aboard a tender or similar vessel in
addition to performing a system defence role. Configuration is similar to
that of a 200-ton SDB.
```

```
The Javelin is built around the Atlatl Boost System, which was designed
as an integrated part of the hull. The vessel's standard maneuver drive
is impressive on its own, being capable of sustained 6g thrust, but under
maximum boost the Javelin can overhaul almost any vessel. A Javelin
that uses all of its reaction fuel will take much longer to get home than it
did to reach the target but this is not a problem in a vessel designed for
rapid interception and high-speed firing passes.
```

```
The reaction drive can be used in combat, enabling the Javelin to engage in
a series of rapid 'one pass and haul ass' strikes against a hostile vessel or
streak away from danger. The primary armament is a fusion gun barbette,
with a dual pulse laser turret for use against smaller targets. The hull is
lightly armored to withstand weapons fire from fighters; the Javelin can
use its speed when engaging craft capable of doing significant damage.
```

```
Normal crew is four, all of whom have workstations on the bridge. The
drives are remotely operated for the most part, although the engineer
can enter the cramped spaces around them to make adjustments if
```

```
77
```

necessary. For the most part, however, the crew confine themselves to
the bridge, living space and small recreation area, rarely entering the drive
room or turrets. These are typically maintained groundside or aboard a
parent ship, and entered from external hatches rather than through the
ship. There are rumored to be Javelins whose internal access corridor
has never been used.

### DART INTERCEPTOR

```
The Dart interceptor is one of the most exciting craft to fly but not always
in a good way. Its incredible acceleration is certainly exhilarating but the
prospect of having insufficient reaction fuel to cancel a high velocity is a
constant source of stress. Automated systems warn the pilot of 'bingo'
fuel on a dynamic basis, ensuring they know where the limit of endurance
lies and can get back to base.
```

```
Fuel management is a critical skill when flying a reaction fighter. The Dart
has a nominal power plant endurance of 32 hours – far longer than any
pilot would want to be in the cockpit – but all fuel is available for drive
and power plant functions. In theory this means the craft could power
its systems for almost a week without manoeuvring, although more
commonly the power plant allocation is used as a last reserve – a Dart
that can get home in three hours by using up all but three hours' worth of
power plant fuel has no real reason to keep much more in reserve.
```

```
81
```

Similarly, reaction fuel calculations are not as simple as they might at first
appear. One hour at maximum thrust translates to 16 hours of constant
1g acceleration. A Dart will normally undertake short patrols of under
four hours' duration or be launched from a ship or ground station as an
interceptor. In the latter case high acceleration will be applied early to
ensure a rapid climb to orbit and intercept, but most maneuvers will be
made at a more modest rate. By coasting much of the way a Dart can
make a patrol of several hours duration and still have plenty of fuel for
high-speed maneuvers.

##### USING REACTION DRIVES

```
The simple way to calculate fuel is to use g-hours (one hour of
continuous 1g thrust) and g-turns (one turn of 1g thrust). A Dart sets
out with 16g-hours of thrust at the beginning of a mission. There
are 10 turns in an hour, so the fighter has 160 'g-turns'. If the pilot
engages in maximum power manoeuvring for five turns of space
combat, they use 16 g-turns every turn or 80 g-turns total. At the end
of the fight they have 80 g-turns of fuel left, minus whatever it took to
get to the combat area.
```

```
Alternatively, combat endurance can be calculated using fuel tonnage.
One hour (10 turns) at Thrust 16 requires 8 tons of fuel, so one g-turn
requires 0.05 tons of fuel. That is to say, fuel is expended per turn at
a rate of 0.05 tons times the amount of Thrust the pilot uses' if they
maneuver at Thrust 7 one turn this costs 0.35 tons of fuel. If the pilot
was desperate, they could draw on the power plant reserve; 0.1 tons
of power plant fuel gives 1.6 hours of power plant operation, which is
longer than most fights are likely to be. A pilot could therefore draw on
this reserve for a last desperate attempt to take out the target.
```

```
Both of these methods require bookkeeping but they allow Travellers
to wring the very last drop of performance out of a fighter. If large
numbers of fighters are in use it is simpler to assume they have one
hour (10 turns) of combat endurance regardless of the Thrust they use
every turn and can creep home on power plant fuel afterwards.

## FIRST CONTACT

```
First Contact is one of the most exciting and rewarding – not to mention
dangerous – aspects of the Scout Service. Well-established protocols
are in place but every situation is different. Exploration beyond borders
occasionally results in contact with an entirely new species and even
within the boundaries of well-explored space there are species that have
been overlooked.
```

```
If a species has not yet been encountered, there will usually be a reason.
The most common are:
```

```
The homeworld is far away: In this case, contact will usually be made
by explorers from one side, or perhaps both. Contact may be accidental,
such as when a ship misjumps into unexplored territory, or might occur
when a migrating race moves into a new area. In many cases contact is
made by planned exploration missions and it is generally not a surprise.
A starfaring civilization can often be detected from several parsecs away
by its emissions or evidence may be left on nearby planets. Other races
can often tell explorers about their neighbors, although their information
may be biased.
```

```
The species has been overlooked: Some species are not initially
recognized as sentient or are difficult to detect. In the former case, the
reason might be a very alien physiology and behaviour, or extremely low
intellect bordering on animal level. Alternatively, a species might leave
a very small footprint, using extremely clean energy and blending cities
into the natural environment. Sparse populations of low-tech people are
also likely to missed by a survey.
```

```
The species may live in unusual conditions: Some species require
conditions so far beyond those tolerable by humans that contact is
not possible. Such beings may be so alien that they escape notice or
recognition. Alternatively, the species may live in a place where contact
is difficult and detection unlikely. One reason for doing so is to obtain
a necessary resource or the species may have been transplanted and
found a way to survive in a hostile environment.
```

```
Contact has been avoided: Some species actively hide from others,
possibly in hazardous conditions. A variant on this concept, popular in
entertainment vids, is a species that does have contact that has been
kept secret. This situation is potentially the most dangerous a first
contact team can face, especially if there are powers at work to suppress
knowledge of the species.
```

```
85
```

### PRECONTACT PROCEDURES

The IISS prefers to make contact with new species in a careful and
methodical manner, gathering all possible information before initiating
contact. Events may force their hand, such as a band of Travellers
blundering into the area but if things go to plan the regulations will be
followed and the contact team will have a clear plan to follow.

The first stage is to conduct a physical and electromagnetic observation
of the target species' homeworld or the worlds they frequent. Standard
survey equipment will give an indication of the conditions the new
species prefers, its requirements for life support and a general idea of its
technological sophistication. It may be possible to create a framework for
communication out of intercepted transmissions or even to decode the
species' language if sufficient time is available.

If communications are possible – even just an exchange of indecipherable
signals – this is the preferred method of initiating contact. Standard
procedure dictates that if a scout vessel is believed to have been
spotted, or the alien species attempts to initiate contact, signals should
be immediately broadcast. Friendly contact is far more likely if scout
ships are open about their presence.

### GENERAL

### CONTACT PROCEDURES

Most commonly, contact is made on the ground. There have been
exceptions of course; species capable of orbital flight might prefer to
send a mission to meet the scouts and of course starfaring cultures
are likely to have an orbital port where an initial meeting will take
place. The latter is potentially a risk of course; an alien culture might
decide to hold a landed ship in its port to learn more about the crew
or as hostages. Contact mission commanders generally prefer to risk
only small craft by sending them into an installation they might not be
able to quickly get out of.

For the most part, however, contact is a matter of landing and meeting
the locals. The majority of encountered species are not capable of
interstellar travel and many lack the technology to communicate other
than in person. As a general rule, the lower the Tech Level of a species,
the more likely it is to think it is the only sentient species in existence.
Panic or superstitious dread is possible in such cases but, on the other
hand, a low-tech species poses little threat to scout ships. The ground
contact team, on the other hand, may be in mortal danger.

Standard procedure is to land a contact team in an open area away
from large populations, with a backup and rescue group available at zero

86

```
notice. The contact team will usually be unarmed, although concealed
weapons may be carried in some circumstances. The backup group is
responsible for getting the contact personnel out if the meeting goes
badly, ideally with a minimum of violence. Distraction techniques are
preferred to the use of force and if violence is necessary efforts are made
to use less-lethal weapons first.
```

```
There have been cases where the contact team were taken hostage
without intervention by the backup. This might be a useful gambit,
allowing the contacted species to think they are in control of the situation.
Such actions must be carefully judged but sometimes there is a fine line
between being the guests of a nervous alien government and being a
hostage. Lasting relationships have been built on the strength of words
heard by captors who thought they were the ones in control.
```

```
If the ground team were to be taken hostage, retrieval is not guaranteed.
All scouts have a 'no hostage' clause in their contract for this situation
and their superiors will not enter into a bad agreement to save the lives
of a contact team. They might, on the other hand, conduct a rescue in
a manner that makes the contacted species realise they have bitten off
```

```
87
```

more than they can chew. If so, further contact will be from a position of
strength and the locals will find themselves being dictated to rather than
amicably contacted.

Standard procedure is to risk as little as possible on a first contact
mission. Teams are rarely more than half a dozen personnel, usually
deployed in air/rafts rather than from spacecraft. This is seen as non-
threatening but also allows starships and spacecraft to be kept out of
reach of the locals. Likewise, equipment is light and basic, although
the contact team can call upon the resources of their ship(s) to conduct
analysis or provide advice.

Initial contact is cautious and wherever possible the team will not
enter enclosed spaces or areas where they can be ambushed or
seized. However, circumstances do vary and risks will be taken where
appropriate. Gift-giving is generally a part of contact procedures but
contact teams do not carry such wealth that murdering them seems
worthwhile. Instead, gifts are used as token of friendship and more
importantly to whet the appetite of the local elite for more. Ideally, gifts
make further contact seem desirable and at the same time establish how
powerful and important the new arrivals are.

### RISKY CONTACT

If preliminary assessment or other data indicates that a standard contact
is too risky, an extended information-gathering process begins. Once
there is sufficient information about the targeted culture a suitable
contact strategy may be devised, or in some cases the world may be
Red Zoned on a temporary or permanent basis. All information gathering
is performed covertly in this situation.

Observations of cities and settlements gives a general indication of
population size, Tech Level, infrastructure and industrial development, all
of which allows an estimate of military capability as well as the economic
value of the world. Settlement patterns sometimes give an idea of the
nature of society, or at least how centralised it is. Scattered or clumped
cities might indicate balkanization, for example, although evidence of
warfare is usually a clearer indication.

Technological capability combined with settlement pattern will give an
indication of the world's government type. A centralised bureaucratic
government is not possible unless the population are concentrated or
electronic communications are available. A low-tech world with scattered
settlements probably has a decentralised government system such as
a feudal technocracy if it is not balkanised. Governmental buildings and
areas of a city given over to the business of governance are usually
apparent as such. Once identified they can be closely observed, possibly
using drones or planted sensor packages. This will allow an approach to
be formulated based on the characteristics of the ruling elite.

88

### DEFINING SENTIENCE

```
In some cases it can be unclear whether a species is sentient or not.
Some particularly intelligent animals display characteristics that mimic
sentience and some particularly low-intelligence species do not match
the usual criteria. Neural Activity Sensors are highly useful in making an
initial appraisal but the degree of intelligence indicated does not always
equate to sentience. Some species have a huge intellectual potential but
are not self-aware; others are sentient but extremely limited.
```

```
The discovery of a sentient species imposes limits on the commercial
exploitation and colonization of a planet, and measures are generally
taken to protect close-to-sentient animals. However, these factors must
be proven before measures can be implemented. Instrument readouts
are not enough here; an assessment must be made based upon standard
criteria. These include tool use, language and social structure.
```

```
Language is not in and of itself a certain indicator of sentience. Many
animal species are capable of communicating in various ways and can
often indicate objects or locations by distinct names. What is relevant is
the indication of conscious thought and transmission of concepts. At its
most basic level, 'language' is merely an indication of emotional state.
A cat's purr is a means of communicating contentment and happiness;
a snort of alarm from a deer is more sophisticated and conveys useful
information to other animals – but it is not an indication of thought.
```

```
Even where different sounds or other forms of communication convey
detailed information this is not an indication of sentience. Some animals
give different warning sounds depending on the threat and take defensive
actions appropriate to the information they receive. What is an indicator
of sentience is the ability to convey information that has been processed
to make it concise and useful. Even more significant is the ability to
convey abstract thought that goes beyond observation and to teach
others without having them simply copy actions.
```

```
An animal might learn to perform complex tasks by watching its parents
or other members of its social group, but a sentient person can be told
what to do or to expect. This indicates the ability to conceptualise and
imagine a situation the person has not seen, which is one of the hallmarks
of sentience. It is also necessary for the long-term development of the
species, since it allows the young to be taught more, and more quickly,
than by a see-and-copy process. This ability to quickly bring the young
up to speed creates the potential for further development and innovation,
which might someday lead to a technological civilization.
```

```
What might be termed 'stupidity' is also sometimes an indicator of
sentience. Animals react to stimuli in a predictable manner. If there is
little competition for resources and no obvious need, yet members of a
race leave a fertile and pleasant area to struggle across badlands, there
must be a reason. Such activity is not necessarily proof of sentience
```

```
89
```

but animals do not as a rule leave habitable places for less habitable
ones without obvious necessity. People, on the other hand, explore for
exploring's sake or leave their homes due to social issues that would
never arise among animals.

Complex social structures are not necessarily an indication of sentience,
nor is absence proof of its lack. However, most sentients create social
structures that go beyond simple cooperation in searching for food or
protecting the young. Compassion and protection of the group rather
than the individual are not restricted to sentient beings but protecting and
nurturing essentially worthless members of a group is unlikely in non-
sentient species. Social structures that permit individuals to specialise
permit the development of society and are a hallmark of sentience or
proto-sentience.

Tool use, in and of itself, is not an indicator of sentience. Many animals use
tools and some will even use a basic tool like a stone to create a better
one, such as by scraping a stick to make it sharp. However, complexity of
tool use is an indicator, especially where higher-order tools are made by
specialists using tools created for the task. This harks back to the ability
to abstract and imagine; a smart animal can use a tool it finds but abstract
thought is required to figure out how to make a better one.

#### ONCE SENTIENCE IS DETERMINED

Ultimately, the decision as to whether a species should be considered
sentient or not is made on a 'big picture' basis. If sentience is proven, it is
necessary to decide how to proceed. Low-tech societies are, in general,
contacted discreetly and measures taken to ensure interactions are kept
low-key. It is not usual to inform such a society of the existence of a large
interstellar civilization but equally it is considered inadvisable to give
false or inaccurate information. Fragile societies or those liable to pose a
threat to visitors are Red Zoned. More advanced or adaptable species are
introduced as gradually as possible to the wider interstellar community.

Once a race is deemed to be sentient, it is protected by interstellar
law. The killing of a sentient being of any species without cause is
murder and it is illegal to take people of any species as slaves. Laws
also exist to reduce exploitation, such as by unscrupulous merchants
selling substandard goods at ridiculous prices to a culture that has just
discovered the wider universe.

Such measures are not always successful but wherever possible a
sentient species is protected if required and assisted if it wants to be,
in the hope that eventually its people will join the wider interstellar
community and contribute to the Imperium. Ideally, such transition is
made in a way that preserves the unique culture of the newly contacted
species. Study of that culture and the changes it goes through after
contact is an area of great interest to the Scout Service but goes
beyond the first contact mission.

## >> VEHICLE MOUNTED MISSILES <<

```
The guided missile is a game-changer in mid-technology warfare and
never becomes completely obsolete despite the development of meson
guns and other advanced weapons. In principle, a missile is a simple
enough device, consisting of just a few elements.
```

```
Propulsion: The majority of missiles use chemical propulsion, typically
a rocket engine. Other propulsion systems are possible, such as jet
engines or gravitic drives but these are far less common.
```

```
Casing: The main body of the missile is termed its casing. Normally
the casing has movable fins or directable propulsion for guidance. The
combination of casing and propulsion system is sometimes called a
'bus'. It is not uncommon for the bus of a military missile system to be
adapted to carry civilian payloads such as satellites or scientific probes.
```

```
Guidance: A guided missile, by definition, requires some form of
guidance. This might be a simple dead-reckoning system taking the
weapon to a defined location, or an advanced seeker system capable of
selecting its own targets once it reaches the target zone. Many missiles
receive external guidance, either as direct control signals or in the form
of a designator whose target point is followed by the missile. An unguided
'missile' is typically referred to as a rocket, even if it uses some other
form of propulsion, to differentiate it from a guided weapon.
```

```
Payload: This is whatever the missile is designed to deliver. If something
is explosive, incendiary or similarly intended to cause harm and mayhem,
it is usually referred to as a warhead. A missile might carry several
warheads that may have their own guidance and propulsion systems.
```

## GUIDED TRAIT

```
Weapons that can seek a target without input from an operator have the
Smart trait. Those that require either designation or direct guidance have
the Guided trait. A Guided weapon that loses contact with its operator
will become unguided and continue on its present trajectory unless
programmed to self-destruct. If a laser designator goes off target but
remains switched on, the weapon will follow it and hit an unintended target.
```

```
Use of suitable guidance allows the weapon's operator or the operator
of a designator to target a weapon very precisely, with no penalties for
range. Hand-held or vehicle mounted designators can be used with the
Heavy Weapons or Gunner skills; missile control/guidance systems
```

```
91
```

require the Gunner skill. If the operator succeeds in the skill check
(usually Average difficulty but possibly harder if the target is small or on
the move), the weapon will automatically hit the target. Some guidance
systems provide assistance, making a hit more likely.

##### Blue Fantail 70mm FFGR

A staple of mid-tech battlefields, the 70mm Folding Fin Guided Rocket is
actually a guided missile of sorts. The weapon is a modified version of the
standard rocket launched from a rocket pod (see page 133 of the Central
Supply Catalogue), fitted with a basic seeker head capable of following a
laser designator. The designator is usually mounted alongside the rocket
pod on a helicopter or light aircraft, in which case the rockets follow the
path of the beam. However, a handoff targeting lock can be deployed
by personnel or vehicles on the ground. In this case, the rockets can
be launched on an indirect trajectory, such as over intervening terrain.
However, range is halved as these weapons are designed to be air-
launched and do not have the thrust required to climb to great altitude.

The 'Blue Fantail' designation comes from the brand name of a leading
guided rocket system. It is generically applied to all rocket systems of
this sort, although most have their own codenames. The Blue Fantail
designator is designed to be fitted in a fixed mount on an aircraft or a
pintle mount on a ground vehicle. The pintle mount could also be used
on the perimeter of an installation, allowing precise rocket fire to be
directed against an assault. The hand-held version resembles a bulky
set of armored binoculars.

##### GLMM-128 Gun/Missile Launcher

```
The GLMM-128 (Ground-Launched Multirole Missile, 128mm) is a
lightweight battlefield missile system intended to be fitted to any light
combat vehicle. Primary munitions are 128mm missiles suitable for
anti-armor and medium-range air defence work in a mid-tech combat
environment and are capable of engaging light grav tanks.
```

```
The gun/launcher has an unusual breach-loading system, which
must be manually served. This reduces rate of fire compared to an
autoloaded weapon of a similar calibre but the complex missile/
munitions loading system originally developed for the launcher proved
unworkable. Despite this drawback, the GLMM-128 is popular with
mercenary units and incorporated into many light military vehicles. A
variant, designated ALMM-128, is designed for retrofitting to aircraft
and light grav vehicles, acting as a one-shot launcher. It can be
reloaded on the ground but not in flight.
```

```
The GLMM-128 uses a missile prosaically designated 'Project 414'
but better known by its marketing title as Jorden-Hurade-Hammare, a
corruption of a phrase from an old Terran language roughly translating
as 'Earth-Flung-Hammer'. The JHH missile normally carries a high
explosive shaped-charge warhead but its bus can be used to deliver
other munitions. Multiple high explosive/fragmentation submunitions can
be scattered across a small area by the anti-personnel payload package
and a plasma warhead is available for those with the credits to afford it.

##### AP-150 (Actiune Puternica)

##### 150mm Battlefield Missile

The AP-150 is a large, long-range battlefield missile intended for use
aboard maritime ships and large vehicles. It can also be used as an
aerospace defence missile, although it is not ideal for this role. The
missile lacks agility, making a hit on a grav tank or similar vehicle unlikely,
whilst not having the punch required to do much damage to a starship.

The AP-150 is normally deployed in its own container-launcher, a
self-contained unit fitted to a missile boat, maritime ship or vehicle.
Alternatively, batteries of AP-150s can be positioned to cover strategic
waterways or the approaches to a city. These are sometimes turreted but
deployment in a simple concrete pit containing four container-launchers
is common. Launch sites attract return fire much of the time, so a group
will usually be expended as a single salvo.

The standard warhead is a multimode explosive core surrounded by
tungsten cubes. These can be hurled forward by a shaped-charge
detonation or outward in a cone for an area effect. The missile is smart
enough to determine which mode is most effective against its current
target and will use the most appropriate if a direct hit is not possible.
If a direct hit can be obtained – and the target merits it – the warhead

94

```
will attempt to punch through the target's hull. In this case the tungsten
sheath protects the warhead until it detonates inside the target, flinging
white-hot tungsten cubes around inside.
```

```
Setting up an AP-150 is intentionally easy. It uses a plug-and-fight
architecture compatible with most standard military systems, whilst
fittings are designed to allow the container-launcher to be added to a
vehicles or maritime vessels with a minimum of deck penetrations.

##### Spearwall Orbital Defence Missile System

The only sure defence against attack by starships is starship-grade
weapons. The Spearwall system is designed to make orbital-defence
available to as wide a range of users as possible. The system is built
around the Spear missile, a starship-grade weapon modified for launch
from ground-based platforms. On small worlds, Spear missiles are
often used in their basic configuration but the Longspear is favored by
governments of larger planets.

Longspear missiles have an extra stage added to their bus, increasing
mass and volume but allowing a much more rapid climb to orbit when
combined with an additional booster. The standard Spear missile has
Thrust 10. Longspear increases this to Thrust 15. The Longspear cannot
be used in a standard launcher and requires the use of a Spearwall
erector-launcher.

The Spearwall system uses one of three launchers. The first is a standard
starship missile system, intended to be mounted in a groundside
bunker but otherwise no different from the shipboard equivalent. The
static launcher is an armored container designed to be dug into the
ground, pointing upwards. Its recharging and control interface unit
is normally buried nearby, just under the topsoil, and commands are
received remotely. When the unit is ready to fire, a set of explosive
charges clears most of the soil off the mouth of the container, after
which hydraulic rams move the lid aside. Buried container/launchers
are virtually impossible to detect by emissions and are likely to survive
an attempt to suppress planetary defences.

The third launch system is an erector-launcher designed to be carried on
a large vehicle. This is usually a military transport of some kind but some
governments mount their Spearwall systems on ships or trains. A bunker
containing multiple erector/launchers on a movable platform is another
possibility, allowing missiles to be brought into firing position under a
narrow launch tube whilst the rest remain protected. The Spearwall
erector-launcher can only carry one missile at a time but is capable of
launching Longspears in addition to the standard Spear missile.

Warheads are normally conventional starship-grade munitions, although
some world governments deploy nuclear warheads as a deterrent or
extreme-circumstances defence. Detonating nuclear weapons in your
own orbital space comes at a price, so wherever possible such missiles
are held in reserve for the direst emergency or as a bargaining chip.

Spear and Longspear missiles are spacecraft scale weapons.

# TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

## PLANETSIDE TRANSPORTATION

Travellers, by definition, travel over great distances between the stars –
often without really thinking about the difficulties involved. A starship can
also serve as a means of planetside transportation, although there are
some problems involved with hopping around in a huge chunk of flying
metal. Worlds with the means to enforce it typically restrict spacecraft
and interstellar vessels to the starport and any subsidiary spaceports.
Few governments want privately owned starships wandering around in
their airspace, for reasons that range from accident prevention to local
security. This particularly applies to armed starships, which might outgun
the local military by a wide margin.

There is also the problem of finding a suitable landing spot to consider.
Instruments can do so much but the only ways to tell if a piece of ground
really can support a starship's weight is to survey it at ground level or land
and hope for the best. Leaving aside the possibility of causing damage
with a bad or ill-advised landing, there is a real possibility that Travellers
might touch down on soft or unexpectedly uneven ground. One way to
avoid this is to use public spaces like car parks or school yards as a
landing area... and this is why governments like to restrict interstellar
jerks from just landing where they please.

Travellers thus often want or need a means of transportation when they
get planetside. Carrying a vehicle aboard ship is a possible solution but
this takes up space and may not be suitable for all worlds the Travellers
visit. A high-tech city is not really the place for a heavily armored custom
ATV capable of crossing airless moons or the most extreme wilderness
imaginable, so Travellers will often want to use local transportation. This
can be a cheap, efficient and generally enjoyable experience... or an
ordeal the Travellers will never forget.

## AT THE STARPORT

Orbital starports are effectively high-tech cities in space and usually
have a well-planned local transportation network, light ground vehicles
and rapid rail-based transport being the norm. Some ports use grav
vehicles tied into a local traffic network to prevent accidents. These are
often lightweight designs unsuited to operations outside an enclosed
environment but entirely suitable for internal passenger and freight
movement. Destinations are usually chosen from a menu, with custom
journeys set-up with an equally user-friendly interface.

Transportation of this sort is often free, usually efficient and rarely
difficult to use. However, it does make the movements of the Travellers
easy to track and access will be restricted to parts of the installation.

98

```
Ironically, it may be more difficult to reach a distant part of the orbital
port than the most remote regions of the world below. A combination of
distance, difficulty of navigating through a strange city and restrictions on
public transport might make part of the installation inaccessible without
advertising the fact.
```

```
A high-quality downport will usually have a similar transportation setup,
usually tied into the traffic network of the startown or nearby city. Again,
this is often used to subtly restrict access and contact between offworlders
and the local population. A quick monorail ride takes Travellers to the
capital but the capital-starport rail link terminates there and does not
connect to the rest of the city. The result is that visitors tend to remain in
the easily accessed part of the city and cultural pollution or smuggling is
kept to a minimum – all without walls, barriers and checkpoints.
```

### PLANETSIDE

```
Planetside transportation can vary enormously. Imported higher-tech
transport may be quite common among the elite or near the port but
as Travellers venture further afield they may find themselves having to
use the same means of getting around as the locals. There is also a
possibility that, away from the starport, little or no provision is made for
non-native species. This is unlikely to be due to racism as such; it is
more that budgets are always limited and whilst it may be desirable to
make portside transportation useable, a city 4,000 kilometers away that
receives a handful of offworld visitors in any given decade is unlikely to
spend money on making its rail net Virushi-friendly.
```

##### TL

```
There will be no planetside transportation network.
```

##### TL1-

```
Water provides the only mass or heavy transportation available on most
worlds. This may be sailing or rowed ships, or animal-drawn barges on
canals. Personal transportation relies on animals for riding or to pull carts.
Most of the population will never go farther than they can walk in a day
or two but the elite will have a degree of mobility. For most this means
riding animals or animal-drawn conveyances but imported vehicles are
possible if there is offworld contact. These must be maintained, of course,
so they become status symbols as much as conveyances and therefore
unlikely to be rented out to offworlders. There will be few roads suitable
for vehicles in any case.
```

##### TL3-

```
Long-distance travel on land uses powered railways for the most part,
providing a degree of personal mobility to all classes of society. Conditions
aboard these trains will be basic to say the least. Sometimes power plants
```

```
99
```

```
are bought in from offworld, especially when long-
distance lines are run through wilderness. It is
possible to find what looks like a low-tech
steam locomotive powered by a black-
boxed nuclear power plant, driving
a train made up mostly of locally
produced rolling stock with a
luxury car for VIPs.
```

Maritime travel is
similar in many
ways. Advanced
sailing ships
may be in use
or powered
vessels using
steam or combustion
engines. Again, it may not be
uncommon to find more advanced
power plants or navigation and communications equipment in use.
Often the local maritime shipping companies that can afford imported
equipment edge out those who cannot, coming to dominate the main
sea lanes whilst non-upgraded vessels operate elsewhere.

Ground vehicles are primitive but the creation of a road network suitable
for them makes importing offworld ground cars a viable option. These
are usually cheap and simple vehicles, sometimes styled to match locally
produced designs. Ground vehicles are normally only encountered in
major population centres as they have a short range and the infrastructure
to support them is primitive if it exists at all.

##### TL5-

Mass transportation becomes a possibility at TL5 and is widespread by
TL6 unless there is reason not to implement it. Land and water travel
generally use advanced developments of earlier concepts, although
a TL5-6 economy may be strong enough to permit a few advanced
vehicles to be bought offworld. Thus executives and government officials
may have access to grav transport, although this is rare and seen as a
symbol of extremely high status. High-quality offworld ground vehicles
are more common.

Air transportation is an option at TL4 but commercial exploitation of
the technology is unlikely before inexpensive and reliable aircraft are
developed. Although grav vehicles supercede aircraft as Tech Level
increases, on worlds where interstellar contact is common there is a
different trend. A world that develops technology in isolation will start with
primitive aircraft and improve them before finally developing grav vehicles
but one that is aware of grav technology or the capabilities of advanced
aircraft will take a different route. Usually this means buying aircraft that

100

```
are more advanced than local technology would allow but that can be
maintained, and then learning to replicate them. This usually occurs after
a few grav vehicles demonstrate the advantages and desirability of air
transport, almost a reverse of the normal process.
```

##### TL7-

```
Electric vehicles tend to supercede others by the early pre-stellar era,
even if fossil fuels were widely used before. Combustible liquid fuels
offer advantages at lower Tech Levels, not least because they allow
mechanical vehicles to be built, which require less advanced equipment
and knowledge to maintain. Once an electric-based infrastructure is in
place and batteries or fuel cells are light enough to be useful, electric
systems are generally seen as more desirable for environmental, safety
and efficiency reasons.
```

```
Air transport is common at TL7-8 and often mixed with imported grav
vehicles. A TL7-8 economy may be important enough at the interstellar
level to permit widespread importation of grav vehicles but in most cases
locally manufactured vehicles still predominate. Traffic control procedures
are in place for air travel but ground vehicles tend to be self-driven in a
frighteningly chaotic manner. Major cities may have automated ground
traffic control systems in place but this is rare and not always effective.
Most worlds with even moderate offworld contact tend to adopt standard
driving rules but there are always local exceptions and variations, which
might make local roads very interesting for unwary Travellers.
```

##### TL

```
Tech Level 9 is a turning point in transportation and not merely due to the
availability of grav vehicles. Internal transportation within cities tends to
take the form of overhead or underground light railways, often monorail or
```

```
101
```

high-speed maglev systems. Automated control makes these networks
extremely efficient, permitting trains to run very close to one another in
a manner that would lead to innumerable serious incidents without the
controls in place. Disasters are rare but, as a result of the small margins
in place, they tend to be very serious.

The use of grav vehicles requires city planners to think in three
dimensions to a greater degree. Buildings tend to be tall and more widely
spaced than in mid-tech cities, with rail ports a little above ground level
or underground, roads at ground level and grav ports on the sides or
tops of buildings. Automated traffic control is commonplace, with ground
and grav vehicles locked into a control grid that may not permit manual
control within city limits. This is sometimes used as a form of social
control, limiting access to parts of the city other than by way of easily
monitored rail routes.

Controls are less strict outside major population centres, although some
worlds have designated air lanes that grav vehicles are funnelled into.
This keeps skies elsewhere clear and ensures any accidents occur
on known paths, greatly simplifying search and rescue attempts. Grav
vehicles also ply back and forth between maritime ships and the shore,
supplanting helicopters and light aircraft in a variety of transport, rescue
and commercial roles.

##### TL10

As technology increases a world is better able to take part in interstellar
commerce at a profit, which translates to prosperity and availability
of more sophisticated vehicles in greater numbers. The pattern for
interstellar societies of this sort tends to be one of light local transport
and large-scale or heavy-duty intercity transit along a limited number of
routes. Thus vehicles, both grav and ground, tend for the most part to
be very light and suitable only for city roads. Some may not be manually
drivable at all.

Inter-city travel is typically by very high-speed rail links or sometimes
water transport using large surface ships and submarines. Bulk land
transportation is typically by way of railways but the availability of grav
technology makes it possible that there may be absolutely no ground-
level infrastructure outside cities. One alternative to rail transport is the
use of very large grav vehicles that may carry passengers and/or freight
at high speed at modest altitude. Other than these sleek wedges hurtling
overhead from time-to-time, the countryside may be entirely undisturbed
on many worlds.

102

##### TL11-13

```
Grav transportation becomes ever more prevalent and affordable as
technology improves, although there will still be some light vehicles in
use. These are typically short-distance runarounds and light transports
for goods, often running indoors or in enclosed transit tubes between
building complexes.
```

```
If a world has multiple orbital facilities such as factories or shipyards,
infrastructure begins to go vertical rather than horizontal. Once
enough shuttles and interface craft are available, it is actually cheaper
to go from one city to another in a high ballistic arc or by way of orbital
station than maintain a planetside transportation net. Cities and the
immediate area around them generally have a light transportation hub
but anything moving over any distance goes up first, then down to
the destination. It may be virtually impossible to get from one city to
another without going through an orbital shuttle terminal. At this point,
the world's cities are often more connected to the wider universe than
to one another; and citizens may visit other planets more often than
other cities of their homeworld.
```

##### TL14-15

```
Grav-supported structures first appear at TL11 but by TL14-15 gravitic
technology is usually an integral part of city design. Some structures
are built as floating modules, reconfiguring as required, and by TL14
whole cities may be supported by gravitic lifters. Such a city can go
anywhere on the planet, making ground transportation outside city limits
meaningless other than for the rural population. Society is almost entirely
'vertical' by this point, with small ground transport hubs around landing
areas but most transits are made by grav vehicle.
```

```
On these extremely high-tech worlds, the transportation network is a
complex matrix containing fixed ground installations and communities,
mobile cities and installations, and orbital facilities. Planning a journey is
a matter of knowing not merely how to get from A to B but also where B
will be located when you arrive. For the average citizen this is done by
selecting a destination from a menu and boarding the right grav transport
or shuttle. For Travellers, there is always the possibility of arriving at the
right place... only to find the destination city is not there anymore or the
building they intend to visit has flown off to another city.
```

```
Overall, it is safe to say that advancing technology makes it faster, easier
and generally safer to get around but also vastly more complex for
anyone taking responsibility for their own journeys. On the other hand,
high-tech citizens have less need to move around and when they do it is
made very easy for them providing they remain within the expected limits
of internal travel. It may be that as getting from place-to-place becomes
easier, the average person becomes less adventurous and more inclined
to stay at home. Small wonder, then, that many ordinary citizens consider
Travellers to be a bit strange!

## INCARNATE-CLASS STRIKE DESTROYER

Towards the end of the Fourth Frontier War (1082-1084), with heavy
losses among Fer-de-Lance and Chrysanthemum destroyer escorts,
a call went out from the Imperial Admiralty. They were searching for a
design at the same tonnage for a more powerful vessel. The Incarnate-
class strike destroyer was the answer provided by a collaboration
between Makhidkarun and GSbAG.

Engineers at Makhidkarun had designed an advanced gunnery artificial
narrow intelligence system. Their attempts to market it to the Imperial
Navy had met with, at best, lukewarm responses. In an attempt to prove
the software's value, executives of the company in the Deneb sector
approached their counterparts at GSbAG to craft a starship specifically
designed to utilise their advanced software. Instead of requiring 20
gunners, as other vessels of this size did, the design would incorporate
a state-of-the-art computer running their new ANI, saving both personnel
costs and space.

In a deliberate attempt to confuse enemy ship recognition systems,
the Incarnate was laid out similar to the older Fer-de-Lance with major
differences in the forward section. With its much heavier armor and orders
of magnitude greater firepower, any foe confusing them would pay dearly.
Those improvements, coupled with others, had a hefty price tag; the new
Incarnate vessels came in at almost twice the cost of the Fer-de-Lance.

Still, the Admiralty saw benefits in the design, especially after a stellar
performance shakedown cruise of the Retribution Incarnate, the maiden
vessel of the line. She left the drydocks at Magash (Deneb 0316) in
late 1087 and headed corewards to perform anti-piracy patrols. While
escorting a convoy of merchantmen, they were set upon by a pair of
800-ton Vargr frigates shortly after emerging from jump space. With
her stealth jump drives dampening her exit signature, they had failed
to notice the Retribution Incarnate's presence in the flotilla. Both Vargr
ships were well within her fusion bay's range before she opened up. The
fight lasted less than 10 minutes, ending with the complete destruction
of both corsairs. While the Retribution Incarnate did not escape without
being struck, she did escape unscathed. Her heavy armor protected
her from everything the corsairs could throw at her. After her return to
Magash, the Imperial Navy placed an order for 11 more.

Unfortunately, as the years passed and the Zhodani threat faded
from memory, the costs of the Incarnate came to seem increasingly
unnecessary. Coupled with unsettling reports concerning the advanced
synaptic processors in the gunnery system, the Imperial Navy chose

104

```
not to order any more. Others, however, had taken note of the vessel's
power and survivability. Orders started coming in from several private
concerns, particularly other megacorporations, looking for an escort
vessel. Several dozen were built and examples can be found throughout
the spinward reaches of the Imperium.
```

```
Of note, some of GSbAG's customers expressed concern with the
gunnery software. A variant of the class was built that replaced the heavy
fighter and its docking bay with a dozen additional staterooms. This
change, coupled with reducing the capabilities of the main computer and
removal of most of the advanced software, reduced the price by almost
a quarter billion Credits.

## MERTACTOR: GLISTEN'S GATEKEEPER

```
Mertactor (B562732-B) is a small, low-gravity world on the trailing side
of District 268. Its close links with the powerful economy of Glisten, and
position at the border of Imperial space, have earned it the nickname
'Glisten's Gatekeeper'. Whilst insignificant in its own right, Mertactor's
location makes it a strategic asset. It is generally considered to be part
of Glisten subsector's administrative apparatus and protected by the
Glisten subsector fleet.
```

```
Mertactor itself is habitable enough but lacks the mineral resources to
be a major industrial center. In addition to being fairly small, the world's
composition is primarily lighter minerals, resulting in low surface gravity.
Despite this, Mertactor is rated as having a standard atmosphere. This is
true at sea level but sea level is rather low on this world.
```

```
Mertactor has only 20% surface water coverage, most of it located in deep
basins. Air pressure at these altitudes is normal, so cities are located
around the shores of the seas. Inland, where the land rises, atmospheric
pressure drops away quickly due to a really large contrast between the
ocean and the highlands. The interior is habitable to those who have
acclimatised but someone ascending from a coastal city or stepping off
a starship with normal air pressure aboard would suffer altitude sickness
in most areas. Hills and mountain ranges are positively dangerous to
ascend and there are few flying creatures outside the ocean basins.
```

## HISTORY

```
Mertactor was colonized as part of a gradual spread outward rather
than a grab for important resources. At the time there was no intent that
this would be the Imperial border; Mertactor was just one more system
to be claimed. There was no large-scale investment or government-
backed settlement plan. Instead modest colony expeditions arrived over
the course of many decades. Each found a suitable spot and began
expanding, typically setting-up an agricultural or aquacultural base and
exporting foodstuffs to begin recouping the enormous cost of colonization.
```

```
Expansion was gradual, especially since those resources present were
hard to get at, and for many years the colonies received little outside
support or funding. During this time the original founders became a
hereditary ruling elite, with each major settlement developing into a sort
of proto-nation. Conflict was uncommon but destructive when it did occur.
```

### 109

The beginnings of 'modern Mertactor' lay in the discovery that whilst the
world lacked the sort of mineral wealth necessary for heavy industry –
iron, copper and the like – its surface rocks contained a high percentage
of compounds useful in electronics and light fabrication. These minerals
found a ready market in the asteroid communities of Glisten, beginning
a long economic and cultural partnership. A collective bargaining
agreement among colony directors became a world government that
regulated offworld exploitation of Mertactor's light-mineral wealth.

Income from mining operations funded a technological advancement
program, which also benefited from funds supplied by the Glisten
subsector administration. Much of the cost of the orbital Class B starport
came from this source, as part of a border security and trans-border
trade initiative. A secondary, and probably unintentional, outcome of this
project was the curtailment of expansion into District 268. With a robust
border control and trade hub in place at Mertactor, further expansion
would mean repeating the expense and was deemed undesirable. Thus
Mertactor became the 'gatekeeper' for District 268.

SOCIETY

The people of Mertactor are mostly humans of mixed stock, plus a
scattering of various alien races. All are Imperial citizens and culture
is very much 'standard interstellar' for the most part. This stems from
the amount of traffic passing through Mertactor's starport and close ties
with Glisten, ensuring the latest fashions, fads and social foibles reach
Mertactor's populace.

Society is, on the whole, well integrated and peaceable. The ruling
oligarchy is not particularly well liked but laws are liberal and standards of
living are quite high, so most people are content. There are opportunities
for advancement through talent and work, although there is a readily
apparent class divide between the upper echelons of society and general
citizens. It is possible to become very wealthy without acquiring much in
the way of status or social elevation.

Most of the population, numbering around 10 million, are concentrated
in the cities of the ocean basins. Bulk movement of goods uses sea
transport but most people travel between the cities in large grav transports
operated by one or another of the world's transportation companies.
Movement of this sort is commonplace, with the result that people from
one city will often take a job in another and settle down there. Over time
this has created a very even – some would say bland – social distribution.

Offworld trade is critical to the economy of Mertactor. Its orbital port is the
turnaround for many large cargo ships out of Glisten, with cross-border
commerce undertaken by smaller vessels or independent operators.
This has made Mertactor something of a trade hub, with ships crossing

### 110

```
out of the Imperium spinward in the direction of Collace or coreward
towards the Sword Worlds. Whilst technically part of the Spinward
Main, this chain of star systems is not well travelled by Imperial ships
due to political issues in the region. There are plenty of non-Imperial
vessels on the local spacelanes, however.
```

```
The majority of Mertactor's population are employed by businesses
connected with interstellar commerce or the support of installations.
Recruiters from merchant lines are always active at the starport, providing
a glamorous route out of the cities for those who want it.
```

```
Mining has become a major industry, although it is carried out in an unusual
manner. Rather than seeking veins of metals and heavy minerals, mining
on Mertactor is based around extraction processes applied to bulk ore.
The light minerals and compounds that make up most of the world's
exports are obtained by crushing and processing large quantities of rock,
extracting what is needed then discarding the remainder.
```

```
One method used is to strip-mine a promising area down to the depth
of a kilometer or more. This sort of operation would not be possible with
ground vehicles but gravitic ore barges can lift huge quantities and carry
it to the processing sites. There is always employment for skilled and
careful grav pilots alongside the usual array of machinery operators,
chemists and explosives experts. The mines do not employ many
unskilled workers but Mertactor's good education system ensures that
anyone wanting to learn a skill has the opportunity.
```

```
Some mining is also undertaken by surface crawlers, which break-up
the surface layers of rock with lasers and penetrator charges, then
scoop up and process the rubble. After passing through the bowels of
these vast vehicles the processed minerals are formed into ingots and
loaded aboard grav transports to be shipped to the industrial sector of
the downport.
```

```
The crawlers operate in the thinner air of the uplands much of the
time and are a hazardous workplace. Serious accidents are rare
largely because strict rules are in place about air quality and protective
equipment. Explosives and laser operators in particular are confined to
air-conditioned control rooms during their shifts and anyone going outside
is required to wear a compressor mask unless 'good air' indicators are
clearly visible.
```

```
STARPORTS
AND SPACEPORTS
The world's ruling elite have their own spaceports, small installations
off-limits to almost all traffic. Other traffic goes through the main Class
B starport. Mertactor has a central downport, divided into industrial,
commercial and public sectors. The latter also serves as a grav-port
```

-

### 112

```
for the world's transportation hub, linking to grav-ports at other cities.
The commercial sector is not large at the downport, as most business is
conducted in orbit. The majority of cargoes that pass through the highport
are split up and loaded onto ships to be taken to distant destinations;
only a small proportion descends to Mertactor's surface.
```

```
The orbital port is a large installation, with subdivisions according to
function. A portion of the station is taken up with facilities for the world's
system protection flotilla. Not coincidentally this is located next to the
private section reserved for the ruling elite and a small number of favored
merchant ship and liner operators. The 'Imperial Quarter' of the station
is in fact its largest component, serving trade ships from Glisten and ore
transport shuttles from planetside. The 'Border Quarter', as it is known,
is dedicated to serving cross-border traffic. It is well secured and smartly
operated, carrying out customs checks and spaceworthiness inspections
on vessels crossing into or out of the Imperium.
```

```
Mertactor's highport is a favored entry point to the Imperium for
legitimate and large-scale commercial traffic, not least because
its checks are stringent. A vessel that can show it came in through
Mertactor will avoid further checks deeper in the Imperium, whereas
one that bypassed the 'gatekeeper' might have its paperwork inspected
on several occasions thereafter.
```

```
Mertactor's yards and repair works are likewise a popular place for
non-Imperial vessels to receive maintenance or have new components
fitted. Work is always done to a high standard and Mertactor stamps on
the component listing can help a vessel retain its resale value. Just as
importantly, the yards have a good reputation for not cutting corners,
which is important to those who trust their lives to their vessel.
```

```
MERTACTOR SCOUT BASE
The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service maintains a small base on the
surface of Mertactor, high in the mountains where the air is very thin.
A handful of small ships operate out of it, mainly on routine surveying
and chart-maintenance operations. There are rumors that covert IISS
missions are launched into District 268 to conduct intelligence-gathering.
Small bases of this type support routine operations all across the
Imperium, ensuring that charts are kept up-to-date and shipping data
reaches central information repositories.
```

```
Scouts from the base are routinely assigned to the orbital port as
observers, where they collect information on the volume and type of
ships crossing the border. Scouts are sometimes spotted accompanying
customs teams during their routine boarding operations; again this is part
```

### 113

of the constant information flow that allows strategic planners to make
economic and military decisions.

MILITARY AND NAVAL

Mertactor has a small professional ground force, lightly equipped for the
defence of cities and installations. It has little capability to project power
beyond the ocean basins, although a grav-cavalry contingent exists
that can strike at any point on the planet. The military is supported by
forces loaned from the personal guards of planetary oligarchs and the
Mines Protection Service. The MPS is a private security organization
funded by contributions from the mining companies. Its personnel are
rescue workers, police and armed security all in one – professional and
competent but spread very thin.

In theory, these forces would form the backbone of a planetary defence
effort, with volunteer citizen militia rounding out the numbers. The militia
dates from the earliest days of colonization and remains well regarded,
although it is poorly equipped. Nevertheless, an attack on the cities of
Mertactor would result in thousands of volunteers, with at least some
basic training, answering the call to arms.

Offworld defence is considered more important than planetside capability.
The system defence flotilla is stronger than most and partially funded by
the Glisten subsector administration. In addition to armed customs boats
and wings of fighters, the system defence flotilla has three destroyer-
sized monitors. These are all conversions of old warships and not
equipped with state-of-the-art systems but they are quite capable of
dealing with most threats without a need for backup. Their presence is a
strong deterrent to piracy and raiding.

The Mertactor system is also patrolled by the Glisten subsector fleet,
which tries to maintain a guardship over the world and push patrols
through the system and into District 268. The subsector fleet is stretched
thin, however, and is not of high quality. Glisten is a 'safe' posting – both
in terms of action and the damage an incompetent officer can do – and
has long been something of a dumping-ground for personnel who cannot
be dismissed but cannot be put in charge of a warship in a sensitive area.

The majority of officers commanding ships in this region are not
incompetent but do tend to be over-promoted 'plodders' who achieved
command due to political connections. There are exceptions – the
Glisten subsector fleet has some really excellent officers, like all such
forces – but it is not uncommon to hear a port official wearily state that
'someone's cousin passed through today' when a visit by the navy has
been particularly tiresome and unproductive.

# VEHICLE HANDBOOKVEHICLE HANDBOOK

### 114

## VEHICLES OF THE IISS

```
The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service makes use of a wide variety
of vehicles. Some are improvised or obtained locally but, wherever
possible, standardised designs are used. Vehicles are obtained in large
numbers by regional scout bases and held as pools to be assigned as
needed. This approach reduces procurement and maintenance costs but
the budget for transport alone is still enormous.
```

```
Most IISS vehicles are clearly marked and use colour schemes associated
with the Scouts; typically mid-grey with yellow or high-visibility orange
for general-purpose vehicles and a darker shade without obvious high-
vis panels or decoration for operations in more dangerous areas. The
IISS 'Galloping Poni' logo is usually prominently displayed, although its
colouring and vibrancy are toned down where appropriate.
```

```
For covert or 'low-observable' operations the IISS prefers to use locally
obtained vehicles or generic designs that blend in with traffic in the target
area, or more stealthy versions of its standard vehicles. Equipment
assigned to these missions will not be marked with the Scout Service
logo, although it is usually traceable back to the IISS. The Scout Service
rarely engages in 'deniable' missions, although its personnel often seek
to avoid attracting attention.
```

IISS PERSONAL FIELD

## TRANSPORT DEVICE, GRAVITIC

```
Better known as a 'Scout grav belt', the PFTSD has many applications,
from safety when operating in high places or from open-topped vehicles,
to slipping into an area unnoticed. It is similar in many ways to a TL
civilian grav belt but has a few additional features.
```

```
The grav belt is more like a short garment, with legs almost down to the
knee and short upper sleeves. A harness within the garment distributes
weight well, although using a grav belt is a distinctly strange sensation.
Three small gravitic units provide propulsion as well as lift and can be
controlled by means of a belt unit or a chest pack. The latter allows for
chin or mouth control if necessary; most users prefer the belt controls
despite this occupying a hand and limits tasks that can be carried out.
```

### 115

Performance is similar to a civilian unit –
top speed is around 300 kilometers per
hour (High) in a standard atmosphere
but this is unpleasant for the user even
when wearing an enclosed helmet. Nap-
of-Earth speed is officially 40 kilometers
per hour (Very Slow) but this is a safety

limit set by the programmers of the control software. An override is
provided, allowing the user to fly at top speed if desired but since hitting
almost anything at over 100 kilometers per hour is likely to be both messy
and fatal, sticking to the programmed limit is advised.

Where the Scout Service grav belt differs from the standard civilian model
is in its additional capabilities. The standard unit can lift around 300
kilograms; the Scout Service variant uses heavy-duty lifters that increase
this to nearly 400 kilograms. An attachable lift-bag allows additional
equipment to be carried by a grav belt-equipped scout, although the
tendency of the bag to act like a pendulum can make flying tricky. Flyer
(grav) 2 is required to fly safely with a slung load in a carry bag. For every
point of skill less than this, DM-2 applies to all checks whilst airborne,
increasing to DM-3 if the load is more than 50 kilograms.

The belt harness is ruggedised, acting as Protection +3 in the event the
wearer comes under fire or encounters a sharp obstruction. This does
not protect from impact damage but will keep branches or jagged rocks
from making holes in the Traveller. The unit also features an enlarged
backpack, which contains one of the lifter units. The remaining space
can be used to carry whatever small items the scout might desire.

### 116

```
GRAV TUBE
The grav tube is essentially a two-person grav belt using the same
lifting units – only more of them – as the Scout Service grav belt. It falls
somewhere short of being a true vehicle but is useful for a variety of
reconnaissance tasks. On the other hand, it has few utility or transportation
applications due to its lack of cargo capacity.
```

```
The base of the grav tube is a disc, which contains the lifters, batteries,
and control electronics. The floor of the tube contains a set of light grav
plates similar to those used aboard starships, although much lighter
and less robust. These more or less cancel the motion of the vehicle,
ensuring a smooth ride under almost any conditions. A ring of lights on
the rim of the tube allows illumination of the ground around the tube, with
a more powerful directional light in the center of the ring.
```

```
The pilots stand rather than sit, leaning against a 'seating post' with their
feet secured by straps. The tube can be controlled by one person, so
occasionally an equipment package is
jury-rigged into the other position. In
this case a vertical arrangement
is necessary, with the
seating post acting as
a spine from which
wires, sensor devices or
whatever else is installed
can dangle. Liberal use of
industrial-strength duct tape
can create a resilient setup, but
one that cannot be quickly removed.
```

```

Grav Tube 15 80 Cr

Grav Tube

### 117

The canopy takes the form of an elongated bubble, with little room for
the occupants. Two Travellers can fit inside wearing light vacc suits –
TL12 and above – along with a few small items. The canopy is very
light and offers little resistance to damage. It is sufficiently well sealed
to allow operation down to 15 meters underwater, after which the door
seals will start to leak. At around 30 to 50 meters, the seals will fail
completely. However, scouts wearing underwater breathing gear can
use the tube as an underwater transport platform with the door left
unsealed. The unit's systems are, in theory at least, impervious to
water down to 100 meters or perhaps more. However, this application
is considered inadvisable and generally discouraged.

The grav tube's batteries are good for around 120 hours of low-speed
mobility, with a performance equivalent to that of the Scout Service grav
belt. During this time the unit can provide life support to two Travellers,
whilst recharging their personal vacc suits. However, endurance of the
life support unit is around 24 hours with two Travellers or 48 with one.
This limits the utility of the grav tube in hostile environments and as a
result it is generally assigned to teams working on habitable worlds.

IISS GRAV BIKE

Whereas the grav tube is basically a metal disc with the innards of a
couple of grav belts built into it, the grav bike is an altogether more
glamourous piece of equipment. That comes with a price – grav bike
accidents are a significant contributor to Scout Service mortality rates.

The IISS grav bike is a very expensive vehicle for its type. It is based on
the Ling-Standard Products Kaivii performance model, using a slightly
elongated frame and additional electronics. The bike is quite 'chunky' in
appearance but highly streamlined with a powerful yet efficient engine
capable of driving it at high subsonic speeds. Use of the autopilot is
highly recommended when operating at low altitude and the pilot and
passenger can do little but cling to their restraints if the bike has to
maneuver at such speeds.

The primary purpose of vehicles of this sort is reconnaissance and
surveying. The advanced sensor package can automatically generate
highly detailed maps including information on air pressure and
temperature, received sunlight and similar data, even when transiting
at several hundred kilometers per hour. The passenger can direct the
sensor package or use hand-held equipment stowed in lockers at the
side of the fuselage. Bikes can also deliver a ground team or move
them from one location to another very rapidly.

### 118

```
One unusual feature of the IISS grav bike is its possession of a life support
system. This cannot protect crewmembers on an open vehicle unless
they wear vacc suits or suitable clothing but can extend the duration of
a mission in a hostile environment by a considerable margin. A set of
emergency life-support clothing is carried for the pilot and passenger;
similar to softsuits used aboard may starships, these suits will hold up for
a nerve-wracking ride back to base after an incident but not much more
than that. If sealed helmets are used, the bike's life support equipment
allows users to operate at high altitudes or in very thin atmospheres
without a vacc suit.

```
IISS AIR/RAFT
A number of air/raft designs are used by the IISS, many of them standard
civilian designs painted grey and given a new logo. However, some
applications require an advanced-capability vehicle. The IISS thus
commissioned a variant of the Ling-Standard Products Venture 400 four-
seat air/raft for its own use, assigning licenses to favored companies to
produce these vehicles to the highest standard.
```

```
The IISS 'raft is a solid-body design, sealed against vacuum and can
provide life support to the vehicle's occupants for up to four days. There
is no airlock, however. Crewmembers will normally wear Scout field
dress and can don helmets before the doors are opened. The access
points are designed to mount to external doorways on Scout Service field
shelters and base modules, allowing crewmembers to pass in and out of
their base without needing to suit up.
```

```
The IISS air/raft is a powerful communications, sensor and processing
platform, often used to provide support to 'lesser' vehicles such as
ordinary (cheaper) air/rafts used by most of a mission's personnel. In
this role it is sometimes referred to as a command raft or support raft but
this does not mean any changes have been made – the IISS air/raft is
capable of fulfilling this role and more, as standard.
```

```
Capacity is two front-seat crewmembers and two back-seat passengers
who have less room to work. Indeed, anything requiring more movement
than tapping keys on a laptop console requires getting out of the back
seat. The small internal equipment locker is designed to be removable,
creating a small additional working space in the rear of the vehicle for
'backseaters' to use.

IISS AIR/RAFT

### 122

```
IISS SURVEY G/CARRIER
The G/carrier is a common paramilitary vehicle used by mercenary
units and some planetary armed forces. The Scout Service finds its
rugged construction useful for operations on worlds prone to meteorite
showers as well as regions made hazardous by their inhabitants. For
this reason the Scout Service version uses a different armor layout to
a paramilitary G/carrier. The upper surfaces are heavily protected and
angled to deflect incoming projectiles from above, providing protection
from micrometeorite strikes.
```

```
The IISS G/carrier fulfils a similar role to the command raft, although
with much greater survivability in a dangerous environment. It has the
same sensor package and normally carries no weaponry. The crew of
two have a reasonable amount of space in the driving cab and up to
eight personnel can be accommodated in the rear compartment. This
is a tight fit and if equipment must be carried or installed for use, the
complement must be reduced.
```

```
The IISS G/carrier has an airlock, unlike the air/raft, and a basic fresher
that sometimes serves as a 'light decontamination unit'. It is not suitable
for much more than washing dust off a suit but the heavy-duty filtration
and recycling unit can get rid of particles that would otherwise get into
all corners of the vehicle. This is important when operating on airless
worlds; 'dust' in this case is small rock fragments that can be sharp.
Personnel can be injured by such particles getting inside clothing and
equipment damaged by abrasion.
```

```
G/carriers are often converted to other roles by the Scout Service, such
as rescue vehicles or even construction units. Surplus Scout G/carriers
are popular with mining companies, for the same reasons they are used
by the Scouts.

## AMBUSH-CLASS HUNTER-KILLER CORVETTE

```
The Ambush-class was designed for a single purpose – to annihilate
small vessels. This it does admirably well and it can pose a serious threat
to larger ships. Whether acting as commerce raider or pirate-hunter, the
Ambush-class is a threat that must be taken seriously.
```

```
Sales of vessels with this level of combat capability are, in theory at
least, carefully regulated. However, this has not stopped multiple
examples falling into the hands of pirates and rogue governments. These
sometimes use the Ambush-class as the centrepiece of a raiding group,
with support vessels picking up loot or providing boarding parties to take
control of surrendered ships. The ability to vaporise any challenger is
attractive to many corsair leaders.
```

```
More conventionally, these corvettes are normally deployed on solo
operations, sometimes with an assigned supply vessel. In this role they
live up to their designation, hunting down small raiders and pirates.
Given that the average pirate vessel is a converted trader, few stand
any chance and even a small squadron can be scattered and dispatched
whilst its weapons do little more than char the corvette's paintwork.
```

```
Small flotillas are also used by minor governments as strike assets. A
handful of these vessels can pose a serious threat to a much larger
warship, although they would take heavy losses in return.
```

```
Jamming all this firepower into such a small hull was no easy task and
required the use of advanced miniaturization and optimization techniques.
The result was an extremely powerful small vessel with extensive
electronic warfare capabilities and the agility to intercept almost any
target. The same high levels of thrust also allow a quick strike-and-flee
attack in the event that the Ambush-class is required to take on a larger
and more powerful vessel.
```

```
The vessel is built as three cylinders, with the primary hull containing
living and working areas, fuel, main power plant and control spaces
whilst the smaller, shorter cylinders are given over mostly to a single
weapon and its supporting systems. The 'weapon' cylinders contain an
armored bay holding a miniaturised high-yield particle accelerator and
compact three ton fusion power plant capable of supporting its function
even if power feeds from the main hull are compromised. The power
```

### 125

plant and weapon bay are surrounded by armored bulkheads and a
small amount of fuel tankage.

The main hull contains around 75% of the vessel's tonnage. The
bridge is located forward, with an electronic warfare/fire direction room
immediately aft. Accommodation for senior crewmembers is provided
by three standard cabins and one high cabin, which also serves as an
office for the ship's commanding officer. The armory and briefing room
lie aft of this block, with a further group of cabins and the medical bay
accommodating the rest of the crew.

The ship's main power plant is surrounded by additional bulkheads,
although the jump and maneuver drives are not. This represents the
emphasis of the vessel – keeping the big guns in action is considered all-
important; survivability less so. However, with triple pulse laser turrets in
dorsal and ventral mounts on the main hull and a good electronics fit, the
Ambush-class is well protected against missiles and small craft, whilst its
