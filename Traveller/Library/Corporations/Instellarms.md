### Instellarms

Instellarms produces high-end military hardware, selling to mercenary forces, governments and similar bulk clients. It does not deal in single weapons but in high-volume equipping contracts that include weaponry, ammunition, spares and training. Instellarms supplies many of the better mercenary formations and some subsector dukes with their hardware, on a scrupulously neutral basis. Those with the cash can buy from Instellarms unless the sale would be illegal; a noble under Imperial censure or a mercenary unit with questionable paperwork will be refused a sale but those in good standing do not have to provide a reason for wanting to buy arms.

Founded just after the Civil War by a former mercenary commander,
Instellarms deals in weaponry and trained mercenary personnel.
'Excellent and only slightly overpriced' is the usual impression
consumers gain of Instellarms' products.
It is still not clear how the firm's initial stocks of arms and equipment
were obtained. There was a lot of surplus equipment on the market
after the Civil War, of that there is no doubt. However, exactly where
the money came from to buy it remains a mystery. The firm's early
history is riddled with infractions and outright flouting of Imperial
regulations on mercenary activities.
However, today Instellarms is almost disappointingly 'clean'. It deals
in large–quantity sales to legitimate governments and even has an
'ethical arms sales' policy in some regions. There are more than
ethical reasons why Instellarms will not sell to certain governments
and organizations, however. Instellarms has several very lucrative
contracts with the Imperial armed forces and these greatly outweigh
the benefits of sales to rogue states.
Instellarms does not normally operate 'gun shops', though some
of its subsidiaries do. A firm with contracts to provide hundreds of
thousands of gauss rifles to the Imperial Army need not concern
itself with selling a handgun to a passing Free Trader crewman.
However, Instellarms does maintain large facilities on various
worlds. These offer registration and accreditation for mercenary
units and individual personnel, and often have contracts available.
Weaponry can be test–fired and purchased at these outlets, though
small orders are discouraged by high unit prices compared to bulk
orders.
