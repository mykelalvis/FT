## INTRODUCTION

The sector of space named the Spinward Marches lies far from the capital of the Third Imperium, many months from the Imperial Court and the close supervision of the Emperor. The Marches are both a backwater and a frontier, an under–developed region bordering upon independent space and less–than–friendly neighbors.

Great events have unfolded in the Marches. In the history of the
Marches there have been four Frontier Wars against the Zhodani
Consulate and its allies; innumerable skirmishes with Vargr raiders
from Trailing. It was here that Admiral Plankwell began his bloody
bid for the Iridium Throne and ushered in the Imperial Civil War,
and it was his successor as Sector Admiral of the Spinward Marches,
Admiral Arbellatera, who took the sector fleet to [[Capital]] and ended
the matter. Further back in history, it was the Marches that gave a
home to the ancestors of the Sword Worlders, and it was here that
a Darrian experiment caused their star to go nova.

The Spinward Marches is an eventful region. High–tech industrial
worlds are interspersed with all but uncharted backwaters and there
are many forces at work. The great powers of the Third Imperium
and the Zhodani Consulate jockey for position as independent
systems align themselves as best suits their purposes. The Imperial
Megacorporations and smaller business entities engage in cut–
throat competition while mercenary forces never seem to be short
of work.

The Marches are a place where skills can be sold and knowledge can be
dangerous; where an independent starship or a band of adventurers
can make a profit between the cracks in the system. There is always
a job going... cash in hand and do not ask questions.

It is 1105 by the Imperial calendar, a time of subtle change and great
potential. Events here in the Marches may resound all the way to
Capital, but this is where it'll happen. This is where the opportunities
are to be had; this is the place to be.

Welcome to the Spinward Marches!

###### CONCEPTS & TERMINOLOGY

This book uses certain concepts which will be explained below. Most
of these are standard throughout all Traveller material published
during the game's long history and apply equally to any other
Traveller material.

## The Official Traveller Universe (OTU)

The Official Traveller Universe (OTU) was first created in the
1970s. It was gradually added to and developed through many
years to become the standard setting for Traveller games. The
body of information set in the OTU published over the years has
become known as the 'Traveller Canon'. However, since canon was
developed by different people at different times there are inevitably
a few inconsistencies and even contradictions.

This means that at times it was necessary to choose between
conflicting versions of 'canon' or to eliminate concepts that jarred
with either the remainder of the setting or with common sense.
Where this was done any changes made as a result are as subtle
as possible.

However, canon is something that game designers worry about. It
is a baseline used to ensure that published materials do not clash
or contradict one another. Once an individual Traveller Referee
starts running a game, the Official Traveller Universe becomes that
Referee's Traveller Universe. Fans often use abbreviations like MTU
(My Traveller Universe) and YTU (Your Traveller Universe) when
discussing this.

What this all means is that once you get your hands on this book,
the Traveller Universe (TU) becomes YOURS. You decide what
concepts to ignore, which ones to use and which ones to replace with
something that fits the setting you want to play in more closely.

There are also a few places where something is not mentioned that
can be found in another supplement covering the same area. Unless
it is specifically said that it is not there, there is no assumption that
it does not exist. That is up to you. If you have an old magazine
that says that planet X has a moon made of cheese strings and it
has been omitted here, you get to decide whether you want cheese–
string–moon in or out of your TU. This sourcebook is a starting
point, not a straitjacket.

There are, however, certain concepts that are found in almost every
possible variant TU. These are listed and explained overleaf.

IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION^3

Charted Space
The region that has been explored by humans is referred to as
Charted Space. Within this region there are many areas that are
quite densely populated and well travelled by starships. Other areas
are backwaters or have never been more than cursorily mapped.

The most prevalent sentient species in Charted Space are humans,
and the most powerful human state is the Third Imperium. There
are many other great and small powers plus independent worlds
and political groups within the region.

Of course, there are few areas about which absolutely everything
is known, and even if an area had been properly explored the data
may not be publicly available or the public version may be entirely
incorrect. There is still plenty to be discovered even in the settled
regions of Charted Space, and beyond the core areas many mysteries
still await discovery.

Directions in Space
Directions like North or Southwest are meaningless in space even
on a relatively small scale. Within a star system most objects move
in orbit about the star or a planet, and movement can be defined
with reference to a suitable point. Most bodies in a star system orbit
in the same general plane, known as the Ecliptic. One direction at
ninety degrees to the ecliptic is defined by convention as 'System
North' or 'Up' and the other as 'System South' or 'Down'.

Most movement within a system is defined in terms of being
towards or away from a given body, usually the main world of the
system or the star itself. The terms 'In–System' (towards the inner
planets of the star system and the star itself) or 'Out–System' (away
from the star) are also used. These are rather general terms but as
navigation in three dimensions, whether along an orbital path or
a straight line, is a complex business they serve well enough for
casual conversation. Of course, starship astrogators produce rather
more detailed course plots using highly advanced mathematics...

Outside the confines of a star system, some frame of reference is
needed to indicate relative positions. By convention the following
terms are used:

- Coreward refers to the direction towards the galactic core.
- Rimward is the opposite direction to Coreward, towards the
    galactic rim.
- Spinward means in the direction in which the galaxy is
    rotating.
- Trailing is the opposite of Spinward; away from the direction of
    galactic rotation.

Note: Some Imperial citizens also use the term Coreward to mean
towards the Imperial heartworlds, the 'Imperial Core'. This usage
is generally obvious from context. For example, it should be fairly
obvious that a magazine called Coreward Gazette deals with matters
in the Imperial central region and not the center of the galaxy several
thousand light–years away.

Distances in Space
Concepts like meters and even kilometers are inadequate in the face
of the vast distances in space. Over relatively short distances such
as in orbital space near a planet thousands or millions of kilometers
are used as a measure. Larger distances in–system are measured
using the Astronomical Unit, or AU. This is based on the distance of
Earth's orbit from the Sun, and is about 160,000,000km.

The light–second is sometimes also used, defined as the distance
light travels in a vacuum in one second. This is 299,792,458m,
usually rounded to 300,000,000m. One AU is 499 light–seconds.

Over greater distances still larger measures are needed. The light–
year (defined as distance light travels in one standard Earth year)
is sometimes used. It equates to 63,241 AU. More commonly the
Parsec (3.26 Light–years) is used as this is the maximum distance
that can be covered in a single Jump by a Jump–1 capable starship.

Most Traveller starmaps use a system of 1 parsec to 1 hex.

Astrographic Features
Charted Space contains no major astrographic features such as
black holes and only one rather unimpressive nebula. It does,
however, have a few anomalies and interesting features. Stars tend
to occur in groups (termed clusters) or long snaky chains (known
as Mains). Trade and commerce tends to move along the mains as
they allow vessels to navigate between systems with ease. Crossing
to another main requires a ship with a longer range or some means
to refuel in deep space.

Many clusters and segments of a main have their own cultural,
astrographic or economic identity. These are sometimes named,for
example the Bowman Arm in the Spinward Marches is a segment of
the Spinward Main centring on the Bowman system.

The empty space between clusters or mains is sometimes referred
to as a rift. These small rifts are usually no more than 1–4 parsecs
wide and are hardly worthy of the name. Even the Great and Lesser
Rifts of Charted Space are nothing compared to the vast gulf
between spiral arms of the galaxy. However, they are a significant
navigational obstacle to vessels using Jump drive.

A few odd features have been reported, though some may be nothing
more than wild spacers' tales. They include a rosette system of five
equidistant worlds orbiting a common star. This could not have
occurred naturally. Nor could the rumored ringworld located in
the Vargr Extents. There are also a number of broken planets and
shattered moons that seem to indicate a war of titanic proportions
in the distant past.

Star Systems and Mainworlds
Most star systems are identified by their mainworld. That is, the most
important planet, moon or planetoid belt in the system. This is for
the simple reason that people visit worlds, not stars. The mainworld
of a system is usually the most habitable, but not always. It may be
a moon of a gas giant or a planetoid belt, but most commonly it will
be a planet of some kind.
The nature of the Jump drive is such that unless there is a good
(usually economic) reason to visit the other worlds of a system,
vessels tend to ply between mainworlds in different systems rather
than the less important worlds in the same system. It takes as long
to Jump a few hundred AU to an outsystem rockball as it does to
travel to the much more important mainworld of the star system a
parsec away.
For this reason the remainder of a star system can be quite
underdeveloped, though in many cases there will be outposts,
mining stations and other installations, not all of them legal or
above–board, scattered about the various bodies and planets of a
given system.
Starports and Spaceports
By convention, a world has only one Starport but can have many
Spaceports. The designation Starport is given to the world's main
port, where most commercial and passenger traffic goes. Any
other port is designated a Spaceport. This can cause problems on
Balkanized worlds where several governments exist; most will claim
that their port is the main one.
Usually, but not always, the Starport is the best port on the planet
and others will be of inferior types. Normally there will be a main
port accompanied by a 'Startown' which is often the planetary
capital. The Startown is usually geared to offworld visitors and
doing business with other star systems, and may have more relaxed
attitudes or even laws than other regions of the planet. This is not
always the case however.
The Imperium considers that a Starport (but not usually a Spaceport)
is Imperial territory, so that Imperial law and not local law applies
there. In practice there is often a compromise in place, with shared
jurisdiction in terms of law enforcement. Law levels vary from place
to place, but the typical well–regulated starport tends to restrict
visitors to sidearms – this may be more or less than people are
permitted to own or carry outside the port.
The Startown is planetary territory, not part of the port, and
theoretically local law applies there. However, the Startown is
often a buffer zone between world and port, and if there are radical
differences in law level then sometimes the Startown has a special
set of laws in place within its limits.
The groundside part of a starport or spaceport is termed the
'Downport'. There may also be an orbital component termed the
Highport. In some cases this is big enough to be a city in space, in
which case there may be no need to go groundside at all if business
can be conducted in orbit.
As an example, an important system might have a large Highport
serving a Downport at the capital. Big ships dock at the Highport and
use shuttles for passenger and cargo transport; smaller vessels can
land if they choose. From the orbital Highport it is possible to go to
the main Downport or to Spaceports in each of half a dozen cities,
plus a commercial port serving an industrial complex somewhere.
Meanwhile there is a dedicated military port, a small government
port and a couple of spaceports serving small installations on other
bodies in the system,for example a mining colony on a moon of one
of the gas giants. A minor system, on the other hand, may have little
more than a shed and a marked landing area.
Faster–Than–Light Travel and Communica-
tions
In the Traveller universe there is no Faster–Than–Light (FTL) radio
or other instantaneous communication medium. The only way to
get a message to a given point is to send a starship there. In civilised
areas a system of courier ships and 'express boats' (Xboats) is used
to maintain communications, with mail and additional information
moving aboard commercial starships.
This creates a system not unlike Earth in the Age of Sail, whereby a
vessel on a distant station might be months from base and the orders
of its captain's superiors. Colonial governors, corporate officials,
lawmen and all sorts of other individuals find themselves waiting for
literally weeks if instructions are requested. Thus individuals have to
take responsibility and act as they think best.

FTL travel is possible using the Jump drive. Essentially a ship enters
Jumpspace and stays there, cut off from the rest of the universe for
roughly a week. It then returns to normal space some distance form
its starting point. A Jump–1 rated ship can travel up to 1 parsec in
a single Jump (which always takes more or less a week, regardless
of distance). Higher Jump–rated ships can cover greater distances
but despite the occasional rumor or secret prototypes and alien
vessels, reliable Jumps of more than 6 parsecs have not been
achieved.

It is possible to travel more than 6 parsecs in a single Jump, but
this is only one of several possible outcomes of what is known as a
Misjump. Misjumping can be a slight inconvenience, bringing out
the vessel a bit late or a few AU from its intended emergence point...
or it can result in an unpredictable Jump of highly variable duration
and distance.

There are no reliable reports of a vessel surviving a Misjump that
carried it more than 36 parsecs, though there are the usual wild
spacers' tales. It is assumed that those vessels that Misjumped and
were not seen again were destroyed. It is definitely known that some
vessels have been destroyed by Misjump accidents since in some
cases debris was found.

Dating Systems
Many, indeed most, worlds have their own local dating system and
many have more than one. However, the standard Imperial calendar
is in use on most worlds. Within the Imperium it is generally the
main dating system, and even outside it is often used as a handy
frame of reference.

The system uses a seven–day week (named Oneday, Twoday and
so forth) and a 365–day year. Dates within the year are given as
Day–Year. For example, 054–1105 is the 54th day of the 1105th year
since the founding of the Third Imperium.

Currency
The standard unit of currency within the Third Imperium is the
Credit. Tendered as coins, notes or high–value credit plaques,
Credits are accepted in most places but may have to be converted
to local currency in some regions. The Credit is widely accepted
beyond the Imperial frontier and is sometimes used as a stable
baseline currency to base local transactions upon.

Since there is no faster–than–light communication system other
than sending a message aboard a starship and waiting at least
a fortnight for an answer, electronic banking is not widely used
beyond a local level. Local systems will allow users to draw against
funds deposited on–planet or assets pledged as collateral. Large
and reputable organizations are generally permitted to draw funds
against their reputation, so to speak, as local loans which are then
paid in due course.

Large transactions may use hard currency or bearer bonds, or may
involve letters of credit. Another common way to handle large
transactions is to use physical or economic assets as currency – for
example, the ownership of stock in a major corporation or even a
starship may be transferred as part of a deal, perhaps as security
while the banks on two different planets sort out the details of the
cash transaction or as the actual payment.

Operating a financial system over several parsecs and with a lag of
weeks is a problem. Faith in the value of the Credit allows cash to be
used, which simplifies the problem of electronic transfers between
institutions that might be weeks apart by fast courier.

Language
Most people throughout Imperial space and in the Solomani
Confederation speak Galanglic as their first language, and it is widely
understood elsewhere. Local dialects and accents vary considerably,
and on some backwater worlds basic Galanglic is so mangled that it
sounds like a foreign tongue. However, as a rule a Galanglic speaker
can make himself understood anywhere.

Various pre–Starflight Terran languages are in use in some areas, as
well as the native tongues of alien races. Vilani is spoken in cultural
Vilani areas, and some purists will even refuse to speak any other
language. This is rare outside the immediate region around Vland
however.

Travellers and Travelling
The vast majority of people in the Traveller universe never go far
from their home, at least in astrographic terms. They might go to
other cities on the same world or to an orbital station; perhaps even
to an outsystem colony, but even this is relatively unusual. People
only move about for a reason and if there are adequate opportunities
at home then the average citizen will stay there.

Some individuals attend offworld universities and a percentage of
those go on to dwell for a time or even settle permanently on a
different world. Others serve in the military or with a big corporation
that may move them around from time to time. Others move
from world to world as part of their job; diplomats, roughnecks,
entertainers and a wide range of other types of people will go from
place to place to follow the paycheck or assignment.

However, these people are not Travellers (with a capital T). That
distinction is reserved for a certain type of individual, and the
connotations are not always positive. There is no precise definition
of a Traveller; it is instead a label applied to a person who moves
around a lot by choice as much as out of necessity.

Travellers are varied. Some are simply well–off tourists, some are
mercenaries or freelance professionals of various types. Others
work aboard small starships unaffiliated with any government or
major shipping line. Some are pursuing a personal goal which
might be anything from scientific research to vengeance. Some just
travel for the fun of it and a handful are professional adventurers
who undertake dangerous jobs for high–paying clients.
What these people all have in common is an apparent inability
to put down roots. Most will eventually (or intermittently) settle
down somewhere but for the present time they wander about.
Travellers have a bad reputation in some quarters as unreliable, or
as troublemakers who poke into things better left alone.
In other places they are welcomed either for the skills they can
provide during their stay or for the Credits they will pay for their
accommodation and recreation. Travellers can be a useful temporary
asset to some governments and organizations – resourceful,
intrepid and deniable – or they can be nothing but a nuisance. It
depends very much on the individuals concerned – there are few
hard–and–fast rules concerning Travellers.
Free Traders
Considered by some to be a subset of Travellers, Free Traders are
something similar but slightly different. The term is applied in
different contexts to a class of starship and to the personnel that
crew them. It is also loosely applied to anyone or any ship engaging
in a general type of activity.
Thus 'Free Trader' can define a specific type of starship, a small
merchant craft suitable for free–trading operations, or it could refer
to any ship or crew engaging in opportunistic independent tramp
trading without a set route.
Most of the goods and passengers that are moved around the
Marches travel aboard large freighters, freightliners or dedicated
passenger ships. These are generally tied to a set route and call
regularly at their stopovers. Smaller ships ply the same routes and
less profitable ones, picking up the slack in the system. Many minor
trade routes are not profitable at standard freighting rates, but it is
considered desirable to have vessels on the route. The result is the
subsidized merchant.
The 'subbie' is both a specific class of ship and a general activity.
Subsidized routes are partially paid for by commercial activity and
partly by government money from local worlds or trade alliances
that feel the need for a regular service. Note that while ships of the
class termed Subsidized Merchants are well suited to such activity,
they can do other things such as free trading, and a subsidized route
can be plied by craft of other types.
Although the big shipping lines and the subsidized routes move
most of the cargo and passengers, there is some slack in the system;
enough that a small merchant ship can make an honest living, just
about.
These Free Traders wander on and off the main shipping lanes
engaging in whatever commercial activity seems to offer the best
prospects. This could be a charter to deliver something or carry out
a mission, standard–rate freighting, a mail contract, a short–term
naval auxiliary commission or speculative trade whereby the crew
buy a cargo and try to sell it at a profit, rather than shipping other
people's goods for a fee.
Most of the time a Free Trader can get by, with lean patches and the
occasional bonanza caused by a good speculative investment or a
lucrative urgent job. However, it does not take much to drive a Free
Trader into the red. A crew that are in need of funds may be inclined
to take risks or break the law. They might go down the route of risky
high–stakes speculative trade in restricted items or take a job they
know is going to be trouble.
Some crews may cross the line into illegal activity ranging from the
relatively minor such as smuggling (the 'small package trade') or
trafficking in illegal but not very harmful items all the way through
to outright piracy. The majority of pirates are not career buccaneers
but are 'ethically challenged merchants' who cross the line between
legitimate commerce and piracy when it suits them.
Free Traders tend to frequent backwater ports where the markets
are not sewn up by the big shipping lines. These can be dangerous
places so crews are usually made up of clued–up and 'handy'
individuals. Armament (personal and ship–mounted) is common,
as is a willingness to use it at need.
This does not mean that all Free Trader crews are down–at–heel
desperadoes one step removed from pirates; most are professional
spacers who sometimes frequent dubious places and take
appropriate precautions. However, it can be hard to tell streetwise
good guys from the bad apples.
The Travellers' Aid Society
Ironically, while many Travellers are members of and make use of
The Travellers' Aid Society (TAS), it was set up to assist the more
mundane traveller (no capital T). TAS maintains a chain of hostels
which vary considerably in quality from excellent hotels to draughty
shacks, and provides information to its members about local
conditions.
While TAS was created with the needs (and money) of well–off
businesspersons and minor nobles in mind, it has gradually come
to cater to a more ordinary class of person. Anyone can rent a room
in most TAS facilities, but the Member's Lounge and the special
facilities (which generally include accurate and up to date local
information on what's really going on) are reserved for members.
Membership can be awarded for service or, as cynics claim, for
being someone TAS would like to have as a member. It can also be
bought for a straight one million Credits, though some candidates
are 'blackballed' after paying for various reasons.

TAS publishes JTAS – the Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society.
This is a well–respected news and current events journal, with
features on interesting people and places across Charted Space.
The 'open' version can be bought by anyone and helps fund the
reporters and the society itself. Members have access to a slightly
more comprehensive version and the JTAS archives, which are very
extensive and contain information on a wide range of subjects.

TAS is in no way a secret society, nor is it a 'universal siblinghood of
Travellers'. There is no guarantee that an influential person staying
in a TAS hostel will want to talk to a down–at–heel adventurer just
because they are both TAS members. However, it at least provides
a place where interesting and perhaps useful people can be met if
the Traveller makes the right approach. Sometimes job offers and
information come through the TAS network and are not seen by
outsiders.

Overall, TAS is very useful to Travellers. Whether it is worth spending
a million credits on is another question entirely.

###### THE MAIN INTELLIGENT SPECIES

Humans, of one sort or another, are the main intelligent race in the
Spinward Marches and much of Charted Space in general. There
are, however, several other major and minor intelligent species.

The term 'Major Race' has two meanings. Imperial scientists apply
the term precisely to mean any race or species that invented the
Jump Drive independently. In this context a Minor Race is a species
that either received Jump–drive technology from another source
(e.g. buying it or reverse–engineering an example found in a wreck)
or has not developed interstellar travel at all.

However, the terms are sometimes used rather more loosely to refer
to the power and prominence of a species. By this definition some
'major' races are actually quite unimportant while some 'minor'
species are very influential.

Humaniti
Exactly when 'Humanity' became 'Humaniti' is no longer known.
While the word 'humanity' has various meanings, 'Humaniti' has
only one – it is the name of the dominant species in the Third
Imperium.

There are three Major and many Minor (by the definitions above)
human races. All are offshoots of the same basic genetic stock
and most, but not all, can interbreed. There are also vast numbers
of cultural groups who may seem very different from the rest of
Humaniti but are in fact genetically identical. Sometimes these are
mistakenly identified as minor human races.

To truly be a minor race rather than a social or cultural group requires
some significant genetic difference from the rest of Humaniti. This
can occur gradually, as a result of a restricted gene pool over many
millennia or as an adaptation to harsh conditions. It can also be
deliberate. Some minor human races have been deliberately altered,
and in a few cases this was quite radical. A few altered themselves,
some were adapted as part of colonial programs and some were
changed by outside influence.

It is generally thought that the ancestral homeworld of Humaniti in
all its many forms is Terra, or Old Earth. Other locations have been
postulated, but currently the most widely–accepted theory holds
that humans originated at a single point, which was most likely to
be Terra, and spread across the galaxy in the distant past, becoming
disparate racial and cultural groups before the modern period.

The spread of Humaniti is generally attributed to a group known
as the Ancients, a powerful and technologically advanced species
or group which dominated the region 300,000 years or so in the
past. Some claim that these Ancients were in fact humans; others
suggest that humans were servitors or allies of the Ancients who
were left behind when the Ancients disappeared.

Whatever the reasons, modern Humaniti displays an amazing
diversity of cultures, philosophies, religions, and personalities. As
a result, some of the most alien cultures encountered are Human.
Humans are also amazingly adaptable, many times even able to
fully integrate into alien run societies. Despite this diversity, all
human races are amazingly similar in their physiology, even those
who have been genetically engineered, such that most Human races
are capable of interbreeding with each other.

There is considerable variety in skin tone, eye and hair colour,
height, build and similar physical characteristics. Presumably this
is because the originally transplanted humans were very diverse.
It does mean that it is not possible to tell by looking at someone
whether he or she belongs to any given racial group unless there are
cultural clues. Dress, mannerisms, accents and such like will usually
indicate a person's cultural origin.

SOLOMANI
The Solomani often claim to be the true 'root stock' of Humaniti as
they developed on Terra itself. Others point out that these are the
people who were left behind when humans went or were taken to
the stars during the Ancients period.

Culturally, the Solomani tend to towards being explorers and
inventors, and are highly individualistic. Their societies tend to be
in a constant state of change and development, which is not always
positive. However, as a result of this the Solomani have expanded
far out from their distant home and their cultural enclaves can be
found almost anywhere, often melded with local societies.

There is a Solomani state, named the Solomani Confederation,
which broke away from the Imperium just over a century ago and
retained its independence, more or less, in what became known as
the Solomani Rim War. Although Terra and the surrounding regions
were retaken by the Imperium, the subsequent peace settlement
created the Solomani Confederation, which has its own cultural
outlook.
Most humans of Solomani descent feel little sympathy with the
Solomani Confederation. It is physically and culturally distant.
Indeed, the Solomani Confederation is sometimes seen as 'the bad
guys' by Imperial citizens as it fought a war against the Imperium
in recent history.
Solomani Confederation influence is low to non–existent in the
Spinward Marches, though there are many Solomani cultural groups.
These Imperial–Solomani are first and foremost Imperial citizens,
though they may display elements of old–earth cultures. Sometimes
these are vastly distorted or idealised versions of a pre–interstellar
Terran culture; often they are a product of local conditions.
VILANI
The Vilani are more culturally homogenous than the Solomani
or most other large human groups. According to the best
current theories, the Vilani are descendants of humans who were
transplanted or made their way to the world of Vland during the
Ancients period. After a long and troubled period struggling against
their homeworld, which was only borderline–habitable to humans,
they eventually made their way back into space.
The Vilani were probably the first humans to regain the stars after
the Ancients departed. They gradually built an empire that is said
to have included 15,000 worlds. Known as the Ziru Sirka, or Grand
Empire of Stars, this Vilani empire is sometimes referred to as the
Vilani Imperium or the First Imperium. It was highly conservative
and restricted the development of many worlds in the name of
stability. This seems to have worked; the Ziru Sirka lasted for over
7,000 years.
Vilani tend to be highly conservative in outlook. Tradition is a
powerful force in society, and traditional methods are applied to
most problems. Of course, 7,000 years is long enough to have
developed an effective traditional response to most situations.
Vilani society is very group–oriented and is built around guilds
and bureaus that run the various services needed to keep a society
working. Some of these are today Imperial Megacorporations
with fingers in many pies all across the Imperium. However, the
very nature of Vilani society is such that cultural Vilani are not as
widespread as Solomani. Small groups can to be found almost
anywhere but the main concentrations are located in the region
around Vland.
Pure–blood racial Vilani tend to live very long lives. However, this
trait is heavily diluted by interbreeding. Mixed–blooded Vilani will
tend to live only marginally longer than Solomani or any other
mixed–race human. Most cultural Vilani are not pure–blooded
members of the Vilani 'race'.
Typical Vilani view scientific and technological progress with disdain.
Stability is more important than progress, and societies dominated
by Vilani culture will be very resistant to change. The Vilani culture
is dominant in a fairly large area of the Imperium. In these areas
new initiatives from [[Capital]] tend to meet considerable resistance.
Conversely, Vilani regions tend to be stable, orderly and, usually,
prosperous.
Within the Spinward Marches, the Vilani culture is not dominant
except in small areas on a few worlds. Most humans in the region
do not hold traditional Vilani views.
ZHODANI
The Zhodani are the third major human race. Their home region
is to Spinward–Coreward of the Spinward Marches and has never
been part of the Imperium. Indeed, four major wars have been
fought between the Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium.
The Zhodani Consulate is the largest of the human states and also
the oldest. It is extraordinarily stable by human standards, and
according to available evidence, internally peaceful. The Consulate
has remained stable in terms of size for many hundreds of years; it
is claimed that further expansion was curtailed when the Consulate
reached the maximum size that could be effectively governed.

Relations with client states along the borders are reportedly
good, though the distances involved mean that little information
is available to Imperial analysts. It is known that the Zhodani are
active in one area. Several large and many small expeditions have
been launched over the centuries, all aimed down a corridor of
space leading directly towards the Galactic Core. The purpose and
result of these 'Core Expeditions' remains unknown.

The Zhodani are the only major human group to make extensive
and open use of psionic powers. Testing for abilities is routine
and apparently mandatory, and is central to the Zhodani system of
government. The upper echelon of society are nobles, who are the
only class entitled to vote in what is ostensibly a democratic system.
Most of the work of governance is undertaken by the Intendant
class, with the majority of the population being Proles.

Imperials view the open use of psionics with distrust and distaste,
and dislike the idea that there is little upwards mobility for the
average Prole. The only route is via psionics. All Prole children are
tested for potential and if they have a suitable talent, they are taken
away from their parents and placed with an Indentant family. The
new Intendant will be raised in what amounts to the middle classes
and can even hope to be elevated to the nobility.

Becoming a noble can be achieved by service or by victory in the
three–yearly Psionic Games. Nobles wield the real power in Zhodani
society. They both lead and govern, and elect from among their
number the Consuls that rule all of Zhodani space.

This all seems very unfair to the typical Imperial citizen, who is used
to at least the concept of upwards mobility by various means. The
idea that a Zhodani might be reading his mind is also unsettling.
However, to Zhodani this is the natural order of things. The Proles
are well looked after and are given fulfilling tasks to do; their
happiness and welfare are important concerns of the Intendants
and Nobles.

Here, too, the average Imperial finds Zhodani society a bit sinister.
Not only are social sciences developed to a high level but there is an
organization named _'Tvarchedl_ dedicated to finding unhappy people
and 'curing' them of what is seen as a disease. Although their name
translates as Guardians of Morality, most Imperials refer to the
_'Tvarchedl_ as 'thought police'.

To the Zhodani, unhappiness is a disease and it is a comfort to
know that there are people whose job it is to find out what is making
the person miserable and either help him adjust his life to eliminate
the cause of his unhappiness or else to make the mental adjustment
needed to overcome him.

Most often, _'Tvarchedl_ operations take the form of helpful advice
and psionically–assisted counselling. Mind–altering is actually
much less common than Imperials imagine. It is usually reserved
for those who are resistant to the gentler processes, such as those
who have a mental illness, or those who request it because they feel
it is the only way to deal with their problems.

Most Zhodani are appalled by Imperial society, which they see as
a chaotic mess of deceit and lies in which people are permitted
or actually forced to live in a way that makes them miserable. To
the Zhodani, this is neglect or abuse of the common populace
and no amount of rhetoric about the free pursuit of happiness
or advancement can conceal the fact that most people never find
either and are forced to make the best of a fairly unpleasant set of
circumstances.

An Imperial citizen who is unhappy in his office job is theoretically
free to get a different one, but may find it impossible. He or she
might also not realise exactly what it is that is causing their distress
and end up pursuing pointless goals in the mistaken belief that this
will help. A Zhodani in the same position would receive a visitor
from the 'Tvarchedl , who would help him or her figure out exactly
what was causing the unhappiness. The 'thought policeman' would
then either offer advice on how to eliminate that factor from the
person's life, or would actively help the person find a different job
where they would be happier. If that required retraining, then the
'Tvarchedl would fund or even provide it.

It might be that wider factors were at work, in which case a
troublesome colleague might be reassigned or offered advice on
how to better fit in with the work environment and stop upsetting
his or her colleagues. Alternatively, if the office worker requested it,
he or she might be offered therapy to adjust his or her viewpoint
such that the aspects of the job or colleagues causing the problem
might seem more palatable.

The Zhodani claim that their approach is very different from the
sinister mental reprogramming many outsiders believe they engage
in. They suggest that their methods are more enlightened, better for
the unhappy person and all–round more effective than the Imperial
system of simply letting people get on with it since nobody cares
anyway. Imperials often shudder and start talking about sanctity of
personality at this point.

Given these huge cultural differences and the Zhodani lack of
interest in expansion, there is little interbreeding between Zhodani
and other humans. As a result, there is a fairly distinct Zhodani
physical appearance, which is an exception to the general trend.
Zhodani tend to be tall and slim, and seem to exhibit psionic talents
more commonly than other humans. This however, may be due to
the fact that these are actively tested for and accepted in Zhodani
society, which is not the case elsewhere.

OTHER HUMANS
Most humans within the Marches (and the rest of the Imperium,
with some exceptions) tend to be of mixed blood. Solomani, Vilani
and many of the minor human groups have been interbreeding for
centuries, creating a fairly 'generic' human type.
Cultural influences are generally more important than racial ones,
though local conditions will influence the general characteristics of
a planetary population over the centuries. Thus as already noted
most cultural Vilani or Solomani are actually of mixed blood.
People being what they are, local associations tend to be more
important than more distant ones. Thus the population of a given
world tend to identify themselves as citizens of that world first and
as Imperial citizens a long way second. Regional associations are
sometimes important, such as when people identify with the Marches
or Rhylanor Subsector, but even this is relatively uncommon.
A planet is a big place; about as big as most people can identify
with. As a result, the average person identifies closely with their
town or city, and their homeworld to a lesser extent. Far–off things
like the fact that they are citizens of the Imperium rarely intrude into
daily life for most people.
Cultural pollution has caused many worlds, especially those on
major trade routes, to move towards a “standard–starfaring” culture,
though even this is subject to local variations and tends to be more
pronounced near the Starport than elsewhere. Some worlds are very
different to this standard–starfaring culture. Diversity (within limits)
is more frequent than commonality. However, radically different
societies are normally either located in remote areas where there
are few visitors, the product of deliberate isolationism, or both.
There are a number of minor human races. The Jonkeereen, for
example, were genetically engineered by Imperial scientists. They
breed true, creating a human offshoot race specifically tailored to
survival in a desert environment. Their homeworld is in Deneb
sector but they can be encountered anywhere. The Geonee are
shorter and of heavier build than most other human types as a result
of conditions on their homeworld. It is probable that the Geonee
became adapted to the conditions there after being transplanted by
the Ancients, though the Geonee have another explanation.
The Darrians, who are native to the Spinward Marches, are thought
to have been genetically adapted by the Ancients in the distant past
and today are one of the more important minor human races. The
Darrians rule a small state on the Spinward fringe of Imperial space.
This is their second interstellar polity; an ill–advised experiment
involving their star ended the first.
OTHER TERRANS
Enhanced, that is sentient, versions of several Terran species have
been created. Most notable and widespread are Dolphins, who
inhabit the oceans of many worlds and travel among the stars when
it suits them to do so. It is difficult for aquatic creatures to do so
but technology has enabled Dolphins to join the starfaring races.
Some Orca (Killer Whales) were also uplifted to sentience and can
be found on various worlds, sometimes co–existing with Dolphins.
Among the other Terran species uplifted to sentience were various
apes. These were, in general, less successful than the Dolphin
project and have tended to fade away. Some worlds nearer Terran
have populations of Apes, either in mainstream society or in
enclaves living in remote areas. They are rarely encountered away
from their homes, though the occasional Ape does turn up in an
unexpected place.
It is also generally accepted that Solomani genetic experimentation
created enhanced humans. These 'Supermen' were few in number
and do not exist today. The Solomani Confederation is strangely
reticent on the subject.
Other Intelligent Species
Charted Space contains a large number of non–human intelligent
species. Some, such as the Jagd–Il–Jagd, are very alien indeed. They
are gas giant dwellers and unlikely to be encountered far from their
home system of Jagd in Lishun sector. Others share environmental
needs with humans and can be encountered on the same worlds or
even living in the same communities.
ASLAN
The first human explorers to encounter this humanoid race thought
they looked somewhat lion–like and used the name 'Aslan' (Turkish
for lion) to describe them. The label stuck and has been in use ever
since, though the similarity is vague and Aslan have no connection
with any Terran species, let alone the great cats.

##### Aslan

The Aslan have a clan–based martial society, with over 4,000 clans
making up the Aslan Hierate, a region of space located to Spinward
of the main Imperium. Relative to the Spinward Marches, the
Hierate lies to Spinward–Coreward across the Great Rift. The Aslan
have considerable holdings on this side of the Rift however, and are
not uncommon in the Marches.

Aslan society is divided along strict male/female lines. Males are
leaders and warriors; females are businesspersons, scientists and
technicians. The divide is so ingrained that some Aslan males are
unable to understand the concept of money (or so they claim) and
will address a female human soldier as male (fighting is a 'male'
preserve) or a male scientist as a female (since the individual is in
a 'female' role).

Aslan culture holds that only the first son inherits, so landless second
sons ( _Ihatei_ ) often go adventuring in search of land and glory. This
can lead to friction with neighbors who do not appreciate the
activities of the _Ihatei_.

DROYNE
The Droyne are something of an oddity. They have enclaves scattered
all across Charted Space. Some are stone–age primitives while
others possess advanced starships mounting fearsome weaponry.

Vaguely humanoid with both reptilian and bird–like features, the
Droyne are divided into six castes. Members of different castes
have considerably different physical and mental characteristics
depending upon their role in Droyne society.

The Droyne never explain their actions. At least, not in a way that
makes sense to humans. At times they are quite active, with trade
ships visiting many ports and other vessels sighted all over Charted
Space. There have been many unexplained lulls in Droyne activity
as well.

There are two Droyne worlds in the Marches, Andor and Candory.
Both are interdicted by the Imperium. Permits to visit are
supposedly available but are very hard to obtain. There are also a
few small enclaves on other worlds. Visitors to these places are
often completely ignored even if the Droyne communities can be
found at all.

HIVERS
Hivers resemble very large six–armed starfish and communicate
visually by waggling their digits. Most wear a device called a Voder,
which translates the waggles into Galanglic.

The Hivers are the 'first among equals' (or so they claim) in the
Hive Federation, leading a wide assortment of other races. The
Federation is far to Trailing–Rimward of the Marches on the far side
of Imperial space, with a neutral area in between. Hivers are thus
rare in the Marches, though they have been sighted.

K'KREE
The K'Kree, or Centaurs, also dwell far to Trailing of the Marches
across the entire Imperium and also a region of independent space.
They are even more rarely seen in the Marches than the Hivers.

K'Kree are militant herbivores who have never made any secret of
their 'manifest destiny' to wipe out all meat–eaters in the universe.
This puts a strain on relations, though there is some trade and
diplomatic contact between the Imperium and the 2000 Worlds of
the K'Kree.

VARGR
Vargr are candidates for the 'Other Terrans' label, but as a Major
Race they are dealt with here instead. The Vargr were genetically
engineered from Terran carnivores (the word Vargr means 'Wolf')
in the distant past, presumably by the Ancients.

The Vargr dwell mainly to Coreward, in the Vargr Extents. This is a
large area of Vargr and mostly–Vargr worlds forming large numbers
of great and small polities that rarely remain stable for long. Many
Vargr live in the Imperium; they are the second commonest species
in the Spinward Marches.

Vargr are pack creatures whose culture and civilization are based
around the concept of individuals with 'Charisma'; that is Alpha
individuals. Vargr will give their loyalty to charismatic individuals
and thus gain reflected glory, but a leader who loses face may find
himself without followers rather quickly. Vargr society tends to be
somewhat more fluid and turbulent than human civilization, though
Vargr are capable of deep loyalty to an individual or ideal that has
earned it.

###### MINOR RACES

There are many minor sentient races. Most are limited to a single
world, and many have pre–industrial or even stone–age levels of
technology. Others are starfarers. Many live alongside humans and
others on dozens of worlds, having migrated to take a job or join a
colonial mission.

Most minor races are naturally occurring species, though some
are obviously variants or offshoots of other races. This might have
been the work of the Ancients or could have other causes. Minor
races sometimes cause a certain amount of head–scratching in
the scientific community. For example, there may be two or more
apparently identical species dwelling on homeworlds which are
vastly distant from one another, with no evidence of a starfaring
past.

Among the most commonly encountered minor races in Charted
Space are the Bwaps (sometimes called Wabs or Newts). Their
native–tongue name for themselves is Bawapakerwa–a–a–
awapawab. Bwaps are small humanoids who originated in swampy
terrain and need a humid environment to be comfortable. They are
natural bureaucrats, and large numbers have entered the service
of the Imperium as well as various worlds as administrators and
accountants.

Chirpers (named for the calls they emit) are another minor race that
can be encountered in various areas, though for different reasons.
They are small and reclusive humanoids that exhibit some bird–like
physical characteristics. Some observers suggest that they are little
more than animals; others think that Chirpers are in fact very clever
but not interested in the usual trappings of civilization. Chirpers are
an oddity in that they seem to be native to many worlds all across
Charted Space yet they have no technology or any sign of having
ever possessed it.

There are many other minor races across Charted Space. Individuals
and small groups from these species can be encountered going
about their business almost anywhere.

###### THE ANCIENTS

Little is known with any certainty about the Ancients, and it is
probable that most of what is known will turn out to be inaccurate.
Various theories have been put forward about them, most of which
have insurmountable flaws.

Most scientists agree that the Ancients reached the height of
their power several hundred thousand years ago, and that their

disappearance coincides with a fair amount of damage to this
region of space. There are several asteroid belts and devastated
worlds dating from that period. The most likely explanation is that
they fought each other or someone else to mutual destruction.

Various Ancient devices and sites have been found, along with
larger numbers of mistaken and outright fraudulent finds. Trade in
Ancient artefacts is heavily restricted but there are always those who
will pay top dollar for a working item.

The Ancients are thought to have been responsible for transplanting
many species including humans and Vargr. They may have
terraformed worlds or seeded them with life, and are probably
responsible for the presence of Terran plants and animals on worlds
only now being charted by humans.

The wonders of the Ancients are mostly lost, and those that can
be found are often incomprehensible. Devices turn up that have
no known function, and even those that can be used remain
mysterious. The Ancients and their technology are something of
a modern superstition; any unexplained phenomenon tends to be
blamed on the Ancients.

## The Third Imperium

###### OVERVIEW

The Third Imperium is a major power in Charted Space. It is over
a thousand years old, and has weathered some difficult times to
reach that great age. The Imperium claims direct lineage from both
the First (Vilani) and the Second (Solomani) Imperium, giving it a
legitimacy going back several thousand years.

The secret of the Imperium's longevity is its ability to absorb changes
and even the occasional hard knock. Worlds have occasionally been
captured by outside powers, wars both internal and external have
caused great destruction in some areas, and crises have threatened
to split the Imperium apart. Yet it endures. To understand how and
why, it is necessary to comprehend both the nature of the Imperium
and the long history of human empires in Charted Space.

The Third Imperium does not actually govern many worlds, at
least not directly. Instead it rules 'the space between the stars' and
has holdings on some worlds of which a small number are owned
outright. However, even [[Capital]] is technically a member world of
the Imperium rather than a possession of it.

Most of the territory claimed directly by the Imperium takes the
form of enclaves on member worlds or else is located on planetoids
or rockball worlds that nobody else lives on. In the latter case the
whole body (planetoid, moon or planet) is usually considered to
be Imperial territory and, as many of these bodies are the sites of
Imperial bases, access by civilians tends to be restricted.

The Imperium is essentially a framework which permits member
worlds to do more or less as they please within certain limits. So
long as it upholds certain laws and pays its quota of taxes to the
Imperium, a world and its population are entitled to create whatever
social system, laws and style of government that they wish.

A few activities are not acceptable, such as harbouring Imperial
felons or allowing slavery, but within the limits of the Imperial
Charter worlds are free to pursue whatever course they see fit. They
may even (under some circumstances and subject to certain limits)
go to war with one another.

Individual member worlds provide for their own local defence,
while the Imperium regulates commerce and maintains a powerful
fleet to collectively defend the Imperium as a whole. This is a huge
advantage for member worlds, as the Imperial Navy can afford
vastly greater numbers of more powerful vessels than any given
world, and in theory much of this fleet is available to deal with any
given threat.

The Imperial military and other services are paid for from the tax
quotas of worlds and also from interstellar commerce. The Imperium
'owns space' beyond the immediate environs of a given world, and
commercial traffic must pass through that space. Revenue from
commercial taxes, license fees and the like go into the Imperial
coffers.

The result is a fairly loose framework that can tighten up at need.
For example to deal with internal troubles, external threats or an
economic crisis resources can be shifted from more stable areas
until the situation is dealt with.

Overall, the Imperial system can best be described as a federation
based upon mutual protection and economic well–being. The
Imperium does not govern its member worlds directly. What it does
it to protect them while they govern themselves.

Historical Perspective
Charted Space is huge by human standards, but it is only one tiny
corner of a vast galaxy among countless other galaxies. However,
Charted Space is notable for one very important factor: it has
sentient life.

Explorers have pushed out hundreds of parsecs in all directions and
have found plenty of non–sentient life, but no self–aware people
that did not originate somewhere in Charted Space have ever been
encountered. This is not to say that there are no sentients out
there somewhere, but there does seem to be a large region around
Charted Space where sentient life has not developed. There are no
satisfactory explanations for this phenomenon.

Thus Charted Space is a very special place. It is quite possibly
the only island of sentient life in a galaxy devoid of thought. The
history of the Third Imperium is, to a great extent, the history of
this region.

Antiquity
Little is known about the very distant past, and what is 'known'
is actually inferred from archeological finds and other data that
is very much open to interpretation. Thus it may be that what is
today accepted as fact could turn out to be entirely wrong. The only
certainty is that Imperial scientists do not know all that much about
what Charted Space was like before the First Imperium arose.

It is generally accepted that some time in the far distant past the
beings now known as the Ancients arose and undertook great works
across the region. There are various theories about these people and
what they did; all that is known for certain is that they are gone.

The Ancients are normally assumed to have created the Vargr,
genetically engineering them from Terran canines. Another species,
today known as humans, became widespread across Charted Space
during the Ancients period and developed various engineered and
natural variants. Some theorists believe that humans were the
Ancients, or that the Ancients were humans, which has slightly
different connotations. Some Vargr believe that their ancestors were
the Ancients.
The unsuitability of many Ancient devices for human or Vargr use
undermines these theories, however, but Ancient sites and artefacts
have been found that are obviously intended for humans or Vargr.
Proponents of the 'we are the Ancients' theories take this as proof of
their claims and suggest that the other artefacts were created for the
use of alien allies or servitors, or perhaps even for sale.
However, this is all conjecture. There is little proof that the scattering
of devastated areas, new planetoid belts and bombardment
patterns on various worlds across the region has anything to do
with the Ancients, though since the damage coincides with the
disappearance of the Ancients so far as anyone can tell, it seems
likely that they fought someone else or one another and were either
exterminated or greatly diminished.
Whatever the truth of the matter, engineered and unaltered humans
were settled or were placed on many worlds in the distant past. Some
of these cultures died out while others have done rather better. The
two main transplanted groups eventually became the psionic Zhodani
and the Vilani. Meanwhile, Humaniti continued to develop Terra and
finally became the people known today as the Solomani.
Even less is known about what happened after the disappearance
of the Ancients. There is little or no evidence of interstellar travel
or even much in the way of civilization on the worlds of Charted
Space. It is likely that the events of this period will never come to
light. Eventually, however, humans stepped onto the galactic stage
and a new era began.
The First Imperium
After tens of thousands of years in which the scattered people of
Charted Space learned (or relearned) to make fire, to work metal
and eventually to build cities, the people of Vland overcame the
challenges presented by their world and built their first starships.
It was a tough journey, and not merely because Vland is difficult
world to live on.
Oral and written records speak of runaway war machines marauding
about the surface of Vland trying to destroy one another for literally
thousands of years, until their power finally ran out. The wreckage
of these devices has been located; they are almost certainly Ancient
artefacts, which lends credence to the destroyed–in–war theory.
These war machines made it impossible for a city–based civilization
to arise on Vland for a long time, but once they were gone the Vilani
began the long climb back to the stars.
The Vilani explored nearby worlds and then began to forge an
empire for themselves. This was the First Imperium, or the Ziru
Sirka ('Grand Empire of Stars'). It dominated both the humans
and non–humans of the region, and maintained its power through
ruthless use of economic and military might.
Upstart civilizations on the borders of the Ziru Sirka were kept down
by harsh treaties and harsher punishments for breaking them, or else
were crushed utterly. By far the most violent period in the history of
the First Imperium was the Consolidation Wars. This was a lengthy
series of campaigns intended to ensure that no independent Jump–
capable society existed near the borders of the Imperium.
Once the Consolidation Wars were over, Imperial attention turned
inwards. Always more concerned with stability than growth, the First
Imperium stagnated and became almost fossilized. Thus when new
threats emerged on the borders they were largely ignored until it
was far too late.
The Second Imperium
By the time the Terrans finally discovered Jump drive, the Ziru Sirka
was in decline and had ceased to take much notice of what was
happening beyond its borders. Border incidents gradually developed
into a series of what to the Vilani was a string of trivial skirmishes
that might just possibly be worth calling wars.
Border troubles were nothing new, nor was any real threat perceived
from these newcomers. At first it was not realised that the tiny
fleets of the Terran nations all came from the same homeworld.
The Imperium thought it was simply brushing off the gnat–bites of
a handful of barbarian worlds. Even after the Terrans united against
their common foe, there was nothing to indicate that they were a
credible threat.
To the Terrans, of course, this period looked rather different. Terra,
along with her handful of colonies, was fighting for survival against
an enemy whose sheer power was not yet perceived. During what
became known as the Interstellar Wars, the Terrans frantically
innovated, invented and reverse–engineered themselves a navy
capable of inflicting a defeat on the Vilani fleets.
The Ziru Sirka was both stagnant and complacent; internal politics
was far more important than barbarians at the gate. The continuance
of the Empire was taken for granted; what mattered was how a defeat
on the border could be presented in the best possible light, and how
to gain political advantage from the situation.
Thus it was that internal matters occupied the attention of local and
regional commanders who should have been dealing with what had
now become a major threat. Cooperation was hampered by internal
rivalries and a reluctance to lose face by asking for help. It is entirely
likely that the Ziru Sirka was already well on its way to collapse when
the Terrans began hammering on the gates.

Once the cracks became visible, the collapse of the Ziru Sirka
happened fast. The Terrans, who had taken the name Solomani for
themselves by this time, found that resistance to their fleets simply
evaporated as they advanced. Only now realising how powerful their
opponent was, the Solomani grabbed the opportunity with both
hands and went for the throat before the Vilani could recover.

When the dust settled, the Solomani were in shaky control of the
former Ziru Sirka. They lacked the ships and people to govern
effectively but were assisted by the fact that much of the old Imperial
structure remained intact. Thus the Second Imperium, as it became
known, was essentially a Solomani–controlled overlay atop the
previous structure.

That in itself was a serious problem, although it allowed short–term
control to be established. The Ziru Sirka had been coming apart
when the Solomani conquered it, and they were not able to replace
its rotten foundations. Instead the Second Imperium, also known as
the Rule of Man, was doomed from the start.

Today the Second Imperium is often referred to as the Ramshackle
Empire. Its fall was gradual in terms of human lifetimes and the
coming collapse may not have even been apparent. However, within
four centuries the Second Imperium went the way of the first.

It was not war or disaster that ended the Ramshackle Empire but
simply the collapse of its economy. Colonial expeditions were
heading out into uncharted regions even as the Rule of Man spiralled
into darkness, and some areas were in better shape than others, so
it is hard to put an exact date on the final collapse. A couple of dates
do stand out however.

In –1776 by the current Imperial calendar, a financial crisis triggered
a huge depression and the near–total collapse of the banking
system. This began a period known as the Twilight. By –1526 the
last governmental body claiming to be the Rule of Man was gone
and the period known as the Long Night began.

The Long Night
The period from –1526 to the founding of the Third Imperium in Year
0 is known as the Long Night. Various successor states emerged in
the last days of the Rule of Man, but these were small and primarily
concerned with short–term survival. Most lacked both the resources
and the vision to lead a resurgence of interstellar society.

The beginning of the Long Night was characterised by piracy and
warfare as the successor states battled over the wreckage of the
Empire. Most worlds were not able to maintain their technological
or industrial base without interstellar trade and a rapid technological
slump ensued. Worlds went their own way or formed tiny pocket
empires. On many less hospitable planets the population died out
completely.

Interstellar travel fell off quickly. This was due to many factors; the
lack of support facilities and shipyards, the danger inherent and the
inevitable shrinking of horizons that resulted from the collapse of
the Imperium.

There were still some high–tech worlds and even interstellar
powers. Among them were the Sylean Federation and the Terran
Mercantile Community. Here and there new powers emerged, but
most disappeared into the darkness before the Long Night finally
ended.

The Third Imperium
The Third Imperium was not founded as such but was 'restored'
on Sylea by the arch–businessman Cleon Zhunastu, later Emperor
Cleon I. Cleon's Third Imperium claimed legitimacy via direct
descent from the Second and First, a claim generally accepted to
be valid. More importantly, the Third Imperium had the military
and economic capability to overcome the challenges it faced and
establish itself as a major interstellar power.

The Sylean Federation at that time consisted of 30 or so worlds, and
these formed the basis of the new Imperium. Their charter, which
was largely a free–trade agreement with collective–defence clauses,
formed the basis of the Imperial Charter. The planetary and business
leaders of the Federation became the early nobility of the Imperium
and many of today's noble families can trace their ancestry back to
these individuals.

The new Imperium launched a military campaign to crush the
warlords that nibbled at its borders, then began to reintegrate the
worlds of what is now [[Core sector]] . This was mostly a diplomatic
and economic exercise, though there was some fighting.

Other sectors followed, and as the years rolled by the Third
Imperium expanded to fill almost all the space available to it. These
years were not without their troubles and eventually the Imperium
decided upon a massive effort to find permanent solutions to its
problems. Beginning in 76, the Pacification Campaigns as they
became known were a combination of economic, diplomatic and
military operations which brought many 'holdout' worlds into the
Imperium and found solutions to most of the long–term problems
plaguing Imperial expansion.

The Pacification Campaigns were over by 120, and marked the end
of the rapid growth of the Imperium. From then on expansion was
gradual, by a process referred to as 'border creep'. Eventually the
borders came up against natural or political obstacles such as rifts
or the outer edge of another polity's territory.

Numerous conflicts have erupted, mostly along the borders, since
the end of the Pacification Campaigns. Some have even threatened
to break the Imperium apart or slice off a segment of its territory.
The first was the Julian War, fought against an alliance of human and
Vargr states to Coreward of the Imperium. These formed the Julian

(^16) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
Protectorate and fought the Imperium to a bloody standstill before
launching a surprise raid that destroyed two Imperial Navy depots.
The resulting settlement, in 191, curtailed Imperial expansion to
Coreward–Trailing and established the League of Antares as an
autonomous Imperial territory.
The Imperium allows its members a great deal of leeway, but there
is one action they are not permitted – planetary governments cannot
secede. The world of Ilelish and several of its neighbors attempted
to do just that and paid the price. Seeking autonomy as a means
to escape a period of depression, Ilelish and her allies came out
against the Imperium in open rebellion from 418–435. The Ilelish
revolt, as it is known, was crushed and parts of Ilelish were sterilised
by nuclear bombardment.
Meanwhile Imperial explorers and colonists had rounded the
Coreward end of the Great Rift (in Corridor sector) and contacted
the Zhodani. Tensions eventually led to a series of frontier wars. The
first was from 589–604 and immediately afterwards the disaffected
Admiral Olav Plankwell led his fleet to [[Capital]] and seized the
throne.
The period from 604 to 622 is known as the Civil War or the
'Barracks Emperors' period. The Iridium Throne changed hands
seventeen times in total – six times in 619 alone. The war was ended
by Admiral Arbellatera Alkhalikoi, founder of the current ruling
dynasty. Arbellatera did not seize the throne but instead appointed
herself regent pending the selection of a suitable candidate. Her
actions in restoring stability to the Imperium earned her the crown
anyway, but it was given rather than grabbed.
In the years after the Civil War, the most important innovation in
the Imperium was the Express Boat (Xboat) network which was first
established in 624 and finally completed in 718. This network of way
stations and tender bases permitted rapid information transmission
via Xboats and vastly improved communications across Imperial
space.
Meanwhile, the Solomani had begun to be troublesome. For many
years the Imperial court had been dominated by Solomani interests,
and a number of serious imbalances had been created. This in turn
caused disaffection in other areas. In 679 the power of the Solomani
was greatly reduced at the imperial court. Solomani influences
remained strong but balance was restored with a corresponding
improvement in stability in most areas.
However, the Solomani were now unhappy, and the diplomatic
corps was unable to find a solution for a long time. Finally, in
704, a region roughly 50 parsecs in every direction from Terra was
granted self–governance as the Solomani Autonomous Region.
This brought an end to the worst of the Solomani unrest and the
Imperium looked elsewhere, dealing with other problems. Among
those was increased interest in psionic powers, which it was feared
might lead to political sympathy towards the Zhodani. The Psionics
Suppressions, intended to counter this trend, ran from 800 to
826 and resulted in the closure of almost all psionic research and
teaching establishments as well as the criminalization of psionic
power use.
Imperial attention was brought back Rimward by Solomani activities.
Not content with autonomy within the Imperium, the Solomani
Autonomous Region redefined itself in 871 as the Solomani
Confederation; a declaration of independence in all but name. At
first the Confederation and the Imperium retained the polite fiction
that nothing had changed, but reports of Solomani repression of
non–humans eventually became too much to ignore.
The situation gradually deteriorated and in 940 the Imperium
revoked the autonomous status of the Solomani. This triggered a
half–century of economic sanctions and diplomatic wrangling but
changed little. However, in 989 the Solomani forced the issue,
annexing all of the former Autonomous Region and some other
worlds that had never been part of it.
The Confederation had hoped that the Imperium would be too
distracted by internal events to act decisively. Emperor Styryx had
just abdicated as a consequence of the mishandled Third Frontier
War to Spinward–Coreward, but this did not prevent Emperor
Gavin, Styryx' successor, from declaring war against the Solomani
Confederation.
The Solomani Rim War began in 990 and initially went well for
the Solomani. However, after a period of stalemate the tide
gradually turned. Terra fell to assault in 1002, though the campaign
was exhausting for both sides. The resulting peace settlement
established what remained of the Confederation as a distinct state,
with the territories captured by Imperial forces being reintegrated
into the Imperium.
Since 1002, there have been plenty of incidents and the occasional
crisis, but only one major war. This was the Fourth Frontier War of
1082–84, which is sometimes referred to as the False War as the
Zhodani advances mostly stalled at the border. By the time news
of the war had reached [[Capital]] and instructions for its conduct had
been sent back to the Spinward Marches an armistice was already
in place.
The past few years have been fairly stable and there seems to be no
reason to suppose that this might change. Some observers have
suggested that the Imperium is enjoying a 'golden age' of peace
and prosperity.
The Imperium Today
The modern Imperium is the result of centuries of history, and
its nature varies considerably from place to place. These regional
variations cannot override the Imperial Charter and associated High
Laws, but they do colour local politics considerably.

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^17

The Imperium of today is primarily driven, as it always has been,
by economic considerations. Worlds are free to govern themselves
as they like and may spend their own tax income as they please on
economic investment, defence and whatever else seems desirable.
Obviously, the prosperity of the Imperium as a whole is increased by
economic growth among the member worlds and this is encouraged
with a system of subsidies, tax breaks and other incentives to spend
money on economic development.

Although worlds are self–governing there needs to be a power
structure for the Imperium as a whole. Various local organizations
exist, such as postal unions and trade alliances, though military
alliances between member worlds are not permitted. Disputes
are resolved where possible at the local level, ideally between the
disputing parties directly. However, matters such as tax collection
and allocation of Imperial resources are dealt with at a higher level.

The very highest level of Imperial power is of course the Emperor
himself and his immediate subordinates. At this level general policy
is determined and passed down to those who implement it. Only
very major issues are dealt with directly.

At the beginning of the Pacification Campaigns, the Imperium was
divided into six Domains, each administered by an Archduke with
overall responsibility for the area. A seventh Domain, the Domain
of Deneb (which contains the Spinward Marches) was established
in 589 but an Archduke was never appointed.

A Domain consists of four sectors of space, at least in theory. In
practice some of the Domains extend outside the Imperial border.
While the Archduke of that Domain is responsible for Imperial
interactions with worlds and states beyond the border, no territorial
claim is made or implied to these worlds. If they were to join the
Imperium, they would naturally become part of the Domain.

Since the Civil War period, the Domain level of Imperial politics has
been of relatively little importance. The power of the Archdukes was
greatly reduced after the Civil War in an effort to prevent a repetition.
It was felt that having several individuals in the Imperium with
powers rivalling those of the Emperor was not desirable. However,
since the Fourth Frontier War the current Emperor, Strephon, has
reversed this trend somewhat.

Today the Domain level is once again a part of the power and taxation
structure, but remains of relatively low importance. The Fourth
Frontier War demonstrated the desirability of having a powerful
individual close to any crisis point, prompting the Emperor to make
the office of Archduke more than an honorary appointment. It is
likely that the Domain of Deneb will eventually gain an Archduke for
similar reasons.

However, at present the most important level of bureaucracy and
power is the sector. There are four sectors to a Domain, and each
sector contains sixteen subsectors. Again, this is theoretical; a

region that lies outside the Imperial border, such as District 268
in Spinward Marches sector, is considered to be part of the sector
for astrographic purposes but is not part of the Imperial sector
administration as it is not part of the Imperium.

The lowest level of Imperial administration is the subsector. As
already noted, there are sixteen subsectors to a sector. Within a
subsector there may be many or few worlds depending on local
stellar density, and the importance of these varies considerably. Part
or even all of a subsector may lie outside the Imperial border.

Worlds collect taxes according to whatever system is chosen, and
pay a quota to the Imperium which is assessed by the Imperial
bureaucracy. Part of this taxation is retained at the subsector level,
part at the sector level and the remainder goes to the Imperial
treasury. For many years the Domains have not been in this chain,
but were recently given the right to impose taxes of their own. These
largely come from commercial taxes imposed within their territories.
These, too, are partially retained at subsector and sector level, part
by the domain administration and the remainder goes to central
Imperial funds.

Money flows the other way, too. Local projects are funded by the
subsector treasury, those of wider importance by sector and domain
funds. Grand Imperium–wide projects and matters of importance
across the Imperium are funded by the central treasury.

Other issues are also dealt with by these strata of power. The
Imperial Bureaucracy, Colonial Office and Ministry of Justice all
maintain structures at subsector and sector (and recently, domain)
levels which deal with increasingly important matters. The Imperial
armed forces are also organised along subsector and sector levels.
There is no domain–level military command.

The result is a feudal system on a grand scale. World governments
pay taxes up the chain and receive support down it. Matters that
can be dealt with at a given level are handled there, with the large
resources of the sector, domain or Imperium levels available at
need. For the most part, leaders and administrators at each level are
able to leave details to those below them. Resources are allocated at
need and may be sent as part of a high–level assistance package or
loaned to the next–lower leader for the duration of the problem.

###### THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM

The Imperial system can be summed up as follows:

Member worlds govern themselves and pay a portion of their tax
income to the Imperium. They are assigned a representative (who is
an Imperial noble) to oversee their interactions with the Imperium
as a whole and other worlds within it. Corporations and other power
groups also have representatives of this sort. Representatives do
not rule the world they are associated with but instead are a sort
of ambassador and liaison officer whose job is to ensure that

(^18) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
the best interests of both Imperium and the individual world are
safeguarded.
These representatives deal with one another at various levels, directly
or at the courts of counts, dukes, archdukes and even the emperor
himself. If an issue cannot be resolved at one level, it is taken higher
until a solution can be found. It is not always possible to obtain a
perfect resolution but the representative's job is to get the best deal
he can for his world whilst being mindful of greater issues.
Imperial High Law
The Imperium has formulated a body of law that applies all across
its territory and also applies on all member worlds. Even an anarchy
world which has deliberately chosen to have no laws is bound by
Imperial High Law, though it may entirely lack the will and the
means to enforce it.
High Law mainly governs the interactions of world governments,
large business groups and the Imperium itself. It sets out rules for
who can give orders to whom, how the political/military chain of
command is established and so forth, most of which is of no interest
to the average traveller. Similarly, the large body of legal information
on planetary tax quotas and the conduct of inter–governmental
disputes (including limited wars) is unlikely to affect most people
except peripherally.
Although member worlds are entitled to choose whatever
governmental system they like, some things are not permitted by
High Law and the Imperial Charter. Slavery is outlawed and a charter
of rights for sentient beings is in force throughout the Imperium.
Governments and other accountable bodies do have some privileges
under High Law that are denied to individuals. The right to maintain
armed forces, to make and enforce laws, and similar governmental
tasks are governed by High Law. World governments are, for
example, permitted to maintain an arsenal of nuclear weapons. Very
few civilian agencies can obtain permits for nuclear devices, and
world governments can only issue permits to their own personnel.
Only the Imperium can grant a license to, say, a mining corporation
to use nuclear explosives and this is very strictly controlled.
High Law also specifically prohibits certain activities and limits
others. Some acts are considered to be major crimes wherever
they are committed. Piracy, rape, murder and treason against the
Imperium are all examples of Imperial felonies. Even where a world
government has jurisdiction but does not prohibit these acts, local
law enforcement is required to assist Ministry of Justice personnel
in apprehending the perpetrators.
High Law does not supersede local law, however. If an act is
prohibited under local law but not High Law, it is still a crime.
Moreover, someone convicted of a crime on one Imperial Member
world is a convicted criminal everywhere, even in places where the
act is not an offence. That said, some local crimes are considered to
be irrelevant in most other places. For example, while wearing green
on Twoday may be a serious offence on one world, a conviction for
this offence carries no real weight on worlds where the act is not
prohibited.
The Imperium maintains a system of weapon permits which
balances accountability against requirements. Almost anyone can
buy and carry a civilian hand weapon for self–defence, provided
the item is legal in their current locale. More powerful weapons
are restricted for several reasons, not least because the Imperium
prefers not to have weapons that can put holes in its troops' combat
armor lying about everywhere.
As a general rule, more powerful weapons require greater
accountability. It is relatively easy to obtain a permit for an assault
rifle or submachinegun; all that is needed is a 'demonstrated need'
such as security aboard a free trader. High–tech military weapons
are more strictly controlled and generally require that the prospective
owner be a member of a recognized mercenary unit. Very powerful
weapons like grav tanks and plasma guns are not readily available
to the public.
Some travellers think that they can go to a high–tech, low–law world
and legally buy military–grade hardware. Most are disappointed to
find out that they cannot as Imperial restrictions are still in place.
There are various ways around this – a powerful patron might
provide a license for military hardware, for example, or the weapons
could simply be obtained illegally and kept hidden.
When a serviceperson leaves the Imperial armed forces, they
often receive a 'weapon' benefit. This is more than simply being
presented with their service rifle as a momento. The weapon comes
with a permit to own the weapon, making it possible to obtain
spares and ammunition legally. Service–weapon permits do not
allow individuals to ignore local laws and carry weapons where they
are not allowed, but many worlds allow honor–weapon owners to
retain their weapon in their home. This is most common when the
serviceperson has retired to a frontier area.
High Law also recognizes that self–defence is sometimes necessary,
and that force is often used in legitimate military operations. For
mercenary troops and Imperial service personnel, the situation is
fairly clear and in many cases they can be exempt from local law if
they are on a legitimate mission under valid orders. For travellers
defending themselves, local law still applies but at least the
Imperium recognizes their right to self–defence. Since travellers
spend a lot of time beyond the jurisdiction of local law enforcement,
this at least means they will not end up with the Ministry of Justice
chasing them.
Worlds of the Imperium
Every world within the border of the Imperium is a member, though
the exact terms of each world's treaty of membership can vary. Most
worlds have a unified government that claims jurisdiction over the

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^19

whole planet, and it is with this government that other member
worlds deal. If there are groups that reject the authority of the world
government, this is considered a local matter unless it gets out of
hand.

Replacing the world government does not invalidate Imperial
membership; indeed, secession is simply not permitted. However,
sometimes the membership treaty can be amended to cope with
newly–arising circumstances.

On Balkanized worlds, that is those with multiple governments, each
state is recognized by the Imperium and has treaties with it. There
are numerous worlds where not all of the planetary governments
are Imperial members. The Imperium takes a long view; in time the
member governments' increased prosperity will entice the others
to join.

All member worlds have the right to provide for their own defence
and to make whatever laws seem necessary, within certain broad
limits. However, the Imperium retains the right to impose sanctions
against a world whose government is taking 'inappropriate'
actions, the definition of which can vary considerably according
to circumstances. Worlds can face travel restrictions, economic
sanctions or even total interdiction. In the latter case the Imperial
Navy blockades the world and allows no traffic in or out. This can
have very serious economic implications.

Under most circumstances world governments have jurisdiction
in military and legal matters out to orbital space, defined as ten
planetary diameters. From there to a hundred diameters is a zone of
shared jurisdiction between the Imperium and the member world.
Beyond one hundred diameters (the normal safe Jump limit) is
Imperial territory.

However, member worlds have a right of navigation in their own
star system (and throughout the rest of Imperial space too) and
their system defence forces are of course free to range throughout
the system. However, beyond the 100–diameter limit all actions
are undertaken 'with Imperial permission'. Unless this has been
formally withdrawn as part of a package of sanctions it is assumed
to be in place.

Thus local craft can conduct customs boardings beyond the 100
diameter limit and can take action if local laws are being contravened,
but only if they can show that the contraband goods are bound for
their own world or are banned by Imperial law. It is not permissible
to prosecute a merchant ship passing by on the way to another
world where the goods are not illegal. If the ship lands or enters
the 100–diameter zone, the situation is nebulous. However, most
worlds are not concerned with goods destined elsewhere unless
they are banned by Imperial law. Only the most rabidly high–law
worlds will interfere with commerce in this manner, and they risk
Imperial displeasure by doing so.

There is normally only one 'mainworld' in a star system. Other bodies
(asteroids, moons and planets) may be home to small outposts or
colonies but these are more likely to be possessions than states in
their own right. Some of the outposts in a system may be owned by
the mainworld government, and these are subject to the same laws
as that world or whatever local regulations are in place.

The remainder of the star system is considered to be Imperial
territory. Territorial claims to part of the system must be processed
via the subsector administration. In the case where a mainworld
makes a reasonable claim it will usually be upheld as a matter of
course. Claims by other governments or organizations are less
certain and usually involve some negotiation.

A world government that claims ownership of planets and moons in
the neighboring system will have to show very good reasons for the
claim whereas a commercial organization that wants a few square
kilometers of real estate to build a mining installation is more likely
to have its request granted.

As a rule smaller bodies such as planetoids tend to be wholly
owned whereas segments of moons and planets are assigned. It is
possible for several or even dozens of small mining concerns to be
working claims in the same planetoid field or on the same moon.
Each territory will have its own regulations and enforcement system
which can be very different from that on the mainworld.

(^20) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM

###### PLANETARY ARMED FORCES

Most worlds have some kind of armed forces. This can range from
a tribal chieftain's bodyguards armed with the finest in stone–axe
technology to a major fleet of starships.

In practice, very few worlds maintain Jump–capable warships but
many have some kind of 'system squadron' using locally built or
imported vessels. Most system squadrons are basically patrol forces
capable of policing the local spaceways and enforcing customs
regulations. These are not usually able to defeat a serious military
force. However, major worlds often have large system defence
forces with large numbers of system defence boats and possibly
several squadrons of monitors.

Whether or not a system defence force is available, most worlds
have some kind of planetary army. This is normally divided into
three 'commands'.

Close Orbit and Airspace Control Command (COACC) forces
exist to defend the world's immediate orbital space as well as its
atmospheric space. COACC forces generally operate a mix of
ground–based weapons and aircraft as well as orbital combat craft.

Ground–based weapons include missile batteries and, on high–tech
and rich worlds, deep–site meson guns hidden well beneath the
planetary surface. Aerospace interceptors capable of reaching orbit
are sometimes used as well as true orbital craft such as fighters and
system defence boats. These are sometimes based on a convenient
moon or orbital station, or may launch from ground stations.

Conventional aircraft are also used. These can engage intruder forces
as they enter atmosphere and also conduct traditional air support
and superiority roles. Bombers, fighters and logistics aircraft are the
province of COACC.

Maritime Force Command is usually small to non–existent unless
the world has a lot of oceans. Its personnel crew surface and
subsurface combat and logistics vessels operating at sea. These can
range from inflatable assault boats to major warships. Some worlds
mount meson guns on deep–diving submarines, enabling them to
hide in the seas and fire on enemy craft in orbit.

Ground Force Command is normally the largest of the armed
forces. As a rule its units will be equipped to the local tech level,
with elite formations possibly having access to imported high–tech
weapons. Some worlds maintain formations equipped to Imperial
Army standards, loaning these to the Imperial forces most of the
time.

Ground Force Command includes all the traditional combat
and support arms – infantry, artillery, armor, logistics, medical,
engineering and the like – as well as special–forces units such as
commandos and Protected Forces (ProtFors) troops for action
aboard space vessels.

However, all this is limited by the locally available technology.
The armed forces of a world equipped with biplanes and primitive
armored cars can be outgunned by a single high–tech infantry
company. For this reason may worlds buy in a small quantity of
high–tech gear or retain a mercenary force to provide a high–tech
spearhead for local forces. The expense of arming an entire planetary
force with imported gear is prohibitive, but there will usually be
some more advanced weaponry available to governmental guard or
elite units.

IMPERIAL HOLDINGS
The Imperium possesses only a handful of entire planets. Most of
these are outsystem rockballs used as naval installations or similar
facilities. However, there are a few mainworlds that are Imperial
territories rather than member worlds. Some are prison worlds,
others are the personal fiefs of archdukes or the Emperor. There are
also a number of 'reserve worlds' which are off–limits to outsiders
for various reasons. Each of these types has its own regulations and
in many cases access is restricted.

The Imperium also maintains large areas of territory on mainworlds.
The most well–known example is the starport of each mainworld,
which is technically Imperial territory. Outside the 'extrality line'
local law and custom applies; within it a slightly different system
is in force.

Most (but not all) starports and orbital installations maintain an
Imperial–Standard law level. Sidearms and hand weapons are
generally permitted but nothing heavier – though other weapons
can of course be carried in cargo containers or transported onto a
world that has a lower law level than the port.

Law enforcement is generally performed by employees of the Port
Authority, who usually have extradition agreements with local law
enforcement agencies and various courtesies in place such as the
'right of close pursuit'. This permits law enforcers from either side
to pursue offenders across the extrality line and make an arrest. This
is not always the case; on some worlds it really is possible to run
across the extrality line to escape local police.

Sometimes the Imperium will lease an entire continent, a moon
or some similar territory for use as a base. Whether situated on
a mainworld or elsewhere, these governmental and military
installations have stricter regulations than are in place at starports.
Armed civilians are not normally allowed to wander about Imperial
administrative centres, and restrictions are enforced by military
personnel or security forces recruited for this purpose.

###### THE MEGACORPORATIONS

While local commercial and industrial activity is important, especially
that of the high–technology industrialized worlds, a very significant
chunk of the funds that go into the Imperial treasury comes from
mulitworld corporations. Some of these are sufficiently enormous
as to be referred to as Megacorporations.

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^21

The Megacorps have holdings on dozens or hundreds of worlds
across the Imperium. Most are diversified in terms of activity as
well as location, with interests in shipping, manufacturing, banking,
research and other critical areas. The Megacorporations wield far
more power than any given world government and in many cases
could literally buy out a government if that seemed desirable.

Conflicts of interest between the Megacorps and world governments,
or between different corporations, are inevitable from time to time.
Outright trade wars have been fought between corporate assets,
which include mercenary security forces and sometimes armed
starships.

The Megacorporations wield enormous power due to their wealth
and control of critical industries, and for another reason too. Many
of the great nobles of the Imperium are shareholders or officers of
the Megacorporations. This is hardly surprising as the Imperium
was founded by a businessman and of its original nobility was
made up of his allies and supporters. The Imperium is built upon
economic activity, and many its leaders are captains of industry.

This can create conflicts of interest, and there are laws to limit how
far a corporate noble can favor his own and his economic allies'
interests. However, the simple fact is that money and power go
together, and the Megacorporations have both in large quantities.

There are 13 Megacorporations within the Imperium, plus many
more huge corporate entities. All are entitled to use the suffix 'LIC',
which stands for Limited–liability Imperial Charter and designates
corporate status. However, some corporations use a different suffix
for stylistic or historical reasons. For example GSb uses the ancient
Terran suffix AG to remind all and sundry of its claim to have been
founded long before the Third Imperium.

Some Megacorporations have their regional headquarters at the
domain, sector and subsector capitals; others use a similar system
of tiers but maintain their bases elsewhere. It is not usually worth
the trouble and cost of setting up a regional headquarters on some
outsystem rockball, though there are security benefits for doing so.
Most Megacorps have their offices at worlds that are major trade
hubs, though there are exceptions. For example, if a corp owns a lot
of interstellar shipping it may be worth setting up a private starport
to house both the regional headquarters and maintenance yards.

There is no overall policy; Megacorporations tend to do what works
best in the circumstances and will adapt to local conditions.

DELGADO TRADING, LIC
Delgado is the most recent of the Imperial Megacorporations,
founded in 997. It started out as a manufacturer of military hardware
and moved into other industries including mining and refining of
heavy minerals, publishing, antiquities and toys. Delgado is well
known for its work in miniaturization and for its distinctly suspect
employment practices.

Many of Delgado's subsidiaries, notably Delgado Shipping LIC,
operate a two–tier employment system whereby a small proportion
of employees are given high status and very good salaries while the
rest are more or less blatantly exploited. Entry into the upper echelon
is used as a 'carrot' to string hopefuls along while paying them well
below the going rate. To those who make the jump to Favored
Employee status, Delgado is extremely generous, but there are a
number of contractual 'sticks' which are used to beat troublesome
employees with.

GENERAL PRODUCTS, LIC
General was formed by the merger of several manufacturing
concerns after the Civil War. It is primarily concerned with heavy
industry; notably the construction of starships and heavy machinery.
It also manufactures a range of 'general basics' such as tools and
kitchen implements which are adequate for their purpose and more
importantly, cheap.

General has dominated the cheap–and–good–enough end of
the market for many years, but has recently been at the center of
controversy as several of its starships have suffered serious defects.
Poor build quality and lack of attention to detail have been blamed
for the loss of several military and civilian starships, and General's
fortunes have declined accordingly. There are rumors that General
may shed its shipbuilding interests in some regions or may lose its
Navy contracts if it does not meet new tighter standards.

GESCHICHTKREIS STERNSCIFFBAU AG
Abbreviated to GSbAG and commonly referred to as 'Gasbag'
Geschichtkreis Sternschiffbau AG claims to have been founded in
–2438 by the amalgamation of several Terran manufacturing firms.
The earliest record of its existence is a contract with the Sylean
Federation Navy dating from –334.

GSbAG is unusual for a Megacorporation in that it operates almost
entirely in one business area; in this case shipbuilding. The firm
builds ships for the Imperial family, among other prestigious
clients, and is also well known as the constructor of expensive but
luxurious yachts and passenger liners. GSbAG maintains a number
of small research and development facilities and manufacturing
plants making components for its vessels, but these all feed directly
into the shipbuilding industry rather than being economically viable
in their own right.

HORTALEZ ET CIE, LIC
Dating from the early 200s, Hortalez et Cie is a financial corporation
which owns numerous businesses (including shares in other
Megacorporations) but does not operate them under its own
corporate identity. Its activities under its own name are almost
exclusively limited to the financial sector.

Among other activities, Hortalez et Cie finances colonial operations,
building projects and economic investments. It also deals in
insurance and mercenary bonding as well as (in some regions)

(^22) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
serving as a recruitment house for mercenaries, starship crews and
similar personnel.
Hortalez bankrolls a lot of Imperial and local projects. In a frontier
region like the Spinward Marches, Hortalez tends to be involved
in funding starport development and economic expansion on
developing worlds or recent colonies. In recent years it has shown
an increasing reluctance to fund speculative trade expeditions
beyond the Imperial frontier, though there have been a number of
exceptions to this rule.
INSTELLARMS, LIC
Founded just after the Civil War by a former mercenary commander,
Instellarms deals in weaponry and trained mercenary personnel.
'Excellent and only slightly overpriced' is the usual impression
consumers gain of Instellarms' products.
It is still not clear how the firm's initial stocks of arms and equipment
were obtained. There was a lot of surplus equipment on the market
after the Civil War, of that there is no doubt. However, exactly where
the money came from to buy it remains a mystery. The firm's early
history is riddled with infractions and outright flouting of Imperial
regulations on mercenary activities.
However, today Instellarms is almost disappointingly 'clean'. It deals
in large–quantity sales to legitimate governments and even has an
'ethical arms sales' policy in some regions. There are more than
ethical reasons why Instellarms will not sell to certain governments
and organizations, however. Instellarms has several very lucrative
contracts with the Imperial armed forces and these greatly outweigh
the benefits of sales to rogue states.
Instellarms does not normally operate 'gun shops', though some
of its subsidiaries do. A firm with contracts to provide hundreds of
thousands of gauss rifles to the Imperial Army need not concern
itself with selling a handgun to a passing Free Trader crewman.
However, Instellarms does maintain large facilities on various
worlds. These offer registration and accreditation for mercenary
units and individual personnel, and often have contracts available.
Weaponry can be test–fired and purchased at these outlets, though
small orders are discouraged by high unit prices compared to bulk
orders.
LING STANDARD PRODUCTS, LIC
LSP started out as a mining concern and remains a major player in
that field. Its mineral–mining operations have gradually expanded
into related fields including asteroid mining, petroleum skimming
from gas giant atmospheres, ore processing, bulk transportation
and heavy industry.
In addition LSP is now active in the fields of electronics, computers
and software, vehicles and high–technology equipment. Its starship
components division manufactures mining and prospecting vessels
as well as starship weaponry, drives and power systems. LSP also
produces a range of simple and easy–to–use power systems and
machines aimed at the colonial market, and a cheap but effective
range of smallarms that are also popular along the frontiers.
LSP operates a number of major mining installations either directly
or as owned subsidiaries. Many of these are located in the outsystem,
on moons or in planetoid fields which are claimed (sometimes quite
aggressively) as company territory. Its activities are not restricted
to Imperial space; LSP is actively sponsoring prospecting missions
beyond the Imperial border and is known to own large shares in
several extra–Imperial industrial and mining concerns.
MAKHIDKARUN
Makhidkarun is one of three Megacorporations (Naasirka and
Sharurshid being the others) that have their origins in the First
Imperium. None was exactly a corporation during that period; they
were termed 'Bureaus', each of which was responsible for overseeing
a part of the Ziru Sirka. Economic activity was one of the key means
by which the Vilani Imperium maintained its control over subject
worlds, so the Bureaus were heavily involved in trade, commerce
and industry.
Although the Bureaus were very similar in function and composition,
each had unique characteristics which influenced its development
during the primacy of the Vilani Imperium and in the centuries

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^23

since. Each of the bureaus was based on one of the three powerful
groups in traditional Vilani society: the aristocracy, the merchants
and the Shugili. The latter were experts in food production, and were
vital to human survival on Vland as virtually every potential food
item required extensive preparation to make it edible.

Makhidkarun was established by the aristocracy and was particularly
interested in governance. Today this is reflected in its status as the
premier supplier of luxury goods such as wines and gourmet foods.
The communications division deals mainly in data processing
equipment and data itself; particularly entertainment and art.
Makhidkarun also supplies electronics and computer equipment
to the Imperial armed forces and operates an asset–management
service.

NAASIRKA
Naasirka is the second Vilani Bureau–turned–Megacorporation.
Founded primarily by the Shugili, Naasirka moved into other areas
when it became apparent that the specialist skills of the Shugili were
only required on Vland itself and a few other, similarly borderline
worlds. It was not possible to control food production on most
worlds, where nothing more than rinsing or heating was necessary
to make food edible.

Naasirka became a general and diversified corporation, dealing
in electronics, software, computers and robotics as well as
transportation and energy production. Naasirka is at the cutting
edge of robotics and artificial–intelligence research and supplies
most of the electronic and data–transfer equipment used by the
Imperial Express–Boat service.

Naasirka maintains extensive manufacturing plants on many worlds
and less well publicised research establishments in quieter areas.
Many of these are located on moons or asteroids off the beaten path
and are not welcoming to visitors.

SCHUNAMANN UND SOHN, AG
Also known as SuSAG, LIC, Schunamann und Sohn was first
registered in 252 as an Imperial corporation. However, the firm had
links to a defunct Sylean firm of much greater antiquity and still uses
the AG suffix as a reminder of its pedigree.

SuSAG started out as a manufacturer of psionic–enhancing drugs,
which was entirely acceptable in the early years of the Imperium
but ceased to be something a reputable (or legal) firm would be
involved with. SuSAG began to move into other areas just in time to
avoid disaster as the Psionics Suppressions kicked the bottom out
of that particular market.

SuSAG is today the premier Imperial chemical and pharmaceutical
corporation. Its biochemical warfare division has a particularly bad
reputation for safety, which is not entirely undeserved. As a result

of a lot of bad press as well as concerns about security and safety,
SuSAG normally sites its production and research plants in remote
and uninhabited areas or on planetoids.

SuSAG has extensive interests outside the Imperium, and one of
the largest Megacorporate security forces. The firm has shown
that it is entirely willing to interfere in local affairs in order to
protect its interests. It has also been accused of illegal research
and continued involvement in psionic drugs production despite
an Imperial injunction. To somewhat offset this bad reputation,
SuSAG subsidizes a number of medical charities and disaster–relief
agencies as well as sponsoring large numbers of medical students.

SHARURSHID
The third of the Vilani Bureaus, Sharurshid was founded by the
merchant caste and became a trading rather than manufacturing
concern. To this day Sharurshid produces little but makes a vast
amount of money buying and selling other firms' produce. In
particular Sharurshid is famous for luxury goods, a sector where it
competes vigorously with Makhidkarun.

Sharurshid operates a large fleet of trade ships, many of them plying
long–distance routes to bring rare goods to the markets of the core
worlds. The firm also operates brokerages on many starports,
helping others make a profit for a modest percentage.

Sharurshid has few physical installations other than its offices and
starships; it simply does not need them. If facilities are necessary
then these can be leased for whatever term is required. Similarly,
Sharurshid is less interested in making investments than in trade.
Where, say, Hortalez et Cie will invest in a new manufacturing
facility, Sharurshid is more likely to buy its products and sell them
elsewhere.

STERNMETAL HORIZONS, LIC
Sternmetal competes with the somewhat more diversified Ling
Standard Products for top slot in the mining and manufacturing
sectors. The firm also undertakes some heavy engineering and
construction projects. It manufactures power generation and
transmission equipment for starship, vehicular, industrial and civil
uses. Sternmetal is also the foremost producer of food synthesis
equipment in the Imperium.

Sternmetal tends to do things on a large scale if they are worth
doing at all. 'Corp Towns' are not uncommon where Sternmetal has
brought an entire colony of workers and their families into an area
or recruited them and provided a ready–made settlement. Living
conditions are generally very good in the corp–towns, and in many
cases they have expanded beyond the original application to become
thriving cities in their own right.

TUKERA LINES, LIC
Tukera is the premier Imperial shipping corporation. In some areas
it has a virtual monopoly on large–scale freighting and passenger

(^24) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
travel. Tukera's assets range from huge bulk freighters and
impressive liners to specialized fast couriers and mid–sized mail
ships.
The firm's revenue mostly comes from regular, dependable routes
rather than speculative trade. Where Sharurshid has ships to enable
it to trade, Tukera's vessels are the main source of its prosperity.
Tukera protects its assets, personnel and interests quite aggressively.
Most ships are armed and carry a well–trained security detail.
Tukera also operates a number of starports or sections of larger
ports, and in many areas uses these assets to ensure preferential
treatment for its own vessels and those of its associated companies.
Of course, non–Tukera vessels are also permitted to use these
ports, though they always come second to Tukera assets. Despite
this, Tukera–owned ports are popular with starfarers for their good
service and safe environment.
The earliest record of Tukera Lines dates from the Sylean Federation
but the firm claims to be several centuries older, with a founding
date sometime during the Rule of Man.
ZIRUNKARIISH
Zirunkariish is a Vilani firm, but one without roots in the
great Bureaus. It was founded in –425, during the Long Night.
Zirunkariish is primarily an investment and banking firm, and is the
largest insurance under–writer in the Imperium. It also funds the
development of mid–tech worlds and starports on major routes.
Zirunkariish is a majority shareholder in several major starport
projects, though it rarely takes much interest in direct ownership.
The firm is content to provide capital and take its profit, leaving
management to others who are (hopefully) experts in the field.
Exactly how much Zirunkariish is worth, and how much influence
it has, is open to speculation. With few physical assets it is difficult
to make even a general estimate of the firm's value. However, the
amount is staggeringly large – that much is certain.
In recent years Zirunkariish has been accused of manipulating the
money markets due to its effective ownership of many worlds' hard
currency reserves. Essentially the firm has loaned capital to a number
of worlds, secured against their reserves. There is nothing wrong
with this, it being standard practice. However, persistent rumors
suggest that Zirunkariish is somehow using its influence over these
worlds to create a favorable investment climate elsewhere.

###### THE IMPERIAL NOBILITY

The leadership of the Imperium is based on a feudal system, with
knights and nobles of various ranks holding positions of power.
However, although these nobles often have fiefs on a given planet,

they are very rarely the direct ruler of a world. Instead the nobility
act as representatives of the various worlds (and also commercial
interests, political and religious groups and the like) to the
Imperium. In the case where an entire world is the personal fief of
an Imperial noble, it is likely that there will still be some kind of local
government and the world's Imperial representative will not usually
be the fief–holding noble himself but a member of his retinue or a
subordinate.

The Imperial system is designed to allow world governments
and other powerful groups to work out their differences through
representatives at the various levels of power. If a matter can be
settled at the court of the local count, then that is an end to it. Wider
issues are dealt with at the courts of dukes or archdukes, with the
greatest issues being arbitrated at the Imperial Court.

Nobles of the same rank are theoretically equals, though in fact
there are different ways that a noble can hold a certain rank and as
a result two barons, for example, may wield very different kinds or
amounts of power.

Note that the nobility do not dictate to the worlds of the Imperium.
They represent their associated world, and advise its government,
but if the world chooses to take a different path then the noble can
only protest and advise of the likely consequences. If the world's
actions are detrimental to the Imperium then the consequences
may include economic sanctions or even interdiction by the Navy.
In extreme cases the Imperium may even invade a world and replace
its government, though this is rare.

Imperial intervention in the affairs of a world is occasionally
sanctioned at the subsector level, but must be ratified at the sector
level in this case. More commonly an intervention is ordered at
sector level. The day may be coming when archdukes once again
have the power to order an intervention but at present they are
restricted to rubber–stamping the orders of the sector duke.

There are essentially two strands to the Imperial nobility: the peerage
and the orders of knighthood. The peerage consists of the higher
noble ranks: baron, marquis, count, duke and archduke. The orders
of knighthood contain various ranks within them, such as Knight
Grand Cross of the Order of the Arrow, but there are really only two
levels – knight and baronet.

Almost all ranks in the peerage are hereditary, passing to the
holder's heir upon his or her death. Multiple titles can be split up
among several heirs. Some orders of knighthood are hereditary,
others are not. As a general rule the heir of a baronet becomes a
hereditary knight.

The close family of a peer are considered to be members of the
nobility and are often addressed by the title 'lord' or 'lady' followed
by their name if they do not hold a title of their own. Many close

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^25

family members are knighted upon becoming adults and in that
case are addressed as such. Knighthood–by–association of this sort
is not hereditary as such but children of such knights will obviously
also be close family of a great noble and will be knighted in turn if
that is the local practice.

Inheriting a title is one way to gain one. Individuals can also be
knighted or elevated to the peerage for merit or service, or in order to
hold a particular job. Each year two lists of new nobles are published
by the Emperor. The Holiday List is published on day 1 of the new
year and the Birthday List on the Emperor's birthday. Most of the
nobles created on these days are non–hereditary knights, though
promotions to the peerage are also made at this time. Additional
nobles can be created at any time if that suits the Emperor's needs.

When an individual is elevated to noble rank, they receive a patent
of nobility which indicates their status, rank, and duties, and a
letter of enfeoffment which confers ownership of any property that
comes with the rank. They also swear loyalty to the Imperium and
its Emperor. Noble rank can be revoked or suspended until the
noble's heir is ready to receive it. A noble with multiple titles can
lose one yet keep others, depending upon the infraction he or she
has committed.

Many noble ranks come with additional benefits. The noble is often
granted a fief of some kind, ie an area of land upon which to build a
home and set up an estate. This may or may not generate wealth; if
it does not then the noble will either be granted a stipend from the
throne or, more commonly, property such as shares in a corporation.
Nobles are expected to retain physical fiefs but a portfolio of shares
can be traded as the noble prefers. The consequences of good or bad
management will stand however; a noble family that impoverishes
itself this way is not due any support.

Hereditary knights are usually assigned a fief. Non–hereditary
knights may or may not be given a stipend but are rarely assigned
land. Note that land, when it is assigned, is located on an imperial
member world, but the government of that world does not answer
to the noble. He may or may not be its representative (a noble
assigned to represent a given world will usually be given a fief there)
but he is a citizen of that world and subject to its laws. Special
clauses usually allow the noble to maintain an armed bodyguard
and security force at his estate even on worlds with strict laws, but
this is not always the case.

Sometimes a fief is given as part of a task. For example a knight
might be assigned a large area of wilderness on a frontier world
as his personal estate, and assigned the task of colonising it with
the eventual goal of creating an industrial city. If successful, the
knight's family would eventually become very wealthy and probably
be elevated to the peerage.

It is not necessary to be a noble to hold most Imperial offices.
However, the senior officials of the Bureaucracy and the Diplomatic
Corps are all peers or members of their close family. Virtually all

ambassadors and heads of administrative teams are at least
knights. Sometimes a knighthood is awarded specifically so that a
worthy individual can take up a post. Similarly, the Imperial armed
forces contain a lot of nobles. These officers command by virtue of
their naval or military rank, not their noble position.

The Navy is an excellent route into the nobility for a young person
of good but non–noble family, and is also the place where many
young nobles gain experience before taking up their political duties.
The Marines and the Army have less noble officers, and those that
exist are of generally lower noble rank. It is rare to meet a naval
commodore who is not at the very least a knight, whereas there are
many senior army generals who are not nobles. The Scout Service
has virtually no nobles among its ranks.

Noble Rank
The various levels of nobility are unofficially subdivided into three
categories:

Individuals elevated for merit or performance in various fields are
termed Honor Nobles. Business, entertainment, the Imperial
services or exceptional performance in any other field can earn a
knighthood or, less often, one of the lower ranks of the peerage
(baron, marquis or count).

Individuals who hold a position are termed Rank Nobles. There are
two subtypes. The term 'Local Nobility' is given to relatively minor
nobles who represent worlds and other interests such as business
groups. The rank is usually hereditary. Most local nobles are barons
or, occasionally, marquises. Individuals who hold a non–hereditary
Imperial office (e.g. an ambassador) and have been granted a title
for that purpose are termed 'Administrators'. They retain their noble
title after leaving the post but it is not hereditary unless of course
the noble already held the requisite rank when the administrative
post was assigned.

The smallest group, but the most powerful, are termed 'High
Nobles' or the 'Great Nobility'. These are the most powerful Imperial
families, who head the great Megacorporations or administer large
areas of space. Most are dukes or archdukes, though there are a few
very powerful counts among this select group. These individuals
wield tremendous power through their position or their holdings,
or both.

Actual noble titles are the same however the individual came by
them. In theory two nobles of the same rank are equals, though they
may have very different roles and levels of power.

THE ORDERS OF KNIGHTHOOD
A knighthood entitles the holder to use the prefix 'Sir' before his or
her name. Some females prefer the archaic 'Dame' and certain orders
use this prefix for male and other genders as well, for traditional
reasons. The initials of the knight's order are often listed after his
or her name, and/or a location, such as 'Sir Alexandr of Skiddir'.
Locations normally denote the knight's fief but occasionally refer

(^26) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
to the event that won their knighthood. This is usually the name
of a city or world but can be something more unusual, such as 'Sir
Andrea of Two Suns' which refers to a knighthood won at the Battle
of Two Suns.
There are various orders of knighthood associated with regions or
activities, all of which are considered to be generally equal in the
grand scheme of things. Within a given order there may be ranks,
in which case the Grand Master of an order obviously outranks
someone recently inducted into it.
Examples include the Order of the Emperor's Household, the
Order of the Starship and Crown and regional orders named for the
domains, such as The Order of Antares. There is no Order of Deneb
as no Archduke was ever appointed to that region.
Knights often receive a stipend rather than a fief. Most honor
nobles receive neither; their knighthood is simply recognition
of achievement. Those knights that do have a fief rarely receive a
large area unless it is of low value. A knight might be given several
hundred kilometers of wilderness, or a rather more desirable but
smaller area on the edge of a major city.
Some orders of knighthood can only be bestowed by the holder of a
certain office, the Archduke of Ilelish, for example, and others only
by the Emperor himself.
BARONET
Technically a rank of knighthood, Baronet is sometimes considered
the lowest peer rank instead. The name comes from an archaic
Terran practice; a senior knight who led others in battle was
permitted to display a banner for them to rally to, and was known as
a 'Banneret'. The term was gradually corrupted to Baronet, though
both are used in some regions.
A Baronet is essentially a highly ranked hereditary knight, who may
or may not be given a fief. Baronets use the prefix 'Baronet' or
occasionally 'Banneret' before their name and usually the location
of their fief afterwards, for example Baronet Mikhal Danilo of
Slovenos.
BARON
The lowest rank within the peerage is Baron. Barons usually have a
fief of some kind. Those that are associated with a given world usually
have their fief there. Barons usually represent relatively undeveloped
or unimportant worlds. If a world achieves prominence its Imperial
representative is usually promoted to Marquis.
Other barons are not representatives of a given world but may hold
a fief on one. One baron might have received his rank for service
and another because she heads a small but important shipping
corporation. All are equal in precedence at the Imperial court as
each has contributed to the Imperium in different ways.
Barons use the prefix 'Baron' or 'Baroness' and often a range of
other honorifics such as 'hault', 'ap' or 'von' before their surname.
As with knights, the Baron's fief location is often used as a suffix.
MARQUIS
An imperial Marquis is usually either a powerful businessperson
or the representative of an important world. In the latter case
the world's name is used after the noble's rank title, for example
Marquis of Aramis or Marquis Aramis. Both usages are correct.
COUNT
A Count may be an extremely important Imperial officer, such as
the ambassador to the Solomani Confederation, or the head of
an important corporate body. Alternatively, a Count may be the
Imperial administrator for a group of 2–3 worlds within a subsector.
In the latter case the count's title is followed by the name of one of
the worlds he or she is responsible for.
DUKE
Imperial dukes oversee an entire subsector of space and give
political guidance to those at lower levels of power within that area.
One of the dukes in a sector has precedence over the others and is
titled Sector Duke. At present sector dukes answer to the Emperor
but if the current reforms continue as planned their allegiance may
be switched to the domain Archduke.

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^27

All dukes use the subsector they are associated with as a suffix, for
example Duke of Rhylanor. This also applies to the Sector Duke
who retains direct responsibility for his or her subsector as well as
sector–wide concerns. Usually a member of the duke's family is
appointed to deal with subsector matters.

ARCHDUKE
Each of the six original domains of the Imperium has an Archduke,
though for centuries this has been a figurehead appointment only.
That is slowly changing as the Archdukes are given increased
powers.

There is at present no domain–level structure in the Imperial navy
or army, though bureaucratic and business apparatus exists at that
level. The Archducal court is, in some regions, becoming useful as a
place to resolve very high–level issues. However, this practice is only
just becoming established and does not exist at all in the Domain of
Deneb which has no Archduke.

An Archduke uses his or her Domain name as a suffix and is assigned
an entire world as a personal fief. Technically the Emperor is also
the Archduke of Sylea, and uses this title on some occasions, but
[[Capital]] is not the Emperor's fief. Instead this is Usdiki in Gushemege
sector; the Emperor can sometimes use the title Marquis Usdiki if
he chooses.

The Archdukes can create nobles, but only within the ranks of
the knighthood, that is knights and baronets. All other noble
appointments are the preserve of the Imperial court.

The Imperial Family
The Imperial family and close household are not part of the peerage
as such, though many of them hold titles in their own right. Children
of the Emperor and his close relatives are granted the rank of Prince
or Princess, with the heir–apparent holding either the title of Imperial
Prince/Princess or sometimes the archaic Grand Prince/Princess.

The Emperor's consort may be given the rank of prince or princess,
or may retain their own noble title. It is fairly common, though
incorrect, to refer to a consort as Emperor/Empress. Other
members of the household use whatever noble rank they hold in
their own right or else are knighted into the Order of the Emperor's
Household.

Whilst technically the Emperor's son or daughter holds a higher
station than a sector duke or even an archduke, the Imperial
household are not in the political chain of command unless they
hold specific titles in their own right. They are, however, hugely
influential and well worth listening to. Members of the Imperial
household are often given critical tasks and armed with an Imperial
Warrant to carry them out. This grants whatever authority they need,
albeit temporarily.

Duties, Powers and Responsibilities
All nobles have some degree of influence that can be brought to bear
in various ways, but the actual power wielded by a noble is more to
do with their position than inherent to their rank. For example, an
imperial duke is a very wealthy individual who almost certainly has
large business holdings. He can exert influence through his titles
and money, and possibly his shareholder position in a company.
He can also give direct orders to those that answer to him, such as
his household guards. He does not, however, have the right to give
orders to planetary governments or Imperial forces, at least not by
virtue of his noble rank alone.

However, many nobles hold their position as a job as well as a rank.
The sector duke is the most senior noble in a given sector and has
certain duties including overseeing political and administrative
affairs in the sector. Military forces are commanded by admirals
and generals (who may be nobles as well, but they command due
to their military rank, not their noble titles), but as military force is
an instrument of political will, the sector duke is closely involved in
military operations.

It is important to understand the distinction to appreciate how the
Imperial nobility works. The sector duke is a political leader who tells
the naval commanders assigned to his sector what he needs doing
and then lets them decide how to do it. He does not command the
fleet in person and indeed cannot legally do so, though he can stand
at the admiral's elbow offering 'advice'.

The same applies throughout the nobility. A noble who is the head
of a corporation gives orders to the corporation as its head, not as
a noble. He may also be an important political leader, but that is
essentially a different job done by the same person. A noble title
does not in and of itself grant the owner any measure of power.
However, high noble rank is required to wield certain levels of power
and is an indication of the level of power the individual controls.

All nobles, whatever their rank or reason for holding their titles, are
required to uphold the honor and good name of the Imperium, and
to embody the virtues of courage and service wherever necessary.
This is interpreted rather widely; an elderly actor knighted for a
lifetime of cinematic excellence would be held to a different standard
to a knighted naval officer trained from birth to lead.

All nobles are bound by exactly the same laws as everyone else
(though inevitably some do abuse their power and wealth), and do
not officially have the power to give orders to anyone outside their
immediate household. There are, however, three exceptions to this.

The first is where the noble has a specific task or office, such as a
baron who is also a naval admiral in command of a task force. This
individual can give orders to his own household as baron and to
his naval forces as admiral, but there is a difference between these
aspects of his rank. The baron–admiral would have no right to give
orders to an Imperial Army colonel operating in the same theatre

(^28) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
unless he had been given or assumed control of a situation as the
senior Imperial representative present.
The second is where the noble has been issued with an Imperial
(or Archducal) Warrant. These documents grant specific powers to
a named individual (who is usually but not always a noble) for the
duration of a given task. Technically any job a noble is given, such
as overseeing the interstellar trade in a region, comes with a warrant
defining the task and powers associated with it. However, these are
fairly routine assignments. In this context an Imperial Warrant is a
little more than that.
A warrant is normally issued for a task that requires a fair amount of
on–the–spot judgement and may result in the need for assets that
could not be assigned ahead of time. For example, a noble might
be issued a warrant to investigate allegations of corruption in the
subsector bureaucracy. The warrant for this task would give the noble
the right of access to local police and Ministry of Justice records
and to 'borrow' personnel as needed. It might make provision for
the noble to suspend government officials or even Imperial nobles.
Trying to use this warrant to take command of an Imperial Navy
cruiser would be pointless.
Some warrants are more open than others. There are rumors
that 'blank warrants' exist, which essentially state that the bearer
speaks with the Emperor's direct authority and can essentially
take command of any assets, up to and including the Imperial
bureaucracy or an entire battle fleet, if he feels the need. Only a
handful have ever been reported and most of these were proven to
be fakes. It may be that the 'blank warrant' never actually existed,
though there are a number of entertainment vids on the subject.
The third circumstance is where a noble 'presumes authority' in
a crisis. Technically, and by long precedent, those elevated to the
nobility hold the Emperor's trust and are his direct representatives.
Although they may have no official power in a given situation, a noble
may step forward and start giving orders if it seems necessary.
The Imperium is based on traditions of individuals acting decisively
and accepting the consequences of their actions, and as a rule tends
to respect individuals – nobles or otherwise – who try to help. Local
and planetary cultures vary but in many places people are expected
to offer their skills at need. A doctor might reasonably offer first aid
to an injured person, so it is logical that a noble who has been trained
to lead should take charge if there is no–one better qualified.
This is as much a matter of personality as anything else; a natural or
trained leader will lead, noble or not. However, when the question
of chain of command comes up, noble rank can be important. No
military officer will place his troops under the command of some
random person in an expensive suit but a noble, as the emperor's
representative, might be able to persuade others to accept his
authority over the situation for the duration of the crisis. All involved
will have to justify their actions, of course.
Thus taking control of a situation depends very much on the rank of
the noble, his reputation, and his ability to persuade others to follow
him. And of course, how much sense he's talking. As a general rule,
an Imperial knight passing through a small backwater town when a
major disaster breaks is more likely to be able to take charge – and
to need to do so – than if he is caught up in a crisis somewhere that
has a well–organised hierarchy in place.
Noble power is thus rather limited outside the noble's own sphere
of influence. Many nobles do not even have a sphere of influence
outside their own estates, though they may be able to exert influence
through contacts, money and their name.
Noble Courts and The Imperial Moot
Traditionally the term 'court' meant a place where issues were
resolved and disputes settled. The meaning drifted over the
centuries, coming to refer to a court of law. However, the courts of
Imperial nobles are indeed places where matters are resolved.
The court of a baron or even a marquis is a modest affair, if it even
exists, but from the level of count upwards the courts of nobles
become very important places where influence and favors are
traded and issues resolved between representatives.
The usual practice is for worlds within a county (a count's area
of responsibility) to maintain representatives at the count's court
where they interact with liaison officers of major businesses active
in the area, the Imperial armed forces, the Ministry of Justice and
the Colonial Office as well as the ever–present Bureaucracy.
Representatives from the county are present at the subsector and
sector ducal courts, and the archducal court if one exists. Of course,
an individual world can maintain representatives at all these levels
but it is expensive and not usually necessary. The hierarchy exists
to filter out matters that can be dealt with at any given level from
those that need to be taken to the next higher level. Imperium–wide
matters are resolved at the Imperial court, which also serves as an
Archducal court for the [[Core sector]] s.
Each world of the Imperium is also entitled to representation in the
Imperial Moot, which is distinct and different from the Emperor's
court. The Moot is an advisory body which debates major issues and
tries to present the Emperor with one or more workable solutions
to choose from. It does not have many direct powers other than
to ratify a claimant to the throne and the ability to dissolve the
Imperium. This is not something to be done lightly, but it does
provide a counterbalance to the power of the Emperor if necessary.
In practice, a wise Emperor listens to the Moot's recommendations.
Going against them means ignoring the advice of a large gathering
of the Imperial nobility (or their representatives), and these are
the people who wield much of the power in the Imperium. Thus
although the Moot itself does not have much power, its members
do and should they decide to act in concert then even the Emperor

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^29

must take notice. The most successful periods in Imperial history
were characterised by a good partnership between Emperor and
Moot.

Noble Houses
The family, close retainers and some of the holdings of a noble
are often referred to as a 'noble house'. Houses are sometimes
identified by the family surname, for example House Miracru. The
term is somewhat vague but generally encompasses family members
and core interests. Thus the name House Miracru refers to Count
Alaedon Miracru himself, his wife and children, his two sisters and
their families, the family estate and its key business, Miracru Mining
LIC because this is a family concern. Although House Miracru also
has a majority share in the Deneb Materials Corporation, this is not
considered part of House Miracru as it is not directly owned.

A noble house can have many direct assets and tends to have
other holdings which are owned but not directly controlled. There
will usually be a 'household' of variable size which includes family
members, unrelated people who are closely involved with the house
and a number of retainers.

The inner circle of a noble house are referred to as the retinue of
the noble. These may include trusted bodyguards, tutors, business
managers and the like. Some may be almost family, in that their own
family has been associated with the noble house for generations. As
a rule, a high–ranking noble tends to have a larger retinue than a
knight or baron.

The retinue of a noble, though often non–nobles themselves, enjoy
a special status by association with a prestigious noble house. They
will accompany their noble to events and may even stand in for him
or her at some of them. This position of trust gives a noble's retinue
great power. It has been wisely said that the non–noble captain of
a duke's bodyguards is a more influential individual than many
Imperial barons.

The retinue will normally contain one or more bodyguards or officers
of household troops, and there will usually be a security force as
part of the household. This can range from a couple of bodyguards
through the crew of an armed yacht to several regiments of household
troops. The latter are, in most regions, named Huscarles. This word
derives from an ancient Terran term for professional soldiers of
high status who were part of a noble's household. The meaning has
not changed much.

Outside the immediate retinue there are many retainers. These are
basically people who are paid to work for the noble house. Some
will be just that, employees, but many noble houses make a point
of building loyalty among their retainers and staff and creating a
feeling of belonging. Thus being a retainer of a noble house often
feels slightly different to being an employee.

Not all nobles maintain household troops, and most of those that
do have only a small force to protect their estate. Huscarles are
retainers rather than members of the retinue, except for a very small
group of personal guards. They are recruited like any other troops,
though as with other staff most noble houses are careful about
selection and try to build loyalty among their Huscarles. This results
in a force with very high dedication and morale, often capable of
performing beyond the level its numbers would indicate.

Huscarles are permitted in the Imperium under the same laws that
allow for corporate security forces, mercenary units and the like.
They are supposedly for the protection of the noble house's estate
and assets, but are sometimes deployed for other purposes. Some
sector and subsector dukes maintain a large force equipped as
regular combat troops, and use them as a personal 'hammer' to back
up Imperial forces at need or fill in when they are not available.

However, the huscarles of most noble houses are normally limited
to a few light infantrymen. Forces above company size, and forces
of any size equipped other than as infantry with some air defence
capability, are unusual.

PLAYER NOBLES
It is likely that a player–character noble will hold a fairly minor rank,
such as a knight or baronet. More important people are unlikely
to be hanging around with adventurers, and if they do travel it will
normally be in the company of their retinue. This could be the basis
of a Traveller game, but unless the players all want to play that sort
of game it can be a problem.

Thus a player–character noble should not be adventuring as the
head of a great household. It is normally better to assume that the
character is away from the support of his family or house. Perhaps
he belongs to an impoverished house, or is in disgrace. Perhaps
he is a younger child who will not inherit, in which case he will not
have the title his social standing implies but would go by 'Lord...'
or possibly he will have a knighthood by virtue of his kinship to a
great lord.

Alternatively, the noble player–character might be travelling to see
the universe before he takes up the reins of power, or because the
family have decided to pay him to be somewhere else. There are
many reasons why this might happen, and most can be turned into
adventure fodder.

Thus a player–character noble will not be able to command armies
or Imperial ministries, nor bring to bear the resources of a noble
house. However, he/she has a 'name' and with a bit of clever talking
might be able to use that to advantage.

###### THE IMPERIAL ARMED FORCES

Although the individual member worlds of the Imperium provide for
their own local defence, and both corporations and noble houses

(^30) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
are permitted to operate security forces, large–scale threats are
dealt with by the Imperial armed forces.
There are three military forces: the Navy, the Marine Corps and the
Army, though the marines generally operate under the control of a
navy admiral when involved in large–scale operations. Organization
is by sector and subsector, following the general political structure
of the Imperium.
The armed forces are commanded by officers who have risen through
the ranks of their service. Many of these officers are nobles, but they
command by virtue of their military rank and position in the chain of
command rather than their noble titles. An Imperial baron serving
as an army colonel would be outranked by a non–noble general.
This situation is somewhat unlikely however, as senior officers tend
also to be high–ranking nobles.
Nobles, even sector dukes and similarly important individuals,
are not permitted to short–circuit the chain of command and give
direct orders to military forces. The sector duke must go through
the sector admiral rather than simply ordering a ship captain to
perform a task. However, in a crisis some leeway is permitted; the
captain might agree to follow the duke's 'suggestion' if it seemed
like a good idea or if sufficient influence was brought to bear.
The chain of command is fairly simple. Political direction comes
from the nobility, with the military as its instrument. The sector
duke might say something like, 'Admiral, please be so good as to
strengthen our naval presence along the Spinward–Coreward edge
of the sector; I recommend at least another battle squadron and two
or more cruiser squadrons'.
The admiral would then decide if this is possible and perhaps put
forward a counter–recommendation or indicate why the deployment
is not a good idea. Once a deployment is agreed, the admiral then
sends orders to his subordinates to despatch squadrons to their
new stations, who then instruct the individual captains.
The chain of command is important for many reasons, not least
to prevent a noble from causing an incident by sending ships
somewhere they should not be or stripping a vital region to cover
somewhere else. Communication lags make it vital that commanders
know where their assets are, which means that the services cannot
afford to have multiple individuals giving orders.
The difference between political direction and military plans can be
a slight one; representatives from the armed forces and the nobility
will usually be present at high–level planning sessions. However, the
distinction comes down to this: The armed forces are commanded
by their own officers. Military operations are ordered by senior
military officers in accordance with the political direction supplied by
the Emperor's representatives, ie the nobility – in short, the nobility
indicates what needs to be done and the military decides how and
what assets will be used. There is of course always communication
and an element of joint planning involved.
Whilst some military officers are also nobles, it is their current job
that indicates which side of the fence they are on – the nobleman–
commander of a military force is part of the military chain of
command, while a noble who is a retired naval officer advising the
sector duke is not. His advice may be well worth listening to but he
cannot give direct orders.
The system works like this. The sector duke says something like:
“We're being invaded. These key worlds must not fall and that trade
route must stay open. I'd like to think we could halt the attackers
about here...” The Navy responds by offering a plan which, after
some discussion, is approved. The admiral then orders his fleet
assets to their new locations and reports on progress to the sector
duke.
At some point a matter may arise that is more political than military,
such as the need to decide whether to retake certain territories or
strengthen the defences of others. This is at least partly a political
decision so the nobility needs to be consulted. However, purely
military matters such as specific unit deployment are the sole
province of military officers.
The Imperial Navy
The Imperial Navy is the 'Senior Service' in the Imperium. It is the
most prestigious of services and is considered a good route to social
advancement as well as a training–ground for young nobles.
The Navy is primarily concerned with maintaining the security of
the spacelanes and defending the Imperium from invasion or
lesser threats such as rebellion. It also upholds and enforces the
law, conducts emergency relief operations and 'shows the flag' to
remind member worlds that they belong to and are protected by the
might of the Imperium.
To carry out these roles the Imperial Navy uses a wide array of
vessels. The largest and most impressive are pure warfighting
ships with tremendous armament and protection. Most of these
are termed battleships, with the most capable being designated
dreadnoughts.
Cruisers are the workhorse of the fleets. Smaller and less powerful
than a capital ship (a battleship or dreadnought) they nevertheless
carry extremely potent weapons. Virtually all cruisers and capital
ships are built around a 'spinal mount', a super–huge weapon that
runs the length of the vessel. The spinal mounts of cruisers are
of necessity smaller than those of battleships but are capable of
damaging even a capital vessel.
There are many types of cruisers. As well as heavy and light general–
purpose cruisers, the navy makes use of strike cruisers, armored
cruisers, long–range 'rift' cruisers and a range of specialist vessels
for various purposes. Most fleets include numerous cruisers but
they can also be found operating alone or at the head of a task force.
An Imperial Navy cruiser is a very potent vessel and can deal with

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^31

many problems on its own. Many smaller navies are outgunned by
a single heavy cruiser.

The navy also maintains a large number of escort vessels of many
types. The largest of these include destroyers and fleet escorts. Some
are pure escort ships, designed to keep light craft and missiles away
from the capital units. Others are general–purpose ships capable
of carrying out a range of missions. Destroyers are the largest navy
ships commonly encountered on patrol.

Smaller escorts do exist, right down to ships like the Close Escort
or Patrol Cruiser (a long–standing misnomer; this tiny vessel is an
escort rather than a cruiser). These are the ships that do most of
the navy's work; patrol, piracy suppression, guardship duty and the
like. They also escort and protect larger vessels. There are never
enough escorts; the navy budget is huge but most of it is spent on
the capital ships and cruisers needed to prevent invasion by major
powers. Small ships for internal security are a lower priority.

The fleet also makes use of a range of carriers. Most are cruiser–
sized vessels capable of deploying dozens of fighters. The latter are
of very limited use in battle but can intercept missiles and other
small craft. Their primary role is security; a carrier can set up a wide
range of radar pickets with its fighter contingent and can deal with
most policing and security missions – a wing of fighters is more
than a match for the typical armed freighter used by pirates, or even
an escort–sized warship.

Another class of vessel, the battle tender, carries fighters, though
these are not its main striking arm. That distinction goes to a
squadron (3–5 usually) of 'battle riders'. These are non–Jump
capable warships which do not need to devote space to Jump drives
or fuel and so can carry the same weapons fit as a battleship on a
much smaller hull.

Other large non–Jump capable warships are termed monitors.
These are restricted to a single star system but provide a powerful
defensive capability for a modest cost. The navy sometimes deploys
battle riders in this role. Smaller non–Jump capable warships are
termed System Defence Boats and are often deployed in large
numbers to patrol and protect a system.

The navy also operates a range of support ships; couriers, auxiliaries,
hospital ships, logistics vessels, fuel tankers, scouts and troop
transports to carry army or marine assets.

The navy is divided for administrative purposes into Sector Fleets
and Subsector Fleets. Sector fleets are named for their home sector
and maintain a headquarters there, usually at a system–wide naval
depot. This star system is usually but not always named for the
sector, such as Depot/Lishun or Depot/Ilelish. The depot system
is heavily defended, often by non–Jump capable vessels such as
monitors and system defence boats. Most of the time significant
elements of the sector fleet will also be present.

There are also normally several naval bases throughout a sector.
These are more modest and can vary from a small installation serving
a patrol flotilla to the home port of several battle squadrons.

Most of the sector fleet's capital ships, those capable of fighting a
major action such as battleships, dreadnoughts and fleet carriers,
are concentrated at the depot, with the remainder deployed in
smaller battle forces at naval bases across the region. [[Capital]] ships
are kept concentrated to deal with major threats and are rarely seen
away from a major fleet. Most of the sector fleet's cruiser strength
is also kept concentrated, though cruiser squadrons (CruRons)
are more often deployed to smaller bases than battle squadrons
(BatRons).

Each Sector Fleet commander also has responsibility for a Subsector
Fleet corresponding to each subsector within the sector. This is
nominally 16 but of course in a sector like the Marches there are no
subsector fleets for subsectors lying outside the Imperium.

Subsector fleets are numbered rather than named and are
commanded by a lower ranking admiral who answers to the
sector commander. Where the sector fleet contains most of the
major warships assigned to the region, the subsector fleet is more
concerned with local affairs. It has been said that sector fleets fight
wars while subsector fleets keep the peace and protect commerce.

(^32) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
For this reason a subsector fleet usually has a single cruiser as
flagship and deploys mainly escorts and destroyers for patrol and
commerce–protection work. Of course, if a major incident arises,
the sector fleet is there to deal with it, and often vessels are loaned
from sector command to the subsector admiral's control.
Other fleet types can be created. For example, in wartime strike
fleets or battle fleets might be formed. Often the assets to create
these are loaned by other sector fleets, with the vessels returning to
their 'home' sectors when the war is over.
Most of the time, travellers will encounter the smaller vessels of
the navy on patrol, conducting boardings and customs inspections,
and in port between missions. Personnel on liberty can be found
around any port where a naval ship is docked. Recruiting offices
and liaison personnel are commonplace in the larger ports. Some
worlds also have naval installations co–located with their starport.
These range from bases for naval ships to specialist installations
such as logistics staging posts, repair yards or training grounds for
new recruits.
Occasionally travellers might see a fleet on exercise or encounter an
interdiction patrol. The latter exists to keep unauthorized personnel
and ships away from a 'red zoned' world, ie one to which civilian
access is restricted. Most naval installations can also be considered
'red zones'; ships approaching are usually boarded and searched
if they cannot explain their presence and will normally be turned
around and sent on their way unless they have the correct permits.
Ignoring a red zone is grounds for the navy to fire on a vessel,
though less aggressive methods are tried first.
THE COLONIAL FLEETS
The Imperial Navy is backed up by the so–called Colonial Fleets. The
name is archaic, probably dating from the Interstellar Wars period;
very few of the worlds that contribute to this part of the fleet are
colonies as such.
The colonial fleet is essentially a framework to allow the assets
of various worlds and organizations to be called up to assist the
Imperial Navy at need.
Worlds are permitted to maintain their own fleets for local defence.
Most settle for an orbital defence force and possibly a force capable
of patrolling their home system (collectively termed a 'system
squadron'), possibly backed up by a Jump–capable patrol vessel or
two as status symbols and/or for commerce protection.
However, some worlds maintain rather larger naval forces. There
are various reasons for this, with status being the main one. Almost
no worlds have battleships (though some buy old capital ships and
gut their drives to create a super–monitor to defend the system)
and few possess even cruisers. There is simply not enough need for
such expensive assets. However, forces of destroyers and escorts
are not uncommon for rich worlds, and these can be called upon for
service with the colonial fleet.
In addition, some nobles maintain a number of small warships as
part of their household forces and many corporations have armed
ships to protect their assets. Mercenary vessels can be hired and
many armed traders have a naval–auxiliary contract, trading a
maintenance discount for the chance of being called for military
service. Ships are also sometimes borrowed from the Scout
Service.
This rather random pool of naval assets is administered by the
colonial fleet administration, which calls up vessels as needed. In
peacetime, this is limited to the odd resupply mission for an armed
trader or a handful of escorts called up to strengthen anti–piracy
patrols. In wartime, the colonial fleet is generally used to replace the
more capable vessels of the Imperial Navy on convoy–escort and
patrol duty, freeing them for fleet service.
Larger colonial–fleet vessels such as cruisers and destroyers are
generally grouped into combat squadrons in wartime. They tend to
be older ships bought as surplus by their new owners and in less
than ideal condition, but extra hulls are always welcome.
The colonial fleet also keeps track of the 'Reserve Fleet'. This
consists of a pool of naval reservists and personnel who have left
the service but remain available for reactivation, and a collection
of 'mothballed' warships maintained at the depot and naval bases.
Surplus capital ships tend to end up in mothballs rather than being
bought up by private users as escorts. Thus the navy has a pool of
capital ships and cruisers (and also some smaller vessels) that can
be theoretically reactivated.
Many of these mothballed ships are in very poor condition and
some cannot be made combat–worthy, but the same could be said
of the reservists called up to crew them. However, given time it
is possible to create several extra BatRons and CruRons from the
Reserve Fleet. Ships (and personnel) tend to be of older designs
and may lack the edge of efficiency of newer and younger assets,
so ideally they are used in lower–threat areas to free more potent
assets. The reserve fleet has however fought some tough actions,
and probably will again.
The Imperial Marine Corps
The Marine Corps has two main functions. On the one hand it is a
'hammer' to smash problems flat with overwhelming firepower. On
the other, its personnel act as ship's troops for naval vessels and
guard important installations. By tradition, marines guard Imperial
embassies and provide an honor–guard to ambassadors.

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^33

conducting an infantry assault on a target. Such affairs tend to be over
very quickly; the Marine Corps does not mess about. However, not
all marines are trained to use battle dress and a smaller proportion
are actually equipped with it. Battledress–equipped marine forces
are used as a spearhead when available, but require a great deal of
support to keep them effective in the field. Fortunately, shipboard
workshops are available to accompany battledress–equipped forces
wherever they are deployed.

Marines are most commonly encountered guarding the Imperial
embassy at a starport or conducting boardings to inspect cargo or
ship's papers. All naval bases have a contingent of marines assigned
for both the defence of the base and any missions that may require
a rapid–reaction force.

The Imperial Army
The Imperial Army is organised somewhat similarly to the navy, with
regional command structures at the subsector and sector level. The
former tend to be small; little more than headquarters and liaison
units.

Unlike the navy, the army is not ubiquitous. Its manpower numbers
are huge, but these are concentrated at bases for the most part. The
army does have a security role but its assets tend to be deployed to
trouble spots rather than engaging in flag–showing operations.

Most worlds have some form of ground forces for their own defence
and security, and quite often the Imperial Army will provide liaison
or training assets to an important world. However, the majority of
planets are not guarded or defended by the army. Instead they rely
on their local forces, which can be equipped and organised in any
way the world can afford and thinks is appropriate.

The Imperial forces, however, are mostly equipped to a uniform
standard. Some specialist units do exist, mainly of a special–forces
nature, which have equipment geared to their role. One example
would be a unit drawn from an aquatic species and specialized in
underwater combat.

Imperial army formations use combined–arms techniques; artillery,
grav armor and aerospace defence assets are integrated into the
force at various levels. Most Imperial army units are lift infantry
formations. That is, a primarily infantry force with grav vehicles
for mobility. The infantry ride in grav armored personnel carriers
(APCs) and are equipped with combat armor and advanced
combat rifles plus support weapons. The formation will usually
contain several grav sleds carrying electronic warfare and artillery
weapons, and there will usually be some tanks available unless the
force is very small.

Other common formations include light infantry (optimized for
peacekeeping and urban combat operations), grav cavalry (light
armored striking and reconnaissance formations), armored

The Marine Corps does not possess warships of its own, but it does
operate armed troopships and assault transports. These have flight
crews 'on loan' from the navy but are under Marine Corps direction.
Marines do fly fighters and shuttles, and are trained in interface
operations wherein they might provide close support to ground
troops before climbing back to orbit to defend the transports.

The Marine Corps is primarily an infantry force. Every marine is
trained as a rifleman and learns cutlass drill for ceremonial purposes.
The cutlass is carried during boardings as a broad hint more than
anything else; if trouble erupts then firearms are normally preferred.
Marines serving as ship's troops provide security for the vessel and
act as escorts for officers undertaking liaison tasks or work parties
if it seems necessary. Most ships, like most embassies, have only a
small detachment of marines available.

Larger forces are created as necessary, but it is more common for
marines to deploy even to a war zone as companies and battalions
rather than brigades and divisions. The marines emphasise fast–
moving, hard–hitting short–term actions, often by firepower–heavy
but outnumbered forces. If a longer–term capability is required then
the army is normally deployed instead. Marine support, artillery,
armor and similar formations do exist but they are not numerous.

The most common image of the Imperial Marine Corps is a fairly
small force of marines, equipped with battle dress (powered armor)

(^34) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
infantry (infantry formations with a large tank force attached) and
grav armor (a primarily armored force with some infantry for
mutual support). In addition, the army maintains among its ground
forces a range of support formations such as electronic warfare
units, field hospitals and engineering formations.
However, there is more to the Imperial Army than this. The term
'army' might better be replaced with something like 'planetside
combat force', as the army also fights on and under the surface of
water. Maritime forces tend to be smaller than 'ground' forces but
this depends on the nature of the world being fought on. Maritime
formations range from combat divers or aquatic–species infantry to
surface ships and submarines.
The army is also capable of conducting aerospace and close–orbit
operations. While in theory any grav tank or APC can reach orbit, they
normally stay close to the ground for protection and concealment.
Aerospace assets include strike aircraft, orbital interceptors and
high–speed grav craft as well as tracking gear and ground–to orbit
missiles.
Not all worlds have a breathable atmosphere, so the army maintains
a large Protected Forces (ProtFors) contingent trained to operate in
harsh environments. ProtFors is something of an elite assignment
and units tend to be of a very high standard.
MERCENARIES, HUSCARLES AND CORPORATE FORCES
As already noted, corporations, nobles and other groups are entitled
to provide for their own defence. Normally this means maintaining
a few bodyguards or a handful of paramilitary security troops to
protect an installation or estate. However, larger military units do
exist.
Some worlds maintain military formations equipped and trained to
Imperial Army standards. There are various reasons for this, such
as status, but the commonest is to ensure that the world's armed
forces gain some operational experience even in peacetime. Some
powerful nobles maintain units for a similar purpose.
Thus it is possible to encounter an imperial army force which
contains a battalion on loan from a corporation, noble house or
planetary government, or a mercenary unit on contract to the
Imperial Army. In all such cases the unit will have been sworn in
(perhaps temporarily) as a unit of the Emperor's armed forces and
will be under the command of regular army generals.
Mercenary forces range from individuals and small teams through
platoon, company and even battalion sized units. Larger formations
are extremely rare. Equipment varies considerably. Mid–tech units
are much cheaper to hire than top–end formations, and are entirely
adequate for peacekeeping duty or on mid or low–tech worlds.
Many mercs are ex–Imperial army personnel and most are serious
professionals who give good value for money. There are fanatics,
thugs and wackjobs–for–hire on the merc circuit, but for the most
part the licensing and bonding process weeds the worst of these out.
A unit that has been hired for Imperial service can usually command
a higher fee afterward as this is generally seen as a guarantee of
quality.

###### THE IMPERIAL SERVICES

The armed forces defend and protect the Imperium, but the
other services keep it running. Often they go unnoticed, but the
bureaucracy and other services are vital to the daily function of the
Imperium. As a general rule noble rank is necessary to hold high
office in the services, and can be gained as a reward for service.
The Scouts are an exception; the egalitarian and generally maverick
nature of scouts means that few nobles join and fewer are created.

The Imperial Beauracracy
Perhaps the most important single component of the Imperium is the
Bureaucracy. Although the name suggests a stuffy, bean–counting
collection of accountants and clerks, this image is only about 99%
true. The Bureaucracy does occasionally have an exciting job, such
as when investigating an organization or world government that has
something to hide or is falsifying its imperial tax accounts. Things
can become life–threateningly interesting in such cases.

The life of an Imperial bureaucrat is, however, a stable and
comfortable one most of the time. It is a solid career offering a good
salary and benefits and the chance to meet important people once
in a while. The vast majority of personnel are the sort that find this
lifestyle attractive. It is also probably true that more rebellions and
crises have been averted by good accounting practices and timely
reporting of budget anomalies than have been smashed by the navy.
To those who want to make a difference without being shot at in the
process, the Bureaucracy offers a chance to serve and be rewarded
without taking undue risks.

However, what many people forget is that the Bureaucracy is
actually the Imperial administrative apparatus. That is, it contains
the sector and subsector dukes who make the big decisions, and
the power–brokers that make billion–credit deals every day. Imperial
bureaucrats do get sent on hazardous missions. Nobody builds
statues to records clerks and accountants, but there are those in the
Bureaucracy whose names are known to billions.

The Imperial Colonial Office
The Colonial Office (usually abbreviated ICO) administers 'colonial
territories', a catch–all term for Imperial possessions and worlds
that are being opened up for colonization. As such, its main areas
of interest are along the borders. However, it is also responsible for
overseeing areas within the Imperium such as prison worlds, reserve

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^35

worlds maintained by the Imperium and the territories (sometimes
whole planets) leased as sites for naval and army bases.

ICO deals with the selection and training of colonists for new
sites and the registry of mining claims that are not on worlds
with an Imperial–member government. This includes outsystem
planetoids and wilderness areas of colony worlds. ICO will provide
administrators, specialists and even a planetary governor to a
colonial mission if it is either an Imperial operation or if the backers
decide that going through ICO is the best option.

Technically, the office is also responsible for the itinerant Belter
communities that are not citizens of any given world. In practice
this is restricted to registering births and deaths if and when they
are reported and assigning Imperial ID to Belters who do not have a
homeworld government to do it for them. Such people are assigned
ID as 'Imperial Citizens' rather than as citizens of any given world.
This is usually the last involvement ICO has with them before filing
a death certificate some time later. Many Belters are very lax about
this, so accurate records are not possible.

The Diplomatic Service
The diplomatic service is one of the smallest Imperial agencies in
terms of numbers employed, but it is extremely important. The
diplomatic service acts as liaison between world governments,
corporate bodies, external states and the Imperium itself. It
provides an ambassador or liaison official and a small staff to many
worlds. These personnel are normally located at the capital and/or
the starport. Some of them assist the planet's noble representative
while others have a different role.

The main function of diplomatic service personnel is to help
Imperial citizens from offworld stay out of local trouble and to
assist in dealing with any issues that might arise. Most starports at
worlds with unusual or very strict laws have an advisory service in
place, which usually publishes simple guides to staying on the right
side of the law. The diplomatic service also has a number of lawyers
available, though normally only at worlds where they are likely to be
needed.

Note that the diplomatic service does not help Imperial citizens to
get away with committing crimes on member worlds; rather it tries
to prevent well–intentioned people from making mistakes through
ignorance of the law. Actual criminals can take their chances.

At a higher level, the diplomatic service maintains embassies at
worlds along the border and with foreign states. The ambassadors
at these sites are very powerful individuals who may be called upon
to negotiate on behalf of the Imperium. High noble rank is required
for these posts.

The Imperial Ministry of Justice
There are three sides to the Ministry of Justice. Firstly, it maintains
the legal records of the Imperium, interprets High Law and advises

other services on legal matters. Laws are made such by Imperial
decree but it is the IMOJ that drafts them and advises on their
implications. Secondly, the Ministry of Justice acts as an Imperium–
wide enforcement agency, dealing with major and high–level issues.
Personnel operating at this level are termed 'Agents'. The third
facet is street–level enforcement carried out by marshals and their
deputies.

The IMOJ exists mainly to enforce Imperial High Law, which
means that it spends most of its time and effort on apprehending
multi–world felons and investigating charges against governments
and organizations. The latter involves close cooperation with the
Bureaucracy and is often a drawn–out process of following financial
paper trails culminating in low–profile arrests.

However, the IMOJ also provides law enforcement at a more direct
level where this is appropriate. Starports and new colonies that
have no established enforcement system can request (and pay
for) a team from the IMOJ to be assigned. This will consist of an
appropriate number of marshals and deputies to keep order, and
may also include forensic scientists, detectives and administrative
personnel if the deployment is large enough to require them.

IMOJ personnel are always tasked with upholding Imperial law and,
where appropriate, local laws. The Ministry will not assign teams to
a world whose laws are considered 'inappropriate' even if they do
not violate the Imperial Charter – the IMOJ needs to maintain its
image and integrity, and its personnel are not required to enforce
the extreme laws of some Imperial member worlds.

When IMOJ agents and marshals are operating on a given world,
they normally have to follow local procedures and are bound by local
laws as well as Imperial ones. World governments have jurisdiction
in their own territory unless a formal IMOJ operation (for example,
an investigation into government malpractice or breaches of High
Law) is in process.

There are two fairly distinct career paths open to IMOJ personnel

- the deputy/marshal route or the agent route. Both can lead to
a high position as a judicial advisor though the balance is skewed
towards agents rather than marshals.

Travellers are most likely to encounter IMOJ marshals and their
deputies enforcing law in frontier outposts that have chosen
to request them. Agents are only likely to be encountered if the
travellers become involved in organised crime or become felons on
several worlds.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service
The IISS is not considered to be a military force, though its ships
and personnel are tasked with upholding the law and can be co–
opted into military operations at need. Scout vessels usually act as
messengers and reconnaissance assets, though sometimes they are
capable of functioning as escorts.

(^36) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
Most of the time, however, the Scout Service has a more peaceful
role. There are three main branches of the service, overseen by
the bureaucracy (that is, the scout service's bureaucracy, not the
Imperial administration). Within each branch there are various
subdivisions, such as contact & liaison or security. However,
personnel move between specialisms and even branches on a fairly
frequent basis. It is not uncommon for a scout to become bored with
communications duty and request a stint with the survey branch. If
a suitable berth is available and the comms branch can spare the
scout, a transfer will usually be forthcoming.
Scouts never actually leave the service. Instead they go on 'detached
duty' and are subject to reactivation at need. In practice younger,
more recently detached scouts are far more likely to be reactivated
than elderly men and women or those with families. Detached duty
can be requested at any time and is often approved – the Scout
Service would rather have a younger scout leave the service for a
time and possibly return than trust a burned–out and resentful
individual with a critical task.
Detached scouts do not receive a salary or support, though they
can usually get a bunk and a meal in any scout service installation
they visit. Occasionally a detached scout may be assigned a small
starship, though this often comes with strings attached. The usual
requirement is to file a short 'user report' on every starport the ship
visits for inclusion in the Scout Service files. Many detached scouts
return voluntarily to the service after a period doing something else.
The detached duty office also acts as a two–way clearing house
for personnel. It helps other agencies (Imperial and private) that
want to hire or 'borrow' scout personnel for a particular task find
someone suitable.
Conversely, the detached duty office also maintains records of
and pays salaries to non–scout personnel who are involved with
the service and its activities. This can include contractors carrying
out mundane work for the service but more commonly deals with
the scientists, engineers and consultants that the Scout Service
sometimes hires to round out a mission. These personnel are not
considered to be scouts and are not subject to reactivation, though
they remain on the detached duty office's books and may be called
upon again in preference to a complete outsider.
The three main branches to which most scouts belong are
the communications, exploration and survey offices. Comm–
branch maintains communications across Imperial space. It is
primarily concerned with the express boat (Xboat) network and
the tenders, communications stations and bases that support it.
Communications branch scouts also crew special courier ships and
packet boats that deliver important items and regular updates to
Imperial stations. As a rule naval couriers serve the navy and deliver
emergency messages; scout vessels move routine traffic.
The survey branch undertakes the mammoth task of surveying and
mapping every planet and asteroid in the Imperium, maintaining
up–to–date charts as well as population census figures, records of
starport types and quality, and all manner of other data–collection
tasks within the Imperium and just beyond it. Survey branch is
also responsible for monitoring many of the worlds that are under
Imperial interdiction. Some 'red zones' are imposed and monitored
by the navy (to punish a world for breaking High Law, for example)
but those that are imposed for other reasons (including dangerous
conditions or something of scientific interest) are normally
monitored by scout service ships of the survey branch.
The exploration office is responsible for charting new territories, be
they on a member world or far beyond the Imperium. As a rule the
exploration office maps an area and the survey office then moves
in and begins studying it. The same applies for newly–encountered
species; exploration personnel will normally make first contact but
it is the survey office that will study the new species. There are still
plenty of areas within Imperial space that have not been charted
in detail, so exploration teams can be encountered even in fairly
settled areas.
The scout service is unusual in that none of its field branches has
a rank system. Any given ship or mission has someone in charge,
and experienced scouts are sometimes given the courtesy title of
Senior Scout, but the overall system is that people are assigned a
job according to their skills. A scout who led one mission may be
assigned to another as an ordinary member of the team – though
leadership skills and experience tend to result in a string of command
positions.
The scout service administrative and planning arm is known as the
Bureaucracy but is entirely different from the Imperial service of
the same name. The Bureaucracy does have a rank and promotion
structure, which is viewed with suspicion by many 'field' scouts.
Most scouts serve their entire career in the field; some spend a
token period in the field and apply for a Bureaucracy job at one of the
regional scout bases or way stations. However, both the Bureaucracy
and the field value self–reliance, initiative and competence very
highly and plodding bean–counters tend to be weeded out by the
promotion structure.

###### OTHER GROUPS

A number of influential groups exist within the Imperium. These
often have nobles associated with them and thus are part of
the power structure, but some are outside the normal political
apparatus.

Shipping Lines
The shipping lines that ply the spacelanes between Imperial worlds
are vital to its economic and therefore political well–being. The
larger lines are extremely influential, though most are restricted to a
sector or two or a smaller area of operation and thus exert influence

TTHHEE TTHHIRDIRD IIMMPERIUMPERIUM^37

over a relatively limited region. Most lines operate on established
routes in a fairly limited area, though many are open to charters that
might take them outside their own area if the price is right. Ships are
generally of the same small number of classes

Most shipping lines operate on a sufficiently large scale that they
can sponsor students through university or train them from the
ground up, but all lines will gladly take ex–navy personnel or similarly
experienced people. These are not just flight crew of course. Most
lines have one or more bases where they conduct maintenance,
and thus they need security, administrative and other personnel to
support the actual flight operations.

Few shipping lines operate a vast miscellany of vessels; most have
one or two designs in every niche they occupy, and most are limited
to a segment of the marketplace. Some are purely bulk freighting
concerns, others known for their luxury liners. There are specialist
fast–courier or small–cargo shipping firms, general hauliers and
even a few firms specialising in high–risk exploratory trade outside
Imperial space.

To be a player in Imperial politics, a shipping line needs to have
dozens of ships and operate on the sector level at the very least.
However, there are plenty of smaller lines which have a handful of
ships to their name and make a reasonable profit working a small
region. So long as they remain below the threshold of interest of
the bigger lines, or work in a way that complements their activities,
these small lines can get by. If they tread on the toes of the shipping
giants they tend to be edged out rather rapidly.

Below the level of these 'subsector' shipping lines there are various
alliances of free traders and such like, which sometimes mature
into shipping corporations but more commonly break up after a
time. Alliances of this sort have little political power and get their
personnel wherever they can. On–the–job training for the odd
promising deck hand is possible but for the most part free traders
hire people who can already do the job as they lack the resources to
do otherwise.

Working for a shipping line (of whatever size) is an excellent way to
prepare for a life as a traveller. As a general rule, personnel can gain
promotion by moving down to a smaller line. A character working as
assistant engineer aboard a shiny corporate liner can accelerate his
promotion by taking a job as chief engineer aboard a smaller vessel
operated by a minor company. This may be accompanied by a pay
cut, however, and it is difficult to move in the opposite direction
without taking a demotion.

There is also the risk that the character may 'move down' too much
and end up working aboard a semi–legal vessel or broken–down free
trader. However, some people prefer to be a senior crew member
of a minor vessel to a life of luxury as a junior member of a more
prestigious crew.

Shipping lines need to protect their personnel, assets and vessels.
As a result ships can be armed, especially on the frontiers, and
all carry at least a few weapons in a locker. Some shipping lines,
however, take this a bit further and maintain a large security arm
that is almost a private army and even have a number of small
warships which are used to patrol dangerous systems or escort the
line's commercial vessels. Warships do not make a profit, so this
practice is only followed where the need is greatest.

Insurgents and Terrorists
While it is convenient to slap the label 'terrorist' on anyone whose
actions are disapproved of, the Imperium recognizes that there is a
difference between insurgents and terrorists. By definition, a terrorist
is someone who uses terror for political ends. The Imperium takes
a harsh stance on such activity, but is much more flexible towards
insurgents.

Insurgents are usually guerrilla fighters, but can sometimes be
organised conventional forces fighting against the government
of a world or the Imperium itself. This can create an awkward
situation for the Imperial authorities. On the one hand, the world
government is a member of the Imperium and entitled to support.
On the other, the Imperium recognizes the right of worlds to have
whatever government their people choose and an insurgency may
be an expression of the majority will.

There are also questions of morality and expediency. Should the
Imperium support a morally dubious government, or help overthrow
a liberal one in favor of a regime that fits well with Imperial plans
for the region? For these and other reasons such as the sheer costs
(in lives and money) involved the Imperium generally tries not to
become involved in 'local matters' such as insurgencies against a
world's government.

However, if the insurgents are anti–Imperium in outlook, plan
to secede, or if they are damaging Imperial assets and causing
needless suffering among the civilian population, then the Imperium
may send in the army or the marines. The diplomatic corps may
also become involved in trying to find a peaceful solution to the
situation.

Thus while terrorist acts often result in Ministry of Justice
involvement or a rapid military intervention if the scale justifies
it, local insurgencies are generally left alone. It is not illegal for
mercenary forces to fight on the side of insurgents, for example,
and the guerrillas themselves are normally treated as prisoners of
war. Terrorists are criminals and are dealt with accordingly.

Criminals and Pirates
It is inevitable in any society that there will be individuals who are
dissatisfied enough to take up arms in the name of their cause, and
others who prefer to ignore the law when it suits them. Most crime
is of a local and relatively minor nature and is a matter for local
governments to deal with.

(^38) TTTHHEHEE T TTHHIRDHIIRRDD I IIMMPERIUMMPPEERRIIUUMM
The Imperium does not generally waste resources chasing minor
criminals who have left one world and gone to another unless they
rack up a very impressive list of offences. Even murderers, although
by definition Imperial felons as well as local ones, are rarely actively
pursued. They are, however, often caught by passive enforcement
methods.
The Ministry of Justice circulates descriptions of wanted criminals
to starports and world governments, and often picks up felons in
the course of routine enforcement, such as identity checks when
passing through customs at a port. However, only the most serious
criminals are worth forming an Imperial task force to pursue across
the sector.
Many worlds have extradition treaties with their neighbors, and
many a criminal has thought himself safe only to be arrested for
something not even illegal on the new world, and sent back to face
trial.
The Imperial authorities tend to become involved when an individual
commits many crimes on various worlds and is clearly a serious
threat, or when a crime assumes political or economic significance.
Organised crime falls into this category, though normally if a group's
activities are restricted to one world then they are left for the local
police to deal with.
Organised crime on a multiworld scale is a threat to the stability of
the Imperium; indeed, many organised crime groups have political
connections and can influence policy. This is unacceptable to the
Imperium and is a major area of interest for the Ministry of Justice.
Piracy is another threat to the economic well–being of the
Imperium. Piracy takes various forms from planetary raiding, where
small communities are attacked by spacegoing raiders with actions
ranging from hijacking to traditional heave–to–and–be–boarded
piracy.
Most pirate attacks are one–offs carried out on an opportunistic
basis, sometimes by mercenary units or armed merchant ships
down on their luck and needing a quick source of cash. Some attacks
are relatively genteel and take the form of extortion more than true
piracy, but others are vicious indeed.
There are very few 'career' pirates in the Imperium. It is possible
to make a few raids and then move on, but brazen buccaneering is
not far short of suicide. The occasional pirate attack may not draw a
reaction from the navy or Ministry of Justice, but repeated attacks in
an area, or involving the same vessel, will draw a lethal response.
As a rule the navy maintains patrols to deter piracy and gathers
intelligence on their activities, while the Ministry of Justice looks
for tell–tale signs of where the cargoes or stolen ships are being
sold. If a base can be identified, it will be smashed in a sudden
overpowering raid by naval, marine and IMOJ assets.
Smuggling is not regarded as seriously as piracy in the Imperium,
though there are still stiff penalties. On the other hand, commerce
raiding is legal within certain limits. If it is part of a properly declared
war and conducted in an humane manner then it is permissible
to attack merchant traffic for the purpose of damaging an enemy
economy. Raider captains have to be careful not to cross the line
into piracy, however.
Pirate and smuggling rings, at least the successful ones, are usually
involved with organised crime of other sorts, and thus can take on
political significance.
Religious Groups
The Imperium has no official religion. It is tolerant and respectful
of all religions and belief systems, other than those that contravene
the basic sentients' rights that the Imperium grants to all self–aware
people. In short, Imperial citizens are free to believe what they like,
or nothing, so long as it does not harm anyone else.
There are a great many religions within Charted Space. Some are
restricted to one species (and some are distinctly racist) while
others appeal to all manner of beings. Religions have no special
status; they are treated the same as business concerns and political
groups. They must pay tax and follow the same laws as any other
group. To the Imperium a religious gathering is much the same
thing as a fishing club, and an evangelical preacher is the same as
a salesman on the starport concourse offering cut–price personal
comm upgrades. Religion is there if people want it (like fishing
clubs and comm upgrades) and if they do not then there are limits
on how pushy its proponents are allowed to be.
Religions are permitted Imperial representation by nobles like
any other group, and world governments are allowed to sponsor
religions. Indeed, some worlds are theocracies where the religious
leaders are the government. Such governments are technically not
allowed to force mandatory worship on their population, but this is
often overlooked on the occasions when it does happen.
Some religions are more militant than others, and schisms within
religions have led to a number of insurgencies and outright wars in
the past. Where possible the Imperium stays out of such matters as
they can become very tangled indeed.

###### OVERVIEW OF THE SPINWARD

###### MARCHES

To the average citizen of the Imperial core worlds, the Spinward
Marches is just a name. One of the distant provinces perhaps, or
one of those troublesome backward border regions. Nothing good
seems to ever come out of the Marches. The Civil War was launched
from there; major conflicts with foreign states seem to be two–a–
penny... and in any case the Marches are around the end of the
Great Rift, very far away, and of no real consequence.

There is an element of truth in this, of course. The Marches are
isolated not only by distance but by the barrier of the Great Rift,
which cannot be crossed without considerable effort. As a result,
the only way into and out of the Marches is through the narrow
Imperial–held strip between the Great Rift and the Vargr extents,
aptly named Corridor sector.

On top of that, Spinward Marches sector is the Imperial border with
the Zhodani Consulate and several smaller human, Vargr and other
states. As a result it was bound to have an interesting history. Mostly
events in the Marches affect only the local area, but occasionally
something does spill out. Usually it is something bad – that is just
the way the universe works.

To a great extent, astrography dictates many of the characteristics
of the sector. The single most important feature is the Spinward
Main, which wends its way right across the sector, branching at
several points. The Spinward Main is often considered to begin at
Mora, though in fact the chain of stars runs onward into Star Lane
subsector in Deneb sector for a couple of parsecs.

From Mora, an arm of the Main runs Coreward into Rhylanor
subsector, but the Main proper is far longer. One of the major arms
run Coreward into Aramis and Regina subsectors, then across to
Spinward all the way to Querion subsector. The central arm runs
through the Sword Worlds to Darrian subsector, while the Rimward
arm splits into three major branches. One leads to Glisten and two
run into Five Sisters.

The most important implication of this huge astrographical feature
is that it is possible to reach any subsector of the Marches with
a Jump–1 ship, albeit slowly. A Jump–2 ship can reach almost any
world in the sector by following the Main then Jumping across onto
a smaller local main. Only a handful of worlds cannot be reached
in this way.

There are a few areas of very sparse systems in the Marches, and
these tend to channel and restrict shipping. One is in Aramis

subsector but lies close to the border so has little effect on internal
shipping. Rather more important is the sparse area in the Vilis and
Lanth subsectors.

Not only is this a region of low stellar density, which restricts
easy navigation, but the area is associated with a number of
curious phenomena. While most can be dismissed as wild tales,
the incidence of Misjumps and ship disappearances in the region
around what is known as the Abyss Rift is significantly higher than in
other areas. The region of sparse systems extends out to Spinward
from Vilis but as there is no Imperial territory in this direction this
is of little consequence.

The other region of low stellar density lies to Spinward–Coreward
of Collace in District 268 and is known as the Collace Rift. Arms of
the Spinward Main run around the edges of this rift, which contains
the barely–surveyed world designated 875–496 and the interdicted
Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory.

Politically, there are few barriers to navigation in most of the sector.
The Sword Worlds Confederation is not friendly to the Imperium
and this necessitates a detour around Sword Worlder space for most
ships headed into the Darrian Confederation. Difficulty of access
also means that the Imperial holdings in Five Sisters subsector are
more or less cut off from the rest of the Imperium.
Obviously, crossing the border into the Zhodani Consulate
presents significant problems as Imperial ships are not always
welcomed there. The same comments apply to the Sword Worlds
Confederation. Ships coming into the Imperium from these states
are sometimes considered somewhat suspect by the Navy and the
worlds they visit.
The Imperial border is not a hard barrier. It is a simple enough matter
to leave Imperial space, visit worlds outside the Imperium and
later return. No special permission is needed. However, while the
Imperium has laws that govern trade between member worlds these
do not apply to systems outside the Imperium, and those systems
have their own regulations. Thus although crossing the border is
not a big deal, the way ships are treated by the local authorities
when they make planetfall can be a disincentive to cross–border
trading in some areas.
Above all, it is important to note that each world, whether part of
the Imperium or not, is different and self–governing. The Imperium
is a framework that establishes some common concepts and laws,
and otherwise leaves worlds to their own devices. There are large
cultural differences between many of the worlds of the Imperium.
Beyond its borders this is even more pronounced, though only the
most isolated worlds are not affected in some way by the values and
ideas that exist elsewhere in the universe.

###### HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

To understand why the sector is the way it is, it is necessary to look
back over its long and somewhat troubled history.

It seems likely that the Ancients were active in the Spinward Marches
region. There is certainly evidence of that, in the form of transplanted
Terran species. Various animals and plants native to Terra and other
distant worlds were found in the region when human exploration
began. There were also humans living in the area; the Daryen people
for one, and the rather more powerful Zhodani not far away.

Plus, there are a couple of interesting anomalies. Several Ancients
sites and many more artefacts have been located, and the Ancients
are thought to have been somehow responsible for the fact that
Shionthy is now an asteroid belt; there is strong evidence that it was
a planet until, in cosmological terms, quite recently.

However, little is known about ancient times in the Marches.
Archaeologists turn up some new data from time to time but the
work is both intermittent and piecemeal. Evidence has been found
of non–human civilizations dating from the distant past but which
are not thought to be associated with the Ancients. Perhaps time
and research will make all this clearer.

In the meantime, it is known that the Ancients were here at some
point and that they did a number of things that suggest a fairly
lengthy stay. They are gone now. Beyond that, everything is a matter
for conjecture.

Information about the Zhodani is hard to come by and not always
reliable, but it seems likely that they arrived on their homeworld
(Zhdant) about 300,000 years ago. They were brought from
elsewhere (perhaps Terra) by the Ancients, who settled them and
undertook a range of incomprehensible acts including remodelling
mountains and cutting then refilling ocean trenches. They also
reportedly built a city on the moon of Zhdant.

Soon afterwards, possibly as little as a few hundred years, Zhdant
came under severe orbital bombardment. It is thought that the
Ancient cities and other sites were destroyed using several hundred
megatons of nuclear explosives as well as deadfall ordnance (objects
dropped from orbit as kinetic weapons) and weapons that have not
been identified. Modern Zhodani are descended from a few tens of
thousands of survivors, who were cast back to barbarism. There are
no records of survivors among the Ancients, at least not among the
data that the Imperium has been able to gather from the Zhodani
Consulate.

The Zhodani Consulate
Over the next tens of thousands of years the Zhodani struggled to
survive an ice age triggered by the bombardment and, as conditions
improved, began to spread out across the planet. By approximately
–24,000 (using the modern Imperial calendar), the Zhodani had
evolved into their modern form and were increasingly reliant on
agriculture rather than nomadic hunting.

Imperial scientists believe that there was once a large population of
Chirpers on Zhdant. They might have been put there by the Ancients
or could perhaps have been native. In either case, human contact
with the Chirpers, who had built their own society, resulted in the
discovery that these Chirpers had psionic abilities. Zhodani humans
may or may not have gained their initial insight into psionics from
the Chirper population; what is known is that from about the time
the humans and Chirpers encountered one another, Zhodani
humans began to display psionic abilities.

Zhodani sources are vague about the Chirpers; apparently they all
died out at some time within recorded history. There is also evidence
that some time around –8000, the Zhodani suffered some kind of
disaster, probably depopulation due to a plague. There may be a
connection between these events.

Civilization was rebuilt slowly, and not without difficulty. However,
by –6,731 a technological society existed on Zhdant. This was the
date of the first Psionic Games, the beginning of modern Zhodani
society. The Games established a path for a psionically talented
commoner to join the nobility and helped find the most powerful
psionic individuals in each generation. The period between games
(three local years) is still a fundamental concept in Zhodani society.
For example, it is the term served by most elected officials.

The Zhodani are thought to have begun (though some sources say
'regained', which has interesting implications) space travel around
–6400. Within 400 years they were launching sublight exploration
missions to neighboring systems. The Zhodani were apparently
willing to undertake very long–term operations; they created colonies
in several systems and sent out exploration ships on missions
lasting decades. The Zhodani Consulate was founded in –5,823 and
consisted of worlds as far as four parsecs from Zhdant.

In –5415 the Zhodani developed Jump drive and rapidly expanded
their territory, encountering sentient species along the way. They
seem to have met the Vargr around –2,800 and the Vilani in about
–2,000. However, Zhodani exploration was unusual in one very
significant way; they seem to have been fascinated by the Galactic
Core.

Since the first, in –4,000, the Zhodani have launched seven major
and many more minor Core Expeditions. These have gradually
pushed towards the galactic core, establishing a chain of refuelling
and repair bases and setting up relations with the species met along
the way.

The expeditions seem to be limited to a region about 30 parsecs wide
(with occasional offshoots) and over 8,000 parsecs long. Imperial
scientists do not know the purpose of these missions, but suggest
that given the time and expense involved they must be considered
very important.

The Zhodani Consulate expanded fairly rapidly from about –4,000
to –1,000, at which point it halted. Unlike the Imperium, there is
no 'border creep'; the Consulate has been stable for two thousand
years. According to Zhodani sources, it has reached the largest
size that can be effectively governed and further expansion is both
unnecessary and counterproductive in the long term.

Although it holds a few worlds in the Spinward Marches, the Zhodani
Consulate did not push into the sector and thus had a stable border
when later arrivals appeared on the scene.

The Rise and Fall of the Darrians
Meanwhile, another transplanted group of humans was becoming
active in the region. Like the Zhodani, the Darrians were settled on
a habitable world by the Ancients for reasons unknown and were
then abandoned there when the Ancients 'departed'. Darrian was
a very habitable world and there was thus less impetus to develop
technology than elsewhere. The Darrians developed slowly and
peacefully.

Many centuries later, in –1520, while the Rule of Man was declining
into the Long Night, a fleet of ships belonging to a Terran corporation
arrived at Darrian seeking a new home. They befriended the

Darrians rather than competing with them and by –1400 a synthesis
of the two cultures had emerged. This had the best features of both
groups; the energy and inquisitiveness of the Terrans fused with
the intellectual nature of the Darrians to create a technologically
advanced yet ethical society.

Both groups were capable of interbreeding and within 400 years
there was only one Darrian race and culture. Moreover, it possessed
technology rated at TL16 on the Imperial scale – better than the
Imperium itself has managed to create to date. However, this was
the Darrians' undoing. They began to experiment on Tanis, Darrian's
sun, in –1000 and in –924 the star destabilized.

It is thought that the event known as Mahgiz, (Chaos, in the
Darrian language) was caused by a probe sent into the star to
conduct an experiment of some sort. Whatever the cause, a series
of massive solar flares erupted. These were accompanied by a huge
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which radiated out from the star at
lightspeed.

The pulse did no physical damage but destroyed electronics. At
a stroke factories, hospitals, businesses and starships lost their
electronics systems. Vehicles crashed, automated systems went out
of control and communications went down. The pulse was followed
by a wavefront of stellar gas moving more slowly. Three weeks after
the EMP, Darrian was devastated by fire from space, which killed
over 80% of the population and effectively destroyed civilization on
the planet.
Although the gas dissipated in the Darrian system, the EMP struck
other systems as it radiated out. With some warning, it was possible
to preserve electronic systems from the worst effects. However, the
heart had been torn out of the Darrian civilization. Without the
technology and industry of the homeworld there was no way to
replace or sustain technological items such as starships possessed
by the Darrian colonies.
In –905, the Darrians began taking measures to ensure their long–
term survival. Starships were placed in storage and each colony
looked inward, preparing to survive the difficult times ahead. By
–860 the Darrians had ceased all space travel.
Over the next six centuries the world of Mire gradually climbed back
up to TL10 and began constructing starships. Its cache of surviving
vessels were broken out and refurbished, and the Darrians returned
to the stars. In –275 they reached out to begin exploring nearby
space. What the found was both surprising and ominous.
Newcomers in the Marches
Settlers set out from Terra and other worlds throughout the
Interstellar Wars and the Rule of Man. Some used cryogenic
suspension, some attempted to use generation ships. Most had
Jump–capable vessels. The fate of many groups will never be
known. Indeed, there are almost certainly still a number of sublight
vessels filled with now–dead frozen colonists headed out into the
unknown.
However, the fate of some missions was less grim. One such reached
the world now named Gram in Sword Worlds Subsector and in –399
founded a colony there. This group was composed mainly North
Europeans from Terra, and possibly due to difficult times early on,
developed a rather unique culture based on an idealised version of
Icelandic/Scandinavian values. As the colony grew, surrounding
worlds were colonized and were named for swords in Terran
mythology. A government of sorts, based on the world of Sacnoth
and known as the Sacnoth Dominate, eventually emerged.
In –164 the Sword Worlders, as they were now known, encountered
the re–emerging Darrians, much to mutual surprise. The two
cultures were very different; the Darrians egalitarian and intellectual,
the Sword Worlders chauvinistic, obsessed with personal honor
and above all far too 'manly' for their own good. Cultural and
occasionally military conflict flared up from time to time between
the Darrians and the Sword Worlders, and has never really ceased.
However, the Sword Worlders spent most of their time bickering
among themselves, and by –102 the Sacnoth Dominate had
broken up in rebellion. The subsequent period of civil war caused
all interstellar government among the Sword Worlds to collapse
by –80. Each of the Sword Worlds went its own way, forming local
alliances or honoring old debts of honor for past assistance but
never forming a single government. There were many attempts,
some of them violent, but none that achieved any real success.
Meanwhile, not far to Rimward of the Marches, another group of
worlds was being settled. A European long–range colony mission
using sublight ships was launched in –2452, just 30 years before the
invention of the Jump drive. The mission consisted of three ships,
all aimed at worlds close to one another. C–Jammer reached New
Home in –6. Van de Lubbe landed its colonists at what became
Neubayern in –2 and Voyageur reached Amondiage, in Year 0.
The colonists of course knew nothing of the Interstellar Wars or
the First, Second or Third Imperium. The colony ships moved on,
still using sublight travel, and settled nearby systems. Each then
went its own way; New Home being the first to build new spacecraft
in 270. Gradually the inhabitants of what became known as Old
Islands subsector spread out to other worlds and into New Islands
Subsector. However, as these two relatively dense clusters of stars
lay in the middle of the Great Rift, they remained cut off from events
elsewhere for many centuries.
Finally, in 983, an Imperial Interstellar Scout Service vessel
(IISS Eldorado) Misjumped into the Islands and obtained local
assistance in getting home. The secret of the Jump drive was thus
obtained by the people of Serendip Belt, who used it to begin a war
of conquest.
Some years later, in 1016, an IISS mission reached the Islands
and discovered the results of the inadvertent intervention. In a
misguided attempt to put things right, Jump drive technology was
distributed among the other worlds of the subsectors. Since that
time, a number of small conflicts have been fought and the various
factions have embarked on a massive arms race that none of them
can afford. The result is that today the Islands subsectors are divided
into a number of armed camps, with over–militarised states itching
to use their excessively inflated fleets on one another.
The history of the Islands subsectors is peripheral to that of the
Marches, except for two factors. Firstly, they form part of a difficult
but useable route across the Great Rift for high–Jump couriers and
military vessels. This allows much more rapid contact between
Imperial holdings in Verge and Gushmege sectors and the Marches
than would be possible by going all the way around the Rift. Secondly,
the presence nearby of several states that will avidly buy military
technology or actual weapon systems has influenced the economic
position in the Rimward end of the sector for the past century.
Another influence on the region, though a minor one, was exerted
by the Aslan. The Aslan home region lies across the Great Rift and
although they have possessed the Jump drive for two thousand
years the Aslan have only recently arrived in the Marches. In fact
the first recorded crossing of the Great Rift occurred in –1104, and
gradually a number of colonies were set up on the Coreward side.

It is not known exactly when the Aslan entered the Marches. Quite
probably, explorers were active in the region centuries before the
first recorded contacts. It is known that Aslan were present on the
world of Romar in District 268 by 454, and contact with the Zhodani
was made in 461.

In 585, several groups of Aslan ihatei offered to fight for the Darrian
Confederation in return for grants of land. Since that time the
Darrian Confederation has had a fair sized Aslan population and has
recruited many thousands of Aslan troops into its armed forces.

###### THE IMPERIUM IN THE MARCHES

The Third Imperium was founded in Year 0 and expanded quickly at
first. After the end of the Pacification Campaigns, this changed. The
Imperium as an entity was no longer particularly concerned with
expansion. It was entirely willing to accept new members and for
corporations and other bodies to launch expeditions beyond the
borders, but the initial deliberate expansion had been replaced by a
gradual 'border creep'.

Expansion to Coreward was curtailed by the Vargr Extents, a large
area filled with small states and independent worlds with mostly
Vargr populations. Major states were encountered in most other
directions, or rifts created natural barriers. However, there was a
narrow corridor between the Coreward end of the Great Rift and the
Vargr extents, and through this bottleneck the Imperium gradually
expanded into the region beyond. This area is often referred to as
lying 'behind the claw' as the shape of the Great Rift resembles a
lobster claw to most observers.

When they began exploring behind the claw, the early Imperial
scouts found an under populated region which eventually led to the
Sword Worlds and the Darrian Confederation. These two small but
developed powers lay close together; islands in a sea of unclaimed
worlds. Before meeting them, however, the Imperial scouts ran unto
the Zhodani in Year 50. Initial contact was tentative and it was some
time before the scale of the Zhodani Consulate was appreciated.

After establishing a forward base at Deneb, the scouts pushed
on to open up the region, and behind them came the traders and
the colonists. In the region around Deneb itself, to Trailing of the
Marches, expansion was fairly rapid and many colonies received
considerable investment. The result was the creation of several
economically important worlds. Movement into the Marches was
slower and was made in piecemeal fashion.

One of the biggest developments for the Marches was the
establishment of a trading settlement at Mora. Set up by Ling
Standard Products in Year 60, this was initially the far end of a long
trade route through Corridor and Deneb sectors from the Imperial
core. Over the years it gradually developed into a forward base for
trade with the new colonies of the Marches and with the states
encountered there.

Contact with the Sword Worlds was in 73, but it was not until 148 that
the Darrians met the Imperials. During this time the Sword Worlds
managed to create a new unified government, the Triple Dominion
(shared by Anduril, Colada and Dyrnwyn) which lasted from 104
to 217. It may be that the Sword Worlders deliberately discouraged
the Imperials from moving through their territory and thus meeting
their Darrian rivals. Certainly the amount of scouting missions in
that direction dropped fairly rapidly.

By 200, Imperial interest in new territory, especially in distant regions
that were hard to reach, had waned. Expansion in the Marches thus
proceeded in a disjointed manner, fuelled by economics and on a
fairly small scale. The presence of the Spinward Main, a long chain
of stars connected by a Jump–1 route, enabled easy access to large
parts of the sector. The remainder was largely ignored and there was
little interest in pushing out beyond, even to Spinward or Rimward
where there were open borders. To Coreward the Zhodani Consulate
blocked further expansion in that direction.

In 250, the Imperium had spread into those parts of the sector
easily reachable via the Spinward Main, bypassing less accessible
regions. Regina, settled as early as 75, became a major trade center,
acting as a hub for half a dozen neighboring worlds. By 250 this
number had grown to 17, though some were very minor colonies.
Expansion slowed still further as the easily–reached worlds were
taken. Colonies grew into independent world–states in their own
right and the region developed a respectable economy. However,
backwaters remained exactly that; few new colonies were founded
in most parts of the sector.

By 500, tensions with the Zhodani Consulate were rising. Imperial
expansion, though slow, had resulted in Imperial and Zhodani
colonies being intermingled along the border. After a period of
escalating tensions, war broke out in 589. The conflict took the
form of skirmishing along the border and deep raids into the sector
against the main Imperial worlds there. The Imperial fleet was
caught at less than full readiness, and the Zhodani had formed the
first Outworld Coalition with Vargr states in Gvurrdon sector.

Eventually the Imperials were able to force a stalemate and the
subsequent armistice, enacted in 604, ended what is now known
as the First Frontier War. The Imperium lost some territory but was
compensated with ownership of large unclaimed areas of the sector.
Had the Zhodani wanted these systems they had had centuries to
take them unopposed, so this was an easy concession for them to
make.

The Imperial commander in the Marches, Grand Admiral Olav
hault–Plankwell, was deeply disgusted at the lack of support he had
received during the war. Desperately needed reinforcements were
not released from other sector fleets despite Plankwell's entreaties.
When they finally arrived, the reinforcements were enough to force a
stalemate, after which Plankwell used them for another purpose.

With his fleet at his back, Plankwell advanced on Capital, assassinated
Empress Jacqueline and took the Iridium Throne for himself. This
began the Civil War, during which a series of emperors ruled for
brief periods. These 'Emperors of the Flag' or 'Barracks Emperors'
were almost all naval commanders who defeated the last claimant
only to fall in battle themselves.
While the Civil War was raging, the Outworld Coalition reformed
and struck again, in 615. The Second Frontier War, which lasted
until 620, was characterised by a brilliant if rather desperate holding
action orchestrated by Grand Admiral Arbellatera Alkhalikoi, coupled
with raids by Imperial cruiser forces into enemy territory. Benefiting
from a crash–building program intended to replace the losses
incurred in the Frontier and Civil wars, Arbellatera was able to
fight the Outworld Coalition to a bloody standstill. She unilaterally
negotiated an armistice that ceded more Imperial territory to the
Zhodani and, as Plankwell before her, advanced on [[Capital]].
The Second Frontier War ended in 620, and in 622 Grand Admiral
Arbellatera reached [[Capital]] and defeated the fleet of Emperor
Gustus. Rather than simply take the crown, she appointed herself
Regent, holding the throne in trust until the Imperial Moot could
settle the matter of succession. Arbellatera was crowned Emperor
by the Moot in 622, ending the Civil War and beginning the modern
dynasty.
These events stripped the Marches of its fleet, but there was no
resumption of hostilities with the Zhodani for many years. Indeed,
it was not until 979 that conflict broke out once again. There had
been incidents and even a few skirmishes in the intervening time,
and tensions had been rising for some years.
Despite this, the Imperial response was disjointed and, overall,
inadequate. The war mainly took the form of commerce raiding by
cruisers while the battle fleets of both sides faced off but did little.
The Navy and the Emperor himself were censured for their lack of
activity, and eventually, in 986, a peace agreement was reached. The
terms were unfavorable to the Imperium and this, coupled with
general disaffection over the way the war was prosecuted, resulted
in the abdication of Emperor Styryx.
The settlement did eliminate some problematical border regions
and allowed a good defensive frontier to be set up in accordance with
the 'thin hard crust' strategy then in use. This strategic model called
for a forward defensive zone to held as strongly as possible and was
later replaced by a more flexible system of defence in depth.
Peace returned to the Marches, though elsewhere the Solomani
Rim War distracted Imperial attention for some time. Then, in
1082, the Fourth Frontier War erupted. This conflict was triggered
by an unintentional incident and took the form of a series of naval
battles along the frontier. It was over quickly; peace was made in
1084, before the Emperor's orders for conduct of the war, or any
significant reinforcements, reached the Marches. Again there was
some slight realignment of borders.
Since the end of the 'False War' as it is sometimes known, the region
has been at relative peace. There are troubles on various worlds, the
occasional Imperial intervention or trade war between corporations
and so forth but there are no indications that major troubles are
brewing.
The Marches Today
The Spinward Marches of today, in the year 1105 since the founding
of the Third Imperium, are the product of great and small events.
The distant and more recent past continuing to influence the present
with many initiatives and movements afoot. Some are overt, some
are hidden and some a combination of both. The consequences of
some of these actions cannot be predicted even by their instigators.
Whatever else may or may not be true, the Marches of 1105 are an
interesting place.

###### STATES AND PEOPLES OF THE

###### MARCHES

The majority of worlds and people in the Marches are part of
the Imperium and are dealt with below. Note however that the
Imperium is not a monolithic organization; it has many power blocs
and interest groups, and some of these are aligned with external
factions. Others are pursuing their own ends which may not coincide
with the best interests of the Imperium as a whole.

The Aslan
There are no Aslan worlds in the Marches, but there are Aslan
populations on several worlds. Some of these are integrated into
the local population (such as in the Darrian Confederation) while
others remain aloof in their own settlements. Some are present
legally and with the blessings of the world government; some are
squatters who have simply grabbed some land and set up a home.

This is a common practice among Aslan ihatei, or 'second sons'.
Aslan males value land ownership very highly, but only the primary
heir inherits. Some Aslan males are happy to serve their clan in a
subordinate role. The ihatei are the others; those who have set out
to make their own fortune.

Ihatei settlements sometimes trade in either goods or services –
several worlds have small units of Aslan mercenaries as part of their
planetary armed forces. Others are simply armed camps whose
inhabitants just want to be left alone and are prepared to repel any
attempt to interfere with their plans.

Aslan society is very male–dominated, with females taking
supporting roles as managers, technicians and scientists while the
males are pilots, soldiers and leaders. This could make them rather
difficult to deal with, but in many ways Aslan can be simpler to get
along with than Sword Worlders.

Aslan have strict culture of duty and honor, and can be insulted
very easily by those that do not understand their ways. Some Aslan
are more understanding about the cultural ignorance of outsiders
than others. However, the basics of Aslan etiquette (at least enough
not to get into serious trouble) can be fairly quickly picked up, which
enables most people to interact with Aslan without being challenged
to a duel or finding themselves outside the Aslan territory with a
warning never to come back.

Aslan trade ships and mercenary units are fairly common in the
Marches, with ihatei settlements being restricted mainly to the
Spinward–Rimward corner of the sector. Individuals and small
groups have settled on many worlds and are unlikely to attract
comment on most Imperial worlds.

The Darrian Confederation
The Darrian Confederation is an ally of the Imperium, and welcomes
Imperial ships subject to the usual customs checks and traffic
controls. The Darrian alliance dates from 595 and was a response to
a Sword Worlder invasion of the Entropic Worlds, then a territory of
the Darrian Confederation, during the First Frontier War in 593.

The Darrians control a fairly small area of space, containing 17
worlds. This number has changed from time to time, largely due to

Sword Worlder invasions, but otherwise the Confederation is very
stable. However, some Imperial citizens view the Darrians with a
certain amount of suspicion.

The reason for this is the Darrians' possession of the Star Trigger, a
doomsday weapon based on the probe that caused their own near–
extinction in the Maghiz (Chaos). A version of the Star Trigger was
reportedly deployed around 400 and is carried aboard vessels of the
Special Arm, a Darrian force dedicated to protecting the Star Trigger
and using it if the need arises.

The Special Arm has at least one secret base; it is not known how
many ships they have, nor how many Star Triggers are operational.
As far as is known, the weapon has not been tested in the field. A
successful test would be fairly noticeable, so the assumption is that
one has not been made. The Darrians, however, maintain that they
had a working Star Trigger available if they need it.

Being a fairly small state, the Darrian Confederation maintains a
modest but capable navy crewed by Darrian and Aslan personnel. A
handful of TL 16 vessels exist. These are relics left over from the pre–
Maghiz period and cannot be replaced or even properly maintained,
so they are used very sparingly.

Darrian ships regularly conduct exchange training with Imperial
vessels, and joint operations are not unknown. For the most part, the
Confederation patrols and polices its own space and the Imperium
does likewise. Trade ships, on the other hand, come and go as they
please. However, the need to go through the unwelcoming Sword
Worlds or around through neutral space does limit the volume of
trade somewhat.

The Darrians are not at war with the Sword Worlders but a state
of mutual mistrust and dislike exists, seasoned with ongoing
resentment over the Entropic Worlds and other issues, but for
various reasons neither side wants an open war.

The Confederation is not expansionistic. There are many unclaimed
worlds nearby, but the Darrians have never showed much interest
in acquiring new territories. Its people are much more interested in
scientific research and finding ways to improve their peaceful lives.

Darrian itself receives fair numbers of tourists who want to see the
high–tech wonders left behind by the Maghiz. However, the capital
of the Confederation is at Mire, which was the first world to regain
spaceflight and is today the center of both government and the
economy.

The Droyne
Droyne can be encountered all over the Marches, though not
commonly. There are a few communities on various worlds, mostly
in isolated areas, and several ships that move around according to
whatever agenda they may have.

There are two Droyne–owned worlds in the Marches; Candory
and Andor. Both lie close together in Five Sisters subsector where
only Jump–3 ships can reach them. Both are interdicted by strong
Imperial Navy squadrons for reasons that are classified. Most
people believe that the interdiction has to do with the Droyne use of
psionics, which is of course disapproved–of by the Imperium. The
authorities decline to comment when asked.
Droyne ships come and go from these two worlds and are sometimes
sighted in ports across the Marches and beyond. There is also some
civilian access, mainly to trade ships with special permits in place.
However the Droyne themselves, like those living in small enclaves
on various worlds in the Marches, do not seem to be very interested
in outside contact.
It is entirely possible to visit the same Droyne Oytrip (community)
on several occasions and receive a different reception each time. The
Droyne do not explain themselves to outsiders. They are something
of a mystery even to the experts that study them. To the average
Traveller they are totally incomprehensible.
The Federation of Arden
The Federation of Arden does not, technically, exist. Arden is
one of several independent worlds lying between the Imperial/
Zhodani borders that have been influenced by both powers over
the centuries. In recent years Arden has begun proposing a 'local
defence association' among nearby worlds with a view to creating a
formal alliance neutral to both Zhodani and Imperial interests.
Although this idea has not met with great enthusiasm, a number
of political pressure groups, businesses and very minor shipping
lines have recently begun making a lot of noise about a 'Federation
of Arden'. Exactly what is meant by this term depends on who is
using it. It seems to commonly be used to describe a loose alliance
of businesses and other groups attached to the political coat–tails
of Arden.
There are those who predict that some kind of trade or even military
alliance may emerge in time. This would require other world
governments to sign up, which does not seem imminently likely. It
is probable that the whole thing is just talk, but the term 'Federation
of Arden' has now passed into common use in the surrounding
region. Time will tell what form the Federation eventually takes.
The Sword Worlds
One of the big questions in the Marches is: which is correct: The
Sword Worlds IS, or The Sword Worlds ARE? The Sword Worlders
themselves seem unable to decide, which implies that the latter is
true.
The Sword Worlds Confederation is a very loose alliance whose
members spend most of their time arguing among themselves or
jostling for position. Individual world governments tend to pursue
their own agendas even where there is supposedly a cooperative
effort being made. Joint ventures are usually short–lived, though a
charismatic individual can often hold things together where a paper
agreement would simply fall apart.
As a result, unless there is a severe external threat or a major
opportunity on offer, Sword Worlder activity tends to be disjointed.
When the Confederation as a whole acts, it can do so with a surprising
degree of unity, at least in the short term. Naval and military assets,
which normally belong to the individual worlds, are pooled under
central command. Once a chain of command is established (which
can be a difficult process) the combined fleet can be expected to
follow its orders whatever local agendas may be in place.
One reason for this is that although the Sword Worlds Confederation
resembles a dysfunctional family with feuds and jealousies getting in
the way of almost every activity, it is still a family. Almost any rivalry
or dispute can be set aside while a threat to the Confederation is
dealt with.
However, in peacetime, this means that vessels ostensibly belonging
to the Sword Worlds Confederation Navy must be thought of as
serving their home world first and foremost. To an outsider a patrol
vessel out of Gram might look just like one out of Narsil, but their
captains may have very different priorities.
Imperials find the Sword Worlders difficult to deal with (and vice
versa) due to cultural differences. Sword Worlders are chauvinistic
(some would say extremely protective instead) towards women and
find it hard to accept Imperial females in positions of responsibility
or power. They tend to come over as haughty and arrogant, and look
down on those who do not meet their standards.
The Sword Worlds Confederation as a whole is politically unfriendly to
the Imperium and the Darrian Confederation. Note that 'unfriendly'
does not mean actively hostile nor stupid. The Sword Worlders do
not want a war with the Imperium, in which their vessels would
be over matched in terms of numbers and technology, and do not
deliberately provoke the Imperials. They will not, however, allow
themselves to be pushed around.
Thus passing through Sword Worlder space tends to be unpleasant
and somewhat difficult rather than dangerous for most minor ship
operators such as free traders, and expensive for the bigger lines.
Those that have won the respect of the Sword Worlders, on the
other hand, are treated as old friends and find a warm welcome
among their Sword Worlder brothers–in–all–but–blood.
It is not possible to describe an over–arching Sword Worlds
Confederation plan for the future, other than to say that the Sword
Worlds want to be left alone to captain their own fate. Exactly what
each world is planning at any given time varies greatly.
The Sword Worlds owns the four so–called 'Metal Worlds' (Iron,
Bronze, Mithril and Steel), but has not done much with them.

They are designated as reserve worlds in much the same way
that the Imperium earmarks some uninhabited worlds for future
development when the means are available or the need arises. As
yet, there has been little such activity and an expression of interest
by the Imperial Colonial Office in developing one or more of the
metal worlds has not been rebuffed by the Sword Worlders.

The Vargr
Vargr are the second most common species in the Imperium,
especially at the Coreward end of Imperial space. Most worlds in the
Marches have a mixed human/Vargr population, though humans
are prevalent. On a few worlds the minority Vargr are second–class
citizens or live in separate communities, but for the most part
humans and Vargr live in the same streets and apartment blocks,
work alongside one another, and are entirely familiar with one
another.

Imperial Vargr are just that; Imperial citizens like anyone else, and
tend to be seen as a–person–from–Regina, for example, rather than
an alien. Vargr are not alien in the Marches, not in the sense of
being strange and unknown. They tend to display Imperial cultural
influences or follow the culture of their homeworld, just like anyone
else.

Non–Imperial Vargr, from the Extents, come from a slightly
different culture. Actually, one of many different cultures that exist
in that region. They tend to have slightly different habits and values
to Imperial Vargr depending on their origins. There are no large
Vargr states in the Marches and no monolithic power structure in
the Extents. Local politics are vigorous at times and governments
can change on a short time frame, making cross–border politics
somewhat more interesting.

Vargr of all origins show their pack–animal roots in a tendency to
gravitate to individuals or ideas with 'Charisma'. Charisma is hard
to define exactly; each individual Vargr has his own idea of what
constitutes a worthy cause or leader. Status and recognition tend
to be more important to Vargr than an equivalent human, especially
if the recognition comes from someone the Vargr admires or
respects.

Contrary to certain stereotypes, Vargr are not flighty in their
allegiances. They may transfer their loyalty from one leader to
another of he has sufficient Charisma but this is not done lightly.
It is usually considered a natural consequence of meeting a more
charismatic leader rather than a betrayal if a Vargr leaves his old
allegiance. However, this does not mean that a Vargr naval officer
will switch sides at the drop of a hat. Charisma is a factor but there
are many others to be considered; demonstrating loyalty to a leader
is a charismatic act in its own right.

Vargr tradeboats from the Extents can be encountered all over the
Marches, especially in the Coreward–Trailing corner of the sector.
Unfortunately, so can corsairs. Raiding is considered to be a more

honorable profession by Vargr than most humans, and some
states of the Extents actively encourage it. Most Imperial Vargr are
less accepting of raiding and piracy than those from the Extents.

The Zhodani Consulate
The Zhodani Consulate is the largest non–Imperial power with an
interest in the Marches. Its holdings are small, confined to a couple
of subsectors along the Spinward–Coreward edge of the sector.
However, the influence of the Consulate reaches much further into
the sector than this.

Zhodani military ships are unlikely to be encountered in Imperial
territory except as escorts for consulate officials or valuable cargoes.
They are occasionally active in neutral areas and routinely transit a
narrow corridor through Imperial space to the Sword Worlds for
'diplomatic purposes'. Access is permitted by treaty for a small
tonnage of vessels each year. Imperial Navy ships shadow the
Zhodani vessels during their transit.

Zhodani merchants and couriers are seen somewhat more often,
and range more widely, but as a rule they tend to stay out of Imperial
space. There is a persistent theory that the first three Frontier Wars
(the fourth was an accident) were fought because the Zhodani
felt threatened by something the Imperium was doing, and that if
there is no perceived threat then there will be no more war or even
much interaction. The Zhodani do not seem very interested in what
happens outside their own extensive borders.

There are those, of course, who take the opposite view. They contrast
the lack of Zhodani ships in Imperial space with the way imperial
vessels routinely trade into the Vargr Extents and neutral space
beyond the borders, and into the Consulate itself, and suggest that
it is the ships they do not see that are the problem. There are also
claims that the Consulate is sponsoring anti–Imperial sentiment
and even activity within the Marches.

The Consulate is not inclined to comment on these things. It
maintains a strong naval and military presence along the border and
is not very receptive to Imperial vessels crossing into the Consulate.
Permits are required and boardings are not uncommon. While
vessels are not harassed, they are not welcomed either.

Exactly how negative an image this creates seems to depend greatly
on the outlook of the ship crew in question. Those that dislike the
Zhodani speak of this lack of welcome as a deliberate attempt to
discourage Imperials from entering the Consulate. Those with a
more neutral viewpoint feel that the Zhodani simply do not care one
way or the other and that Imperial ships with the right paperwork in
place are as welcome as in most other regions.

It would be very surprising if the Zhodani Consulate did not have
some kind of intelligence gathering apparatus in place within
Imperial space. The availability of psionic powers grants a few extra
capabilities but most likely the Consulate uses a fairly mundane
system of agents, informants and couriers like all other states. Its
own counter–intelligence system seems to be very effective at times,
but only sporadically.
The rest of the time Imperial agents in Zhodani space seem to be
able to operate undiscovered. Asking why this might be leads to
the conclusion that perhaps the Zhodani are content to leave most
agents in place and only removes those that are troublesome or
when something important is about to happen. This sudden ability
to become highly competent disturbs Imperial intelligence people,
who strongly suspect that the Zhodani are deliberately leaving their
agents in place for reasons of their own.
The Zhodani Consulate has a maximum tech level of 14 available,
and enormous industrial power. The size of its fleets are unknown,
but based on previous conflicts they are likely to be huge. Certainly
large numbers of patrol craft have been sighted along the border,
and these seem to be very efficient.
Minor Races
Members of the various minor races can be encountered all across
the Marches, serving aboard starships, working in the port or settled
into a nice job on a planet far from their homeworld. Although
the vast majority of citizens are humans or Vargr there is nothing
unusual in seeing the odd alien (or group of aliens) going about
their business.
Some minor races have their homes in the Marches, and most do
not have starship technology so tend to be encountered only rarely
away from home. Minor races are full members of the Imperium
if they are members at all. There is no discrimination based on
species. However, the homeworlds of most minor races are
relatively undeveloped compared to the more important Imperial
worlds in the region, so their economic importance is small. Minor
race homeworlds are represented to the Imperium by nobles like
any other, unless they are interdicted for their own protection or the
safety of others.
A Note On Languages
Within the Imperium and in most areas beyond it, the standard
language is Galanglic. Galanglic is a melding of English and
several other languages, including Vilani, which has evolved over
many centuries. Local dialects and variations are quite common,
especially on backwater worlds. Someone who speaks Galanglic in
any of its forms can usually make himself understood anywhere in
the Marches, even though it may not be the first language on some
worlds.
Within the Imperium, various groups have their own languages
which include High Sylean, Vilani and the languages of various minor
races. Worlds that were settled or came to be dominated by people
originating among one of Earth's many non–English–speaking
cultures may speak very unusual forms of Galanglic but more often
have their own tongues based on the language of their forefathers.
Of course, centuries of offworld influences and linguistic drift may
have changed this language beyond all recognition.
Thus on some worlds, although Galanglic may be spoken as a
second language, the locals may use some other tongue entirely
for daily business. Further confusion can be created by the fact
that what one group calls 'German' or 'Chinese' may have drifted
so much that another group would identify these with an entirely
different ethnicity.
In addition, other cultural groups will have their own, entirely
separate, languages. Minor races have their own tongues and
even modes of communication that are entirely different. The best
example of the latter is the sign language of the Hivers, though
Hivers are not likely to be encountered so far to Spinward.
The Darrians have their own language, which is a melding of
their original Darrian tongue and Turkish, the language of the
first Solomani to join them. Similarly, the Sword Worlders speak
a language that varies somewhat from system to system but is
broadly based in the North European and Scandinavian languages
of old Earth. It is termed 'Sword Worlder' by outsiders just as the
Darrian language is referred to simply as 'Darrian' by outsiders.
The Zhodani have a single language spoken throughout the Zhodani
Consulate with almost no variation other than a few technical terms.
Most Zhodani who have extensive contact with Imperials speak
Galanglic, though there is a fair amount of unintentional cultural
exchange along the borders which means that it is not hard to
learn to speak Zhodani. However, most Galanglic speakers sound
'wrong' when speaking Zhodani even if their pronunciation is good.
It is as if they fail to 'get' the ideas behind the words they are trying
to say. This does not affect the ability to be understood but is a
major barrier to fluency.

Most Aslan encountered in the Marches speak Galanglic. Their own
language is Trokh, though many humans just refer to it as 'Aslan',
which annoys native Trokh speakers in the same way that calling
Galanglic 'Human–speak' might irritate an Imperial citizen.

The Vargr have literally dozens of languages, possibly hundreds.
The most common in the Marches is Gvegh, which is gradually
supplanted by Irilitok the further to Trailing a particular Vargr hails
from. Within Gvegh (and Irilitok, and all other Vargr languages)
there are considerable variations but the basic form is the same.

The Droyne often decline to communicate with outsiders at all.
When they do condescend to deal with others they normally use
the language of the people they are dealing with, usually through a
Droyne interpreter. It seems that the Droyne have many languages,
each local to a given community or world, but according to some
scientists all Droyne, even those cut off from others of their kind,
speak a common language called Oynprith, It is rarely used in front
of outsiders and seems to have some kind of ritual or ceremonial
use. It is extremely hard to learn any Droyne language as the Droyne
do not normally teach any of their tongues to non–Droyne, if they
speak to them at all.

As already noted, a Galanglic speaker can usually make himself
understood anywhere in the Marches and most regions just beyond,
providing whoever he wants to talk to is willing to communicate.
Misunderstandings are possible, however, and it is not always
certain that a Galanglic speaker will be available. Many travellers
learn a smattering of other tongues, just in case.

###### THE IMPERIUM IN THE MARCHES

The majority of worlds in the Spinward Marches are members of the
Imperium. Imperial corporations, officials from the various services
such as the Bureaucracy, and members of the armed forces are
relatively common on those worlds carrying out normal business.
Navy patrols are also a fairly common occurrence, especially in
systems that are on a major trade route.

Beyond the Imperial border the corporations are still active, though
less so, and the Navy makes sweeps into neutral space. The Scout
Service is also fairly active outside the Imperium. Local corporations
and businesses, whether based in the Imperium or just outside it,
often operate across the border without much regard to whether a
world is in the Imperium or not. Local regulations vary considerably
and matter more than the allegiance of the world.

In this respect the border is a 'soft' one, in that although worlds on
the border conduct the same customs checks as any others, they
have no obligation to treat trans–border shipping any differently to
that coming from within the Imperium. As always, local conditions
vary and some worlds choose to impose taxes on cross–border
goods which would not be permitted under free–trade laws within
the Imperium. This is a local matter and of no interest to the Imperial
authorities, so long as internal trade is not affected.

Nobility
As already noted, there is no Archduke as there is no Domain
structure for the Marches to be part of. If there were, it would be the
Domain of Deneb and probably administered by one of the sector
dukes from the more developed regions closer to the Imperial core,
who would be granted the title of Archduke accordingly.

The Marches has the usual system of Imperial nobility in place, with
individual worlds represented by barons or marquises and larger
groupings administered by an Imperial count answering to the
subsector duke. The position of Sector Duke, the most senior of the
subsector dukes, which grants additional powers and responsibilities
over the entire sector, is not officially assigned in the Marches.

However, the importance of Mora as a trade center and as the
'Gateway to the Marches' grants that world and its associated
subsector a level of importance not matched elsewhere. Thus
the role of Sector Duke is carried out semi–officially by Duchess
Delphine of Mora. This practice has been in place for centuries by
Delphine's ancestors and is commonly accepted as the way things
should be. Only those politically opposed to Delphine for whatever
reason even question her primacy. She makes a point of not using
the title of Sector Duke herself, though many of her supporters
unofficially apply it.

Although the Marches remains something of an undeveloped
backwater, it is also a frontier region and one that has historically
been troubled by various major and minor threats. As a result,
many nobles maintain larger household forces (huscarles) than is
common practice elsewhere in the Imperium. These forces are still
not, for the most part, particularly enormous, and mostly consist of
a patrol vessel or two and/or a battalion–sized light infantry force
for the more prosperous marquises and counts.

Some nobles, notably Duke Norris of Regina, maintain considerable
forces. Duke Norris has a distinguished background in the Imperial
Navy and remains dedicated to protecting the frontier from whatever
threats may emerge. Some would call him paranoid, but his personal
forces have more than once been the first–response formations in
a crisis and have a good record. Among them is a unit also known
as the 4518th Lift Infantry (Duke Norris' Own Huscarles), raised by
Duke Norris as part of his personal forces but which spends most
of the time on loan to the Imperial Army.
Other nobles loan part of their personal forces to the Imperial army
or ships to the Colonial Fleet in the same way that many world
governments do, though this practice is relatively rare even in the
Marches.
Among the other notable members of the Nobility in the Marches
is Leonard Fratelli Bolden–Tukera, Marquis of Aramis. Although
'merely' a Marquis associated with a single world, his association
with the powerful Tukera family gives him great power. The Tukera
family are of course the founders of Tukera Lines, one of the Imperial
Megacorporations, and remain principal shareholders.
Although Tukera, like most Megacorporations, has only a limited
interest in the Marches this does translate to a large number of
ships passing through the bigger ports and a very large amount of
money changing hands. Thus far Tukera's interests are to not push
far into the sector but there are rumors of investment in starports
which surely presages an expansion of the firm's operations.
Military
The Spinward Marches is defended by the Spinward Marches sector
fleet of the Imperial Navy under the command of Sector Admiral
Santanocheev who is based at Mora. Unusually, there is no Depot
system in the Marches. Instead the Sector Fleet's major battle
squadrons are mostly deployed well forward at bases in the Regina,
Vilis, Lanth and Lunion subsectors, with a strategic reserve in the
Trin and Mora subsectors.
Cruiser forces are similarly deployed for the most part, though a
significant number are based further back to counter raids like
those carried out in the Third Frontier War. Support vessels such as
tankers are mainly deployed in the rearward bases along with a fair
proportion of the sector fleet's destroyer strength.
Light vessels such as escorts are largely deployed with the major
battle squadrons. The remainder are dispersed throughout the
sector for patrol and security work. In this capacity they back up
the larger numbers of light vessels available to various subsector
commands.
Two semi–independent commands exist. One is the Darrian
Squadron, a small force deployed to the Darrian Confederation as a
gesture of solidarity. The other is rather larger and includes an entire
BatRon, albeit of older capital ships. This force also contains several
cruisers and is based in Five Sisters subsector. Its responsibility
is to maintain the interdiction of the Droyne worlds at Andor and
Candory, and to launch the occasional sweep out to Spinward or
Rimward of Imperial territory.
This somewhat dispersed deployment has been criticized in some
quarters but there are justifications. One is the maintenance of a
'fierce face' to deter aggression. There is also a perceived need to
meet any incursion well forward to prevent a repeat of the Third
Frontier War, in which the Navy was censured for its perceived lack
of activity. There are those who fear that these deployments are
motivated too much by politics rather than military reality, but their
protests, though repeatedly made at the court of Duchess Delphine,
have not been heeded.
Each subsector that contains any Imperial worlds has a subsector
fleet assigned to it. These are numbered rather than named. For
example the Imperial 193rd Fleet is based at Frenzie and is responsible
for the defence and security of the Vilis subsector.
The strength of the subsector fleets varies considerably. Most are
built around a core consisting of a cruiser or carrier as flagship,
a squadron or two of destroyers and a varying number of escorts
and patrol ships. Technically the subsector fleet also contains the
system squadrons of worlds that possess them and the security and
defence squadrons assigned to naval bases. However, since these
are not normally capable of leaving their home system they usually
devolve to local control.
The subsector fleets are assigned a mix of vessels supposedly
adequate to meet patrol, security and defensive needs within
their area of operations. In practice there are always too few of
these vessels, and subsector admirals are continually asking for
reinforcements or assistance from Sector command. Numbers are
also made up by Colonial Fleet vessels, which include Scout Service
ships and a few minor combatants on loan from nobles or world
governments.
In time of war, some subsector commands could expect to receive
cruisers or even battleships transferred from Sector command
or brought in as reinforcements for important subsectors. The
'fortress' worlds with their own powerful forces should be able to
provide for their own defence, but the rest of the subsector would be
vulnerable until the Sector Fleet could drive any invaders out.
A significant Marine force is maintained at the naval bases of
the sector for deployment at need. These forces are under Navy
command and operate in conjunction with naval assets. Imperial
Army formations, on the other hand, have an independent command
structure.
Like the Navy, the Imperial Army maintains local headquarters
in each subsector with a sector HQ at Mora. Major Army forces,
including aerospace and orbital defence formations, are deployed
to some critical worlds along the frontier, while the remainder of
the divisions are based further back. Army detachments of various
sizes are deployed throughout the sector on missions as varied as
internal security, counterinsurgency and peacekeeping in troubled
areas.
There is always some sort of conflict going on somewhere, or else a
need for Army personnel to assist in disaster–relief operations. For
the most part, however, these are minor operations and the Army as
a whole is on a peacetime footing.

Shipping and Communications
Information and goods both move in much the same manner. They
are carried along the major trade routes between the larger ports
then spread out to worlds along 'feeder' routes, usually aboard
smaller ships as distance from the major routes increases. This is
fine for routine cargo, but priority items and important messages
are often sent aboard small, fast courier ships that cannot make a
profit from standard–rate bulk shipping but can charge a higher fee
for fast or secure service.

Most large organizations, corporations, Imperial services and the
armed forces, tend to maintain their own courier network. As a rule,
information moves along the Xboat routes at a theoretical maximum
speed of Jump–4 and on average somewhat slower. Dedicated
high–Jump couriers can bring critical information somewhat faster,
though at an appropriately high price – Jump–6 couriers are not
cheap.

Non–urgent and civilian communications across the Marches are
carried in several ways. The Express Boat (Xboat) network carries
routine messages in electronic format between the Xboat stations,
from where the information spreads out like ripples on a pond.
Scout Service vessels and commercial couriers carry 'mail dumps',
which are duplicates of all the electronic media to arrive in the past
few weeks, to nearby worlds on a regular basis. This means that
any given message tends to arrive several times, ensuring that a
problem with a given ship or data packet simply means a delay
rather than the loss of the data.

Some worlds, which receive fewer vessels, can be weeks or even
months behind the times. The story that there is a world that does
not know the Fourth Frontier War has ended yet is almost certainly
apocryphal, but it is a fact that backwater systems do not get updates
very often.

Physical mail and freight can be even less common on some worlds.
Many small merchant vessels supplement their income as 'mail
ships', which simply means having a dedicated cargo area that must
be made available for small packages intended for the destination
world if any are waiting to go there. If there are none, mail space
can be used for any other purpose. Many worlds are part of 'postal
unions' that have a dedicated mail ship (or several) plying between
them, which ensures that electronic mail arrives in a timely fashion
and physical items reach their destination sooner or later.

Ships are sometimes chartered to take a cargo to a given
destination, or a collection of incidentals will often be placed in
a standard freighting container and shipped at normal freighting
rates whenever a vessel is headed in the right direction. This
has occasionally resulted in a vessel delivering a 1–ton shipping
container which held only a few small items. It is of no concern to
the vessel operator whether the container is full or not; the fee for
carrying it is the same.

The other way that goods move around is through speculative
trading on the part of shipowners. Rather than take a cargo in return
for a flat fee, a ship operator may decide to buy goods at one port
and sell them at another, hopefully for a profit. Shipping empty hold
space is expensive, so even goods that do not cover these costs can
be a better investment than carrying nothing.

Exploratory trade is a special case of speculative trade. In this case
a speculative cargo is taken into an area in order to investigate its
trade potential. New markets opened up in this way can be very
lucrative but the risks are high; there is no guarantee of being able
to sell the cargo at all. Exploratory trade is the province of specialist
trade scouts and the occasional free trader captain gripped by
entrepreneurial spirit.

Megacorps and Smaller Corporations
The Megacorporations are active in the Spinward Marches. Indeed,
it was LSP that first set up a trade base at Mora and opened the
way for expansion into the sector. Corporate freighters belonging
to Delgado and Tukera run into Mora and then onward up the
Spinward Main, though on the whole smaller ships are used for
runs deeper into the Marches.

Exceptions include the major lines through to Lunion, Trin and
Glisten, and up Coreward towards Rhylanor and Regina. These
runs are plied by big Megacorporate freighters and liners as well as
smaller ships.

The financial corporations are active wherever there is a need
for investment, and those with mining interests (notably LSP
and Sternmetal Horizons) have facilities on several mainworlds,
outsystem planets and planetoid belts. Similarly, trade and
commerce exists everywhere, though many areas of the Marches are
not worth Megacorporate interest; they simply do not offer enough
return to be worth setting up an operation.

Instellarms has major facilities in the Marches, offering both
weaponry to governmental and corporate clients and mercenary
services to those needing them. Its regional headquarters is at Mora
though many major worlds have an office or other facilities.

As a rule the Megacorporations can be encountered wherever
it is worth their while to operate. Low–tech and low–population
worlds are not good prospects. Nor are hard–to–reach places.
Thus the big firms are mainly restricted to major worlds with good
communications links to the rest of the Imperium. This creates a
market niche for smaller corporations and minor firms including
freelance outfits to make a profit in the gaps between the major
players' fields of interest.

Some of the lesser firms and organizations operating in the Marches
are listed below:

AGWORLD COMBINE
A loose trading alliance of agricultural worlds and firms operating
in that sector, based out of District 268. The Combine is little more
than a collective–bargaining organization that obtains the use of
bulk freighters (usually from McClellan Factors) for its members.
AKERUT
An anagram of 'Tukera', Akerut is a wholly–owned subsidiary of
that Megacorporation. It operates a fleet of vessels based out of the
Aramis subsector, plying routes into the Imperium and across the
border into the Vargr Extents. Akerut, like its parent corporation,
maintains facilities within commercial starports, allowing its ships
preferential docking at private berths. This has led to a couple of
'customs irregularities' in the past but there have been no recent
allegations.
AL MORAI
One of the larger non–Megacorporations of the region, Al Morai
is a shipping firm based out of Mora and is often referred to as a
'sector line' in merchant–service parlance. This simply means that
it serves an area roughly a sector in size. Al Morai vessels operate
in Deneb sector as well as much of the Spinward Marches. The firm
also conducts exploratory trade, which is more usually the province
of smaller lines. It is also one of the few shipping lines to own
specialized warships. These 'route protectors' are small escort–
sized ships that patrol the routes used by Al Morai and accompany
some flights. Less well known is the firm's extensive network of
information–gathering assets which pass along what they learn
about smuggling and piracy to the Imperial Navy.
ARKESH SPACERS
Arkesh started out as an alliance of Free Traders which still
maintains a nominal headquarters at Strouden however, it has few
permanent facilities, relying on leasing or trading for whatever is
needed. Arkesh has a bad reputation for highly dubious practices;
some of its ships are known smugglers and there are rumors that
acts of piracy have been committed by some members. Thus far,
the organization has avoided Imperial attention though some of its
members have been prosecuted.
BARACCAI TECHNUM
The Baraccai Technum (BT) is based out of Trin. It is primarily a
manufacturing and transport firm with interests in freighting, cargo
brokerage and general shipping. BT maintains a number of 'trade
scouts' and merchant cruisers set up for exploratory trade cruises
beyond the Imperium.
BILSTEIN YARDS
Bilstein Yards are based on Glisten where they manufacture one–off
and small–run starships and custom transport assets of extremely
high quality. Bilstein workmanship does not come cheap, and there
is an element of prestige in owning not merely a yacht but one built
by Bilstein. The firm does not construct warships or standard trade
vessels.
GENERAL SHIPYARDS
A subsidiary of General Products, General Yards is a major
contractor to the Imperial Navy and other bulk clients. It is based in
Regina subsector with lesser facilities scattered across the sector.
The firm has recently begun to emphasise commercial construction
over military vessels, perhaps due to rumored Navy dissatisfaction
with certain classes of vessel built by General.
IMPERIALLINES
Imperiallines is a shipping firm owned by the Imperial family.
It mainly serves the major routes, but vessels are sometimes
encountered on minor or “feeder” routes and have a number of
contracts to the Imperial military and political services. As a result
its ships can be encountered even in backwater systems carrying
ambassadors, resupplying military installations or carrying out
government–related tasks. Imperiallines vessels are very secure and
of high quality. Imperiallines is not a Megacorporation but recent
growth suggests that it will soon achieve that status.
MAGNETODYNAMICS
A mid–sized corporation specialising in the extraction of useful
chemicals from gas or water suspension, MagnetoDynamics
operates a range of facilities across the Marches. These include
Jovian Atmosphere Processing Units (JAPU), better known as 'Sky
Rigs'. The latter are grav–suspended platforms which filter and
process the atmosphere of gas giant worlds for various useful
chemicals. These range from petrochemicals and liquid hydrogen to
exotic compounds. MagnetoDynamics also operates on a number
of rocky planets, extracting compounds from the atmosphere or
oceans.
MCCLELLAN FACTORS
McClellan Factors is a cartel of trading concerns operating mainly
in District 268 under the leadership of McClellan Trading LIC. Some
of the firms involved are registered in the Imperium, others are not.
McClellan Factors is involved in restrictive practices which would be
illegal in the Imperium, though McClellan Trading keeps its nose
clean when operating within the Imperium. This involves treading
a fine line but seems to be worth it; McClellan Factors has several
markets in District 268 sewn up and recently rebuffed an effort by
the Baraccai Technum to move into the region.
NARISKII VEHICLES LIC
Nariskii is a business group based in the Lunion subsector. The
firm has its origins in a number of companies that provided new
and refurbished all–terrain and grav vehicles to early explorers in the
sector. After a long period on the fringes, Nariskii has grown rapidly
in the past few years, opening manufacturing plants in several
worlds. Products are mostly budget and mid–range utility vehicles
ranging from Air/Rafts through ATVs to more humble work trucks.

OBERLINDES
A 'fledgling' shipping line operating a handful of vessels across
Regina and Aramis subsectors and out into the Vargr Extents,
Oberlindes is a family concern which has been known to take in
free traders seeking a 'home'. As its operations increase in size,
Oberlindes risks treading on the toes of Akerut, which operates in
the same areas on a much larger scale.

SPINWARD SALVAGE LIC
Spinward Salvage mainly operates at the Coreward end of the sector,
having got its start salvaging wrecks from the Third Frontier War.
The firm operates a flotilla of salvage vessels plus spare–parts sales
outlets and even a small shipyard that can use new or salvaged parts
to construct or modify vessels. The firm also salvages installations
such as mining facilities or power plants that are no longer in
service. Its overall reputation is good but occasionally freelancers of
a more dubious background are employed.

TREXALON TECHNICAL CONSORTIUM
The TTC is based out of Trexalon in District 268 and is made up
of several industrial and business concerns which share a general
anti–Imperial outlook. At present this takes the form of hostile
economic activity rather than any sort of overt action, though there
are rumors that the TTC is considering more robust measures to
keep Imperial interests out of District 268.

VICTORY ARMS LIC
Victory Arms is a small firm specialising in low–cost weaponry in
the mid to fairly high tech range. Its manufacturing arm produces
a range of cheap small arms that are often found equipping low–
budget mercenary firms and an unfortunate number of insurgent
organizations. Some world governments have placed large orders
for Victory weapons but there have been difficulties in fulfilling these
orders. Perhaps as a result Victory is rumored to be in financial
difficulties.

Psionics Institutes
Officially, all research into psionics as well as the teaching and use
of psionic talents were prohibited three centuries ago. All overt
schools of psionics were closed down, psi–drug corporations were
forced to end production, and psionics use in the Imperium more
or less came to an end.

It is an open secret that the Imperium continues to conduct psionics
research in order to counter the use of psionic powers by foreign
agents (such as the Zhodani) or illegal users. It is also widely
believed that psionic skills are still taught in underground 'psionics
institutes' in the Imperium.

Exactly what constitutes an Institute varies from one case to the
next. Some are academic in nature, operating quietly on the fringes
of society or under the guise of more legitimate activities. Some are
secret societies and some are crazy old hermits or other oddball

characters who occasionally teach their skills to an apprentice. All
these 'institutes' have one thing in common – they are illegal and
unregulated. There is no guarantee that what appears to be a source
of psionic training is not a scam, con, cover for something else, or
a genuinely crazy person. It might even be something quite sinister
like a cult.

Even where psionics training is genuinely available, it may be flawed
or incomplete. Three centuries of underground teaching might have
resulted in some serious misconceptions creeping in. There is no–
one to complain to if an individual's quest for training in the psionic
arts ends badly.

This does not stop a minority of individuals from seeking such
training. Most find nothing or come to the attention of the authorities
and are discouraged from continuing. Others land themselves in
trouble by poking around in the underworld where they assume an
Institute can be found or waste large amounts of time and money
visiting obscure places, some of which can be dangerous. It is
entirely possible to starve to death or be killed by wildlife searching
the outback of a frontier world searching for an Institute that ceased
to exist centuries ago.
There are, however, sources of psionic training out there for those
able to find them. Each one is likely to be very different to any of the
others, and the chances of finding one that teaches all disciplines is
remote, to say the least. For the psionicist seeking to develop to his
or her full potential, the quest for knowledge and suitable teachers
is liable to be a lifetime challenge.
Imperial Research Stations
The Imperium maintains a number of research installations in the
Marches. Most are fairly mundane corporate labs in cities of high–
population, high–tech worlds, where the staff go home to their very
ordinary lives at the end of the day. Others are corporate labs on
contract to the Imperium or military facilities located at army or
naval bases.
Most do important but unexciting work such as developing improved
targeting software for naval applications or pushing the envelope of
gravitic technology to wring an extra tenth of a percent efficiency out
of gravitic systems. However, there are a number of less ordinary
installations which do highly secret research.
These installations are located in remote areas of inhabited planets
or on outsystem worlds. They are designated by a Greek letter, for
example Research Station Gamma is located on Vanejen in Rhylanor
subsector. Access is restricted; the surrounding area is normally
considered a 'red zone', anyone present without a permit is liable
to be arrested and possibly punished for the violation. Lethal force
is liable to be used against anyone declining to surrender and be
arrested.
The nature of research undertaken at these facilitates is highly
classified. Most specialise in one area, but this is not always the case.
Various wild theories exist about what any given installation does.
Most concern exciting subjects like psionics research, biochemical
warfare and investigation of Ancients devices. All that is known for
certain is that these installations are highly secure and that a lot of
money is spent on them. Budgetary allocations are not available for
scrutiny other than by a very select group of personnel within the
Bureaucracy.
Other Imperial Installations
Other than military bases, scout service way stations and research
institutes, the Imperium has a number of installations within the
Marches. Most are located at Highports and major cities, such as
embassies, administrative centres and recruiting offices for the
various forces and services. The Ministry of Justice also maintains a
number of facilities ranging from training centres to prisons.
The latter tend not to be large. Worlds handle their own law
enforcement and punishment of offenders, and the Imperium
only deals with Imperial felons. Most of the latter are guilty of
extremely serious crimes, of which many carry the death penalty.
These hardcore prisoners are detained in extremely high–security
installations on asteroids, in remote areas or aboard 'prison hulks'
created by gutting a surplus starship of its drives and weapons.
Less dangerous perpetrators of significant crimes such as large–
scale embezzlement are also detained in these installations.
Imprisonment while awaiting trial and as punishment are often in
similar circumstances.
Despite a number of accusations and entertainment shows on the
subject, the Imperium does not have hundreds of prison hulks filled
with political prisoners scattered throughout the Marches. There
are relatively few Imperial felonies meriting incarceration in an
installation of this kind. The sort of people sent to them are those
considered far too dangerous to be dealt with in any other way,
or else those with a penchant for escaping custody or otherwise
evading punishment and who therefore require special treatment.
The cost of supporting these installations is considerable, so they
are only used when necessary.

###### TECHNOLOGY ON THE WORLDS OF

###### THE MARCHES

Other than in the most isolated cultures, available technology is
rarely uniform. The tech level given in a world's UWP represents
what can be locally supported. Usually, but not always, this also
means what can be locally made. However, some worlds have the
technological base to maintain high–tech items but lack the industry
to make them.

Note that tech level is an indication of what can be made by local
resources, not the limit of what might be encountered. A tech level
of, say, 4, does not mean that higher–technology items are not
available to at least a segment of the population. It does mean that
they cannot be properly maintained using local resources. Nor does
it mean that people from a TL2 society will fail to recognize a laser
rifle as a weapon; they may well have seen them before and could
probably shoot one even if they do not understand how they work.

High–tech imports tend to be expensive and therefore restricted to
those who can not only afford to buy them but who are also confident
that they can get spares or otherwise obtain suitable maintenance.
Imports tend to be either status symbols or useful tools, sometimes
both.

Thus the planetary ruler of a low–tech world might buy in a number of
grav vehicles for government or personal use, and arm his personal
guards with advanced weapons. Aerospace defence equipment and
communications gear are both popular imports for low and mid–
tech governments, while small arms for a personal bodyguard force
are desirable almost everywhere.

There is a ripple–down effect in place with technology, which is
a direct consequence of economic reality. Buying in items from
a world possessing much higher technology is often pointless.

Maintenance, power and compatibility issues increase logarithmically
with tech level differences and the costs may not be affordable.
Instead, items tend to be bought in from sources only a tech level
or two higher.

This creates a situation where mid–tech worlds can make a modest
profit exporting robust and easy–to–use equipment for use on low–
tech worlds, while in turn benefiting from higher–technology items
bought in from elsewhere.

Imports are never cheap, especially those that give economic
benefits, and so the amount of technology that can be bought in
is limited by economics. There is no Imperial law about importing
technology, other than a range of permit requirements and
bureaucratic matters that have more to do with taxation than
limiting technology transfers. Thus, providing there are no local
laws to the contrary and the proper export paperwork is filled out,
there is no reason not to sell a few crateloads of laser carbines to
a mob of stone–age primitives. The limiting factor is: do they have
anything to pay with?

Of course, when these imported high–tech items wear out or break
they cannot be replaced or repaired by local technology. The laser

carbines mentioned above will be so much junk sooner or later, and
will not greatly benefit their buyers in the long term unless they can
be used to fulfil some important goal.

High–tech imports can be destabilizing in this manner; when a state
on a balkanised world buys in a shipment of high–tech weapons, the
clock starts running. The temptation to use these items before they
become useless might result in conflict that might otherwise not
happen. However, most shipments are on a fairly small scale; a few
hundred assault rifles will not greatly upset the balance of power
on a world.

This availability of offworld technology can contribute to a
phenomenon known as tech–stagnation. A world that must rely
on its own resources tends to progress more quickly in terms
of technological development than one that can buy in what is
needed along with offworld technicians to operate and maintain
it. The incentive to develop the local tech base is reduced by the
convenience of importing items, and the budget that might be spent
on R&D tends to be redirected into the pockets of the importers and
the offworld contractors.

As a general rule, a mix of local and offworld technology can be
encountered in the Startown and regions close to the Starport,
but the further one goes from this area the less offworld tech is
encountered. The local tech level tends to apply to most of a world
although there may be 'outback' areas that are below this level.

Even in fairly remote areas, however, it is possible to encounter
items of higher technological level than the world's rating would
suggest. A mid–tech town might have an imported fusion reactor to
power its industry, or a military installation might possess advanced
aerospace tracking equipment. Exactly what, if anything, is present
depends on local conditions and whether a need for the item is
perceived.

The fact that a world has a given tech level does not mean that it
exports large quantities of technological items. That requires both
technology and industry, and industry needs people. A high–tech
world with a low population will probably have a few items available
for sale but not in large quantities.

It is not always possible to predict from a world's tech level what
items will be encountered in private or government hands. Some
worlds do have a fairly uniform tech distribution. On others people
may be talking on their imported personal comms while stepping
around the droppings of draft animals that pull carts down the
dirt streets. Tech level indicates what can be maintained by local
resources; it does not mean that someone from a higher tech world
is not making a good living as the only repairman for the latest
must–have imported technology.

## Subsectors of the Spinward Marches

###### INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents details of the individual subsectors of the
Spinward Marches and some of the worlds therein. Subsectors
are presented in order from left to right, top to bottom, starting
with Cronor subsector in the 'top left' of the map and finishing with
Trin's Veil in the 'bottom right'. The layout of these subsectors is
shown on page 57.

Of course, the concept of a subsector is an arbitrary one invented by
the Imperium for administrative purposes. There are no 'subsector
borders' as such and nothing to indicate the precise moment when
a group of travellers crosses into a new subsector, other perhaps
than emergence from Jump in a system that is part of a different

subsector than they just left. That said, the various subsectors of
the Marches all have somewhat different characteristics, as indeed
do individual worlds.

Each subsector description includes a brief summary provided before
a more detailed description of two of the worlds contained within its
borders. These worlds have been chosen for several reasons, some
because they are important to the sector as a whole, others because
they are representative in some way of similar worlds elsewhere and
others because they are unique and worthy of further detail.

A Universal World Profile is provided for each world along with a
subsector map, allowing referees to accurately place the worlds of
the Spinward Marches for their players.

The Spinward Marches uses Universal World Profiles (UWPs)
as set out in the Traveller Core Rulebook on page 170 with some
amendments.

There are a number of new base codes in addition to the normal
Navy and Scout bases, reflecting the different governments that are
present within the sector. They are as follows:

Z Zhodani
D Darrian
B Sword Worlds
M Independent Military Base
2 Both a navy and a scout base are present

The remarks section includes the trade codes for the system plus any
unusual facilities and political affiliation. These facilities include:

Cap The [[Capital]] system for that subsector
IWS Imperial Way Station
IRS Imperial Research Station
IP Imperial Prison
IR Imperial Reservation

Political affiliations include (independent worlds have no code):

I Imperial
Z Zhodani
D Darrian
S Sword Worlder

If a system has a gas giant present this is also now included in the
UWP as the letter 'G' at the end of the profile.

The system hex format has also been amended to reflect this
additional information.

#### Cronor

There are 24 star systems in Cronor Subsector, of which only one,
Quar, is a member of the Imperium. Quar is the site of both an
Imperial Navy and a Scout Service base even though it is situated
within Zhodani territory. This curious situation came about as a
result of treaty negotiations at the end of the Frontier Wars. Although
there is no Subsector Fleet, the base at Quar is heavily defended. In
peacetime it is home to a small flotilla of patrol ships that operate in
neutral space and some intelligence–gathering vessels. In wartime
the base would probably be used as a forward staging post if it were
not quickly eliminated.
The rest of the subsector is either owned by the Zhodani Consulate
or is neutral. The neutral worlds are variously influenced by Imperial
and Zhodani policies and are sometimes a battleground for overt
political manoeuvring or covert action by agents of both sides.
Trade ships from the Imperium and the Consulate are also active
among these worlds.
Astrographically, there are two main clusters of worlds in the
subsector. The five worlds centered on Cipango are actually easier to
reach from Imperial space than from the main Consulate holdings
in the subsector, as this requires a Jump–3 vessel or a roundabout
trip through Whenge. This is not a problem for military ships but it
does make access to this cluster and the Zhodani holdings in Jewell
subsector for commercial shipping more difficult.
The largest grouping of worlds centres on Cronor (sometimes
spelled Chronor by Imperial cartographers) which is the Consulate
capital of the subsector and also a major naval base. Cronor has the
highest tech level and population in the subsector and is a major
economic center. Unsurprisingly, it is also very heavily protected.
There are also important Consulate naval bases at Errere, Gesentown
and Cipango. Major fleet assets are based at these locations. The
bases at Atsa, Ninjar and Sheyou are much smaller and play host
to patrol vessels and couriers that make the run to Rimward into
Querion subsector.
The Zhodani border has been stable in this region for centuries,
other than some slight readjustments resulting from conflict.
Culturally, worlds that are members of the Consulate have been so
for a very long time and are entirely comfortable as members. There
are also large numbers of people of Zhodani extraction who live on
the neutral worlds. These are not part of the Consulate and in most
cases have never been but they are still culturally Zhodani for the
most part. Imperial visitors often cannot tell the difference between
these non–Consulate Zhodani and their cousins on the other side
of the border.
Other groups, living on the same worlds, are not Zhodani in terms
of genetics, culture, or both. Sometimes this creates conflict, in
other cases the two groups live happily together or remain separate
without major difficulties. Each world is different.
To Spinward–Rimward, stellar density drops off quickly. Querion
subsector to Rimward is quite sparse and as a result there is little
traffic across this gulf other than official couriers and military
vessels.

###### CRONOR A6369A5 D Z

The Cronor system is the regional capital for the Zhodani Consulate
in the Spinward Marches. As such it is heavily protected by both
in–system (non–Jump capable) and conventional naval assets as
well as elements of the ground forces. A large detachment of what
Imperials refer to as the Consular Guard protects governmental
installations and stands ready to fight large–scale battles should it
ever be required.

Express courier routes known as Postal Routes come in from
deeper in the Consulate (via Errere) and are then staged onward
into Querion subsector via Atsa and Jewell subsector via Cipango. A
minor spur runs Coreward to the naval base at Gesentown.

The Zhodani Consulate does not have a separate Scout Service
like the Imperium, so operation of the Postal Routes and similar
communications duties are undertaken by naval vessels. These are
lightly armed but fast couriers which operate out of a dedicated
section of the Cronor naval base.

The Zhodani navy also undertakes a range of scientific and
exploration missions, and vessels of this type also operate out of
Cronor. Some function as intelligence–gathering assets along the
frontier but most are genuine scientific vessels. Although lightly
armed and part of the navy these are not combat assets and are no
match for a warship of comparable size.

Cronor Naval Base is located on one of Cronor's moons and is very
extensive. Not only does it have formidable fortifications for its own
defence but there are numerous long–range missile batteries on the
surface for the defence of the planet proper. Civilian access to the
base and associated moon is entirely prohibited.

Most visitors to Cronor are impressed, indeed staggered, by the
size and quality of the Highport. Located in orbit above Cronor, the
Highport receives all traffic from outside the Consulate and most
from within. Access to the planetary surface is by a shuttle service

## CCRRONORONOR SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

CCRRONORONOR^59

operated from the port. Zhodani–registered vessels can obtain
permission to proceed directly to the Downport if necessary, foreign
ships cannot.

The Highport is a city in space, with residential areas, parks,
industrial zones and a full range of facilities for those who live and
work there as well as visitors. Clean, efficient and friendly, Cronor
Highport is something of a showcase for the Consulate and certainly
creates a good first impression. In fact, the Highport is all that most
visitors see of the world. Travel to the surface is subtly discouraged
and is largely unnecessary given that everything a traveller could
want is found in orbit.

Cronor itself is an average–sized world with a very thin atmosphere
and plenty of water. Unassisted humans cannot function on the
surface, though all that is needed is an air supply or a compressor
mask. Most of the populace do not venture outside the huge, sealed
cities where they dwell. These are connected by maglev rail links and
fast speeders for those important enough to merit them.

The cities are self–contained arcologies for the most part, with
millions or tens of millions living in each. There are some smaller
settlements but as a rule these have specialist functions. Places
where the bulk of the population live and work tend to be large for
efficiency and for social reasons.

The cities are all slightly different, but each is a thoroughly pleasant
place to be. As at the Highport, there are parks and recreation
facilities for public use and the streets are both clean and almost
entirely free of crime. Law level is moderately low by Imperial
standards and to an outsider there seems to be little in the way of
enforcement. Consulate officials explain that this is because rather
than policing an unruly population, the Zhodani prefer to solve the
problems that lead to crime and unhappiness, making 'fire brigade'
style enforcement much less necessary.

The people themselves seem for the most part to not merely be
contented but often enthusiastic about what they do for a living
or for recreation. Rampant materialism is uncommon; there is
an underlying philosophy of 'Don't show me what you have, tell
me what you've done' among the Proles and Intendants of the
Consulate. Personal achievements count for more than things
bought with money.

With a population numbering in the billions, Cronor has a huge
and powerful economy which produces high–technology goods for
export as well as home use. Some even find their way into Imperial
markets, though this is not common. Government takes the normal
Zhodani form of officials elected from among and by the class of
nobles. This is not really a democratic setup as the franchised class
is so small, but nor is it quite the same thing as direct oligarchical
rule.

Outside the cities much of Cronor's surface is uninhabited. The
population is more concentrated than on many Imperial worlds
and this leaves considerable amounts of wilderness between
settlements. There is a fair amount of plant life in the wilderness
but few higher creatures due to the thin air.

###### PLAVEN E845300 3

Plaven is a largish world with a thin, tainted atmosphere and a
reasonable amount of surface water. It is thus capable of supporting
life and as such was settled by small numbers of colonists as the
Imperium moved into the Marches. These arrived in typically ad–
hoc and disorganised manner, often without proper long–term
planning or necessary equipment. Although this sort of semi–
random colonization is discouraged by the Colonial Office, it is not
really possible to prevent it along the frontiers.

In the case of Plaven, there was no organised settlement program.
The world was far out on the frontier and by the time it was surveyed
interest in expansion was waning. Thus rather than a central and
well–organised colonial effort plus a few random groups of land
grabbers, there was only the latter. If any given settlement hit hard
times there was no–one to turn to for help, with no ICO–sponsored
colonial hub to join if the independent effort failed.

Plaven was settled by several groups at various times. Some did
reasonably well, others failed and presumably died out or left, or
else joined up with other bands and shared their fortunes. The
various tiny colonies never reached the critical mass necessary to
become stable and to grow, nor to pull in offworld trade.

As a result Plaven's small population struggled on at the subsistence
level. High–tech gear wore out and though the colonists adapted to
the world's tainted atmosphere, their numbers dwindled steadily.
Plaven was passed over by the four Frontier Wars, its nominal
allegiance changing hands in treaty negotiations without any
effect on the population. Plaven is officially independent and part
of the demilitarised zone between the Imperium and the Zhodani
Consulate. If the locals even know about this, chances are they do
not care.

Today, Plaven's population is officially listed by the IISS as several
hundred people subsisting without formal government, in a number
of tiny hamlets and homesteads capable of supporting a steam–
powered economy of sorts. There is no law as such, though the
locals enforce their own basic code of conduct and have a working
society based on the authority of senior family members.

The largest settlement contains about eighty people and is located
near a flat area of exposed rock that makes a good, stable landing
place for the occasional starship. Water from a nearby stream can be
cracked for hydrogen to make fuel. However, there are few reasons
for anyone to visit Plaven – it is not even on the way to anywhere

- so what might be termed a 'Starport' receives very few ships.

(^60) CCCRRONORROONNOORR
The official IISS figures for the population of Plaven may not be
entirely accurate, of course. Once every few years a Scout ship lands
at the port and its personnel try to carry out a population census.
Figures for the area around the port are probably accurate; Plaven
is one of the few worlds where he IISS census actually lists every
resident of the planet by name. However, it is possible that other
enclaves exist elsewhere on the planet, perhaps survivors from
another colonial settlement that have gone their own way.
If other groups exist, they have thus far avoided official notice and
inclusion in the census figures. This could be done easily enough
deliberately, but equally could happen through a combination of
low technology, remote location and less than zealous surveying by
bored IISS crews sent to the far end of the Imperium to count heads
on some distant rockball.
It is possible that other groups might have higher or lower tech
levels than the official population, though higher tech would have
to be deliberately concealed as its emissions would be noticeable to
even the most cursory survey. It is known that several remnant sites
do exist, where early colonies were set up then were closed down or
failed. Occasionally a Free Trader lands at one of these ruins, having
mistaken it for a living settlement, and returns to Imperial space
with wild tales of a ghost planet or worldwide catastrophe.
Most of these settlements were stripped long ago for whatever could
be salvaged from them. However, some were very remote, beyond
the reach of any of the remaining colonies. It is possible that some
of these remain intact. The occasional salvage mission is launched
by freelancers, usually without much result. There have been some
big scores made from time to time however, when a remote colony
that failed before its high–tech start–up gear wore out is found.
Plaven briefly came to the attention of the Imperial authorities in
1093, when it was discovered that a group of criminals specialising
in starship–borne raids on isolated communities along the frontier
were using the world as a base. Although the sort of loot that can be
obtained by raiding such minor targets is fairly minimal, the risks are
also very small, so what are sometimes referred to as 'spacegoing
poultry thieves' sometimes engage in such activity between more
lucrative operations. Be that as it may, the band using a valley high
in the Varnis Mountains as a base evaded capture for a long time
before finally being eliminated in an action by Naval and Marine
assets.
After that, Plaven more or less fell off the radar once again, though
Imperial patrols from Quar and vessels from the Zhodani Consular
Navy occasionally sweep the system. This is infrequent enough
that patrols rarely encounter one another. When they do, polite but
guarded comms exchanges are normally made before the vessels go
about their own business. Harassment and similar 'cold war' tactics
are avoided to reduce the chance of another accidental war.

## JJEEWELLWELL SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Jewell subsector is where the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate
meet. Politically, there are three distinct parts to the subsector.
The Spinward–Coreward systems are mostly part of the Zhodani
Consulate. This group of six worlds form a thin strip of Zhodani
territory projecting into the subsector. Farreach, Clan and
Chwistyoch are heavily fortified as naval bases and, along with
Cipango in Cronor subsector, form what many Imperial observers
call the 'Riverland Wall'.

Imperial holdings in the subsector are limited to eight worlds in
the middle of the subsector (in Rimward–Coreward terms). Like the
Zhodani equivalents, these are heavily protected for the most part,
with forward naval bases at Jewell and Mongo and Scout Service
bases (known as 'way stations') at Ruby, Emerald, Jewell, Mongo
and Lysen.

The scout bases include maintenance facilities for the Xboat service
as well as intelligence ships monitoring the frontier. Persistent
rumors speak of covert operations launched out of these bases,
aimed at adjusting the attitudes of neutral worlds or countering
Zhodani activities with the same objectives.

There is no Imperial subsector duke for Jewell subsector. It is instead
administered from Regina as an additional area of responsibility for
Duke Norris. However, there is a subsector fleet. This is the 212th
Fleet and is somewhat overstrength for the area it covers. This force
is backed up by Sector Fleet assets based at Jewell which include
battle squadrons and a contingent of cruisers that are obviously
intended for raiding operations into Consulate space if war breaks
out again.

The exposed nature of the deployment has earned the 212th the
nickname of 'Santanocheev's Tripwire' and the suggestion that
its role is simply to find out if the Zhodani are serious this time.
The latter is a reference to the last two Frontier Wars, in which the
Zhodani battle fleets were generally held at the frontier.

The remainder of the subsector is ostensibly neutral, though Imperial
access to worlds 'behind the Riverland Wall' is very limited, allowing
the Zhodani Consulate much greater influence over Condyole and
Puparkin as well as non–aligned worlds in Cronor subsector.

Some of the worlds in the Rimward end of the subsector are coming
under the influence of Arden, or more accurately the alliance of
political and economic interest groups that is collectively calling
itself the Federation of Arden. It is possible that in time some of
these worlds may eventually become part of an alliance with Arden.
How the Imperium and the Consulate will react to this development
(if it occurs at all) remains to be seen.

Esalin is an unusual case. Literally located between the Imperium and
the Consulate it was settled by the Imperium in 835 and was captured
by the Zhodani in 1082, at the beginning of the Fourth Frontier War.
Imperial and Zhodani cultures have become intermingled since and
both groups generally get along quite amicably. As a result, a joint
communiqué issued in 1098 established Esalin as a neutral and
open world which has since enjoyed good relations with both the
Consulate and the Imperium.

###### JEWELL A777999 C 2

Jewell is indeed a thing of great value; a more or less Terra–Prime
world marred only by a slight atmospheric taint caused by volcanic
outgassing. With very similar gravity and weather conditions to Earth,
the world was highly suitable for colonization. The first settlement
was established around 320, and conducted in an ad–hoc manner
without Imperial oversight.

It was the discovery of Lanthanum deposits some time later that
caused a much more focused colonization program to be
launched, leading in turn to industrialization and a rapid advance in
technological sophistication. Jewell was also used as a forward base
for further expansion into the Cronor subsector.

As tensions with the Zhodani Consulate grew a squadron of naval
vessels was deployed to the Jewell system and eventually a base
was set up to support them. This was a small installation which
was donated to the Scout Service when the Navy built a much larger
base around 480.

A larger scout base was set up a few years later, and the original naval
facility was abandoned for a long time. Scout vessels from this base
worked the communications route back into the Regina subsector
via Efate and conducted both exploration and intelligence–gathering
operations along the frontier. The Navy meanwhile engaged in 'Cold
War' operations along the border, shadowing Zhodani ships and
trying to intimidate the Consulate.

When the inevitable conflict finally happened, Jewell was on the
front line. The system squadron and Imperial Navy forces put up
a valiant fight but could not prevent the capture of the world by
the Consulate in 592. Some sources claim that Grand Admiral Olav
hault–Plankwell personally led the campaign to retake the world
in 603, though others disagree. Contrary to popular docu–drama
cliché, he definitely did not take part in the ground fighting to retake
the Downport.

Jewell was strongly garrisoned after the war, and has remained
so ever since. During the Second Frontier War the world came

JJEEWELLWELL^63

under siege for several months (in 617) but held out successfully.
Afterward the scale of the world's defences was increased yet again,
with the original naval base re–opened and several other facilities
constructed throughout the system. Although attacked in the Third
and Fourth Frontier Wars, Jewell was able to not only repel the
assault fleets but to act as a base for operations into the Zhodani
rear, gaining the world the somewhat fanciful media nickname
of 'Jewell: Shining Bastion of the Marches' or the rather more
mundane 'Imperial Breakwater'. The latter refers to the role of Jewell
in blunting Zhodani advances into the Marches.

Today, Jewell is something of an armed camp. Small naval bases
throughout the system support squadrons of monitors and system
defence boats to deny an intruder access to the system's gas giants
for refuelling, while the immediate defence of Jewell itself is entrusted
to one of the largest non–Jump capable fleets outside [[Core sector]] .
In addition, the naval base is home to the heavier elements of the
212 th Fleet as well as battle and cruiser squadrons from the Sector
Fleet.

Jewell is both militarised and heavily industrialised. There are
numerous military bases and many high–tech industrial complexes
on–planet. Pollution from the latter is now much worse than
the original atmospheric taint. Breathing without a filter mask is
possible, if unpleasant, and short–term exposure is not a serious
problem. However, respiratory diseases and a range of cancers can
result from even a few hours' exposure.

Clouds of brown smog are a common sight, and a layer of grime
quickly develops on all external surfaces. For this reason the exterior
of most structures is simply a functional thing and tends to be both
drab and filthy. Buildings on Jewell are built for efficiency without
regard to aesthetics, at least on the outside.

The towns and cities of Jewell are like the people to some extent

- outwardly unwelcoming, but concealing something very different.
When they are able to shed their masks and coveralls the people
of Jewell are friendly and hospitable, though not to Zhodani. Vargr
are also viewed with suspicion in some quarters. That aside, the
typical Jewellite (the term 'Jeweller' is both incorrect and liable to
provoke a series of centuries–old puns that nobody finds funny but
have become something of a social ritual) is demonstrative, loud
and fond of strong drink, especially if there are others to share it
with. Those returning to Jewell after an absence often must run a
gauntlet of hugs and warm handshakes from people they only met
once, accompanied by a barrage of booze.

The six billion or so inhabitants are ruled by a bureaucratic
government based on the highly structured system implemented
during the rapid–colonization phase of Jewell's history. Laws are
strict and quite robustly enforced, but this causes little resentment.
Jewell has been on the front lines in several major wars and its
population has a rather unique outlook as a result.

The majority of citizens are members of one or another of the world's
reserve military, medical or civil defence organizations. These vary
from highly efficient organizations to social clubs, but all share the
same general outlook, the feeling that with their traditional enemies
just 3 parsecs away, vigilance is indeed the price of peace.

Jewell is easier to get to from the Consulate than the Imperium.
Jump–3 vessels can make the crossing into Regina subsector but
ships with shorter legs need to either arrange deep–space refuelling
or else make a long transit around via neutral space and come in via
Plaven and Emerald. As a result the worlds around Jewell have their
own microculture to some extent, which also has local variations. It
is coloured by Zhodani influences on some worlds, whereas others
are vigorously opposed to anything even remotely associated with
the 'Joes' as the Zhodani are sometimes known.

###### LOUZY D322A88 8

It is not hard to see how Louzy got its name. A small world with an
atmosphere both tainted and too thin to breathe, lacking much in
the way of water, it was hardly a garden world nor a prime prospect
for colonization.

Nevertheless, Louzy was indeed colonized, and the colonies grew
rapidly. The world proved to be rich in mineral resources, and
enjoyed something of a 'gold rush' in the mid 600s as the sector's
industrial base was hugely expanded to meet the needs of the Fleet
Asset Replacement Program. FARP was implemented in several
sectors which had lost a large proportion of their naval assets in
the Civil War or as reinforcements sent to the Marches to assist in
fighting the Zhodani.

At that time, the Imperial Navy was facing a crisis. Its strength had
been built up steadily, literally over centuries. The massive losses of
the Frontier Wars and more importantly the Civil War meant that
a large percentage of the fleet needed replacing and fast. System
defence assets also required replacement in heavily fought–over
systems. Crash–building programs covered the worst of the
deficit within a couple of decades but this created a second
crisis as these ships suffered block obsolescence, they all needed
replacement at once rather than over time.

All this meant that there was a massive need for mineral resources
in the Coreward end of the Marches and significantly at the military
shipyards of neighboring Efate. Huge extraction and ore processing
operations were rapidly set up, along with towns for the workers and
associated secondary and tertiary industries.

The expansion was extremely rapid; Louzy was a metaphorical
goldmine of minerals and the industry of the Marches could not get
enough of its riches. Wages were high and living conditions in the
mining towns were as good as the corporations could make them.
The best 'Corp Towns' were operated by Sternmetal Horizons but
other firms followed a similar practice, in order to attract people to
the jobs on offer.

(^64) JJJEEWELLEWWEELLLL
It worked. Louzy was the place to go if you needed a job, or if you
wanted to learn. Education and training packages were included
among the extra benefits offered to workers coming to Louzy.
Seemingly every week there was a new mine or processing plant
opening up, with new arrivals coming to operate it and seasoned
hands taking promotions to head up work gangs in the new facility.
It had to end sooner or later, and by the early 700s the voracious
demand for minerals had tailed off somewhat. So had Louzy's
massive productivity; the easy–to–access deposits were mined out
and some installations had to close. Plus many industrial centres
were getting their raw materials elsewhere, at a better price.
Some operations had to close down. Others moved to less viable
but still productive sites and carried on. The Megacorps pulled
out, to their credit taking care of their own people by moving them
to new sites or investing in the corp towns to make them self–
sustaining. These former corp–towns ended up in better shape than
most settlements as their former corporate owners helped set up a
modest industrial base. Most other settlements had little industry
outside of the repair workshops for their mining equipment.
The Louzy Slump followed inevitably. The world's riches had come
from exporting processed ore and not only was that more difficult to
get at, there was little in the way of local manufacturing capacity to
make use of the raw materials now that the interstellar market was
not buying everything that could be torn out of the ground.
Louzy struggled through some hard times. Its economy was based
on ore that needed advanced machinery to mine, and keeping that
machinery (as well as the cities themselves) operating ate up much
of the money brought in from ore sales. Occasionally fighting broke
out over a claim or an attempt to salvage equipment from a previous
mining operation.
However, in time things settled down somewhat. A world
government was formed out of representatives from the myriad
mining settlements, and collective bargaining improved the cashflow
situation somewhat. Many smaller settlements were salvaged and
closed down, the population migrating to those cities that had
industry and services. Most of these were former corp–towns.
Careful management of the expansion program prevented the
creation of ready–made slums and ensured that the people that
came in from the failing settlements were an asset to local industry
rather than a drain on it.
Today, Louzy is strictly–regulated but stable, with a modest mid–
tech industrial base exporting some raw materials and an increasing
amount of finished goods through the remains of what was once a
very extensive starport. The latter is currently rated as a 'D' class port
could be refurbished to C or even B class with suitable investment.
The world's main problem is overpopulation in its sprawling cities,
which are constructed largely underground to maintain atmospheric
integrity. Money is tight and there is little available for investment,
but investment is desperately needed in order to get more from the
world's huge population base. Needing money to be able to generate
wealth and not being able to get it, Louzy is facing a downward
spiral. Crime is on the increase and most citizens feel they have few
prospects. It may be that the valiant effort made to halt the great
slump has merely slowed it and made the decline more painful.
Efforts are underway to improve matters. Imperial funding and
Megacorporate loans have been requested, without much success,
though there have been some instances of private concerns moving
into Louzy on very favorable terms. The world government seems
increasingly willing to entertain distinctly borderline schemes if they
will bring in hard cash or help turn around the slow decline.
There is also a steady exodus of people offworld. Some are the
best and brightest, using their skills to find a better home for their
families. Most, however, are semi–skilled at best. Some simply buy
a ticket for anywhere or work passage aboard a passing ship in the
hope of finding a new start in a better place. Others are recruited by
mercenary units and other relatively high–risk companies seeking
personnel. Ironically, the biggest recruiters operating on Louzy are
mining companies seeking entry–level workers. Although these
recruitment operations are fairly small–scale at present they are
expanding. This is a good thing – a few less people is exactly what
Louzy needs right now.

## RREEGINAGINA SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Located at the outer edge of the Third Imperium, Regina subsector
lies on the main trade routes towards the Zhodani Consulate and
the Vargr Extents. An arm of the Spinward Main runs through
the Spinward side of the subsector from Rimward before veering
to Spinward into Jewell Subsector. A Jump–2 ship can reach any
world in the subsector by Jumping from the Main at the appropriate
point.

Regina subsector is the responsibility of the 213th Fleet, which has
its headquarters at Efate Naval Base. Elements of the Sector Fleet are
also deployed at Efate, Regina and Pixie, making Regina subsector
one of the best places to spot Imperial capital ships. Indeed, there
is a deliberate policy of 'flag–showing' in place, using cruisers and
even capital ships rather than the usual smaller vessels.

Almost the entire subsector is Imperial territory; only Ruie is not.
Imperial vessels tend to bypass Ruie, heading Coreward by way
of Hefry unless they have business on Ruie itself. Ruie is a high–
population industrialised mid–tech world which could be a source
of considerable exports were it not for internal troubles that have
resulted in an Amber Zone advisory being applied to the world.
There is no actual restriction associated with this, simply a warning
to Imperial travellers that more than the usual level of hazard exists
on the world.

Roup is also Amber Zoned. Again there are no restrictions in place,
merely a warning to take care. There are also three Red Zones in the
subsector, and restrictions are in place regarding access to these. It
is possible to find out why a world is Red Zoned – in many cases it is
an open secret – and even to obtain a permit to go there. However,
this can be quite hazardous. For example Shionthy is generally
'known' (common knowledge may not actually be true) to have
particles of antimatter floating free about the system. Contact with
one could cause massive damage to a starship, making a Red Zone
a sensible precaution.

The reasons for the Red Zones at Algine and Pscias are not commonly
disclosed but Pscias is known to have a very low–tech culture and
is generally thought to be interdicted by the Scout Service to protect
the locals from outside interference. Algine may be interdicted for
the same or other reasons; those interested enough to speculate
rarely have any concrete information.

General Shipyards, subsidiary of General Products, maintains major
shipyards at Efate, Pixie and Regina and is an important employer
in the region. This may have serious consequences as General has

recently been hit with a number of lawsuits and complaints regarding
the quality of vessels produced for the Imperial Navy and various
system squadrons. The cancellation of government orders could have
serious consequences for the yards, and thus for the local economy.

###### REGINA A788899 C 2

Technically Regina is not a planet but a moon, orbiting the gas
giant planet Assiniboia which forms parts of a fairly complex triple
star system. The system primary is Lusor, an F7 main sequence
star orbited by a dwarf companion named Speck. The third star is
Darida, an M6 Red Dwarf star in a very distant orbit.

Darida has its own planetary system including a gas giant and several
'rockball' worlds of varying sizes. There are no habitable planets in
the Darida system though there are a few scientific outposts and a
small Navy base located on various bodies. The latter is home to
a squadron of the Sector Fleet and supporting assets, as well as a
larger but constantly changing force of light patrol ships from the
subsector fleet. A pool of Navy couriers also operates out of the
base, serving both the system administration and the fleets.

The Lusor system also contains various bodies ranging from
rockballs to gas giants, but as the most habitable world in the
system Regina itself was the first to be colonized and remains the
main world not only of the system but also of the subsector.

Regina is the seat of the subsector Duke, currently Duke Norris
Aledon. Responsible for a subsector right on the Zhodani and
Vargr borders and with a background in the Navy, Duke Norris is
more vocal than most in his calls for greater military strength to be
deployed to the Marches.

He is also very critical of what he calls 'over–politicization' of the
Sector Fleet and has repeatedly asked for forward–deployed battle
squadrons to be pulled back into Lunion or Mora subsectors to
create a more elastic defence. This would leave the 'forward' worlds,
including Regina, vulnerable but Duke Norris maintains that strong
system defence fleets at major worlds should be enough to hold out
until a relief force arrives. Thus far Norris' entreaties have fallen on
deaf ears, and he is thought to be considering a direct appeal to the
Emperor himself.

Regina itself is an earth–sized body with a dense atmosphere
and a high surface coverage of water. This made it easy to settle,
and within a few years of the first colonists arriving in 75 Regina's

RREEGINAGINA^67

population began to expand quickly. By the time the subsector was
incorporated into the Imperium (in 250) the world was the obvious
choice as subsector capital.

Since that time Regina has developed steadily, though more as a
center for trade and diplomacy than as an industrial complex. Lying
as it does on the Spinward Main, Regina's excellent starport is an
important interface between regional trade and that bound for more
distant regions. Most ships coming up the Main from Rimward turn
around at Regina. A few push on to Extolay or Efate, but for the most
part it is more economical to sell cargoes at Regina or to transfer
them to smaller vessels for the last leg of the journey.

Many visitors to the Regina system do not go down to the planet.
The Highport has everything necessary for business, be it trade,
hiring new crew or obtaining a refit. Those that do visit the surface
find a comfortable enough environment physically, but one with a
rather strangulous legal and governmental system.

The government itself is an impersonal bureaucracy. That is, it
operates without much input from the citizens most of the time,
and is hamstrung by a complex system of checks and balances to
prevent inappropriate governmental actions. This results in a great
deal of effort being needed to actually get anything done.

Regina has a vast number of laws, which are proposed by the
government but voted into being (or vetoed) by the general
population. In theory, old and unnecessary laws are dropped but
in practice people only vote on laws that interest or affect them, so
there is a great body of obscure and archaic law in place.

Running afoul of the law (current or archaic) is unfortunately rather
easy. The police tend to be somewhat over–zealous in arresting
large numbers of suspects in connection with any given offence.
These people are not brutalised of course; they are innocent until
proven guilty. Unfortunately, they are also under suspicion until
some time after someone else is found guilty, and trials can take
some time to arrange. This makes being arrested very inconvenient
for innocent people on Regina.

Only small outposts exist on the other worlds of the Lusor system,
but in addition to Regina itself the moons of Assiniboia are inhabited
by hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of people, but these
settlements are considered to be part of Regina for administrative
purposes rather than being independent worlds. Their social

and economic importance is very small compared to that of the
mainworld with its hundreds of millions of people and the vast
trading center that is the Highport.

There is a sizable Scout base at Regina, co–located with the main
Highport. Its main function is to serve the Express Boat network but
as is usual with frontier bases it also supports Scout missions along
the border and surveys within Imperial territory.

###### KENG E2718CA 3

Keng fits the popular image of the frontier world in many ways. Lying
at the outer edge of a cluster of stars reachable from the Spinward
Main by a Jump–2 ship, but only with some difficulty due to Red
Zoned worlds and planets with very poor starports along the way,
Keng is one of the outer worlds of the Imperium. With the Vargr
Extents only a few parsecs away and no really viable destinations to
travel onward to, Keng is a dead end as far as travel goes.

For this reason, among others, Keng's colonists never emerged
onto the interstellar stage. Although the world was settled by several
colony missions, none of the groups that came to Keng really
made a go of it. The population increased and spread out, but the
technological level gradually fell as the startup equipment wore out
before an indigenous technological base was created.

Keng is habitable enough. Though small, it has a standard–density
atmosphere whose taint is tolerable to those who have had many
generations to become immune to it. Surface water is in short
supply, but not sufficiently so to limit human expansion on the
planet.

The original settlement pattern was typical of such worlds. Colony
missions landed close to water sources, usually where some other
resource was also available. This resulted in a number of colonial
hubs, from which the population spread out to where there was
water available.

With relatively few seas and rivers to limit travel, a steady creep
across the surface out from these central points was easy enough.
Conversely there was no cheap and easy method of moving heavy
loads, as there would have been on a wetter worlds with more
watercourses, so the secondary settlements tended to be rather
small and set up with what could be easily carried. This limited long–
term development into anything other than agricultural towns.

(^68) RRREEGINAEGGIINNAA
As the population grew and spread, the high–tech equipment
of the colonial hubs gradually gave out and was replaced with
lower–tech alternatives. Subsequent colony missions repeated the
process elsewhere on the planet but there was never quite enough
investment to break the process of setup, spread and decline.
Today the population of Keng numbers several hundred million
people, dispersed about the planet in several clumps, with large
areas of wilderness in between. Each clump has a central city
built around the original colony site and a series of rings, each of
smaller and smaller towns and villages. Industry, such as it is, is
concentrated in the cities while the smaller communities trade
agricultural produce for industrial items.
Most of the cities are linked by a vast rail network. Steam trains labour
across huge areas of wilderness to maintain contact between the
towns and cities. This enables what passes for a world government
to maintain control despite the world's low tech level. The ruling
elite are sometimes referred to as 'rail barons' by offworlders.
Only a few cities have the industrial and technical ability to build
and maintain the locomotives, rail manufacturing factories and
telegraph stations needed to participate in the work of governance.
The remainder are also rated at TL3 by the Scout Service but are
towards the bottom end of the classification, while many outlying
towns can be considered TL2.
Although local law prohibits the carrying of any weapon within the
cities, the outback is an entirely different matter. The government
recognizes that weapons are necessary for self defence and, equally
importantly, trying to take them away from the outback farmers and
steaders would be a hazardous proposition.
Keng is by no means a safe world. It has an ecosystem of its own,
to which has been added a range of plants and animals of offworld
origin. Some come from Terra, some from other worlds. There are
a number of predators which are willing to take on adult humans if
they get hungry enough, and as a result the farmers of the outlying
communities are a tough and resourceful lot who value their
weapons greatly. Most are handmade black powder guns from the
cities, though a significant number of Keng Outbackers (as they are
known) are proficient with the bow or sling.
Those trade ships that come through Keng find little on offer in the
markets besides agricultural products, which are not available in
great enough quantities to make bulk shipping worthwhile. Thus the

world receives few visitors and has virtually no export money coming
in. Keng is thus as close to a truly isolated world as it is possible to
get; there are hardly any imports because there is nothing to buy
them with and no–one coming to the world to sell them anyway.
As a result of this economic and physical isolation, Keng receives
almost no notice from the Imperium and simply goes its own way.
There are areas of the planet that have hardly been explored or even
surveyed from orbit since the days of the first landings centuries
ago.

(^70) AAARRAMISRAAMMIISS

## AARRAMISAMIS SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Aramis subsector lies at the Coreward edge of the Marches and
also of the Imperium. To Trailing is Pretoria subsector in Deneb
sector, Imperial territory, but Coreward is the Vargr Extents. Most
Vargr incursions in the four Frontier Wars and most corsair raids in
peacetime come though this subsector. As a result the 214th Fleet,
tasked with the protection of the subsector, attempts to control
access through to the rest of the sector.

This activity is mainly concentrated on the Rimward end of the
subsector. The fleet is based out of Paya, Natoko and L'Oeul d'Dieu,
clearly demonstrating the Navy's lack of interest in the relatively
unimportant worlds further Coreward. Navy ships do sweep the
more Coreward systems, but not anything like as frequently as the
Rimward ones.

Critics of the Imperial system of government like to point out that
the Marquis of Aramis is a member of the Tukera family, and Tukera
is one of the main Imperial Megacorporations. They suggest that
it is not coincidence that Aramis itself has a naval base and is
flanked by two others. Imperial Navy officials (and the office of the
Marquis of Aramis) dismiss this as a typical example of paranoid
anti–Establishment ranting.

Junidy is the homeworld of a minor race called the Llellewyoly, but
colloquially known as 'Dandelions' as a result of their appearance.
They are an oddball species falling somewhere between plants and
animals, with a highly complex social order that routinely baffles
outsiders.

Yebab is home to the Ebokin, who have a matriarchal society with
very strict laws and rarely leave their homeworld. They are bilaterally
symmetrical, with four pairs of legs and two pairs of arms, and
average less than a meter tall although they are about twice as long.
The Ebokin are of very little importance in Imperial affairs but Yebab
is represented in the same manner as other Imperial worlds.

Four worlds in the subsector are Amber Zoned: Zila, Rugbird,
Towers and Reacher, and there are Red Zones in place at Corfu,
Zykoca and Lewis. As usual the reasons for the Red Zones are not
publicly available.

It is possible that Pysadi may be Amber Zoned in the near future. The
world has been dominated for many years by a religious dictatorship
that worships the planet itself and imposes a number of very strict
laws regarding religious matters. Offworlders have been known to
unwittingly fall foul of these laws.

Notably, Pysadian law prohibits alcohol. This raises issues since the
world is well known for its fruit crops and, while exported fruit makes
good wine, that grown on–planet and fermented there produces
some of the finest wines in Charted Space. The government has
been cracking down recently on Illegal winemaking operations in
remote areas and while this is strictly an internal matter, the lure of
big money for Pysadian Atrake wine (made on–planet from Trake
fruits) has brought many offworld entrepreneurs to Pysadi in search
of their fortune. Recent newscasts about the 'Pysadian Booze Wars'
are massively exaggerated but nonetheless offworlders must be
careful not to accidentally become involved.

###### ARAMIS A6B0556 B 2

Aramis is part of a secondary main lying just off the Coreward–
Trailing tip of the Spinward Main. A spur leads Rimward into
Rhylanor subsector but the primary arm of this main runs to Trailing
across the Rimward end of Pretoria subsector of Deneb sector. This
gives Jump–2 access to Pretoria itself and to the very edge of Lamas
subsector beyond, though astrography intervenes at that point.

As a result Aramis and the region around it is something of a nexus
for trade into Deneb sector as well as the Vargr Extents to Coreward.
Considerable quantities of goods come into Aramis Highport from
Pretoria subsector via Jump–1 vessels plying the main and are then
transhipped aboard Jump–2 vessels via Nutema and Celepina,
either onto the Spinward Main or into the Rhylanor cluster.

There is a very healthy brokerage and private shipping industry
operating out of Aramis Highport, in addition to the vessels of the
mid–level shipping line Akurat. Akurat is a subsidiary of Tukera
Lines dedicated to serving this region. Actual Tukera vessels do
come this far Coreward, but not frequently. Akurat ships also call
at the smaller ports of the Coreward end of the subsector although
their main business is done in the more settled areas towards the
Rimward ends of Aramis and Pretoria subsectors.

Few vessels proceed to the surface of Aramis, however. The world
itself is forbidding, with a corrosive atmosphere and no surface
water. Despite this unpromising aspect, several hundred thousand
people live in Aramis, underground in comfortable, high–tech and
carefully sealed cities.

Aramis is the fief of an important member of the Tukera family,
though it is not directly ruled – officially. The Marquis of Aramis is
the richest and most powerful member of the ruling class on Aramis,

AARRAMISAMIS^71

all of whom are heads of critical industries or important businesses.
Thus although the rank of Marquis is an Imperial title and does not
confer rulership of the world, the Tukera family and the Marquis in
particular dominate all government affairs.

Aramis also hosts both a naval and a scout base. The naval base
is co–located with the Highport and acts as the headquarters for
the subsector fleet and system squadron, which is not large and
is augmented by a handful of system defence boats crewed by
Starmercs. These are in service with the Aramis Port Authority but
are paid for by donations coming from the office of the Marquis.
Heavy units of the Sector Fleet are based elsewhere in the subsector,
but there is usually a cruiser or carrier task group in the Aramis
system on guardship deployment.

Guardships are deployed for fairly long periods, usually several weeks
at a time, and are normally relieved on station by a replacement
vessel or task force. It is not possible to maintain many such
standing deployments, especially of larger vessels such as heavy
cruisers, without diluting naval strength in the region excessively.
Most naval deployments are part of a patrol schedule whereby the
vessel proceeds through a series of locations in the course of a
cruise, staying a few days at each and then moving on to the next
destination.

The fact that Aramis enjoys the more or less permanent assignment
of a heavy cruiser or similar–sized vessel, along with escorts and
supports, suggests that the navy considers it to be a location of
great importance. However, there are plenty of other ports which
see more trade and a lot of worlds whose industrial base is more
important to the Imperium, so what is so special about Aramis?

The answer, at least as far as most cynics are concerned, is that
Aramis is the fief of a senior member of a Megacorporate family and
is given naval protection as a result of his firm's importance to the
economy of the Imperium.

Whether or not this is true, the location of Aramis at the Coreward
end of the subsector protects it from the majority of raids launched
by corsairs out of the Vargr Extents. Akurat vessels are well defended
and are more than a match for a typical merchant–ship–turned–
corsair and are generally left alone. However, their very toughness
makes them a target for a certain kind of raider captain, who seeks
to make a reputation back home as much as a profit from his
voyages. Although requiring heavy firepower, good planning and a
fair amount of luck, such strikes have occasionally been successful.
As a rule, however, the pirates tend to go after easier targets.

The Aramis scout base is not large, being mainly concerned with
supporting the Xboat route through from Rhylanor to Pretoria.
Survey and exploration vessels do operate out of this base, mainly
to monitor and collect data on the Rimward parts of the subsector;
affairs to Coreward are the province of the much larger way station
at Junidy and the smaller base at Nasemin.

###### JUNIDY B434ABD 9 S

Junidy lies right on the Coreward edge of the Imperium. It is part
of a cluster of worlds accessible with some difficulty by Jump–2
ships coming up from the Coreward end of the subsector or in
from Trailing via Pretoria subsector of Deneb sector. Access from
Spinward, that is from Regina subsector, is restricted by three or
more parsecs of rift across all possible routes.

As a result, Junidy and the surrounding worlds are somewhat cut off
from mainstream Imperial culture and receive many visitors from
the Vargr Extents. Most are traders or other above–board starfarers,
though corsairs from the extents do sometimes try to pass through
into the region. The most blatant are forced to either sneak through
the frontier zone using wilderness refuelling (obtaining fuel from
gas giants or by cracking water for hydrogen which it then liquefied
for use as fuel) or must operate on the frontier, making a strike and
then disappearing over the border.

However, many corsairs masquerade as legitimate trade ships
and these are often able to bluff their way through the patrols and
routine inspections at starports along the way, getting into a trade
route and picking a target there.

Some organised corsair bands use a combination of these methods,
slipping the actual pirate ships in covertly. These heavily armed
vessels are not far from being true warships and could never pass as
merchants under a Navy inspection. Once within the Imperium, the
raiders rendezvous with support vessels that have come through
pretending to be legitimate merchants. After a raid, the warships
move to the next target area, conceal themselves and wait for a new
opportunity while the loot is either sent back aboard the trade ships
or taken by them to ports a few parsecs away where it might not be
recognized as stolen.

A particularly clever version of this trick has been used on at least
two occasions by the Kforuzeng, thought to be the most powerful
Vargr corsair band in Gvurrdon sector. The Kforuzeng have been
known to stash ships on remote asteroids and leave them in place
for a long period until the heat from the last set of raids has died
down, then to slip a crew through aboard a merchant vessel. This
crew boards the stashed vessel, makes a series of raids and then
proceeds homeward after hiding their ship again.

Junidy and similar worlds are on the front line of this sort of activity,
and their system defence commanders routinely complain that they
receive very little help from the Imperial Navy and yet come in for
criticism every time a Vargr corsair vessel that they 'allowed to get
through' makes a successful attack. Patrols from the Imperial Navy
base at Riacon in Pretoria subsector occasionally cross into the
Marches to help out, though this creates a command–jurisdiction
issue which is routinely ignored in the name of getting the job
done.

(^72) AAARRAMISRAAMMIISS
Scout vessels from the Way Station also help augment local patrols,
usually by retasking survey ships with excellent sensor arrays to
watch for intruders sneaking through the system. This is a stop–gap
solution that was implemented decades ago and has been left in
place for lack of anything better and on the grounds that it actually
works fairly well.
The Way Station is a large installation which is mostly concerned
with maintaining the communications link into Pretoria subsector
and servicing Scout Service vessels. There is also an extensive
training facility there, which deals for the most part with Contact
& Liaison work and specialises in the study of Vargr subcultures.
The base is often used as a jumping–off point for long–range Scout
missions into the Vargr Extents or even through them and into the
relatively unexplored space beyond. A range of support vessels and
scout cruisers are based there, though some have been known to
depart on missions of several years' duration and are rarely seen
in port.
Junidy itself is a small world with a very thin atmosphere, home
to a population numbering around thirty billion of whom about
half belong to the minor race normally nicknamed 'Dandelions'
or 'Dandies'. Their correct name is Llellewyoly, as near as humans
can pronounce it. The Dandies are adapted to the extremes of
temperature experienced by Junidy in the course of its day and
display traits of both plant and animal.
Llellewyoly have five multi–jointed limbs which house their sense
organs and also serve interchangeably as hands and feet. The
central, spherical, body is covered with long, coarse hair. These
rather odd beings have a tech level 3 culture which is extremely
complex. Individuals hold a number of different social ranks each
with its own forms of address, depending on the current situation.
Using the wrong form of address for an individual's current social
status (which can literally change from one minute to the next) is a
major social gaffe and can result in ostracism.
The human population has a tech level nine civilization which is,
for the most part, separate from that of the native Dandies. Conflict
between the two groups has flared up on several occasions in the
past, and even quiet periods are not without tensions and the
occasional incident.

## QQUUERIONERION SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Querion subsector lies entirely outside the Imperium. Most of
the subsector is claimed by the Zhodani Consulate as an 'area of
interest' though if expansion into the area was desired it would have
been carried out long ago. Much of this territory was gained at the
end of the Third Frontier War. More accurately perhaps, it was given
up by the Imperium as the Zhodani Consulate has little interest in
acquiring more worlds.

Six worlds in the subsector are formally part of the Consulate and are
linked to it by a narrow strip of territory running Coreward through
Cronor subsector. The Zhodani naval bases at Rapp's World and
Querion represent the most Rimward Zhodani possessions in the
Marches.

The remainder of he subsector is mostly neutral, though the Entropic
Worlds (Winston, Entrope and Anselhome) are claimed by both the
Sword Worlds and the Darrian Confederation. They are at present
held by the Sword Worlds Confederation, having been conquered in
the Fourth Frontier War.

The Imperium set up a research station (Research Station Delta) at
Retinae when that world was part of the Imperium, and has since
maintained it as an Imperial possession on an otherwise neutral
planet. It is connected to the Imperium by way of a naval courier
route through Thanber and is administered from Frenzie in the Vilis
subsector. Although the retention of the station was agreed to by
the Consulate, alleged violations of the agreement are a frequent
cause of Zhodani diplomatic protests.

The subsector is fairly sparse in terms of stellar density and contains
mostly mid–tech worlds of little economic or political importance.
One exception is Bael, which is rumored to be the site of large
deposits of Lanthanum, which is vital to the manufacture of Jump
drives. This has attracted commercial interest from various quarters
and a certain amount of competition among freelance prospectors.
The world's remote location, requiring a Jump–3 vessel for access,
is a barrier to exploitation.

Critics of the Zhodani Consulate and its political system point to the
fact that although the Consulate is supposedly stable and works to
prevent internal conflict, the population of Asmodeus still managed
to break up into factions and fight a nuclear war which smashed the
planetary economy and infrastructure and drastically reduced the
population. The conflict eventually wound down, more for lack of
anything left to fight over than anything else. The Consulate finally
beginning a reconstruction effort as the radioactive dust settles, but
as the conflict ended a century ago there is little left to rebuild.

The Imperial authorities and the Travellers' Aid Society routinely
assign an 'Amber' classification to all star systems outside the
Imperial borders, as Imperial citizens do not enjoy the full protection
of Imperial High Law on such worlds. Querion subsector can thus
be considered an Amber Zone to all Imperials desiring to travel
there.

###### ENTROPE E336AAA C

Entrope gives its name to the Entropic Worlds, a group of three star
systems that have changed owners several times in the past few
centuries. Although officially claimed by the Darrian Confederation,
Entrope is under occupation by the Sword Worlds Confederation,
having been conquered in the Fourth Frontier War.

The political situation is complicated by the fact that the Imperium
backs the Darrian claim to the Entropic Worlds and the Zhodani
Consulate supports that of the Sword Worlders. This is more to do
with politics and alliances than any real belief in the rightness of the
claim. Neither side is willing to precipitate an incident by expressing
this support in more than polite diplomatic terms, at least not for
the present.

A small world with a very thin atmosphere, Entrope was settled in the
distant past and has received additional colonists at various times
in its history. Despite the need for compressor masks when working
outside and sealed environments for living in, the population grew
steadily to the present level, numbering tens of billions.

This huge population is jammed into several enormous city–states
with smaller communities between them. Many of the latter are
domed agricultural settlements, though seabed farming is also
extensively used.

The cities are heavily and harshly policed both to deal with the
inevitable pressures caused by having so many people in close
proximity and to try to keep a lid on the world's internal troubles.
Society is heavily factionalised, with alliances between power groups
forever changing and violence more or less the norm. Usually this
is 'kept in the family', in that real efforts are made not to cause
collateral damage when attacking members or facilities of a rival
faction. This is a pragmatic measure as much as anything else –
collateral casualties result in resentment and no faction needs any
more enemies than it already has.

Officially, the world is listed as being ruled by a Charismatic Dictator.
However, exactly who this august person may be can change,
literally, from one week to the next. Whoever came out on top in the

QQUUERIONERION^75

latest power struggle could be referred to as a Charismatic Dictator
in that he or she enjoys considerable support, at least for the time
being. However, the political ground on Entrope shifts alarmingly
fast.

This factionalization is one reason why the Entropic Worlds have
changed hands so often. The world is capable of constructing
powerful defences and a decent system squadron; certainly enough
to prevent casual annexation. However, some factions are pro–
Darrian, some pro–Sword Worlds and some are sufficiently anti–
the others that they would rather side with offworlders than see their
rivals in power.

The present dictator's faction have held power more or less
constantly since 1084, though there have been several leaders in
that time. Revolutions and counter–coups have been put down with
assistance from Sword Worlder troops, though not always quickly or
easily. At present the ruling faction is presenting the Sword Worlders
as offworld allies invited in to help deal with the dangerous rebels
that are wrecking Entropic society, a polite fiction that makes the
occupation more acceptable to many citizens. There are as many
who actively welcome enforced membership of the Sword Worlds
Confederation as oppose it.

Annexation, conquest or liberation by either the Darrians or the
Sword Worlders has always been accompanied by internal conflict

and usually a coup. This has resulted in a great deal of destruction
over the years and some appalling tragedies, such as the breach of
city segments during political infighting.

The Starport was a casualty of the 1084 Sword Worlder takeover. A
short bombardment wrecked the facility. Although it could be rebuilt
using salvaged materials, the occupation forces and the current
'popular dictator' have not made this a priority. The Sword Worlders
have annexed a former industrial spaceport for their military use
and do not permit access to any other vessels. Non Sword–Worlder
ships must land among the rubble of the former port and make do
as best they can.

The outer system represents rich, if hazardous, pickings for salvage
crews. The wreckage of battles for control of orbital space can be
tracked down to wherever it has drifted. Wrecks of this sort can be a
lucrative source of under–the–counter military components as well
as more legitimate salvage.

The problem is that not only is salvage work in deep space a
dangerous business but the Sword Worlders in particular take a dim
view of unauthorized salvage, seeing it as desecration of the graves
of the honorable dead. Despite this, military salvage does go on
and the proceeds often turn up in the seedier starports of the Sword
Worlds themselves. At present the gains outweigh the risks.

One problem with deep–space salvage in the Entrope system is
that the system has no gas giants. Obtaining fuel without visiting
the starport can be a problem. A Jump–2 ship can carry enough to
make two Jump–1s, but the more usual solution is to melt ice from a
suitable asteroid in the system's belt, than go looking for a suitable
wreck with full tanks. This allows a fast escape in the event of a
patrol passing by and noticing the salvage ship.

Although this is unlikely, it has happened from time to time. More
worrying are the tales of salvage crews closing with a wreck only
to find that it is not a derelict warship at all, but the shattered
remains of a previous salvage vessel. Whether these tales are true,
and whether the victims were destroyed by patrols, in disputes
with other salvagers or by some other cause is a cause for nervous
speculation.

###### PRINX C436635 6

Located on the outer Spinward edge of the Marches, Prinx is a small
world with a very thin atmosphere which is borderline–breathable to
humans at sea level. That is to say, a person without a compressor
mask could function for a short period before collapsing. During
this period, which would be acutely uncomfortable, the victim would
display increasingly severe symptoms of altitude sickness such as
confusion, nausea and dizziness. Local animals, such as they are,
have adapted to these conditions or evolved in them and are not
similarly affected.

(^76) QQQUUERIONUEERRIIOONN
The local wildlife is somewhat limited. There are no birds or other
flying creatures; the air is too thin to support them. Most larger
animals are water–breathers, with few species on land. These are
mostly fairly primitive crawling creatures, with few species larger
than a cat or small dog.
Much of Prinx' surface is entirely uninhabitable. With such a thin
atmosphere, mountains tend not to be eroded and remain sharp–
toothed barriers to exploration. There is less soil than on worlds
with thicker atmospheres, and while this does not greatly affect life
in the valleys, high land tends to be stark and rugged, with little or
no vegetation. The surface temperature is also rather low on average
so that in many areas the seas freeze to a considerable depth and
ice caps cover the land, greatly reducing the amount of usable real
estate available to humans.
The settlement of Prinx was a classic example of a land grab that
could not be properly supported. The colonists arrived after a long
and difficult journey and began setting up home on their new world
which, if not outright hostile, was not as welcoming as the mission
planners had believed. At least one follow–up mission arrived before
the project was curtailed and resources diverted to opening up a
more rewarding world.
As a result, the colonists on Prinx were left to go their own way.
They did reasonably well, setting up a stable society that gradually
expanded to cover an entire subcontinent. Over the centuries the
population grew slowly until the present–day level of several million
inhabitants was reached. Equilibrium was reached some time ago
and, with no population pressure to force expansion, movement
outward came to a more or less complete halt.
The subcontinent today know as Lesser Dantterland is thus fairly
well settled and 'tamed' for agriculture, and there are scattered
settlements out across Greater Dantterland. The rest of the planet
is uninhabited and more or less virgin territory.
Within Lesser Dantterland government is by a semi–hereditary
ruling caste descended from the original colony leaders. Succession
is only semi–hereditary as a ruler can adopt several unrelated
individuals into his or her household, who are thereafter considered
to be family and eligible for nomination as heirs, representatives
and holders of high office. In fact, heirs are less often blood relatives
than adopted household members for a variety of complex social
reasons.
Prinx was settled by Imperials and, much later, became nominally
part of the Zhodani Consulate. Today it is once again independent,
although most of the population are not aware of the difference.
Zhodani merchant ships (and the odd military patrol) out of Sansibar
come through the port from time to time. Imperial ships are less
common, though they are not unknown, and Darrian vessels are
increasingly frequent.

Some of these ships are en route elsewhere, others come to trade.
Offworld trade is not critically important to the economy of Prinx,
though it brings in some luxury goods and a little hard cash in return
for a range of plant products and minerals.
Darrian ships used to be very rare in Prinxport, but since the middle
of the 1050s long–range vessels have begun visiting. They come for
three distinct purposes. Most commonly, to trade. This seems odd,
since reaching Prinx from Darrian space requires a Jump–3 vessel,
and the operators surely cannot be making any money on their trips.
Yet still they come.
Other ships pass through and out into Foreven sector to Spinward,
presumably headed for the Coreward end of the sector. The third
group appear to be exploration vessels. They stop over at Prinxport
then conduct some kind of surveying operations over the uninhabited
continents of the planet. Queries about what these vessels are
looking for are met with politely vague answers about 'ongoing
survey projects' and 'researching planetary crust behaviour' that do
not serve to enlighten and are obviously not meant to.
Whatever the Darrians may be up to on Prinx, the locals are not
greatly bothered by it. The Darrian crews that come through
Prinxport are friendly and courteous, bring in a little offworld cash,
and do no harm while they are there. If they want to go surveying ice
sheets or mountain ranges that is their business. The locals have
all the land they need and a fair bit more; the rest of the planet is
somebody else's problem.

## VVIILISLIS SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Vilis subsector is a border region, with a little less than half of its
worlds being Imperial members. The Spinward border is more or
less open, since the space in that direction is more or less neutral.
Any threat from Spinward–Coreward is mitigated by the fact that the
worlds of the Jewell Cluster (in Jewell Subsector) flank any Zhodani
advance through the non aligned systems in that direction.

However, there is a threat from Rimward in the form of the Sword
Worlders, who have aligned with the Zhodani on several occasions
in the past. This guides strategic thinking to some extent. However
the distribution of stars systems in Vilis subsector provides a
'firebreak' to Trailing, ensuring that any defeat in Vilis is likely to be
a local one.

Preventing such a defeat is the responsibility of the 193rd Fleet
which is based out of Frenzie, Denotam and Mirriam. Its most likely
opponents are the Sword Worlders, whose ships have lower Jump
capability than the Zhodani Consulate and other more advanced
opponents. Against less mobile fleets a strategy of static defence
is possible and the 193rd thus maintains a number of guardship
deployments in the form of non–Jump–capable monitors supported
by tenders but unable to redeploy on their own.

Apart from a single BatRon held at Frenzie as a deterrent, Sector Fleet
deployments in Vilis subsector are mainly light units in the destroyer
and light–cruiser classes. Such vessels are considered entirely
adequate to deal with border incidents with the technologically
inferior Sword Worlders and to patrol the Abyss Rift. The Navy is
also responsible for maintaining communications with the research
station at Retinae and showing the Imperial Sunburst in the neutral
ports of Querion subsector.

The world designated 728–907 has been catalogued for a long
time but has only recently been properly surveyed. It possesses
a viable ecosphere with vegetation and insect life but no higher
animals have been detected. The world has been passed to Imperial
Colonial Office (ICO) administration with a view to colonization in
the next few decades. Some interest has been forthcoming from
Megacorporate officials, notably Sternmetal Horizons, but nothing
concrete has yet emerged from the discussions.

Vilis subsector contains three Amber Zoned worlds. This
classification is unusual since two of them lie outside the Imperium
and would normally be considered Amber Zones anyway. Travellers
should therefore use extra caution as conditions must be unusually
hazardous to require a specific advisory to be issued. The third
Amber Zone, Margesi, lies on the border with the Sword Worlds and
is often troubled by incidents spilling out from the Confederation's
rather vigorous internal politics.

Asgard is Red Zoned, and has been for many years. As usual the
reason for this has not been released by the authorities but the
presence of a low–tech culture suggests that protection of the locals
or visiting Imperials is likely to be the reason.

The worlds of the Spinward–Coreward corner of the subsector are
gradually coming under the sway of a loose alliance including the
government of Arden and usually referred to as the Federation of
Arden. As yet this is an unofficial situation but a formal alliance
seems to be emerging. Since Arden lies between Imperial and
Zhodani holdings, these worlds are of strategic interest and an
additional player entering the game is a cause for concern.

###### GARDA–VILIS B978868 A S

Garda–Vilis was originally named Tanoose when it was settled in
–121. However, the colony ran into problems which became steadily
worse until the situation could at best be described as disastrous.
At this point the government of the nearby world of Vilis came to the
rescue and bailed out the failing colony, at the price of becoming a
possession of Vilis. The world's name was changed to Garda–Vilis,
which means 'New Vilis' in one of the local dialects.

Ever since, Garda–Vilis has been exploited to the benefit of nearby
Vilis. Agriculture was encouraged but heavy industry was kept under
strict control. Today, all major industrial operations are owned by
Vilis, keeping the colony economically dependent.

The world itself is fairly large, with a standard, tainted atmosphere
and extensive ocean coverage. This still leaves plenty of room for
the populace, numbering somewhat more than 470 million. The
majority of the population dwell on the world's largest continent,
mostly around the coasts.

The major population center and capital has grown up around the
world's large Downport, which also serves a small Imperial scout
base. The latter is important as a communications link back into the
Imperium via Frenzie, Denotam and thereby into Lanth subsector
and as a base of operations for Scout Service vessels in the region.

The government of Garda–Vilis takes the form of an administrative
apparatus answering to Vilis itself. The world is run by a council
of Vilis army officers, and this is not popular. A rebellion in 1103
was put down by the council, at the cost of what remaining public
sympathy the colonial administration still had. Today the only
pro–government group on Vilis is the population dwelling in and
around the capital as many of these individuals are employed by the
Starport or its associated industries.

VVIILISLIS^79

There is a strong independence movement on Garda–Vilis, calling
itself the Tanoose Freedom League (TFL). The harsh measures
used in 1103 drove the TFL underground for a time but increased its
base of sympathisers among the general population. It has become
apparent that some outside agency is smuggling advanced weapons
to the TFL and providing training to insurgent units.

The TFL maintains that it is loyal to the Imperium and wants to
bring a free Garda–Vilis (or more accurately, a world named
Tanoose) into the Imperium. In 1083 the anti–Imperial terrorist Ine
Givar organization approached the TFL with offers of an alliance.
The bodies of the Ine Givar agents were found outside the scout
base. This was taken as a reminder of both the TFL's pro–Imperial
stance and its rejection of the Ine Givar proposal.

However the region around Garda–Vilis is of interest not only to
the Imperium but also the Zhodani Consulate, the Sword Worlds
and the fledgling Federation of Arden. There have been hints in the
past that one or all of these foreign states was interested in events
on Garda–Vilis. It is possible that the TFL might align itself with a
foreign power if this offered a real chance at independence from
Vilis.

Thus far the rebellion on Garda–Vilis has been treated as an internal
matter and Imperial Army forces have not been assigned to deal
with the matter. Were foreign influences found to be involved
that policy might be revised. In the meantime the ruling council is
stretched very thin. Local forces have been deemed untrustworthy
and disarmed, leaving the Garda–Vilis administration desperately
short of manpower at a time of deepening crisis.

Various measures have been suggested to try to mitigate the
situation on Garda–Vilis. These range from the use of mercenary
forces to augment the Vilis Civil Affairs troops on–planet, a Navy
guardship to help intercept the arms shipments coming into the
world, or perhaps the appointment of an Imperial noble to represent
the world. The latter was vigorously rebuffed by the government
of Vilis – colonies do not have their own representatives, they are
looked after by their parent world. Assigning a representative would
be a step towards recognizing Garda–Vilis as an independent world
and this is not acceptable to the government that has benefited
from having it as a colony for a thousand years or more.

Thus the situation on Garda–Vilis continues to simmer, sometimes
violently. With the majority of the population opposed to offworld
rule and not greatly benefiting from it, and a ready supply of weapons
available for the use of rebels, it would seem to be only a matter of
time before things come to a head.

###### ARDEN C5549CB 8

Arden is a moderate sized world with a thin atmosphere and a rather
scanty coverage of surface water. Although not optimal, this mix
was sufficient to make Arden a strong candidate for colonization.
Consequently large numbers of settlers arrived in the early years of
Imperial expansion into the Marches.

Arden prospered but did not thrive. The population gradually
increased up to the modern level of some 1.03 billion but the
world never quite became an economic or industrial powerhouse.
Nevertheless a solid TL8 economy emerged, finding markets for its
goods among lower–tech worlds nearby.

Along the way Arden's governmental structure ossified. Although
officially government personnel are elected in practice they can only
be elected from among the ranks of the Arden Society, a select group
whose members earn their place through financial contributions or
service to the ideals of the society.

The Arden Society is dedicated to making Arden a major player
on the interstellar stage, and works steadily towards that goal. It
controls the government of Arden itself and a number of industrial
or economic bodies and in recent years has begun to spread its net
beyond Arden itself.

(^80) VVVIILISILLIISS
The Society has openly imperialist aspirations, and is currently
working to create a 'Federation of Arden' from businesses and
shipping lines. In time this federation will, its members hope,
include the governments of nearby worlds. Although the project is
in its infancy already the Federation has major business assets on
nearby worlds and is in a position to influence the making of policy
there.
The Federation is particularly influential on Zircon and Utoland
in the Jewell subsector and on Caloran in the Vilis subsector. On
Caloran, a steady takeover of agricultural–related businesses is
underway. Rather than targeting the farms and the landowners
themselves, the Federation is insinuating itself into the food–
processing industry (such as it is) and edging out local operators
by bringing in machinery and techniques from Arden itself. The
farmers can continue to raise their crops as before but what passes
through the port for export is increasingly under the control of the
Federation.
Both Zircon and Utoland are rated as 'non–industrial' by the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. Arden–backed industrial
concerns, operated by personnel brought in for the purpose,
are currently operating on both worlds. The aim is to corner the
market in industrial production and make the planetary economies
dependent on Arden–owned factories. This far the strategy seems
to be paying off.
Agents of the Federation of Arden are active on other worlds too,
seeking opportunities for a strategic investment that can later be
converted into political influence. In short, Arden is building a
political alliance by creating economic dependency.
On Arden itself extremely strict laws and bureaucratic procedures
are in place. Enforcement is efficient and vigorous, not least because
the Arden Society uses the laws its 'elected' officials pass to keep
any prospective rivals from making any sort of credible challenge.
Meanwhile the world is undergoing a steady industrial growth,
accompanied by investment in an expanded technological base.
Arden is especially interested in starship technology. Its modest
Type C starport cannot build ships, though the government yards
nearby can maintain, repair and service them using imported parts.
Several Arden–based businesses own and operate starships, and
the government has acquired a respectable system squadron as well
as a handful of small jump–capable warships. Expanding either the
military or commercial fleets much further will require an indigenous
shipbuilding capability, which is at present beyond the investment
capability of Arden.

However, the fledgling federation is strategically located in neutral
space between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. It is
possible that the Federation may manage to play one off against the
other to obtain investment or assistance in necessary industries.
Arden (and its federation) is neither hostile nor friendly towards
the Imperium. The same rules are imposed on Imperial ships as
on independents passing through. These include import tariffs and
other practices that are not permitted within the Imperium and are
not levied against businesses friendly to Arden. A number of free
trader captains have come to some kind of agreement with Arden,
trading nominal membership in the Federation for waiving of
tariffs. This ability to conduct preferential trade makes membership
attractive to ships plying the local spacelanes, though it is not at
present clear what the price tag will eventually be.

## LLAANTHNTH SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Lanth subsector has two contrasting regions. Most of the subsector
is very sparse, but the Coreward and Trailing edges of the subsector
are dominated by the Spinward Main, which branches at Tureded.
Traffic bound for Rhylanor subsector and beyond heads out to
Coreward–Trailing while the primary arm of the Main loops away
to Spinward giving access to Regina, Jewell, Vilis and ultimately
Querion subsectors.

As a consequence of its strategic position Tureded sees a great deal
of traffic coming through its small port, more than such a minor
installation can really deal with. An upgrade is long overdue and has
been delayed as much as anything by the independent nature of the
locals, who are not keen on an influx of offworlders even if they arrive
with bucketfuls of cash. It is likely that the port will be expanded
soon whatever the locals think of the idea, perhaps causing friction
between the existing population and those who come to work at the
expanded facility.

Traffic on the Spinward Main is considerable, but the rest of the
subsector is inaccessible to ships capable of less than Jump–3 or

4. Thus although the Xboat route and naval patrols can cross the
subsector quickly, commercial traffic has to take the long way round.
The sparse area in the Spinward and Rimward ends of the subsector
is known as the Abyss Rift, and seems to deserve its somewhat
dramatic name.

Curious Jump–related phenomena have been reported in this region
for centuries, often by reliable witnesses. Scout Service Xboat pilots
plying the Trans–Abyss Rift route have filed reports ranging from
radio signals received (impossible) to 'something on the hull, trying
to get in' (positively crazed) while in Jumpspace. This does beg
the question of whether someone who has spent a week alone in
Jumpspace is a reliable witness or not.

Despite the bad reputation of the region, the main naval bases for
the subsector fleet (the 18th) and those elements of the Sector Fleet
that are deployed to Lanth subsector are located in the Rift or along
its edge at Ivendo, D'Ganzio, Lanth and Ghandi.

All the worlds in Lanth subsector are Imperial members. Three
(Wypoc, Quopist and Rhise) are Amber Zoned at present for various
reasons. There are also four Red Zones of which three (Ylaven,
Victoria and Sonthert) lie within the Abyss Rift. A certain segment
of the population takes this as additional proof that the rift is a very
bad place where awful things happen.

The fourth Red Zone, Djinni, is an uninhabited but apparently
habitable world on the Spinward Main. The Red Zone makes access
to Yori in the Regina subsector problematical for Jump–1 ships.

Vessels approaching the world are warned off and directed to the
system's gas giants to skim fuel. Those which cannot do this are
permitted to refuel from a small tanker kept on standby for the
purpose, though they are charged over the odds for the privilege. As
usual the Imperial authorities are not forthcoming about why they
go to such trouble to keep visitors away from Djinni.

###### DINOM D100535 A

Dinom is a typical 'rockball' world. It is a member of the Imperium
under the governance of the Dinom Corporation. Settled for
economic reasons it is officially listed as an oligarchy in the IISS
database but could be considered a corporate state in which the
main shareholders and owners of facilities make up a sort of
planetary nobility.

The planetary economy is based on mining and ore processing, and
the owners of the major ore–handling plants, mines and industrial
facilities more or less constitute the government. The World Board,
as it is known, does have some representation for those who are not
shareholders in the main economic assets of the world and for the
small populations dwelling outside the main cities, but for the most
part their voices are drowned out by those of the major shareholders
in the Dinom Corporation.

Orbiting at a considerable distance from a very bright star, Dinom
is far too small to retain an atmosphere of any kind, and therefore
lacking in liquid water. It is a rogue planet, which was once a moon
of the system's gas giant. Having been perturbed out of its orbit,
it was then captured in the gas giant's trailing Trojan point and
follows the much bigger world around in its orbit.

Dinom's polar axis points towards the star, which is little more than
a bright disc in the sky. It does put out enough energy to make
the pole pointed towards the star very hot, while the other pole is
constantly exposed to the cold of space. Dinom thus has a 'bright
face' and a 'cold face' as well as a zone of twilight along the equator
where temperatures are less extreme. All major settlements are built
in this zone.

There are three major cities on Dinom, with a total population of
somewhat less than 250,000. Most of the population live and work
in these cities, which are connected by a monorail link, Or rather,
will be connected by it 'very soon'. The monorail system has been
due for completion 'very soon' for what seems like an inordinately
long time and cynics suggest that it will never be completed.

There are an unfortunately large number of cynics on Dinom.
Although wages are good, many people are ceasing to see Dinom

LLAANTHNTH^83

as a place to earn a salary and to consider it their home instead. This
shift in perception has increased disaffection among the populace,
who (probably correctly) believe that the Dinom Corporation is all
about wringing profit out of the world rather than looking after the
interests of the people who live there.

At present the unrest takes the form of grumbling, labour disputes
over minor issues that would have been ignored or cleared up in
minutes just a few years ago, and the occasional strike. The World
Board has made a number of concessions to the workers, which has
caused the problems to quieten down for the time being, but has
not addressed the major issues regarding Dinom–as–home rather
than Dinom–as–workplace.

The World Board believes that it is simply not cost–effective to
implement social programs and to improve Dinom as a place to
live. In this, they are probably correct. The Dinom Corporation looks
after its workers well enough but does not see the need to consider
the long–term development of the world as something other than a
corporate mining installation on a huge scale.

There are those who have begin suggesting that what Dinom needs
is a change of government. This hypothetical new government would
of course allow the Dinom Corporation to continue its operations,
but would spend much more on long–term social development.
The World Board is unlikely to accept this proposal and in any case
it is unworkable. The money for these programs would have to
come from the only real source of wealth on the planet – the Dinom
Corporation.

Thus the situation continues much as it always has, with increasingly
poor relations between the corporation and some segments of the
population. Both maintain that what the other wants is unworkable
and unreasonable, and both may in fact be correct.

While the major processing works are located in the equatorial
cities, there are small settlements a short way into the cold and
bright faces. The only reasons to venture outside the relatively safe
equatorial zone are economic. There are extensive mines and towns
to support them located quite deep in the hot and cold zones,
wherever the resources to be found there justify them.

On the cold face, there are of course the usual veins and deposits of
minerals to be dug out of the ground, and in addition it is possible
to extract frozen gases from deposits on the ground. These are
purified and shipped in solid form or piped as liquids back to the
processing centres for a variety of industrial uses.

Operating on the cold face is hazardous. In addition to the usual
dangers of an airless world such as dust pools that seem only
centimeters deep, micrometeorite showers and the occasional deep
crevasse, super–cold terrain of this sort has its own unique ways to
harm unwary travellers.

Cold face hazards include lakes of frozen gas that will rapidly sublime
when exposed to heat, such as that inevitably given off by an ATV.
Deep crevasses are also possible, where the rock has been split by
explosive sublimation in the past. This occurs when a deposit of
frozen gas is exposed to heat, such as that from the system's star.
Dinom's orientation towards the star is gradually changing so this
occurs at regular but very infrequent intervals.

The bright face is, if anything, more dangerous. However, the
extremely high temperatures there are beneficial in some ways
when mining for metals. Conventional mining is carried out, and
there are other, less commonplace, ways to obtain minerals in this
environment.

It is possible to encounter pools of liquid metal which can simply be
piped into holding tanks. Such metals tend to be those with a lower
melting point but pool–draining is a quick way to obtain a fairly large
amount of metal. The occasional geyser of molten metal is far more
hazardous, though if the period of the geyser can be predicted it is
possible to send in teams to harvest the clumps of solidified metal
after an eruption. This is dangerous but has the advantage that the
metal so obtained tends to be very pure.

###### VICTORIA X697772 2

Victoria lies in the Abyss Rift in Lanth subsector, just off the Lanth–
Ghandi–Dinomn Xboat route. It is one of four Red Zoned worlds
in the subsector and is maintained by Imperial Navy vessels out of
Lanth or Ghandi. There is almost always a guardship in the vicinity
of the world, plus interdiction satellites that monitor traffic in and
out. Occasionally additional vessels sweep other parts of the system,
but this is no more frequent than any other system and is probably
part of the Navy's routine internal security operation. Official naval
sources, as usual, refuse to comment.

The guardship is usually a small vessel such as a Patrol Cruiser or
Close Escort. The subsector fleet has a huge section of the Spinward
Main to patrol and the Sector Fleet is mainly concerned with the
Sword Worlds, just a few parsecs away. Neither can spare large
numbers of vessels to monitor an unimportant planet in the middle
of nowhere.

Victoria itself is a very old world orbiting an old star, and is
deficient in heavy minerals and metals as a result. Despite this it
has a dense atmosphere, which carries a taint capable of defeating
most conventional filters. Fortunately this taint exists mainly at low
altitudes. Above 1000 meters the atmosphere is safe to breathe.
Below this, an oxygen supply or a fully sealed environment suit is
needed.

The human population numbers about ten million as near as can
be estimated. The people dwell on high ground, mainly in a region
known as The Mesas as it consists of a series of high mesas. There
is no world government; different groups each have their own way

(^84) LLLAANTHANNTTHH
of doing things that can range from oligarchies and dictatorships to
democracies and even voluntary anarchy.
Likewise the law level of 2 is an estimated average. Some areas have
very strict laws; most do not. Similarly technology varies somewhat
from place to place, though always limited by the scarcity of metals.
Balloons and dirigibles, sometimes powered by hand–cranked
propellers, have made travel possible between areas previously cut
off by low ground.
Victoria was probably colonized around –1450 and was isolated for
a long time. Even after the Imperium settled the Marches the world
received few visitors as a result of its remote location. In 901 the
IISS made a survey of the world and shortly afterward a Red Zone
was declared. While the Navy does not discuss the reasons for Red
Zoning, the Scout Service is a little more forthcoming. In the case
of Victoria the given reason was to protect the people of the world
from outside influence as they struggled to deal with their metal–
poor environment.
However, there is something else interesting about Victoria. This
may be why the Navy monitors the Red Zone rather than the Scouts,
though Scout vessels do sometimes visit the world. Normally a Red
Zone imposed at the request of the Scout Service is monitored by
their vessels and personnel; the reasons are usually protective or
scientific. Navy–monitored Red Zones are normally for political or
security reasons, or to keep people away from an area of strategic
importance to the Imperium.
It appears that around 300,000 years ago, at a time coinciding with
the disappearance of the Ancients, Victoria was heavily bombarded
from space using a variety of weapons but most notably asteroids
as 'deadfall ordnance'. This is a technical term for dropping a heavy
object from orbit.
The bombardment resulted in a number of immense craters, some
of which are today seas or great lakes. Others are not obvious as
they lie on the seabed. The Mesas area was caused by a strike that
cracked the planetary crust and caused lava to surge up before
cooling, creating the unusual pattern of high areas separated by
chasms which are quite deep but often only 500–2000m wide.
The best asteroids for planetary bombardment are rocky or, better,
nickel–iron cored ones. Thus significant deposits of metal are
probably available at the center of each crater. However, most of
these craters are now submerged and all lie below the taint level,
making access by the locals extremely difficult. Some craters have
a central raised point (a common feature of impact craters) and
this could be both found and mined more easily. However the great
distances involved mean that such an expedition is far beyond the
means of the unaided local population.
It is possible to obtain a permit to visit Victoria, though not by any
means easy. Such a permit includes strict clauses about trading
metal or metal goods to the locals, and specifically prohibits access
to Victoria's moon, Albert. Permits make it perfectly clear that
permission to visit the moon has not been granted and that lethal
force may be used without warning against any vessel approaching.
No reason has ever been given.
Albert is large enough to have an atmosphere and appears to
even have some surface water. It is officially listed as uninhabited
but there have been reports of a stone–built (or, more fancifully,
'crystalline') city on the surface. Official charts make no mention of
this, nor of any colonization effort or history of habitation on Albert.
Official sources will not even discuss the matter, and suggest that
chasing wild tales is not a very useful way to spend one's time.

(^86) RRRHHYLANORHYYLLAANNOORR

## RRHHYLANORYLANOR SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Lying close to Mora subsector, the longest–developed part of the
Marches, and to the established industries of Deneb sector, Rhylanor
subsector is a prosperous area which sees a considerable amount
of commercial traffic. One reason for this is that every world in the
subsector is on the Spinward Main or accessible from it using a
Jump–2 vessel. Indeed, a J2 ship can start out at Belizo and make
a circuit through Mora, Lunion and Lanth subsectors all the way
through to Celepina before crossing back to Belizo via Jae Tellona.

Rhylanor has a long naval connection. The world of that name
was the birthplace of Admiral Olav hault–Plankwell, victor of the
First Frontier War and instigator of the Civil War. Unusually, the
Spinward Marches does not have system named Depot like most
sectors. Macene is the largest and most important naval base in
the sector and may eventually be expanded to a full Imperial Navy
depot. At that time the name may or may not be changed.

The subsector is defended by the 23rd Fleet based out of Rhylanor, Jae
Tellona, Macene, Margesi and Nutema naval bases and there are heavy
elements of the Sector Fleet including several BatRons and CruRons
held in reserve at Macene to back up a threatened subsector.

Rhylanor subsector has a number of corporate bases, notably at
Rhylanor itself. These include shipyards and manufacturing centres
as well as research installations. The Imperium maintains a research
station (designated Gamma) at Vanejen, located in a remote area
of the planet.

There are three Red Zones: Gerome, Huderu and 457–973.
Conspiracy theorists keep trying to link the latter with the research
station at Vanejen, but this seems unlikely as the Imperium would
place its station at a location actually within the interdicted system
if there were something there needing to be studied.

Kegena is currently Amber Zoned. This low–tech world recently
suffered a major social upheaval and governmental collapse. A
temporary administration is now in place courtesy of the Colonial
Office and backed up by the Army, but the situation remains volatile
and caution is advised.

The atmosphere of Pannet makes it hazardous to visit but contains
a number of useful compounds which are extracted for use by
heavy industry. Several companies are offering very good wages for
hostile–environment qualified personnel to work in the extraction
process.

The belt at Gitosy is unusual in that it is spherical, the orbits of the
asteroids that make up the belt are not confined to the ecliptic but
proceed at all angles. However, most of these wayward asteroids
are ice fragments; potentially habitable rocky asteroids are mainly
found in the ecliptic plane or in only slightly eccentric orbits.

###### RHYLANOR A434934 F 2

Rhylanor is a smallish world with a very thin atmosphere located in
a cluster of three star systems just off the Spinward Main. As such
it provides a useful short cut for high–Jump vessels and Xboats but
is somewhat inaccessible to commercial ships, which tend to be
capable of Jump–1 or Jump–2 at most.

The majority of traffic into Rhylanor comes via the Celepina–Jae
Tellona link or from Fulacin to Porozlo. Access to the subsector
capital was one reason for the construction of an excellent A–class
starport at the otherwise rather unimportant world of Fulacin.

Rhylanor is home to several billion people, mostly humans, and
has a fairly moderate society with liberal laws. Entry to the world's
ruling elite by those not born to the right families is not easy but
it is possible to join the ruling class by a variety of methods. The
commonest routes are power and achievement.

Elevation for possession of power is simply a recognition of the
influence an individual already wields. Usually this means business
interests, ownership of industrial assets and the like but in some
cases individuals who have risen to lead (legal) political or social
groups have been elevated to the ruling class. There are those
that suggest that rising political stars who might challenge the
establishment are encouraged to sell out and join the existing
system; others maintain that Rhylanor is a meritocracy where those
who deserve a say in government are given it.

Elevation for achievement is generally linked with service to the
Imperium or to Rhylanor's armed forces. Retired naval, marine
and army officers are frequently offered generous inducements
to take up government posts or simply to be associated with the
government as advisors and public supporters. Achievements in
other areas such as science or entertainment are also rewarded in
this way, ensuring that Rhylanor attracts the best and brightest, and
that when they come to live there, they join the establishment and
thereby strengthen it.

Rhylanor's most famous citizen was Grand Admiral Olav hault–
Plankwell, who not only defeated the Outworld Coalition in the First
Frontier War but then advanced on [[Capital]] and took the throne for
himself. This is sometimes described as the ultimate expression
of Rhylanor–style meritocracy. Plankwell had achieved great things
as a naval officer and he wielded great power, fulfilling both the
requirements for elevation. He thus deserved to be made part of the
ruling elite, perhaps as Archduke of the Domain of Deneb. Empress
Jacqueline was foolish not to reward Plankwell's greatness, and
paid the price when he took what he deserved by his own efforts.
Reminders that Plankwell did not manage to keep his position very
long do not go down well on Rhylanor.

RRHHYLANORYLANOR^87

Admiral Plankwell's birthplace is today a small museum which
attracts large numbers of visitors every year. This is only one of
Rhylanor's many naval connections. Although Macene is home to
those heavy units of the Sector Fleet that are based in the subsector,
the subsector fleet has its headquarters at Rhylanor, and there is a
very powerful system squadron. Rhylanor also boasts a large naval
academy where young officers–to–be undergo their education and
training.

One of the proud traditions of the Rhylanor Naval Academy is the
'manning the boats' ceremony held just before the graduation of
each class of cadets. This commemorates the contribution of trainee
personnel from the academy to the defence of Rhylanor in the Third
Frontier War. Cadets volunteered in huge numbers to crew repaired
and reactivated system defence boats from the system's reserve fleet
during the Siege of Rhylanor. Casualties were very high in the dark
months of the middle of 981 before the siege was finally broken. The
ceremony is held in memory of their sacrifice and as a reminder to
cadets that they have not chosen a cosy, safe occupation.

Rhylanor also has a large Scout base, which acts as a communications
depot for the Xboat routes as well as a regional planning and
command center. The facility is quite extensive and contains training
facilities for some of the more specialized scout roles such as the
use of advanced communications equipment and the Scout Service
security teams that are occasionally called upon to rescue personnel
who have found more trouble than they can handle.

Rhylanor, with its large population base and extremely high
technology level, is also a center for industry, commerce and
education. The Rhylanor Institute of Technology is one of the most
prominent hard–science and technological–research institutions
in the entire Imperium and is almost certainly the foremost such
facility this side of Corridor sector.

Several Megacorporations have their regional headquarters on
Rhylanor, or at least a major installation for those that prefer to work
out of Mora. Some of Rhylanor's extensive shipyards are privately
owned but most are either Megacorporate subsidiaries or at least
partially funded by Megacorp money.

Rhylanor's importance as a communications hub and industrial
center cannot offset the fact that it is difficult to get to. Free Traders
and similar independent starships are rarely seen in the ports of
Rhylanor, Porozlo and Jae Tellona; they tend to stay on the Spinward
Main for the most part. The vessels that do come through are for the
most part expensive Jump–3 liners and freighters running through
Eqqus, Celepina and Belizo.

Many of the ships on this route are Megacorporate–owned, though a
couple of smaller lines make a decent profit from dedicated vessels
plying the trans–Rhylanor routes. The most prominent, Rhylanor
Shipping LIC, is heavily subsidized by the government of Rhylanor
to ensure a regular service. The firm does not operate anywhere
else, but Imperium Mail LIC does. The latter specialises in high–

jump courier and subsidized trade route operations in various parts
of the Marches as well as Deneb sector.

###### VANEJEN C686854 5

Vanejen is a moderate–sized planet with a dense atmosphere and
about 60% water coverage. Average temperatures are low, and
about a third of the oceans are frozen or covered by ice caps.

Although somewhat sub–optimal as a place to live, Vanejen can
easily support humans. It was settled around –2400 by Vilani
colonists, but became isolated during the Long Night, falling back
to barbarism before climbing back up to a modest technological
base. By the time the Imperium arrived in the Marches Vanejen had
experienced centuries of cultural drift and had lost most traditional
Vilani habits in favor of a home–grown culture. The population
were initially pureblood Vilani and there has been little intermingling
over the centuries.

Vanejen lies on the Spinward Main, though a less–travelled spur of
it running Coreward from Mora subsector. This arm offers Jump–2
access to Jae Tellona and thereby to Rhylanor or another arm of the
Main to Coreward, but is otherwise fairly unimportant to interstellar
trade and political affairs.

This region has been a backwater for centuries and has never
received much in the way of investment. It might have remained
entirely underdeveloped but for the events of the Third Frontier War,
which required the Imperial Navy to create a temporary base on
Vanejen and brought interstellar affairs onto the locals' doorstep.

Prior to this Vanejen was a more or less forgotten colony world,
whose inhabitants managed to create a stable tech level 2 society.
Progress beyond that point never really happened. Vanejen fell
off the map and escaped much in the way of notice for centuries.
Indeed, most locals more or less forgot about other worlds. Only
those that interacted with starfarers aboard the few ships that came
through were reminded that there was a wide universe out there.

After the war, the Navy kept the base open for a time even though
it was no longer needed. Budget constraints resulted in its closure
after a few years, but by that time things had changed considerably
as a result of offworld influences.

When the Navy came to Vanejen they did so carefully, making a
number of deals with local leaders. In return for making the setup of
the base easy, the ruling elite were given orbital surveys of mineral
deposits and technological assistance in setting up an industrial
base to exploit them.

In the century since the war, Vanejen has advanced steadily to
tech level 5, with most sectors of industry a monopoly for one of
the ruling families. Literally all steel production is owned by one
family, all land transport by another, and so forth. Some sectors, for
example sea transport, are divided between several families.

(^88) RRRHHYLANORHYYLLAANNOORR
Today, Vanejen has a population of just over 540 million, scattered
across three of the world's four continents. The fourth is barren and
more or less uninhabited. Government is by a stable semi–feudal
system based on control of critical industries. The ruling families
were firmly entrenched in power even before they gained their
monopoly on industrial activity.
Local travel is by rail for the most part, but sea travel is commonly used
for commercial purposes. In the northern hemisphere and equatorial
regions surface ships are the norm but submersibles are used for
most purposes in the southern oceans and other, particularly stormy
or ice–prone areas. Submersibles run on the surface most of the time,
submerging to avoid ice or to ride out a storm.
The submersibles of Vanejen range from small personal transports
to large cargo vessels and run on a diesel–electric system that
can use a schnorkel to pull in air while remaining submerged. An
explosives–rigged buoy is carried to allow a hole to the surface to
be blasted in pack ice, allowing a boat to halt, recharge its batteries,
and then proceed on a long under–ice transit.
These are not military boats, and are unarmed. They generally have
a large glassed–in area forward, with powerful searchlights mounted
alongside. This allows visually–guided manoeuvring at close range
although it does pose a hazard in the event of a collision. Most
boats are capable of operating at a safe maximum depth of about
200 meters, and can survive at somewhat greater depths.
Vanejen also has a substantial population of Chirpers. Most seem
to live on the northern continent, even though it is less hospitable
than the other land masses. This may be because the Chirpers have
moved away from humans, although that begs the question of how
they crossed the seas to their new home. There are populations of
Chirpers on the other continents.
Chirpers are small bird–like humanoids with vestigial wings and a
reptilian tail. They tend to mass about 25kg and are omnivorous.
Chirpers are semi–intelligent and are capable of learning a few
simple Galanglic phrases, though they mangle pronunciation
horribly. Among themselves they communicate with bird–like
chirps, hence their human name.
Chirpers tend to dwell in family groups of hunter–gatherers on the
human–dominated continents, though there have been sightings of
Chirper villages, which are primitive but show signs of agricultural
and tool–fabrication skills. These villages are mainly located on the
northern continent where few humans go.
Chirpers are a nuisance, often sneaking into settlements to steal
food and shiny objects, which they seem to like. They are not
wantonly destructive but can cause a fair amount of damage in
their ingenious attempts to obtain something they want. To be fair,
this is usually food and may be motivated by necessity rather than
mischief, but it is a problem for the locals.
Chirpers are also shy and extremely adept at hiding from humans.
Whole groups are able to vanish into the undergrowth when
approached, though they can be shot at a distance. It may be that
Chirpers do not understand that a human, say, 500m away can be
a threat. They do tend to move away from humans and conceal
themselves as soon as they become aware that people are nearby,
but the incredible vanishing trick is not performed until intruders
approach within a few hundred meters.
The human population on Vanejen has occasionally mounted
expeditions to drive the Chirpers away from human settlements,
and this has been generally successful. Perhaps not coincidentally,
Chirper numbers seem to be falling.
Vanejen is listed as the location of Imperial Research Station
Gamma. As usual for such installations, it is located in a remote
area. RS Gamma is reported to be a tower–like structure built on the
seabed in the far south, projecting up above sea level. It is accessed
by grav craft and supply submarines from local contractors. As with
all such stations, the station is a local Red Zone; access without a
permit is strictly prohibited. It is not known how this is enforced,
nor what sort of research goes on inside.

## DDAARRIANRRIAN SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Darrian subsector lies entirely beyond Imperial space. Access requires
either passage through the Sword Worlds Confederation (not always
possible) or a transit around via an arm of the Spinward Main and into
Darrian subsector from Vilis–Querion or District 268–Five Sisters.

The subsector itself is dominated by a fifteen–world cluster
centring on Ilium and Mire. This was the original area into which
the Darrians expanded when they first discovered interstellar travel.
Although many of these worlds were cut off for a long period during
the aftermath of the Maghiz, they remained culturally Darrian and
were peaceably re–integrated into the Darrian Confederation.

Technically this cluster lies on the Spinward Main but since access
to the rest of the Main requires transiting through the 'Gram Arm'
of the Sword Worlds, astrographical convenience is overruled by
local politics. Uniqua and Garoo are also on the Spinward Main,
though they lie at the extreme outer end, where the Main passes out
of the Marches and into Foreven sector to Spinward. The remainder
of the subsector is less dense, with stars occurring in small groups
for the most part.

While Darrian is the original home of the Darrian people, it was
thoroughly devastated by the solar flares of the Maghiz and never
regained its position. Pre–Maghiz structures and artefacts attract
many visitors each year as they are of a higher tech level than is
encountered in the Imperium or the Consulate. There are strict
prohibitions on exporting pre–Maghiz items.

Mire is the modern capital of the Confederation. Curiously, all
settlements are underground in order to preserve the surface for
parks, nature reserves and agriculture. The Darrian people love and
are respectful of life, though without taking this to extremes. As a
result the surface of Mire is a wondrously unspoiled environment. So
is Rorre, for similar reasons. Rorre was settled by a Darrian group that
disliked technology and preferred a rustic lifestyle. It was untouched
by the Maghiz; life on Rorre continues more or less as it always has.

Torment is a prison world, used by the Darrians as a place to dispose
of criminals that even the tolerant Darrian society cannot accept.
Access is prohibited in much the same manner of an Imperial Red
Zone. Prisoners mine raw materials in return for necessary supplies.

The world of Ilium was terraformed by the Darrians before the
Maghiz and retains a slight atmospheric taint despite the best of
efforts to remove it. Another tainted–atmosphere world is 494–908,
which defied the efforts of Darrian terraformers and is instead used
as a military training area, including orbital bombardment. Spume
also has a tainted atmosphere; this is compounded by the fact
that the taint is radioactive as a result of natural volcanism. The
population live in a sealed mining settlement.

###### DARRIAN A463955 G

Darrian is a smallish world with a standard atmosphere. Although
a little dry, it is entirely habitable by humans and was chosen by
the mysterious Ancients as the home for a transplanted population.
Why these people were moved to Darrian will probably never be
known; the Ancients disappeared soon afterwards and the Darrians
were left alone to develop on their new world.

According to Darrian legends and archaeological research, the
Darrians lived in a world of gardens approximating the Terran Eden.
It would seem that the Ancients set up an environment for the
population that met all their needs and allowed their numbers to
grow rapidly without much need for conflict over resources.

Eventually whatever Ancient devices ran the gardens ran down
and they began to fail, though this appears to have been a gradual
process. The Darrians were forced to spread out across their
planet and to fend for themselves. Fortunately Darrian was a very
welcoming world, and the transition was not especially traumatic.

Perhaps as a result of their relatively comfortable environment,
the Darrians developed a great respect for life and their science
was channelled into coexistence with the environment rather than
fighting it for survival. Science and technology progressed slowly
as there was little need for rapid progress, though the Darrians
developed their intellectual gifts in abstract areas like mathematics
and philosophy.

Over the centuries, the Darrians adapted to their homeworld,
gradually acquiring a distinctive appearance. Although recognizably
human and capable of interbreeding with other humans, the
Darrians developed what some refer to as an 'elfin' appearance.
They are tall and slender as a result of the lower gravity on their
homeworld, and tend to be more dextrous, if a little weaker, than
mainstream humans. Their skin has a golden colour and hair is
white or silver–grey as a result of living under a different sun for
millennia.

By –1511, the Darrians had developed a peaceful, rational society but
one without much in the way of technology. At that point, everything
changed with the arrival of refugees from Earth. These came aboard
a fleet of ships built by the Itzin Corporation, out of Turkey on Old
Earth itself. They were fleeing the decline that would lead to the
Long Night, and made an epic voyage all the way to Deneb sector
before turning Spinward and entering the Marches. After surveying
Sacnoth, the Itzin fleet chose Darrian as its final destination.

Whatever the new arrivals did next, Darrian and its people were
going to be changed forever. However, to the great good fortune
of the Darrian people the newcomers did not take the obvious 'sky

DDAARRIANRRIAN^91

gods' route, nor did they use their superior technology to dominate
or marginalise the Darrians. Instead they made a careful and friendly
approach, trading fairly with their new friends who in turn welcomed
the Terrans into Darrian society.

Change was inevitable, but the Darrian people were part of it rather
than it being forced upon them. Within a century the two cultures had
melded into one, as had the populations. The thoughtful, inquisitive
nature of the Darrians complemented the energetic and at times
reckless nature of the newcomers. Working with the technological
base the Terrans had brought with them, the new Darrian society
began a period of explosive technological growth and reached TL16
within just 400 years.

Curiosity very nearly killed the metaphorical cat when an experiment
on Darrian's sun Tarnis resulted in the Maghiz, or Chaos. Darrian
itself was badly burned by the resulting explosion of star–hot gases,
and has never completely recovered. Most of the population died in
the solar flares or soon afterward, and the remainder were too busy
trying to survive to preserve much in the way of technology. The
Darrian return to space began in –275, but on the nearby world of
Mire rather than Darrian itself.

Today, Darrian still bears the scars of the Maghiz. There are extensive
ruins of former TL 16 cites. These attract tourists and visitors with
a scientific interest from quite far afield, as do the remains of what
are now normally called 'orchards'; the Ancients–built gardens that
were home to the original Darrian civilization. Trade in artefacts
from these sites is very strictly controlled.

Modern Darrian has a population numbering in the billions. Most
of these people live on the surface, contrary to popular images of
Darrian as a world of flying cities. The surface is divided more by
mountain ranges than by seas, creating five great 'basins' which
are the equivalent of continents. In addition there are four flying
cities, held aloft by gravitic technology. Each has its own unique
characteristics and function, but altogether they contain only a
fraction of the world population.

In addition to being the spiritual home of the Darrian Confederation,
Darrian is also the main technological center. The IISS has assigned
a tech level rating of G (16), but this is slightly misleading. TL 16
artefacts are under study and in some cases can be duplicated and
incorporated into devices as black–box components, but the world
as a whole does not make use of TL 16 items on a routine basis.
Most of the ultra–high technology available on planet is in the form
of pre–Maghiz artefacts which are too precious for their scientific
value to be used for practical tasks.

Study of the pre–Maghiz items, coupled with the Darrians' natural
aptitude for technology, will undoubtedly result in technological
growth to surpass that of the Imperium and perhaps even the pre–
Maghiz Darrians. However, even though the government of Darrian
is composed largely of scientists, restrictions are in place and any
potentially hazardous experimentation is very carefully considered

before being implemented. The Darrian government is famous for
its detailed analysis of the impact of almost every decision on the
world itself and on the Darrian people.

###### DORANNIA E42158A 8

Dorannia is one of a cluster of three worlds lying just off the Bowman
Arm of the Spinward Main and accessible by Jump–2 ships from the
Main or the central cluster of the subsector. None of these worlds
is especially important, though Bularia has a reasonable trade in
agricultural produce.

Dorannia is an independent world with a population numbering
somewhat less than a million. It is administered by a fairly efficient
civil service government which follows established patterns in an
unimaginative way. Laws are strict, largely as a consequence of
a harsh environment that can kill the unwary or careless worker.
Mistakes can have terminal consequences for others, too.

The planet is smallish, with a fairly low surface gravity and a very
thin atmosphere which is tainted by radioactive dust. This requires
a compressor mask or a full air supply when working outside
the settlements and strict decontamination procedures at the
settlements. These tend not to be very large, with towns of a few
thousand being more common than large cities. The towns are each
administered by a local government, which in turn answers to the
central administration at the capital.

Dorannia has very little water and virtually no food production
outside the colony domes. Most towns have an area dedicated to
food production, which also helps keep the air fresh, but few are self–
sufficient. Extra foodstuffs are brought in from the more specialized
settlements which grow bulk crops in huge environmentally–sealed
greenhouses.

Transport between the settlements is generally by rail or large, slow
transport crawlers. Grav vehicles are expensive and Dorannia is not
a rich world, so the few grav vehicles available tend to be in the
hands of the government or well–off private owners rather than in
use as commercial transport.

Dorannia has very little agriculture, with a paltry amount of air and
water, but what it does have is fissionables. The world was originally
settled as a mining colony to extract and process radioactive ores,
and this is the mainstay of its offworld business. However, the
remote location of the world makes it a poor choice as a supplier for
most Imperial businesses. The mines make a fairly modest profit
but never enough to really put Dorannia on the economic map.

In recent years, a new industry has emerged on Dorannia. Rather
than simply mining and exporting radioactives, the world's industrial
base now constructs a range of fission–based power systems.
These include full–sized nuclear powerplants suitable to power a
large town or major industrial complex as well as smaller plants for
vehicles and miniature reactors for small–scale applications.

(^92) DDDAARRIANARRRRIIAANN
Nuclear fission is a mature technology on Dorannia, which uses
fission reactors to power its towns, industrial centres, railways
and even some of the larger transport crawlers. Safety records and
reliability are good, although fission power will never be as safe as
fusion, nor can fission match the output per unit mass of a fusion
plant. Nevertheless it is a viable alternative for mid–tech worlds that
want a power system that can be maintained with local resources.
Thus far Dorannia's products have found a few buyers and the
future seems promising. A recent ad campaign run on several
worlds invited prospective buyers to visit 'Atomic Dorannia' and
showcased a range of quite novel nuclear energy applications.
All is not entirely well on Dorannia, however. The scattered nature
of the world's settlements makes them ideal targets for planetary
raiders. These are groups of spaceborne thugs that either raid
settlements for whatever they can grab or else hold them hostage
under the guns of their ship, demanding tribute in return for
not shooting the place up. On a sealed–environment world like
Dorannia the consequences of taking fire in this manner could be
catastrophic.
After a string of raids on different settlements in 1102–3, one of
which wrecked a starport that was not very good to begin with,
the government decided to do something about the problem. A
Starmerc unit comprising an armed merchant ship and associated
personnel was hired for a time, providing a measure of protection
in the short term and advising on the creation of planetary defences
on a more permanent basis.
The latter took a form that would simply not be allowed in the
Imperium. Batteries of crude nuclear missiles were installed near
many of the settlements, guided by rather basic tracking and fire
control equipment. These homebuilt missiles are not up to the
safety standards required in the Imperium.
Although the Imperium does permit nuclear munitions to be owned
by world governments for planetary defence in the case of major
wars, there are many volumes of regulations for their safe storage
and the circumstances under which they can be used. Normal ship–
to–ship missiles, even aboard warships, are non–nuclear. Dorannia,
on the other hand, has launched more nuclear munitions under
combat conditions since 1103 than most planetary navies in their
entire history. The fact of the matter is that 'Atomic Dorannia' has
become trigger–happy with its new arsenal.
Since Dorannia has no real capability to conduct a boarding and
search in space, the only option is to use the threat of annihilation.
Vessels that seem even slightly suspect are targeted and told that
they have numerous missiles aimed at them. They are permitted to
sheer off and go somewhere else or else proceed in to land at the
port very slowly and carefully.
There was originally a flaw in this strategy, in that Dorannia did
not possess the means to destroy a starship without resorting to
nuclear missiles, so once the ship came in close enough it could
not be attacked. However, that was not common knowledge and
in recent months a stock of short–range non–nuclear missiles has
been obtained.
Several vessels have been fired upon, and as the guidance
systems of Dorannia's missile arsenal are not the best, accuracy
is problematical. The answer is, of course, to fire large salvoes in
the hope of a hit. As a result a typical Dorannia PAD (Planetary
Aerospace Defence) missile consists of a large ground–to–orbit bus
section and six independently targeted short–range missiles, each
with a tactical nuclear warhead.
A number of vessels have been induced to flee in the face of this
crazily aggressive response, and at least one has been hit. It is not
possible to tell from an expanding cloud of radioactive debris and
gas whether the target actually was a raider or simply a merchant
vessel whose bad–tempered captain chose the wrong frontier world
to get stroppy with traffic control. In any case, word seems to have
got round. The raids have stopped.

## SSWWORDORD WWOORLDSRLDS SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Every single world of Sword Worlds subsector lies on the Spinward
Main, although getting to some without a Jump–2 capable ship
requires following the meanders of the Main for some time. The
Main diverges at Iron and again at Caliburn. Heading Spinward–
Rimward from there is a section of the Main referred to as the
Bowman Arm which runs across the Coreward ends of District 268
and Five Sisters subsector before wandering out of the sector at
Garoo and Uniqua.

Rimward from Caliburn, the Main splits again in District 268, giving
access to the Rimward end of Five Sisters subsector in one direction
and Glisten in the other. Jump–2 ships can make a circuit back
towards Trin and Mora by this route.

Spinward–Coreward from Iron is an arm of the Main that leads
to Darrian subsector, but is not normally considered part of the
Spinward Main except in purely astrographical terms. This is due to
the political allegiance of the worlds on the Main.

The Sword Worlds Confederation, occupying a section of the
Spinward Main and a couple of spurs from it, is a collection of like–
minded world governments that sometimes work together rather
than a monolithic political body. The present Confederation capital
is at Gram, though exactly how much power is exerted from there
can vary considerably depending on the political climate.

The Sword Worlds were settled by a long–range colony mission from
Terra; the Imperium arrived much later, As a result there are deep
cultural differences between the two groups. Similarly, the Darrians
were recovering from the Maghiz when the Sword Worlders arrived
and claimed the region for their own. They thus see themselves
as rightful overlords of the region, and tend to deal with foreign
(Darrian or Imperial) ships passing through in a high–handed and
arrogant manner.

The four 'Metal Worlds' (Iron, Bronze, Mithril and Steel) are
'reserve worlds' held in trust by the Sword Worlds Confederation
against future need. Until recently the Confederation has vigorously
resisted Imperial efforts to exploit these worlds, but that attitude
has recently changed. A theoretically joint project to develop Steel
has been put forward. In practice the Sword Worlder involvement is
half–hearted at best. Surveying is likely to begin soon, once the last
political issues are resolved.

There are only four Imperial worlds in the subsector: Flammarion,
Caladbolg, Gunn and Caliburn. Flammarion has a small Imperial
Navy station and both Flammarion and Caladbolg have scout bases
to serve the Xboat route through to Five Sisters subsector. There is
also a small Scout base at Biter serving the same purpose. Biter is

part of the Sword Worlds Confederation and keeping the scout base
in operation has at times required some careful negotiation.

Were Steel to be developed, it might be possible to run the Imperial
Xboat system through there, enabling the Imperial Scout station
at Biter to be closed down. This appears to have been a factor in
permitting the Steel Project to go ahead.

Gunn is Amber Zoned due to the hazardous local conditions. As
usual, all non–Imperial worlds should be considered Amber and the
Sword Worlds, with their generally negative outlook on all things
Imperial, particularly so. The fact that Joyeuse has been awarded
an explicit Amber rating leads Imperial wags to describe the world
as 'especially particularly Amber'. Imperial travellers are advised to
avoid Joyeuse altogether.

###### GRAM A895957 B B

Located on what is now known as the 'Gram Arm' of the Sword
Worlds section of the Spinward Main, Gram is a moderate sized
world with a dense, tainted atmosphere and about 50% coverage of
seas. The world is remarkable in that this 50/50 coverage is almost
perfect; there is one giant ocean and one supercontinent, though
this does have a number of small inland seas here and there.

Gram was the first of the Sword Worlds to be settled. The world
was sufficiently habitable to allow the colonists to establish a home
and then spread out to what became the other Sword Worlds as
their numbers grew. For this reason the people of Gram have always
considered themselves the original and best Sword Worlders, and
of course the rightful leaders of the Confederation.

Gram is at present the capital of the Confederation, though exactly
how much that means varies from time to time. What passes for
central government in the Confederation has collapsed entirely
from time to time, and at other times the leadership has rested with
other worlds.

Gram has held on to power in the Sword Worlds since 852, a
remarkable achievement in such a turbulent political environment.
Somewhat over a century ago the administrative apparatus of the
Confederation was moved to a purpose–built city located on the far
side of the planet from Gram's own capital.

Gram is a heavily populated and industrialised world whose
aristocracy are mainly the owners of major industrial and commercial
companies. Some are actually businessmen or captains of industry,
others are simply the heads of families that own these businesses

SSWWORDORD WWOORLDSRLDS^95

and pay staff to run them. Thus most nobles are able to pursue
other interests or a career in the military as well as their political
duties.

The popular image of they typical Sword Worlder is one of a rugged
freeholder with rifles over the fireplace, working his land in the
daytime and swapping tall tales with his neighbors over strong
drinks in the evening. On Gram this is very far from the truth. Most
of the population live in large cities and work either in industry or
the services that support a large population.

There are also many legal restrictions, in part made necessary by
having such a large urban population. Thus Gram's billions are
governed by a fairly high law level that prohibits private ownership
of firearms. This would be unthinkable to the rugged frontiersman
of Sword Worlder ideals, but it is a fact of life for the populace of
Gram.

One of Gram's most important industries is shipbuilding, especially
for the navies of the Confederation. Sword Worlder ships are of a
lower technological level than those of the Imperium, and are not
capable of high Jump numbers. Gram's yards turn out two basic
types of warship.

Since it is possible to reach almost any point in the Sword Worlds
along the Main, vessels whose intended for primarily defensive
operations are normally only capable of Jump–1, allowing them to
redeploy under their own power but not surrendering much space
to fuel tanks and engine systems. Warships intended for offensive
operations are built with higher Jump capabilities for greater
strategic mobility.

What both types have in common is a generally blocky and extremely
tough design, with multiple–redundant systems to allow them
to soak up massive punishment without being forced to quit the
battle. This suits Sword Worlder commanders, among whom an
unwarranted retreat is considered grounds for disgrace and damage
to their ship is a badge of honor. Indeed, it has been said that the
ideal naval engagement from the point of view of a Sword Worlder
captain is one where his ship is shot to ribbons and where at least
one of his peers breaks off action with a less damaged ship.

Sword Worlder ground combat equipment is built along similar
lines, and Gram is a major supplier to the rest of the Confederation.
Combat vehicles are tough and well armed but lacking in sensors
and electronic equipment.

Despite a certain amount of pride at being the capital of the
Confederation, the first of the Sword Worlds and the source of much
of the Confederation's military equipment, there is considerable
disaffection among the workers of Gram. The cities are somewhat
grim and there are few opportunities for personal advancement.
Some of the mid–level aristocracy have begun to champion these
disaffected groups. In some cases this is out of genuine concern,

others are doing it as a sort of placebo, knowing that nothing will
really change, and some seem to be trying to use the workers as
footsoldiers in their own political battles.

At present there have been relatively few serious incidents, but crime
and violence are on the rise in the poorer sections of the cities and
there have been a number of short strikes by workers. These are
normally accompanied by loud protestations by the workers of their
loyalty to Gram and the Sword Worlds, and as a rule are surprisingly
good–natured as well as short.

In one factory, for example, the workers down tools late in the
afternoon shift, once a week like clockwork. They then march outside
where they make a statement to the news cameras that dutifully turn
up and steadfastly refuse to return to work for the remainder of the
day. The police usually send a patrol or two as a token presence
but there is never any trouble. A representative of the management
turns up sooner or later and explains yet again that the issue is being
addressed but concessions are not at this time possible and the
strikers promise to continue their protest until their grievances are
dealt with. So long as neither side rocks the boat, this situation is
accepted by both the workers and the owners as a necessary safety
valve for disaffection that is both valid and unavoidable.

Not everyone is so good–natured, however. There have been all–but–
revolutions in some plants, sabotage in others and even attempts
on the lives of members of the aristocracy. Rioting has occurred in
some cities, though for the most part this is rare. It seems likely
that unless conditions for the typical Gram citizen improve then
the situation will grow worse – and creating a better life for billions
would be hugely expensive if it were possible at all.

###### MITHRIL E568000 0

Mithril is one of the four 'metal worlds' claimed by the Sword
Worlds Confederation but not yet developed or colonized. The world
is very suitable in most ways for colonization – it has a standard
atmosphere and about 80% ocean coverage. However, Mithril is
more than a little cold.

Much of Mithril's ocean surface is either frozen or prone to drifting
ice. The land is swept by harsh winds and often blanketed by ice
and snow. While this would not pose too much of a problem to
high–technology settlers, it does make agriculture something of a
problem and raises the cost of setting up a viable colony.

Mithril lies on the Spinward Main and while vessels capable of
Jump–2 or more tend to bypass the system some ships have to
come through. Those that can usually skim fuel from a gas giant
and move on without visiting the world. A patrol vessel from the
Confederation navy is sometimes stationed in the system and may
challenge vessels passing through but on the whole the Sword
Worlders will not interfere with the navigational rights of passing
vessels.

(^96) SSSWWORDWOORRDD W WWOORLDSORRLLDDSS
Vessels not equipped for fuel skimming must obtain their fuel from
the planet. This is usually done by landing in a remote area and
running hoses to a source of water or landing in water and simply
drawing it into the tanks. The Sword Worlds Confederation does not
greatly appreciate this practice but has never done anything about
it.
Ships landing on the world to refuel are technically violating Sword
Worlder sovereign territory, but so long as Imperial vessels just
refuel and go the Sword Worlders are not sufficiently outraged to
confront the Imperium over the matter, which might result from
actions against Imperial–registered starships.
Relatively few ships land at the port. This is an 'E' class installation,
which is to say little more than a marked landing area with beacons
and a cluster of huts nearby. Outsiders are not welcome at the port.
Fuel and resupply are not available for passing vessels, though
Sword Worlder vessels coming through on official business are
a different matter and Sword Worlds–registered merchant ships
might be more warmly received.
Although the population of Mithril is officially rated as zero as there
is no permanent population, a handful of Sword Worlders operate
the tiny port. This is one of the loneliest jobs in Charted Space – to
be stationed with just a couple of companions on a planet several
weeks from any sort of assistance if disaster strikes.
This tiny presence serves to support the Confederation's claim to
ownership of the world. It is necessary for political reasons but it
is not a pleasant posting. Few of the personnel to be deployed to
Mithril Starport have ever ventured far into the arctic wilderness
surrounding the base. Apart from anything else there is no prospect
for rescue if something goes wrong and the staff all have jobs to do
at the port.
Exploration teams have surveyed the world of course, sometimes
working out of the port. These report an unusual phenomenon
known as the 'ephemeral glade'. Mithril is normally very cold and
its ecosystem has developed to take maximum advantage of the
short periods of above–zero temperatures that occur. During one of
these very brief warm periods (warm by Mithril's standards means
a degree or so above freezing), an ephemeral glade may spring up.
This is essentially an area of plant life that grows from the thawing
soil at incredible speed. Within a few hours an area of grass–like
plants up to 2–3m high can spring up.
Glades tend to be 2–3 kilometers across and rapidly attract animals
from the surrounding area, drawn to the readily available food and
shelter of the glade. Once the temperature drops below freezing,
the plants rapidly die and the animals depart after a last frenzy of
feeding on the dying glade's bounty.
Among the animals attracted to a glade are Calamanders, scaly
burrowing creatures with a complex society. Each group is centered
on a female who bears young and seems to be the 'queen' of the
group. She resides in a burrow which she rarely leaves and is
attended by several drone males. A third gender, referred to as a
Protector, digs tunnels, forages for food and, as the name suggests,
fiercely protects the burrow. Protectors mass about 12kg and are
quite tough. They are amphibious and prone to scavenge for food
or shiny objects which they take back to the female, apparently as
gifts or trophies.
Crystallice are another creature native to Mithril and are at best a
nuisance. They are tiny insect–like creatures that, even close up,
resemble ice crystals. They lie on the surface of snow or ice and
attach themselves to passing creatures, chewing through clothing
or hide to reach exposed skin. At this point they begin to bite and
burrow their way into the dermis, causing extreme pain and often
considerable bleeding. Crystallice infestation can be fatal and is best
countered by picking the crystallice off before they can burrow under
the skin.

## LLUUNIONNION SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

With most of its worlds on the Spinward Main and in close
proximity to Mora subsector, Lunion subsector was settled early in
the Imperial expansion into the Marches and contains a number of
fairly high–technology worlds. Most traffic bound for Five Sisters
and Darrian subsectors goes through Lunion, contributing to the
local economy.

Ling Standard Products (LSP) has major shipyards at Lunion
and Strouden. Indeed these are the most important yards in the
Marches in terms of output. They handle commercial and military
contracts on a large scale as well as building standard designs and
one–off vessels for private customers. Standards of workmanship
are very high.

Not coincidentally, the main naval bases for the subsector are at
Lunion and Strouden, with light patrol forces based out of Shirene
and Capon. Subsector assets belong to the 43rd Fleet, which is
mainly concerned with keeping its section of the Spinward Main
safe for navigation. Long–term 'guardship' deployments are not
uncommon even in systems with lesser starports. While boring
for the crews involved, such deployments go a long way towards
deterring both piracy and smuggling.

The sparse area in the Coreward end of the subsector is part of the
Abyss Rift and has the same bad reputation for Misjumping ships
and other strange phenomena. The remainder of the subsector is
more normal. There is nothing particularly strange about the sparse
area Rimward of the Wardn–Strouden line although it is quite
extensive and runs into neighboring subsectors.

The subsector's planetoid belts are something of a economic
disappointment. Gandr is particularly poor, though the discovery
of superheavy elements there in 1040 caused a number of firms to
move in, only to pull out again when the deposits proved unviable.
Zaibon once had the largest deposit of copper on record, but this
has been played out and few new deposits are being found. As a
result the system's mining–based economy is in decline.

Ianic has a sizable minority of Jonkeereen (about 30%) among its
population. The Jonkeereen are humans genetically engineered to
thrive in desert environments. They generally live apart from the
world's normal humans but get along well enough with them.

Less harmonious is Quiru, where a recent coup using mercenary
forces toppled the government and put a military junta in its place.
As yet there has been no official Imperial response.

Gorram and Penkwhar are Red Zoned, while Shirene is an Amber
Zone. Technically Wardn and Olympia are also Amber Zones as they
are not Imperial Members. Of these worlds Wardn is something of a
mystery. The Patterned Desert features intricate patterns carved into
its surface, with no known source. Some experts have suggested
that these are caused by anaerobic life while others think they might
be some kind of relics from earlier civilizations.

###### IANIC E360697 5

Ianic is on the Spinward Main, though it is not a world of any great
importance, just a place that vessels pass through on their way
somewhere better. The world itself is a small dustball almost entirely
devoid of surface water although it has a standard atmosphere.

Ianic, like most desert worlds, is not an endless sea of dunes. There
are plenty of such regions but in between are mountains, rocky
badlands and areas of semi–desert where there is just enough water
to support life. There are even a couple of very small 'seas' which
would be lakes on any other world. Oases are not uncommon where
underground water reserves well up close to the surface.

Overall, much of Ianic is not habitable without starship–grade
recycling and imports of fresh water and food. However the world is
able to support a population numbering in the millions. There are
a few large groupings but most of the population are spread out
across the planetary surface in small towns supported by deep wells
or natural watercourses.

Government is officially by a bureaucratic system descended from
the original colonial administration, but in practice the world
government really controls only the region around the capital and
what passes for a starport. This is not much more than a few low
concrete bunkers located beside a flattened landing area.

Fuel is not available at the port as such, but water can be obtained
from the saltwater lake nearby and processed to make liquid
hydrogen. A hefty Cr250 landing fee, higher than is usual even
at some high–quality ports, is levied at the port. This is payable
whether or not ships take on water, as the locals view water as one
of their world's most precious resources and feel the need to tax all
visitors to offset the loss.

The Jonkeereen, live separately to the mainstream humans for
the most part. Jonkeereen were originally adapted from humans
to colonize the world of Jonkeer in Deneb sector and have spread
to many other worlds. They are capable of operating anywhere
that normal humans can, and are thus encountered all across the
Imperium in small groups and larger populations.

LLUUNIONNION^99

Those Jonkeereen whose home regions lie close to the capital are
governed from there. The remainder, like many of the mainstream
human settlements, are too far away for effective governance and go
their own way much of the time.

Physically, Jonkeereen are not very different to baseline humans.
They were adapted about 400 years ago and have bred true ever
since. Tall, lean and dark–skinned, they resemble naturally evolved
desert dwellers to a great extent. Their perspiration system is
extremely efficient and they have membranes to protect their eyes
from wind–borne sand or dust.

Jonkeereen society varies somewhat across the many worlds
where they dwell, but the basic traits encountered everywhere
are conservatism and cooperation. Their ways are austere and
pragmatic in the extreme, and this concern with survival can make
them seem harsh or even heartless, especially towards outsiders.
They are more likely to help others of their own kind than outsiders,
if only for the pragmatic reason that fellow Jonkeereen are less likely
to get everyone killed by doing something stupid.

There is little friction between the human and Jonkeereen groups,
but little integration either. Both have different ways of doing things
and a tendency to ignore one another for the most part. Ianic is big
enough for everyone, even if most of its land is uninhabitable.

Observers have occasionally expressed puzzlement that Ianic, a
mid–tech world with an E class Starport, has its own spur of the
Xboat system. Although there is officially no Scout base present in
the system, Ianic is used for two important and related purposes
by the IISS.

The Ianic system is used as a storage point for Xboats and their
supporting tenders that are not in current service throughout the
Marches, plus a number of couriers with various capabilities. There
are several reasons for this. One is simply to have extra boats
and tenders ready to feed into the system when they are needed,
but more importantly there are a number of emergency/urgent
message protocols in place. A single courier, most likely from the
naval base at Adabicci or from Lunion itself, arriving in the Ianic
system can trigger what some Scout personnel refer to as the 'Ianic
Panic', sending Xboats and fast couriers off in all directions with the
message aboard. This is normally used for great emergencies, such
as the outbreak of the Fourth Frontier War.

This large collection of communications and support ships is not
based on Ianic itself but orbits one of the system's gas giants, with
a central station coordinating all approaches and departures as well
as acting as an accommodation center. This allows personnel to get
off their ships for a while. The station also fulfils the other important
function of the system. Backups of all Xboat–carried messages are
maintained at Ianic and other, similar, stations. The Scouts have
little to do with Ianic proper, although sometimes Scout and Navy
personnel conduct desert–survival training on the surface.

###### SPIRELLE C766846 8 S

A prosperous mid–tech world located on the Spinward Main,
Spirelle is well designated as a rich world. There is plenty of water,
a standard atmosphere and an environment that is fairly hospitable
to humans. The population expanded steadily after the world was
initially colonized, until today there are several hundred million
people on Spirelle.

This fairly large populace is spread across the globe, mostly around
coastal regions as is common on similar worlds. Sea and river
transport is the main way to move goods and people between
the cities. Although road and air links are reasonably good, water
transportation is relatively cheap which makes it attractive for non–
urgent goods.

Spirelle exports large quantities of tech level 8 goods to nearby
worlds. Much of the world's industry is geared to the export market,
producing rugged items that are easy to maintain with only limited
facilities. Produce aimed at the local market tends to be more
complex and sophisticated.

There is a reasonably good starport, with government–licensed
traders handling most negotiations for private cargoes. The starport
is, not surprisingly, co–located with the world's largest seaport, with

(^100) LLLUUNIONUNNIIOONN
huge container ships delivering cargoes from all around Spirelle for
export. These are often shipped in standard (interstellar) shipping
containers which can be handled by the normal starship–loading
equipment and carried aboard freight vessels with no need for
unloading or repackaging.
Another important export is bulk seafood and related products.
Extensive fishing fleets and sea–farming techniques produce a great
deal of food. Some goes into the local diet, but a sizable amount
is processed and shipped out for export. Live fish and seafood are
also exported, though this requires careful handling and makes the
produce very expensive to the end purchaser.
With so much of the population living along coasts or on islands,
inland areas tend to be somewhat sparsely populated. Spirelle
has been settled for centuries, so there are few areas that are truly
uncharted, and most localities have at least a few scattered villages.
However, there is a fair amount of wilderness in the interior of the
continents. Mountains, rain forests and tundra cover much of this
area, making it relatively useless to the world's inhabitants.
The Scout Service has a base on Spirelle. This facility mainly exists
as a training establishment, making use of the extensive wilderness
areas to conduct survival training as well as exercises such as
navigational and problem–solving challenges. There are also a few
areas leased as large–scale free–fire areas, used to train basic and
advanced weapons skills.
Although the Scout Service is not one of the Imperial armed forces,
Scouts are often sent into places where they might have to defend
themselves, and most personnel are able to handle weapons with
at least a basic level of proficiency. The training areas are used for
basic and refresher courses for a broad cross–section of personnel.
They are also the scene of much more advanced training.
The Scout Service also maintains a security arm to protect its bases
and personnel. Normally these teams simply act as guards, but
some are trained in the hostage–rescue and 'object retrieval' role.
The latter is a catch–all term for everything from getting a valuable
alien artefact back from thieves to storming a hijacked Scout Service
vessel.
Within the leased areas are mock–ups of various Scout Service
vessels and other common starships, most with internal gravity
equipment so that they can be stormed in a range of conditions
from zero–gravity to a 'shirtsleeves' environment.

The Scout base is located in a fairly remote area, with mountains
restricting access from some directions. It has its own port which
is not available for non–official vessels to use. There is a sizable
community at the base, and a small presence is also maintained at
the main Spirelle starport for liaison and recruiting purposes.
Spirelle is, to a great extent, the sort of world the Imperium was
formed to support and protect. It is home to large numbers of
people who contribute to the Imperial economy as both producers
and importers of goods and may eventually develop into a major
world. In the meantime Spirelle lacks the high–technology industrial
base to construct and effective system defence fleet. While a few
imported system defence boats can make a huge difference, a world
of this kind cannot truly protect itself from large–scale interstellar
threats and must rely on the Imperial Navy to fulfil this function.
Pro–Imperial observers maintain that worlds like Spirelle would
never have the chance to flourish were it not for the Imperium.

(^102) MMMOORAORRAA

## MMOORARA SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Very much the gateway to the Marches, the Mora subsector was the
first area to be colonized by the Imperium and has developed steadily
ever since. All worlds in the subsector are Imperial members. The
subsector is defended by the 73rd Fleet, which is based out of Mora
itself. The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet is also headquartered at
Mora, though if a Depot system is someday designated it may move
there.

In the meantime, the co–location of fleet headquarters and the de
facto sector ducal court has been criticized for creating an over–
politicised fleet. Other observers suggest that it enables better
cooperation between the political structure of the Imperium and the
Navy, its main military arm. Either way, the Marches is behind the
times in retaining a 'crust' defensive strategy when the move to an
elastic defence began elsewhere a decade ago.

The Imperial Navy has additional bases at Mercury, Moran and
Hexos, which mostly play host to lighter fleet elements. Mora
subsector is more intensively patrolled than most other subsectors,
and has no less than four light carrier task groups (one per naval
base) available for the anti–piracy and general security roles. This
makes Mora subsector safer for traffic, but at the cost of taking fleet
assets away from frontier areas that might need them more.

Mora is an economic and industrial powerhouse, and has large
Megacorporate holdings on–planet as well as elsewhere in the
system. Among the lesser corporations also headquartered there
is Al Morai, a moderately sized shipping line that provides a
reliable service through to the Darrian Confederation via the Vilis
subsector.

Only two worlds in the subsector (Palique and Fen's Gren) are Amber
Zoned and there are no Red Zones. However, access to what is left
of the Imperial Research Station on Duale is not possible. Details
of what the station was working on are unavailable but in 1102 a
massive explosion caused heavy damage to the station and caused
its temporary abandonment. Naval assets and Imperial Marines
remain on station (though at a curiously respectful distance) to
prevent intruders from entering the site.

Palique's Amber Zone is due to frequent meteor bombardment.
The world is a captured body that follows a highly eccentric orbit
which takes it through one of the system's two dense planetoid
belts twice a year. Although conveniently placed as an industrial
center for the minerals mined from the rich belts, Palique can be
a hazardous destination for starships. All of the world's cities are
deep underground for protection and the world is justly famous
for the quality of vacc suits and vacuum–environment survival gear
manufactured there.

Pimane is an interesting astrophysical oddity. Its surface has a
number of extremely deep rift valleys which contain an atmosphere
dense enough to support life. The surface is a near–vacuum.

Nexine, an under populated water world, is currently the site of a
study to determine if genetically–altered humans could be seeded
on the world. The project is in its early days as yet.

###### NEXINE C97A443 8 S

Nexine is a large world, almost entirely covered in oceans. The
atmosphere is of a fairly standard composition and density but its
taint makes the use of a filter mask necessary. The world is part of
the Palique Cluster, on both the Coreward Xboat route form Mora
and also the Jump–2 route into Trin's Veil and ultimately Glisten
subsectors.

Several attempts have been made to settle Nexine at various times,
usually without success. A small population, numbering in the tens
of thousands, dwells in far–flung communities, all of them small,
situated on islands across the globe. There is usable land for many
more people than currently live on Nexine, but not much incentive
for them to immigrate.

The island–towns of Nexine are broadly self–sufficient, each with
its own agricultural base and light industries, fisheries and similar
requirements to maintain equipment in local use and feed the
people. The overall tech level is 8, though industry is at the cottage
level and totally insufficient to export any significant amount of
goods.

There are a few larger settlements, notably the capital which is
co–located with the Starport and the Scout base. Even here, the
population is not large enough to support much in the way of heavy
industry and it is the Scout base that is the mainstay of Nexine's
economy. The Scout Service contracts with local businesses for
everything from food supplies to cleaning services, as does the
starport.

The Scout base is small, consisting of a fenced–off corner of the
starport leased by the Scout Service. A handful of cutters and shuttles
serve the Express Boat tenders that support Xboats passing through
the system and there is an extensive communications suite. In all,
there are no more than two hundred Scout Service personnel in the
system at any one time, even counting the crews working offworld.

Trade ships do come through Nexine but the world's tiny economy
cannot support buying and selling, nor produce enough of anything
to be worth freighting. Thus the port makes only a little money

MMOORARA^103

from services to ships, such as berthing fees, rations and the like.
Crews do spend a significant amount of money in the capital's bars,
restaurants and shops.

This dependence on the port for income has in many ways crippled
the growth of Nexine's own economy. A disproportionate percentage
of the world's population is employed in service industries around
the port, leaving too few to develop other sectors. Were this source
of income to dry up then Nexine's economy would almost certainly
crash. This situation is all too common on worlds with a fairly low
population. If the port generates enough income to allow investment
in other methods of generating wealth then the economy can grow.
If not then the world will get by but never have a chance to really
develop.

What Nexine needs more than anything else is more people. There
have been attempts to bring in immigrants using schemes ranging
from generous land grants to refugee–relocation projects, but so far
nothing has worked well enough to make a difference. The current
idea is to see if genetically engineered humans could be seeded on
Nexine, making use of the oceans that make up 99% of the world's
surface.

As yet the project consists of little more than a few scientific
teams doing field research, though presumably somewhere in the
Imperium there is a semi–aquatic subspecies of humans either
already in existence or currently being engineered. The scientific
teams are researching a wide range of possibly important factors,
from mineral content in the oceans to current conditions. Extensive
seabed mapping is also underway, presumably to locate suitable
regions for an aquatic or semi–aquatic population to be settled in.

Some of the Imperial scientists working in Nexine's oceans are
Dolphins. These were uplifted to sentience long ago and are now
a species apart from their lesser cousins. Their unique insight into
the aquatic conditions of Nexine will likely prove invaluable to the
project.

There are several small scientific outposts in various corners of
the world, and robotic information–gathering drones have been
dropped into the seas in great numbers. The main scientific base is
a fair–sized installation with a crew of about a hundred technicians,
scientists and support workers, from which research submarines
of various sizes depart on their cruises. Deep–diving subs have
also been deployed to Nexine and have begun penetrating the deep
ocean trenches and exploring the abyssal plains. This represents a
significant investment in money as well as effort, so presumably
there is a real chance that the project will go ahead at some point
in the future.

###### MORA AA99AC7 F 2

Mora is, both historically and astrographically, the Gateway to the
Marches. To some extent it is also the key, or at least the keyholder.

Mora is one of the richest worlds for many parsecs and is extremely
important in local politics, even though technically Duchess Delphine
of Mora wields no more power and has no more responsibilities
than any other subsector Duke in the Marches.

Mora is a large world with a dense, tainted atmosphere. It is almost
entirely covered in oceans, with only a few large islands and smaller
archipelagos breaking the surface. Nevertheless, Mora was the first
world of the Marches to be settled, and received far more investment
than other early colonies.

Starting in 60, Mora was developed as a trading center financed by
Ling Standard Products. This required a good starport, and that led
naturally to the creation of yards to overhaul trade and exploration
vessels. Soon afterward, full–scale shipbuilding began.

As the early explorers pushed out into the sector and the colonists
followed, Mora was the interface point where goods were marshalled
for shipping back into the Imperium and settlement missions made
preparations for the final leg of their journeys. It was through Mora
that goods from the Sword Worlds, the Darrian Confederation and
even the Zhodani Consulate came.

Eventually, Trin became important as a secondary route into the
Marches but for many decades everything and everyone came
through Mora. Some of the colonists never went any further,
choosing to settle on Mora rather than advance further into
unexplored territory. The world's population grew rapidly and with
it, the amount of industry it could support.

Today, Mora has a population numbering in tens of billions, dwelling
in gigantic mega–cities that cover much of the available land mass
as well as the surrounding seabed. The upper regions of these cities
project high above the surface of the seas, each with a spaceport
on the top.

Most of the cities lie on or close to the equator, and have spread so
much that they run into one another, creating the image of a single
city circling the entire equator. Smaller cities are separated from the
main belt by oceanic trenches.

Most of what little dry land Mora possesses is given over to high–
technology intensive agriculture, with additional food production
provided by seabed farming. There are, however, a few exceptions.
One is Mora's massive Downport, which takes up most of an
equatorial island. Another is the World Park, a large nature reserve.
There is also an island reserved as a private estate for the high
officials of the world government.

Mora's system of government is unusual, in that Duchess Delphine
is not just the world's official representative but also the head of
Mora's government. In practice the duchess delegates her role of
representative to the Imperium to a deputy, except when she feels
that personal intervention is necessary.

(^104) MMMOORAORRAA
All senior governmental positions are held by women, and Mora
is legally a matriarchy. There are some who suggest that this is a
violation of Imperial rules but in fact the Imperium permits any
form of government that the local population desire so long as it
does not violate High Law. Males are not enslaved on Mora, merely
not permitted to hold high office, so this is not a problem.
Mora has no police force or other civilian emergency services. All
such tasks are undertaken by branches of the armed forces. One
particularly important branch is concerned with orbital traffic
control and vessel tracking. In a system as busy as this, local
space can become very crowded and keeping the traffic flowing is
a full–time job for a great many people. There is so much traffic
around Mora Imperial Highport, the main port for the system,
that a secondary Highport has been constructed for use by those
with permission. This includes vessels of the Imperial Navy and
the sector administration, but primarily Megacorporate starships
belonging to Delgado, Tukera and Imperiallines, which jointly funded
the venture. These vessels receive heavily discounted services and
a streamlined customs system. The port is secured by mercenary
troops and patrol craft supplied by Instellarms, which has a large
commercial presence there. The volume of traffic is still so high that
there is talk of building a third port to serve government and sector
administration vessels.
Mora is, of course, highly industrialised, and has a very high
technology level. This makes the world one of the most important
economic players not just in the Marches but also in Deneb sector,
where a significant proportion of Mora's goods are sold.
High–technology industry is heavily supported by the Mora
Technical Institute, which performs cutting–edge research into
gravitics, electronics and manufacturing technology as well as
training graduates to work in these industries. MTI is somewhat
overshadowed by the Imperial Mora University, which deals more
in history, political studies and similar fields. The social status
associated with being a graduate of IMU is higher than MTI and
it is said, not without reason that technical institute graduates can
expect a good, well–paid career working in firms owned by the
families of IMU attendees.
The remainder of the Mora system is heavily exploited. There
are mining outposts throughout the planetoid belt and the
moons of both gas giants are also heavily mined, with scientific
installations scattered here and there. The belt is also the site of
major biotechnology industries, conducting both research and
production.
The system's scout and naval bases, located on large planetoids
in the belt, are both huge. The Scout base is the IISS regional
headquarters for the Spinward Marches and marshals a huge
communications fleet in addition to a flotilla of scout/couriers,
express boat tenders and survey vessels for routine tasks all across
the Marches.
The naval base is the headquarters for the Sector and Subsector
fleets, though normally the sector admiral resides on Mora and
commands from there. This is cause for concern in some quarters,
representing part of the over–politicization of the sector fleet. The
navy and scout service both maintain liaison elements at the port
and the capital, but there are those that feel that the de facto sector
duke and the sector admiral should not have offices in the same
building.
Be that as it may, the Mora system is home to several heavy battle
squadrons and cruiser squadrons of the sector fleet, and the naval
base has several more capital ships in reserve, though they may not
be in the best of condition. Many of these ships would, in wartime,
be crewed by reservists currently living and working on Mora. Some
could be ready in days, some in weeks, and some would probably
prove unusable when activated.
If another frontier war ever breaks out, it is from Mora that the fleet
will sally out to defend the Marches, and from here that the war
will be directed. If the worst comes to pass, it might be that Mora
could be the last bastion of the Imperium in the Spinward Marches.
Certainly it would be held with great determination. Were Mora
to be lost, the Marches would either have already fallen or defeat
would become inevitable. Unsurprisingly, Mora's system defence
squadron is one of the most powerful in the Imperium.

## FFIIVEVE SSIISTERSSTERS SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Five Sisters subsector was first explored by the merchant captain
Ignaz Ruffleran, who named the worlds of Mirriam, Jone, Penelope,
Karin and Ucella after his daughters. When an official subsector
designation was assigned, these worlds gave what had previously
been District 267 its name.

Lying beyond the Imperium proper and connected to it only by a
tenuous link through the Sword Worlds, the subsector was not
heavily colonized at first. A coordinated effort was implemented in
740 under the auspices of Emperor Paulo I but this was curtailed half
a century later after little success. The fact that efforts to colonize a
region close to two worlds inhabited by the psionics–using Droyne
coincided with the Psionics Suppressions has not escaped notice.

Since that time the subsector has remained an isolated territory under
the administration of the Imperial Navy. It is the responsibility of
the 208th Fleet, which is unusual in having capital ships permanently
assigned to it. This is more likely to do with the interdiction of Andor
and Candory than protection of the few Imperial assets in the region,
though why battleships are needed to enforce a Red Zone remains
a mystery. Droyne ships are not normally stopped – the Red Zone
seems to be there to keep people out of Andor and Candory, not to
keep the Droyne in.

The 208th Fleet has its headquarters at Iderati, the subsector capital,
plus six other bases in a ring around Andor and Candory. These are
home to patrol ships and vessels that enforce the interdiction within
the Red Zoned systems but also have heavier non–Jump capable
defence squadrons than is normal for such installations. These are
deployed widely across the system and may be in place to catch
vessels trying to slip through to Droyne worlds. The fact that the
base systems are Amber Zoned helps to deter visitors, though it
seems to have more to do with the danger of intruding into a heavily
defended system than anything else.

Andor and Candory, as already noted, are Red Zoned and both
are Droyne worlds. As well as the base systems surrounding the
interdicted area there are three other Amber Zones in place, at Jinx,
Lakou and 875–496. Of these only Lakou is an Imperial member. It
seems likely that the Imperial Research Station at Froin (designated
Research Station Zeta) is involved with some kind of research
connected with the Droyne but as usual the authorities refuse to
confirm, deny or even comment.

There are 10 non–Imperial worlds in the subsector, not counting
the Droyne ones. Most are located to Rimward of the Imperial zone,
in the direction of what some Imperials call the 'Outrim Void' even
though it is only Rimward of the Marches and is hardly a void. The
term was probably first coined in an entertainment show and seems

to have stuck. In any case, travel 'outrim' into Menorial subsector
via Five Sisters is discouraged by the authorities. Despite this,
exploratory trade missions do occasionally crawl along the Spinward
Main all the way to Five Sisters and then head out into the relative
unknown in search of new markets and that hoped–for big score.

###### SAXE EAA5543 7

Saxe is located almost at the extreme Spinward end of the Spinward
Main and just beyond the Imperial border. It is a large world with
an exotic atmosphere. This can mean several things, though the
common denominator is that the gas mix will not be breathable to
unassisted humans.

In the case of Saxe, the atmosphere is a nitrogen–carbon–dioxide
mix, with very little oxygen. While not actively toxic to humans, this
gas mix cannot support respiration. An unprotected person would
breathe the 'air' in and out while they collapsed and died of anoxia.
In order to avoid this unpleasant fate, a full air supply is needed
although a sealed unit such as a vacc suit is not.

Saxe was settled by a rather optimistic mission that pushed out
ahead of the general spread of Imperials into the Marches and was
forced to make a home on Saxe when the colony ship's systems
began to fail. The ship was used as a habitat until more permanent
structures could be created, and was then cannibalised for spare
parts.

It was some years before other colony missions arrived in the area,
and longer still before trade ships began calling at the rudimentary
starport constructed outside Saxe City, as the original settlement
became known. By this time, several other small towns had been
constructed, though the colonists never spread very far from their
original landing area.

Saxe has gone through periods of oppression and internal conflict,
but today a fairly liberal republican system is in place, with some of
the outlying settlements more or less independent. As noted above
the population, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, has not
spread very widely and is confined to one continent. Vast tracts
of that continent, and the whole of the others, remains untamed
wilderness which, in the majority of cases, is entirely uncharted.

It is possible that there are other groups on Saxe, perhaps later
arrivals, though there has never been any contact with the 'official'
residents. On a large world like this, a small enclave could go
entirely unnoticed – especially if it were deliberately concealed. The
only people likely to do something of that sort would be pirates
or planetary raiders who had set up a base of operations. While
possible, it is not likely.

FFIIVEVE SSIISTERSSTERS^107

There are also rumors of a 'lost colony' of Darrians who dwell in a
sealed city floating in the world's oceans somewhere. This seems to
be even less likely than other hidden–inhabitant claims, though the
rumor is quite persistent.

Saxe is friendly to the Imperium, and is visited by Navy patrols from
time to time. Trade ships are rarer, though occasionally a Jump–2
capable trader uses the world as a stopover on the Five Sisters–
Darrian run. Otherwise the colonists go about their business as they
always have.

Saxe itself has a fairly primitive ecosystem. The atmospheric gas mix
cannot support animal life, nor even insects. This makes flowering
plants unviable, but other types seem to do well enough. Ferns,
mosses and grass–like plants grow wherever there is soil to support
them, and shallow watercourses in particular are choked with
primitive plant life which grows in great mats that can eventually
form a natural, living dam.

These plant–dams create pools surrounded by swampy areas which
are ideal for the creation of riotous plant growth. The swamps in
turn are home to primitive water–dwelling animals resembling
shrimp, krill and similar small crustaceans.

According to some scientists, Saxe is moving towards one day being
a terra–prime world. As more swamps are created by plant–dams,
the amount of plant life performing photosynthesis on Sax is
increasing, putting small but increasing amounts of oxygen into the
air. It may be that this will someday lead to a breathable atmosphere
and the emergence of water–dwelling life onto the land. For next
few million years however, any enterprising lungfish–equivalent that
sticks its head up to try breathing air for a change is likely to be
terminally disappointed.

Various scientific institutions have expressed an interest in studying
the emergence of life on Saxe, though for the time being the difficulty
in getting to the world from the major Imperial centres of learning in

the Marches has prevented any real effort in this direction. Darrian
scientists have visited the world from time to time and even set up
a temporary research facility in the 1060s.

This installation was little more than a set of prefabricated living
quarters just outside one of the smaller local towns. It was hurriedly
evacuated in the early months of the Fourth Frontier War and has
not been re–staffed. If this ever happens, the Darrians will need to
completely restock the facility. It still stands, but the ever–pragmatic
Saxans stripped the place within hours of the Darrians' departure. It
is not known whether permission was given, but the Darrians were
apparently friendly with the locals and certainly interacted with them
on a daily basis, so it does seem likely.

###### MIRRIAM B9998A6 A N

Mirriam is a large world with a dense, tainted atmosphere with
somewhat more than 90% of the surface is covered by oceans. A
considerable amount of Mirriam's land takes the form of mountain
ranges, small islands or else is unusable due to other conditions.
This includes most of the arctic and sub–arctic regions.

As a result the population, numbering in the hundred of millions,
mostly dwells in cities located just off the coast of land masses and
projecting up above the waves. Of those that are built on land, some
are located in mountain valleys but most lie on the coastal plains
where they can benefit from sea–farming. This is an important
industry and ranges from fisheries to vast seabed farms protected
by domes, growing fields of cereals and vegetables for consumption
in the cities and for shipment out through the port.

Mirriam is a commercial exporter of foodstuffs to the surrounding
worlds, but this is of fairly minor importance to the local economy.
Most of the food shipped out of Mirriam goes to the naval bases
in the surrounding area. Imperial–navy ration contracts pay better
than commercial sales most of the time, so much of the world's
output is tied into fulfilling these requirements.

(^108) FFFIIVEIVVEE S SSIISTERSISSTTEERRSS
Most of Mirriam's income comes from exports of industrial and
technological items. Only two worlds in the subsector (Iderati and
Karin) have better technology available for export, and Mirriam's
population base is big enough to allow for large–scale industrial
production of tech level 10 items. Grav vehicles and electronics for
various applications are exported across the subsector.
Miriam is a dictatorship, though a fairly moderate and benign
one. Laws are not excessively tight and enforcement is fair for the
most part. Living standards are good and there are opportunities
for personal advancement, all of which contributes to a contented
population and a popular government.
One of the routes to advancement is Imperial service. Mirriam
has both a naval base and a Scout Service Way Station, and both
recruit extensively from among the world's population. Mirriam
has a generous system of tax breaks and enhanced second–career
opportunities for veterans of the Imperial services. Many veterans
enter service with Mirriam's system squadron or the reserve armed
forces, while ex–Scouts often find a new home with the Deep Sea
Exploration Service (DSES).
The DSES, as the name suggests, is dedicated to mapping the
ocean beds and researching the creatures that live there. For the
most part it is a reasonably safe occupation, but there are always
hazards inherent in exploring caves in the side of an ocean trench
ten kilometers beneath the surface.
Mirriam's naval base is one of several forming a ring around the
Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory. Due to the extremely strict
nature of the Red Zones around those worlds, the nearest Imperial
systems all have naval bases and the forces there are on high alert.
Caution is advised as the Imperial Navy is more than ready to fire
on vessels which seem to be attempting to slip through or to sneak
something past the blockade.
As a result extremely thorough inspections and customs checks
are undertaken, and any irregularity can result in a ship being
impounded and stripped down to the hull braces, while the crew
get pretty much the same treatment. Vessels capable of making the
three–parsec transit are viewed with more suspicion than those that
obviously could not reach Candory.
There are two ways to cross the gap to Candory. The simplest is
to use a Jump–3 capable vessel. However, it is also possible to fit
extra fuel tanks in a ship's hold. Collapsible 'fuel bladders' and more
permanent conversions are both commercially available. Using this
system, the ship Jumps as far as possible and emerges in deep
space. Fuel is then pumped from the extra tanks to the main ones,
ready for a second or third Jump. This can take time and is not
100% safe, but it does make long voyages possible with a Jump–1
ship. Any vessel with extra fuel tankage of this sort is sure to arouse
suspicion and this is very hard to conceal from an inspection crew.

Mirriam's Scout base is a full Way Station, serving as a repository
for communications vessels serving the long route back into the
Imperium as well as plying between the Imperial base worlds in the
subsector. A sizable fleet of survey and exploration vessels is also
stationed at Mirriam.
Scout ships routinely depart on missions to Spinward and Rimward.
Most are of fairly short duration but some can be out for very long
periods. The Scout Service has recently acquired several ex–Navy
tankers and Dromedaries (ships that carry both fuel and dry stores).
Some of these support scout missions in their original capacity,
ie as resupply vessels. This is rapidly becoming known as the
most boring job in the Scout Service apart form Xboat–pilot duty.
As Xboat pilots joke; at least aboard an Xboat you've always got
someone interesting to talk to.
Other tankers and dromedaries have been converted to 'Scout Base
Ships' which can carry a flock of smaller vessels such as Scout/
Couriers, Survey Scouts and the like. They are designed to make
use of the high Jump capacity of naval tankers (jump–4 typically)
to reach an area quickly, then remain on station as a mobile base
for the smaller vessels as they collect data on the surrounding area.
Thus far several base–ship missions have been sent out, all of them
to Spinward.

## DDIISTRICTSTRICT 268268

With the exception of two worlds (Mertactor and Mille Falcs),
District 268 lies entirely outside the Imperial border. It is, however,
an area of Imperial interest. Such regions are designated as Districts
until such time as they are brought into the Imperium. At that point
they are assigned a suitable subsector name along with the usual
Imperial administrative apparatus and a subsector fleet to provide
security.

Most of the worlds of the subsector are on the Spinward Main,
though its meandering path may require a detour into Sword
Worlds subsector to reach some. All worlds are within Jump–2 of
the Main. There are two areas of empty space within the subsector,
which tend to restrict traffic. These rifts lie to Spinward–Coreward
and Trailing–Rimward of Collace. They are unofficially known as the
Greater and Lesser Collace Rifts respectively.

Imperial businesses are active in District 268, though McClellan
Factors is engaged in actively squeezing out its rivals, sailing very
close to the wind with some of its tactics. The Imperial worlds of
Mertactor and Mille Falcs are used as a regional base for those
Imperial firms trading into the subsector and are administered from
neighboring Glisten subsector.

There is no Subsector Fleet as such for District 268. Patrols are
maintained from Five Sisters subsector into the Spinward side of
the district and from Glisten into Trailing side. In addition, a small
force of patrol vessels is based out of Mille Falcs. This is officially
a detachment of the Glisten force but operates independently. It is
composed of a handful of older patrol vessels and escorts, backed
up by a couple of old destroyers.

Probably the most important non–Imperial world in District 268 is
Collace, a high–tech industrial world with pro–Imperial leanings.
Collace is a strong contender for the role of subsector capital if and
when the district is absorbed. However, many worlds want nothing
of the Imperium and are passively resistant to Imperial expansion.

Among these anti–Imperial worlds is Trexalon, which has been
involved in a cold war with Collace for many years now. The
government of Trexalon and the Trexalon Technical Consortium
(TTC) it leads knows that the Imperium will not tolerate armed
resistance and can bring vast forces to bear if the TTC starts attacking
Imperial facilities and ships in the region. Resistance is thus low–key
and below the level that will trigger an Imperial response. There are,
however, rumors that the TTC is behind a number of insurrections
and similar problems on pro–imperial worlds.

The world of Nirton is Red Zoned, and there are three Amber Zones.
Pavabid is one of these, where the world government is a theocracy
which follows the 'Pavabidian Heresy' (as it is called elsewhere) of
the Church of Stellar Divinity. Like other branches of the church, the
Pavabidian version believes that stars are holy, but maintains that
all stars other than Pavabid's are evil. Offworlders are from 'enemy
stars' and are highly suspect. The world is governed from a flying
palace that the locals, who are kept in a state of mid–tech ignorance,
are told is kept aloft by divine favor. In fact it was built on Glisten
and uses gravitic technology.

Bowman is the site of one of the largest planetoid fields in existence,
which covers five orbits rather than the more usual one. The
system has only one planet, a gas giant known as Bowman Prime
whose moons are inhabited, as are sections of the vast Bowman
Belt. Most of the prospecting and mining in Bowman is done by
independents and small firms but LSP has a large facility in–system
and occasionally expands its operation, to the annoyance of locals
who feel they are being edged out.

Tarsus is an agricultural world settled about 600 years ago from
Fornice. There are two communities of Sword Worlders on–planet
as well. One is a low–tech settlement peopled by the remnants of an
oil refinery project set up around –104 and the other is descended
from a Tizonian Army unit that arrived during the Second Frontier
War fleeing war crimes charges. The Imperial Megacorporation
SuSAG has a small research facility in the Tarsus system. Exactly
what it is investigating remains a mystery outside the corporation.

###### BOWMAN D000300 9 S

Most star systems have a 'mainworld', which is the world with
the highest population in the system. Usually this is a rocky
planet which may or may not have an atmosphere, water and so
forth. Sometimes, however, the 'mainworld' is an asteroid belt. By
convention, an asteroid belt that is not the mainworld of a system is
referred to as a planetoid belt, although in astrographical terms the
two words are more or less interchangeable.

Bowman's presents something of a classification problem, simply
because it is so huge. The Bowman Belt does not fill the usual one
orbit that most belts do, but several. There are separate zones
within the belt and there has been some debate as to whether these
are actually several separate belts, in which case Bowman has an
asteroid belt and several planetoid belts, or whether it is all one
asteroid belt.

DDIISTRICTSTRICT 268268 111

To the people who live and work in the Bowman Belt, the point is
moot. There is one belt, and they live and work in one part of it.
Distant regions of the belt are of no real importance because they
are very far away.

The Bowman system centres on a star named Bowman. This
is slightly unusual; normally star systems are named for their
mainworld and listed on the star charts as such. Star names are
often different to that of the system and are of no great importance;
people live on planets, not stars, so it is the world that it most
important to makers of charts. In addition to the star and the vast
Bowman Belt, there is one planet. This is the gas giant Bowman
Prime and its gaggle of moons. Clusters of planetoids are found at
Bowman Prime's Trojan points (ahead of it and behind it in its orbit.
There are no normal–sized planets in the Bowman system.

The Bowman system is unusual in other ways. Normally the starport
is located on the mainworld, but Bowman's port is actually on Alpha,
the innermost moon of Bowman Prime. A Scout base of sorts is also
located there. This is a very small installation which operates a few
ships on various missions in the local systems as well as Bowman
itself. These are often of the 'rock plotting' sort, necessary for the
maintenance of accurate charts but boring and unglamorous.

The population, numbering about 8500, refer to themselves as
Belters. This term means different things to different people. To
some it means the inhabitants of an asteroid or planetoid belt.
Others take it to mean those who make their living from the
asteroid–mining and prospecting industries, often but not always
in a belt. Here in Bowman it simply means the local population as
opposed to 'company men'.

There is no government structure in the Bowman Belt, nor any
real body of law as such. The Belters live in small communities or
family groups and are scattered quite widely. The main population
concentrations, such as they are, can be found at the town of
Garrison which has grown up around the starport and at some of
the larger asteroids. The most important of these is Koenig's Rock
in the main belt.

In addition to the Belter population there are about 2500–3000
'company men' in the system at any one time. These are not
residents or Belters but are well–paid employees of Ling Standard
Products. LSP has more or less taken over the Trailing Trojan
cluster of asteroids, and runs off independents with armed cutters
and mercenary security troopers. There is an LSP 'company town'
in the cluster, from which mining platforms are sent out to nearby
asteroids to extract whatever minerals can be found there. Ingots of
ore are then launched by mass driver to the two LSP stations near
Garrison.

These two stations are owned and operated by LSP but are required
by contract to process ore extracted by the Belter population as well.
They orbit Bowman Prime at the Trojan points of Alpha, from where
it is easy to transport the processed ore to the port for shipment out
of the system.

A third station orbits at the outer edge of Bowman Prime's ring
system, but does not mine for ore. Instead it extracts a range of
chemicals as well as oxygen and hydrogen from ice chunks collected
from Bowman Prime's extensive ring system.

There are also two other operations taking place in the Bowman
system. A small archaeological dig is underway on Epsilon, one of
Bowman Prime's larger moons. This was discovered in 1093 to be
the site of a pre–Maghiz Darrian outpost.

Meanwhile salvage crews continue to pick over the extensive field of
starship wreckage drifting among the asteroids of Bowman Prime's
Leading Trojan cluster. This dates from the period just after the
Second Frontier War, when a Sword Worlder fleet that had refused
to surrender and carried out a highly successful commerce–raiding
campaign was finally tracked to its base in the cluster and eliminated.
The exploits of this fleet, under Admiral Denisov, form part of Sword
Worlder naval tradition to this day.

###### PAVABID C6678D8 6

Pavabid is an independent mid–tech world lying a few parsecs from
Imperial space on the most Rimward arm of the Spinward Main. It
is a very habitable world for humans, with slightly lighter gravity than
Earth, a standard atmosphere and plenty of water. Unsurprisingly,
Pavabid was settled early in the history of the Marches and the
population steadily grew to its present level, about 700 million.

At some point in the world's history, the Church of Stellar Divinity
became the world's most widely practised religion, and later on the
official state religion worldwide. It is somewhat unusual for worlds
within the Imperium to have a state religion but not unknown – if the
population want a state religion then the Imperium will not interfere.
Outside the Imperial border, of course, world governments can do
as they please.

On Pavabid, the Church of Stellar Divinity moved from state religion
to religious state, turning Pavabid into a theocracy, although
uncommon this is not unknown within the Imperium. However,
without offworld influences the world religion took a sinister turn.
The Church of Stellar Divinity has declared the Pavabid theocracy an
official heresy and condemns the actions of the world government.

(^112) DDDIISTRICTISSTTRRIICCTT 268 226688
The Pavabidian Heresy maintains that while all stars are indeed
gods, only Pavabid's star is good and benign. In order to protect
them from the influences of these 'enemy stars', the population are
kept isolated and not permitted contact with offworlders. Travel to
other systems is out of the question.
Offworld visitors to Pavabid are restricted to a trade enclave around
the starport. This is guarded by Church troops and staffed by
the most zealous and incorruptibly faithful Church officials. Law
enforcement within the enclave is strict, equivalent to law level 8.
Outside it is nearer 10, with all manner of Church–imposed rules
intruding into all aspects of daily life.
The people of Pavabid are mostly content and kept that way by
Church rules that prevent them from finding out about ways of
life they might like better. All the same, life is not bad. Pavabid is
covered in small towns built around light industry, with agricultural
regions in between. Most Pavabidians simply cannot conceive of
any other life even if they were to try.
The head of the Pavabidian government is known as the Son of the
Star, and is considered to be the embodiment of part of the star's
consciousness. This makes him both divine and infallible. He dwells
in a floating palace that moves around Pavabid at the Son of the
Star's whim and is allegedly held aloft by the hand of god. In fact it
is a technological construct using impressive but mundane gravitic
technology.
Pavabid lies directly between Collace and Trexalon, two worlds that
are bitter rivals and hold diametrically opposed views about the
Imperium. Collace supports Imperial expansion into District 268
and hopes to become the subsector capital while Trexalon is doing
everything it can to hamper Imperial advancement and delay or
even prevent the region's incorporation into the Imperium.
Since both Collace and Trexalon ships come to trade at the port,
clashes of interests have occurred from time to time on Pavabid.
However, in recent months things have taken a turn for the worse.
A survey of Pavabid discovered extensive deposits of platinum and,
more importantly, iridium. Iridium is used in the production of
Jump drives and is extremely valuable.
Collace in particular is interested in obtaining access to these
deposits, which is strictly forbidden by Church law as offworlders are
not allowed anywhere outside the trade enclave. The locals do not
have the technology to extract it themselves, making it impossible
for Collace or anyone else to obtain iridium from Pavabid.

Collace and Trexalon both believe that the other is engaged in
underhand methods to gain access to the iridium deposits, and
neither is willing to allow the other to pull off a coup like somehow
gaining control of this rich new source. Since both believe that the
other is willing to use covert agents on Pavabid, counter–agents
must necessarily be deployed. As yet there have been no serious
incidents but it is only a matter of time before the shadowy war
spills over and becomes impossible for the Church not to notice.
No–one can predict what might happen then.

(^114) GGGLLISTENLIISSTTEENN

## GGLLISTENISTEN SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

Glisten subsector lies entirely within the Imperium. For many years
it was a backwater lying on an unimportant frontier, and received
little attention. Xboats bound for Imperial holdings in Pax Rulin
subsector (to Rimward towards the Great Rift) ran through Glisten
itself but otherwise there was little need to develop the region. The
opening of District 268 for Imperial expansion, in 940, brought
greater importance to Glisten subsector and has stimulated some
investment.

Many of the worlds in the subsector lie on the Spinward Main,
though the Glisten Arm is a relatively lightly travelled part of the
Main. It terminates at Bendor, though a Jump–2 capable ship can
reach any world in the subsector and can proceed beyond, into
Trin's Veil and finally back to Mora.

Glisten is the responsibility of the 100th Fleet, with its headquarters
at Glisten itself. The subsector fleet is understrength and contains
mostly vessels that are small or obsolescent, or both. Its strength
is further diluted by the need to patrol District 268 and to maintain
a detachment there. The Sector Fleet also has a light presence in
Glisten subsector; the region is a long way from the likely combat
zones in a war with the Zhodani.

There are four Amber Zones in Glisten subsector and one world
that, while not actually Red Zoned, has access strictly restricted. This
is Mithras, an Imperial prison world. Environmental conditions are
harsh, making survival outside the prison complex problematical at
best. Although some prisoners are life–long exiles, there are separate
areas for those serving long but finite sentences. The complex has a
good rehabilitation record and a small, attached institution for the
criminally insane.

Egypt is a major training base for Colonial Office personnel.
Originally set up for an expected large–scale move into District 268,
the facility has supported several operations elsewhere and offers a
retraining service for ex–Imperial service personnel seeking to make
a new life on a frontier world or in more mundane surroundings.

Glisten itself is named for the capital settlement in a system
characterised by cities built in the two asteroid belts. Originally
called Gliss Ten (Gliss being the name of the system's star),
Glisten City arose to become the system capital and eventually the
administrative center for the subsector. There are many large cities
throughout the system's belts. Most specialise to at least a certain
degree in one aspect of industry or economic endeavor.

Marastan is an Imperial reserve world. Although access to the
starport and associated city are unrestricted, only properly

accredited academics are permitted access to the world at large.
This is because Marastan is preserved as a showcase for plant and
animal species collected by the Scout Service. Some of these are
now extinct in their home environment but survive on Marastan in
carefully segregated reserves.

Other worlds of interest in Glisten subsector include Romar, source
of 'dust–spice', a narcotic valued by the Aslan, and Melior, whose
population is about 50% made up of Jonkeereen. Callia also has a
significant Jonkeereen minority, numbering about 25% of the total
population.

###### GLISTEN A000986 F 2

The Glisten system is well placed to act as a communications and
trade hub for the surrounding subsector; one reason why it was
chosen as the subsector capital. Glisten is located at the 'wrong
end' of the Spinward Main. Getting there down the Main requires
a long trip meandering through several subsectors, some of which
are hazardous while others are backwaters. For commercial traffic
this is simply not viable, and as a means to move information it is
extremely slow.

Most traffic into Glisten comes in via the Jump–2 link through
Trin's Veil subsector or the Jump–3 link to Strouden in the Lunion
subsector. What Jump–1 traffic there is tends to be confined to the
local cluster and perhaps the nearby sections of the Main in District

268. This has created a distinct cultural region around Glisten,
with its own accents and slight variations on social customs from
the Imperial norm. These deviations are not great but they are
noticeable to outsiders.

The Glisten system is centered on the star Gliss. It has a single gas
giant and no rocky planets. There are two planetoid belts, of which
one is designated as the mainworld. This belt is home to most of the
system's population, who would not normally refer to themselves
as Belters. That term carries with it connotations of small mining
habitats and semi–nomadic prospectors whereas the people of
Glisten live in large cities. The fact that their homeworld happens to
be a belt does not give them any sort of kinship with Belters proper

- and most 'real' Belters would agree wholeheartedly.

The population of the Glisten system numbers in the billions, housed
in large cities built on asteroids all through the belt. Each city has its
own administrative apparatus, all of which ultimately form part of
the efficient but dull Glisten Coordinating Authority, a civil service
government that runs the system as a whole. Laws are moderate
but with so many settlements, housing vast numbers of people,

GGLLISTENISTEN^115

scattered across the entire system, a rather stodgy administration
has emerged with a fair amount of red tape wrapped around almost
any activity.

The capital of the system is Glisten City, a huge metropolis that
grew out of the much smaller Gliss Ten settlement chosen as
administrative center for the system long ago. Glisten City is the
site of the huge starport and serves as the main center for trade and
business of all kinds as well as the administrative capital. Many other
cities are fairly specialized in their industrial or social activities.

There are several cities each specialising in agriculture, light and
heavy industry, and even an artists' colony. However this is not taken
to extremes. Almost all settlements have some industry, some food
production and some technical capabilities. There are a number of
more general settlements, but these are of much lesser economic
importance than the great centres for trade and industry.

With its large industrial complexes and extremely high tech level,
Glisten is an important exporter of technological goods across
the sector and beyond. Its shipyards are widely renowned, most
are located in the outer belt, named the Pluvis Belt. Among the
installations there are an enormous yard owned and operated by
Ling Standard Products as well as smaller and more specialized
shipbuilders such as Bilstein Yards.

The Pluvis Belt is also the site of Glisten's naval base, home port
of the subsector fleet. The immediate region around the base
is a restricted area and is heavily patrolled, with sensor outposts
constructed on a number of asteroids to give better coverage.

Glisten also has an extensive Scout base, which is located in the
main belt near the starport. In addition to a huge fleet of cutters
dedicated to the ongoing effort to chart and catalogue every asteroid
in the belts, the base is home to the usual flotilla of communications
and exploration vessels.

The Glisten system attracts large numbers of students to its
academic institutions, which include the Glisten Institute of
Planetological Studies (GLIPS) and the Mining School of Glisten,
which is associated with GLIPS but autonomous. The Mining
School receives funding from several corporate and Megacorporate
sources, which offer scholarships for promising students in the
prospecting, extraction, processing and management disciplines.
Ex–students are recruited in large numbers by mining corporations
across the sector.

There is also a community of what could be called true Belters within
the system. Although not officially part of Glisten's population and
not counted among it, the Belters are subject to local laws while
they are in–system and most are willing to comply. However,
there are groups who routinely ignore comm–channel restrictions,
traffic control instructions and other governmental rules which are
considered very important by the people and government of Glisten.

Enforcement of these rules is usually accompanied by howls of
protest from Belter groups who claim they are being persecuted.

The situation is not, in fact, very serious. Small numbers of Belters
are present at any given time and so long as they broadly comply
with regulations – and stay out of the most populous areas – they
are allowed to more or less do as they please. There are simply
not enough of them to be a problem and most of their activity is
in remote corners of the belt anyway. Only those making a real
nuisance of themselves attract the attention of law enforcement or
the navy.

For the Belters' part, most are just trying to make their way in
the universe with a little prospecting or working a claim on some
outsystem asteroid. The shiny cities of the main belt are built on
asteroids but the people who live there are no more Belters than
planetsiders are – the Belters have nothing in common with them
and are happy to just go their own way.

###### CRAW C573645 3

Craw is located 3 parsecs from Glisten. It is on the Spinward Main
but is not really on the way to anywhere, nor is it of much commercial
interest except as a market for mid–tech goods.

Craw is very dry. Much of the surface is desert or rocky badlands,
with the only large body of water a sea at the north pole. Away from
the seacoasts, the terrain varies from classic sand deserts complete
with dunes, through broken rocky regions to mountainous areas,
some with active volcanoes. None of these regions receives much in
the way of rainfall and average temperatures are high. This accounts
for the general lack of plant life in most regions. What there is tends
to be tough and wiry, and particularly unattractive.

Although Craw is a fairly small world it is of above–average density
and maintains a standard–pressure atmosphere. However, as a
result of the lack of plant life there is relatively little oxygen in the air.
It is still possible to breathe unassisted, but humans who are not
accustomed to the environment find it uncomfortable, tire easily,
and sometimes suffer from the effects of altitude sickness. Filter
masks are not necessary. Indeed, they are of no real benefit as it is
not airborne particles that makes the atmosphere difficult to breathe
but the lack of oxygen. An oxygen mask is necessary if offworlders
want to operate normally without several weeks of acclimatization.

Despite its unappealing nature, Craw is home to some seven million
or so humans. About two–thirds of the population live around
the shores of the polar sea; the remainder dwell in settlements
of moderate size all across the globe where water can be found.
Government is by a democratic system of representation, though
the difficulty of communicating or travelling over long distances
means that outlying areas are not properly represented and are in
some ways more or less autonomous.

(^116) GGGLLISTENLIISSTTEENN
The humans on Craw are descended from the early colonists who
came to set up a home and exploit Craw's mineral resources. The
mission was not a great success and due to a number of factors the
colony went through a survival/subsistence phase that lasted for
centuries before finally beginning to recover. Today, as a backwater
world with little in the way of exports to pay for imported technology,
the people of Craw have a long way to go in order to build themselves
a technological society.
A major factor in the local economy is the use of native labour. Craw
is home to tribes of intelligent humanoids whose considerable
numbers are not counted as part of the world population. These
natives are well adapted to the local conditions and can function
better than even an acclimatised human, making them an ideal
source of agricultural and heavy labour. The tribes that live far from
humans have a primitive tech level 1 society, while those with human
contact are generally capable of maintaining TL2.
The tribes close to human settlements are dominated by them
to the point where natives serve as sepoys in an army that serves
mainly to keep down the local tribes and impose a condition not far
short of slavery on them. Native workers (some come right out and
call them slaves) are subject to very strict restrictions as they labour
for the benefit of the human population. This has led to a state of
near–constant conflict between the human population and their
'allied' natives, versus the 'wild' natives who have greater numbers
but lower–tech equipment.
Slavery is of course illegal in the Imperium, but there has been no
Imperial intervention. One reason for this is that demolishing the
current system on Craw would mean that the human population
would need to be evacuated or else would either starve or be killed
by the enraged natives. If evacuated, where would they go?
There is also the fact that the situation is dark grey rather than black;
the native workers are not quite slaves, though they are definitely
third–class citizens. There is also the factor that the native workers
that serve the human population are provided by their own tribes
which are dominated by the humans but not quite enslaved.
A number of Imperial activists (some would call them do–gooders
in a disparaging tone) have arrived on Craw recently to investigate
the situation and report on what they see as shameful exploitation
of the native population. These activists have a difficult task ahead.
The human population resent them, the wild natives will kill them
like any other human, and even if they succeed they must then
convince an Imperial agency to act on behalf of the natives. As a
result no great changes can be expected any time soon.
There is another offworld group on Craw whose welcome is warmer
in some quarters. A team from a mid–sized mineral company,
InStarSpec, has recently set up a base of operations at Craw Starport,
incidentally upgrading it to C status. The installation is secured by
InStarSpec mercenaries armed with good offworld weapons.
InStarSpec has set up a handful of small mineral extraction bases
and exports what they produce via the port, paying the locals a fee
for the privilege. While very modest, this fee represents hard cash
that can be invested by the world government. As the InStarSpec
operation expands, the locals will be able to invest more in bringing
offworld technology to Craw. Already the port town is a strange
mix of local and imported technology, mainly bought from TL5–7
worlds.
In addition to the single merchant vessel chartered by InStarSpec
to run between Craw and Glisten, other ships are beginning to
trickle in and there are hopes that more regular trade may follow.
Time will tell whether Craw becomes a great success story built on
a partnership of local government and offworld mining corporation,
with a little bit of slave–labour thrown in, or whether the corporation
ends up running the world – locals, natives and all.

(^118) TTTRRINRIINN'''SSS V VVEEILEIILL

## TTRRININ''SS VVEEILIL SSUUBSECTORBSECTOR

The Trin's Veil subsector gets its name from the reflective debris
cloud that surrounds Trin, the subsector capital. This is the remains
of a shattered moon, and makes the night–time view on Trin a
glorious sight. It also interferes somewhat with navigation close to
the world.

The subsector is entirely within the Imperium and backs onto Gulf
subsector of Deneb sector to Trailing. Although the Spinward Main
does not run through Trin's Veil, a Jump–2 ship can connect to it
at Hexos (in Mora subsector) or Bendor (in Glisten) after a simple
transit via the Palique, Katarulu and Dodds clusters. Jump–2 is also
required to reach Trin itself. However, trade is conducted on a large
scale within the subsector's two main star clusters using Jump–1
ships.

Trin's Veil subsector is the responsibility of the 207th Fleet which,
like the 100th in Glisten, is somewhat understrength. Patrols are
maintained from the fleet headquarters at Katarulu and from bases
on Murchison and Trin. The Sector Fleet maintains a reserve at Trin
but this is a battle–reserve and rarely has vessels available for patrol
work.

There is one Red Zone in the subsector (Zephyr) and one Amber
Zone (Hazel). Thisbe is not amber zoned but can upon occasion be
dangerous. A long–term project is underway to improve the world's
marginal atmosphere and hydrographics by bringing in ice asteroids
from the outsystem. Most are simply broken into small chunks and
set in a decaying orbit that will cause them to burn up in what little
atmosphere there is, adding to it. A few fragments do reach the
ground, potentially causing a hazard.

The world of Prilissa is the origin of the Kian, a large flightless bird
used as a beast of burden on many worlds and as ceremonial mounts
for the Imperial Household Cavalry. Kian fulfil many of the same
functions as horses and have been exported almost as widely.

###### ARAMIS B659772 6

There are two worlds named Aramis in the Spinward Marches.
Aramis/Aramis (ie the world named Aramis in the subsector also
named Aramis) is an important trade center and naval base. 'The
Other Aramis', ie Aramis/Trin's Veil, is in many ways an opposite.

Aramis/Trin's Veil possesses something that its more prosperous
namesake does not, however, in the form of a habitable 'shirtsleeves'
environment. Gravity is slightly lighter than Terra–normal and the air
is quite thin. This is not a major problem, but unacclimatised visitors
tire quickly and can become light–headed from quite moderate

activity. To offset this, most ships approaching Aramis gradually
lower their internal air pressure during the week in Jump. Thus most
starfarers arrive already acclimatised to the local conditions. While
not perfect, this system enables visitors to avoid serious effects.

Aramis is a very wet world, with extensive oceans and relatively
little useable land. Nevertheless this is more than enough for the
population, which numbers in the tens of millions. There is one
moderately sized continent and many large islands or archipelagos.
Most of the latter have their own small nations which vary
considerably in terms of government and characteristics but mostly
conform to a tech level of 5–6.

One 'island nation' is in fact an industrial enclave on long–term
lease to Peabody Instrument, a firm specialising in the manufacture
of scientific apparatus and instrumentation components for
vehicles and industrial applications. The Peabody enclave has a
large population – fully half a million people – and is also the site of
the starport. Many visitors to Aramis gain the impression that it is
a high–tech industrialised world. In fact, beyond the shores of the
Peabody enclave, which takes up the entire mass of a large island,
Aramis is a mess of small mid–tech societies.

The mainland is home to the majority of the population. There
are several states along the coastal strip, mostly known as 'claves
(corrupted from enclave) and usually named for their founders.
These are independent and often unfriendly if not downright hostile
to one another. Each 'clave consists of a few small towns or a couple
of larger ones, surrounded by an area of villages and farms.

Inland is a wide outback region which is thinly populated and has
no formal government. Most outbackers live in steads which are
protected by a simple earth rampart with firing positions cut in
it. Raids and feuds are not uncommon, and the outbacker towns
are similarly protected. As a general rule outbackers do not like
coasters (or 'clavers as they are sometimes known) and have little
contact with them. There is some trade between the coasters and
the outbackers, just as there is some trade between different 'claves.
For the most part, wary, armed mistrust is the order of the day as a
result of old feuds.

From time to time the 'claves come into conflict, usually over a
disputed border region or a resource–rich area. Similarly the 'claves
will sometimes drive nearby outbackers off their land, either in order
to seize their resources or to improve the security of the region.
Hostility between the coasters and the outbackers probably began
in this way, though the origins of the many disputes and grudges
are in many cases long forgotten.

TTRRININ''SS VVEEILIL^119

Naturally the various 'claves are entirely willing to use the outbackers
against one another, either by inciting a group of outbackers to
harass another 'clave or by raising units of irregular troops from
among the outbackers for a more direct confrontation. This has
served to ensure that the cycle of violence and mistrust is not
broken.

Most of Aramis is tense but not especially dangerous at any one
time. Offworlders are generally recognized as not involved in the
many feuds and other conflicts going on at any given time, and may
be offered courteous hospitality amid what amounts to a war zone.
Of course, there are those who would like to engineer a situation
where their rivals inadvertently killed offworlders but for the most
part visitors are more likely to be seen as potentially useful contacts
or honored guests. There is a strong tradition of hospitality towards
those you are not actively feuding against in Aramis.

Offworlders are, however, not all that common outside the
Peabody Enclave. Aramis is off the beaten track as far as interstellar
commerce goes, and although the Peabody installation has a fair
amount of high–tech manufacturing equipment this is used for its
own business applications and is not available to generate trade
goods for the world in general.

Exports from the various 'claves and island nations are modest in
quantity and constructed at tech level 6, making it difficult to bring
in much offworld cash. Those 'claves and nations that can find
something offworlders want, and who invest the proceeds wisely,
will eventually leave their rivals behind or absorb them.

###### TRIN A894A96 F 2

Colonized not long after Mora, Trin is viewed by some as the 'back
door to the Marches'. It can be reached from Deneb sector by an
easy Jump–2 route through well–developed worlds with good ports
in Gulf subsector. This creates a lucrative trade run into Trin, from
where it is possible to head Coreward and join the Spinward Main
or Spinward towards Glisten.

Large quantities of goods move through Trin's excellent Highport,
which has many brokerages and commercial dispute resolution
firms. Most ships are larger types; corporate freighters and liners
rather than small, privately–owned ships, but Trin's shipyards are
used for refits by many smaller operators – at least, the ones that
can afford the fees.

Trin Highport also hosts a very large independent merchant
academy, the Imperial Trin Institute of Commerce (ITIC). ITIC
trains merchant spacer crews, but also offers courses in related
areas such as brokerage and business law. Many of the personnel
on the 'spacer' side of the institute also undertake Naval Reservist
training at the Imperial Navy base in the system.

As already noted, the Imperial Navy has a base in the Trin system
which serves as headquarters for the subsector fleet and a base for
heavy squadrons of the Sector Fleet. Trin's system defences are
commanded from a ground installation on Trin itself, but many of
the system defence vessels berth at the naval base. Trin also has a
small scout base to serve the communications network.

There is one other major facility in the Trin system, the world of Ling
Standard Products Spinward. This rockball world was named for the
corporate facility built on it in the early years of corporate expansion
into the area. Originally planned to take over as regional headquarters
from the facility at Mora, it instead became a manufacturing site
with a sideline in researching improved industrial techniques.

Trin itself is a medium–sized world with a dense, tainted atmosphere
and relatively low water coverage. There are no moons, though Trin
had one at some time in the past. The cloud of reflective debris
that makes dawn and sunset so spectacular on Trin is the remnant
of this satellite, which presumably broke up due to gravitational
stresses.

The world's population numbers in tens of billions. As with many
very high population worlds, Trin's people are concentrated in very
large cities surrounded by agricultural areas. Even with such a large
population, there is plenty of land and well–regulated agriculture
using high–technology methods is quite capable of feeding Trin's
billions without resorting to bulk food imports or low–quality
subsistence rations. Indeed, Trin is a strong contender for one of
the best places to live in Charted Space.

The cities are not especially crowded, and are very well–designed
by a civilization that has had gravitic transportation since the world
was colonized. Buildings are characteristically tall, with wide spaces
between them filled with parks and recreation facilities. Most Trin
residents are used to thinking in three dimensions when getting
about; the idea of being stuck at ground level is foreign to them.

Ground vehicles are not common on Trin, other than for industrial
and agricultural use, and for mobility within large buildings. Getting
around in the city normally involves fast, efficient maglev trains
or grav buses plying between landing areas on the outside of the
buildings. Maglev rail lines link the cities, along with high–speed
grav vehicles for those in a hurry.

The general populace are well educated as well as enjoying a very
high quality of life. Upward mobility is available through promotions
at work as normal, but for those of a different bent it is possible
to obtain government sponsorship (equivalent to an appropriate
salary) for excellence or merely promise in areas as diverse as art,
writing, music and sport.

(^120) TTTRRINRIINN'''SSS V VVEEILEIILL
There are poor people on Trin, of course, but there is a highly effective
social safety net in place which is normally sufficient to allow anyone
who has genuinely fallen on hard times rather than wanting to be a
career bum to start climbing back to relative prosperity. Being flat
broke on Trin is not quite the same as being down and out on some
frontier world or mid–tech industrial hellhole.
Trin's effective and efficient social system tends to produce motivated
and skilled people. Coupled with a tech level as high as anywhere in
the Imperium, this has made Trin an industrial powerhouse whose
goods are exported across the sector and far beyond. That in turn
generates a level of wealth only dreamed of on many worlds.
Trin's government is fairly typical of high–population worlds, in
that it has a semi–corporate, bureaucratic structure that follows
established practices for the most part. Stability is considered very
important in most areas of governance – Trin is so far ahead of
the pack that reckless growth is undesirable and carries a risk of
damaging the world's enviable position as one of the best and
richest places to live this side of the Imperial Core. Trin has it good,
and prefers to play safe to ensure things stay that way.
However, Trin is an economic center, and her government
understands that flexibility and rapid responses to a changing
situation are necessary for success in commerce. Calculated risks
are entirely acceptable, so long as there is always enough in reserve
to cover a loss and nothing is ventured that cannot be done without.
Cautious speculation is the order of the day in the economic arena
and other areas, such as scientific research, as well.
This innate caution has, oddly enough, prompted the government
of Trin to invest in some very unlikely scientific projects, economic
investments and exploratory missions. If there is a risk that
someone else might make a big score out of a project and that Trin
might miss out, then the government is willing to invest a little in
it, just in case it pays off. This attitude puzzles some outsiders, but
it makes sense to those who grew up in Trin society. They explain
that 'When you're rich, you can afford to throw a little money into
blue–sky projects. If it's a bust, nothing is really lost. But once in a
while you get lucky.'
This means that it is often possible to get a small investment out
of the government of Trin for any project that already has someone
else's backing and looks like a reasonable prospect. The concept
is semi–seriously referred to as 'insurance against someone else's
success'.

###### TRAVELLER ADVENTURES

The Spinward Marches setting has been the backdrop for Traveller
adventures for three decades and still has plenty of scope for more.
With a little bit of imagination, the possibilities for adventure within
the Marches is limitless.

Many adventures fall into one of several general types, some of
which are uniquely 'Traveller' whilst others are more generic. Exactly
what 'feels right' to any given Referee or group of players can vary
considerably. Some adventure types are outside the usual Traveller
experience and may jar with the setting as it is perceived by many
players. This does not mean that playing a game of this type is
somehow prohibited; the whole point of roleplaying games is that
they can be tailored to the preferences of each group of players.

Thus, what is written here is in no way a prohibition on any type or
style of play. It represents a set of guidelines to illustrate how the
mainstream Traveller universe looks, feels and responds to player
actions. However, the only really useful rule is – if it is fun and you
are happy with it, do it.

Motivation, Science and Technology
Although Traveller has starships, FTL travel and psionic powers, it
is basically a 'hard science' setting. This means that there should
be a reason for everything, even if that reason is unknown or even
incomprehensible to the players.

Where the motivation of non–player characters, even very alien
ones, follow some kind of logic, the setting becomes that much
richer and more believable. This does not mean that the players
will understand everything that happens, nor that the Referee needs
to have detailed notes on every character's personality. However,
the game universe needs to be sufficiently consistent that odd
behaviour attracts interest.

For example, if a Non Player Character suddenly becomes violent
when asked a certain question, that should provoke the adventurers
to wonder why. In a consistent game universe such an event would
be unusual, but if Non Player Characters behave in an unpredictable
manner all the time, there may be nothing to indicate that this event
is significant.

Of course, the characters may never find out why their Droyne
acquaintance suddenly stops in the middle of the street and began
to emit a weird keening sound while performing some kind of slow–
motion dance. Droyne often display behaviour that seems odd to
outsiders and they rarely explain themselves. The Referee does

not need to worry about exactly why the Droyne behaves like this
unless it is relevant to the storyline – it is a piece of colour detail that
serves to remind everyone that Droyne are different to humans. The
important thing is that the rest of the universe is consistent enough
that the players are willing to believe that there is a reason.

Note that bizarre alien behaviour still needs to make some kind of
sense, even if the reasons for it are unknown. A Droyne stopping
in the middle of the road, oblivious to traffic and other hazards,
is ignoring its survival instincts. That suggests that something
significant is occurring. Aliens that do odd things from time to time
are believable. Aliens that randomly self–immolate just because
they are weird and alien are not.

The same goes for science and technology. Although high technology
may bend the rules of physics as we know them, generally speaking
there needs to be a certain level of consistency in the game universe
in order to make it both believable and possible to make plans in.

Thus, as an example, unless an artificial gravity field is in use,
gravity should always work as advertised. Planets and moons will
follow predictable orbits. This means that when a ship's sensors
pick up an asteroid in an orbit that cannot possibly exist naturally,
the players know that something odd is going on.

This also makes it possible to use logic and good planning to
assist raw die rolls. If the characters are searching for a lost scout
vessel and find an asteroid that is off its normal path, a smart
player may conclude that it has been disturbed by a collision and
decide to check the charts for the asteroid's normal orbit and match
its current path with that orbit. The difference will be due to the
collision and that will give the characters a starting point for their
search, as their ship's computer should be able to model possible
collision parameters and suggest possible vectors for the wreck to
have bounced off at.

This is an example of the use of logic to solve an in–game puzzle, or
at least gain a clue. It is of course entirely possible to use a simple
make–a–skill–roll approach to this sort of search, but the successful
application of logical thought is more satisfying for the players and,
arguably, what hard–science games are all about.

Certain kinds of technology are usually downplayed in Traveller.
These include, but are not limited to, cybertechnology and neural/
physical enhancements, nanotechnology and 'magical' technologies
like hard holograms. The latter might be possible at extremely high
technologies but for the most part Traveller takes the view that
holograms are just light. You can see them, and hear the sounds
that go with them, but you cannot create an artificial world with
them. This varies from Referee to Referee of course. Some like the
idea of holo–adventures; others do not.
The same goes for force fields and related technologies. High
technology levels in Traveller do permit repulsor and, eventually,
tractor beam units but there are no personal force fields or similar
items common in many other science fiction settings. These things
can make life a bit too easy for adventurers, and nobody wants
that. Even psionic teleportation, rare as it is, has severe restrictions
regarding how far a character can go with it.
This means that instead of teleporting from place to place, slapping
forcefields over hull breaches or using them to contain intruders,
and sticking a tractor beam on a distressed vessel to pull it to safety,
Traveller characters have to do everything the hard way. Ground to
orbit travel is by shuttle or landing the ship. Boarders are repelled
with guns and blades. Hull breaches are manually patched while the
air blasts out around your ears. And if you want to tow something,
you have to go over there and manually attach a line.
This is a good thing. Traveller is about 'people doing stuff'. Traveller
adventures should center on the characters, not the technology they
use. Anyone can push a button and tractor the distressed shuttle to
safety or build a gizmo to fix the escaped nuclear particle problem
in engineering. It takes a hero to don a vacc suit and leap across
the gap to haul the crew out of their wrecked shuttle, or to climb
carefully past the venting coolant pipes as the radiation counter
creeps towards a lethal dose.
As to cybertech and nanotechnology, the general assumption is that
they are present but not the focus of an adventure. A given Referee's
Traveller universe may make use of neural jacking and cyberware, but
once again it is far less interesting to jack into a computer system
from a motel somewhere and obtain the necessary information than
to creep into a hostile area and physically access the computers
there.
Nanotechnology is also best downplayed, as it can result in a rather
dull game universe, or at least one where the characters are not
captains of their own fate. A short–term nanotech virus shield
that allows characters to enter a quarantine zone to perform their
mission sounds like a useful plot device, and incidentally imposes a
'clock' on the characters. Total immunity to disease due to nanotech,
or the ability to gulp down nanotech 'healing potions' to quick–fix
combat damage are outside the mainstream Traveller experience.
That is not to say that your games cannot run like that, merely that
the baseline Traveller universe does not use these things.
Apart from anything else, some technologies make the setting less
fun. There is no need to undertake interstellar commerce if anything
needed can be easily produced by nanites. Characters can become
more or less redundant in a universe where their ship is fixed by
nanobots every time they crash it or get shot at, or where the super–
smart ship's computer can handle the crew's jobs. What is left for
the characters to do in such a universe? They will find something, no
doubt, but a universe where people have to do things for themselves
has so many more opportunities for adventure.
Worlds as Adventure Settings
Spinward Marches sector contains over 400 star systems. Each of
them has a mainworld with its own characteristics, and while it is
possible for two mainworlds to have the same UWP code, these two
planets will not actually be identical.
The UWP code is merely a starting point. Two worlds with the
same size, atmosphere and hydrographics codes can still be very
different from one another. Slight variations in orbital eccentricity or
distance can create very different conditions on–planet. One might
be a garden world while the other is hammered by raging storms on
a regular basis.
However, even within a given world there will be considerable
variance. Only in Hollywood are there desert worlds, forest worlds,
ice planets and so forth. Most worlds will have a range of terrain
with mountains, plains and swampy areas being present even on
a heavily forested world. A desert planet is unlikely to be 100% dry.
There may be oases, regions of scrubby semi–desert and the like.
Similarly a water world may be totally covered by water, but is likely
to have some islands and even small continents poking up above
the surface.
The general characteristics of a planet are only a guideline. However,
much can be inferred from these characteristics. On a world with a
thin atmosphere, erosion due to wind effects will not be so great,
which might lead to higher or sharper–edged mountains than
somewhere with denser air. Less erosion means less particles to
form part of the soil, which could imply a less fertile world than
might otherwise be the case. Vegetation might be taller and more
slender if there is less air movement to drag at large plants. This is
even more likely if the world has lower than standard gravity, which
is generally the case with smaller worlds.
Much the same comments apply to the social characteristics of a
UWP (Population, government and law level). One democracy is
not necessarily like another, for example. Note that the government
code is simply the one that best fit, chosen from a list by a survey
team and possibly not updated in a very long time. Even when the
code is accurate, it may be misleading.
For example, travellers may visit a world listed as a dictatorship, to
find that in fact the 'dictator' is in fact a figurehead monarch who
carries out state functions and ratifies the democratically elected
government as a nicety of law. Although the world calls itself a
kingdom and has an actual king, leading the survey team to enter it
in the database as a dictatorship, it does not function as one.

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^125

This works the other way around, too. What is theoretically a
republic might be a dictatorship in all but name, or might have
such a restricted voting class that it is more of a oligarchy than a
democratic state. Until the travellers have visited a world and lived
amongst its people they will not really understand how its society
works and will miss the more subtle nuances.

As a general rule higher law levels tend to be associated with
police states and other oppressive societies, however this is not
always the case. Some democratic and very pleasant societies have
immense bodies of law and regulations for virtually everything. Nor
does the amount of restrictions in place entirely indicate the level
of enforcement. On some high–law worlds many infractions are
routinely ignored or are enforced in a patchy fashion by overworked
or corrupt police forces.

Low law level generally indicates that there are not many restrictions
in place, but it could be that those few that exist all carry huge
penalties. Zero law is not the same thing as tolerance for any kind
of behaviour. People are not suicidally stupid; they may have no
laws against people marching down the main street in powered
armor armed with advanced military weapons, but if it seems
likely that someone is going to start randomly shooting people or
taking property away from others ('It's not stealing if there's no law,
right?') then they may encounter a very robust response.

Zero law can occur in different ways and mean entirely different
things. Some places are genuine and voluntary anarchies or are
frontier societies with no formal law or enforcement system. In
such places it may well be accepted that nobody has a right to give
orders to anyone else. However, most such places have a 'code' of
some kind and this normally includes respect for property and other
people. Going outside the range of acceptable behaviour may not
be illegal but it may result in the whole town turning against the
character, running him out of town at gunpoint if he is lucky.

Alternatively, law and order might have broken down, in which case
there normally will be an unofficial system in place, amounting to gun
law – those with the most and best–armed followers can dictate what
others may or may not do. Such places tend to be dangerous but
are ultimately self–correcting in many cases. Whoever emerges on
top in the lawless period will usually set some rules and in time this
becomes the new body of law, however rough and ready it may be.

A world's population digit gives an indication of the amount of
people on a planet, but little more than that. It is not possible to tell
from a UWP code how the population is distributed. A population in
the tens of millions is normally required for a significant industrial
base if it is distributed over a reasonable area. However, a world
with half a million people living in the immediate area of the
starport, and virtually no–one else on the entire rest of the planet,
could support a reasonable amount of industry and perhaps make
some money on exports.

On the other hand, a hundred million people living in scattered
villages all across the planetary surface would not be able to produce
much, nor undertake large–scale projects. However, they would
not usually need to; local craftsmen should be sufficient to keep a
small town running. Only when large numbers of people begin to
concentrate in one place are great works needed.

The population code is to some extent a guideline only. It normally
lists only the permanent population. Transient workers, the personnel
and dependants of an offworld–run Starport or an Imperial base,
and similar non–permanent residents, are not counted for purposes
of the UWP listing. Nor, sometimes, are the members of a minor
race sharing the world with the listed population.

There may also be other groups either missed by the survey or not
significant enough to include. A population of even a few hundred
million people will not entirely fill up a planet, and there may be small
populations in remote areas. These could be anything: dissidents,
a corporate mining operation, a religious group seeking seclusion,
unlicensed colonists carving out a home for themselves or anything
else the Referee wants to use.

Thus it is possible to set many different adventures on a world,
often in very different circumstances. On 21st–Century Terra, it
would be possible to become involved with the seedy underworld of
an industrial city, undertake archaeological work in an unpopulated

(^126) AAADDVENTURINGDVVEENNTTUURRIINNGG
outback region, search for ruins in a rain forest, rescue the crew
of a sinking nautical vessel, explore the ice caps, become involved
in the struggles of outback farmers, fight in a war between rival
factions in a previously civilised area, and to have all manner of
other adventures, each in a different setting.
There is a tendency among players to be blinded by the UWP, and
to treat each dot on the star system hex map as a single location.
Many times adventurers visit a world and have an adventure there,
then move on thinking they have 'done' that world. To do so is to
miss out on the vast potential that each star system offers. There is,
after all, only so much information that can be conveyed by a UWP
code and the closer the adventurers get to something, the more
detail emerges.
A UWP code or a three–line guidebook entry is sufficient to get
an overview of a place from a couple of parsecs away, but it is not
until the place is fleshed out by the Referee and experienced by the
players that its true character begins to emerge.
Star Systems As Adventure Settings
The mainworld, varied as it is as an adventure setting, is not the only
possible one. The whole of the star system can be used.
There will generally only be one habitable world in any given system,
and that world will dominate the immediate area around it if
orbital craft or space vessels are available. Thus any moons of the
mainworld, as well as orbital stations and the Highport, if any, will
be closely associated with the mainworld. Commercial and scientific
installations, mining colonies, military bases and similar facilities are
likely to be set up on a world's moons. It is not uncommon to mount
tracking stations and missile or other weapon platforms on a moon.
However, further out in the system, different conditions apply.
Gas giants, if any are present, may have several moons that can
be colonized. There may be one or more planetoid belts, and the
presence of rocky planets is likely in most systems. Each of these
places can be home to an installation of some kind, and can be an
adventure setting even if there is no population.
High–technology mainworlds with an extensive system defence
flotilla tend to control their entire system, with colonies and outposts
on the various bodies. Lower–tech worlds not only cannot colonize
these bodies, but are unable to stop anyone else from doing so.
Thus there may be populations of Belters and/or corporate mining
vessels working a belt or the moons of a gas giant. A rocky planet or
a moon could be home to an entirely separate culture from that of
the mainworld, or could be the site of a base owned and operated
by the Imperial military or a Megacorporation.
Other installations are also possible, such as independent freeports
set up deep in the outsystem. Corsair bases or secret research
installations may be concealed in a planetoid belt or out in the Oort
Cloud, the shell of planetoids and comets that surrounds many star
systems at truly vast distances.
Even without a current population, a moon or asteroid could be
the site for an adventure. Ancient ruins, wrecked starships or just
the chance to strike it rich with a mineral claim could all bring
adventurers to an otherwise overlooked location.
Some star systems contain more than one star, and occasionally
these companion stars have objects orbiting them. A planet more
habitable than the mainworld is unlikely, as this would probably
have been settled instead. However, there may be gas giants (with
or without moons), planetoids and rocky planets in the 'companion'
system, though often there is little more than a few comets. Many of
these companion systems are uninhabited, but they do make good
places to hide precisely because they are off the beaten track, and
there is no way to tell what may be concealed there.
There is one other possible adventure setting within any star
system – a starship. An entire adventure can unfold aboard a
ship in Jumpspace or within a star system. The former is good for
pressure–cooker adventures in a closed environment. Other ships
can be a source of rumors and general chit–chat, or opponents
in space combat. And of course an adventure can be set aboard a
drifting derelict.
Note that most of the traffic in a star system is concentrated around
the starport and the mainworld, with ships running out to the safe
100–diameter limit and entering Jump to their next destination.
In a busy system with a good port, this volume of space usually
contains several ships and many small craft at any one time. These
may include port utility craft, patrol vessels and commercial traffic
using the port. Lower–quality ports do not see the same volume of
traffic; local space may be empty for days or weeks on end over a
Class D port.
However, there is not usually much incentive to go elsewhere in
the system. Many outsystem moons and planets are sufficiently far
out that it would take days or even weeks to get there in normal
space, and ships equipped with Jump drives can get somewhere
more interesting in the time it takes to reach an outsystem location

- a Jump takes a week even if it covers less than a single parsec.

Thus only vessels with business in the outsystem go there. Patrol
craft and vessels serving the outsystem installations, if any exist,
have a reason to be out there. Few other vessels do. Thus systems
with extensive outsystem mining operations or colonies may have
regular normal–space shipping lanes served by in–system freighters
and protected by patrol craft.

Unless there is some obvious reason for being in the outsystem, a
vessel's presence there is often seen as suspicious by patrol ships.
It is always possible (though unlikely) to encounter an Imperial
Navy vessel making a sweep of the outsystem region as part of a
patrol deployment.

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^127

However, the distances between bodies in the outsystem (with
the obvious exceptions being moons of the same gas giant and
planetoids close together in the same belt) are such that an
encounter is unlikely. Equally, a vessel that gets into difficulty in this
remote region will be lucky if anyone is in range to effect a rescue.
The outsystem is a lonely place.

Ships can find themselves in the outsystem as a result of a Misjump
or a badly calculated Jump. The former can also deposit a ship into
deep space, into the vast gulf between star systems. If the drive
is still functioning and the ships has fuel for another Jump, this is
a problem that can be overcome. However, most ships only carry
fuel for one Jump. A vessel stranded in deep space without fuel is
doomed, far more often than not.

It is possible to obtain fuel in deep space. A comet or rogue planet
could be used as a source of ice, which is then cracked for hydrogen.
However, the chances of coming out of Jump within range of such a
body might as well be nil unless its coordinates were known ahead
of time. Similarly, while deep space refuelling points have been used
by the Navy and by explorers for centuries, if their location is not
known they might as well not be there – it is almost inconceivably
unlikely that a ship could accidentally stumble upon such a site.

Hazards, Encounters and Opposition
The dangers a group of travellers may face can be subdivided into
three general types – hazards, encounters and opposition. Hazards
are impersonal threats such as those posed by the environment.
Opposition means people actively trying to impede the group by
various means. Encounters fall somewhere in between; depending
on how the group handles the incident it may be dangerous, helpful,
inconvenient or inconsequential.

The most obvious hazards are environmental. Characters can
hurt themselves falling off or onto things. They can be burned or
frozen, starved or drowned. Vacuum and toxic atmospheres can kill
unprotected characters. Then there is radiation to consider and a
whole range of biological and chemical hazards.

Most environmental dangers can be overcome by the use of good
equipment and caution, but environmental details can be used to
make the adventure experience richer. A gunfight is one thing. A
gunfight inside an ATV which is sinking through melting ice on a
toxic–atmosphere planet is significantly more interesting. Climbing
a cliff is not usually a problem, but what about doing it in vacuum?

Whenever the characters are forced to use suits or breathing
apparatus, the risk of suit damage adds an extra layer of suspense
to an adventure, and the finite nature of air supply is a good 'clock'
to keep the adventure moving. Conflict can be provoked by putting
the characters in a position where they have almost, but not quite,
enough life support equipment for everyone.

Other hazards can be used to endanger the group or to direct (or
misdirect) them. A landslide or dust storm may not cause any
casualties but it may cause the team to become lost. Or it could
be combined with the air–clock idea to force the travellers to do
something they otherwise might not. Since the landslide has blocked
the easy path back to the ship, it will now take longer than the team
has air remaining to get back, however up ahead is what appears to
be a hatch in the ravine side...

Opposition can take the form of hordes of wild–eyed savages
leaping out of the bushes at the travellers or animals that decide
to turn hostile for whatever reason. However, opposition can be
much more subtle than this. In a technological and civilised society,
someone who wants to can cause severe trouble for an adventuring
band by all kinds of non–physical means.

Characters can be impeded by nit–picky customs checks, law
enforcement harassment, suspension of permits and licenses, or
refusal to issue necessary documentation. These things can happen
anyway, but an enemy who knows how to work the system can use
it against the travellers to great effect.

This can be a useful plot device too, forcing characters to leave town
ahead of the law after a false accusation or revelation of something
they thought was buried and forgotten. A permit necessary to
complete one goal may be offered in return for a different service, or
criminal charges (trumped–up or entirely real) might be dropped in
return for making some other problem quietly go away.

For shipowners with a cargo to deliver, delay can be devastating.
The threat of a lawsuit or a similar reason why the characters' ship
will have to stay in port until the matter is resolved can be a potent
one as a commercial ship sitting on the ground is haemorrhaging
money even if cargoes and passengers are not lost to vessels that
are actually going to be taking off sometime soon.

Opposition of this sort is particularly frustrating as often the
characters cannot get at the people responsible, even if they know
who is behind the matter. Finding out and taking revenge or
removing the obstacle can become a major character motivation,
causing the players to generate plots on behalf of the Referee.

Legal and administrative opposition has one other advantage for the
'bad guys'; their dirty work is done by innocent cops, port workers
and customs officials. If the characters take the direct approach and
try to intimidate these people or simply shoot them, they will come
into conflict with law enforcement, port authority security and maybe
even the planetary army or the Imperial Marine Corps. Even if they
survive the results, this creates new problems for the travellers with
no effort needed on the part of their enemies. If the Travellers are on
a Ministry of Justice 'most wanted' list and the Navy is searching for
their ship, their task (whatever it is) becomes virtually impossible.

(^128) AAADDVENTURINGDVVEENNTTUURRIINNGG
Dealing with this sort of opposition requires more than skills with
weapons. The characters must tread carefully, collect information,
and figure out how to thwart their enemy or at least get him off the
case without running afoul of the legal system.
Encounters are not always negative. The characters may see
wildlife or interact with people without any problems occurring.
Many encounters provide useful information or are at worst mildly
irritating. However, much depends upon how the characters
approach the situation.
Some encounters can turn into natural hazards. For example,
a stream is not normally much of a problem for an ATV, but if
the characters recklessly charge into it at great speed (perhaps
pursuing another vehicle or trying to escape from something) they
may manage to crash their vehicle or find a deep bit and end up
being swept downstream (ATVs are designed to float) towards a
waterfall.
Similarly most animals will not attack a human unless provoked,
frightened or challenged. Characters who insist on shooting at the
local wildlife may be recognized as a threat and attacked by some
creatures or may attract predators to the sounds of their victims'
distress. It is often possible to avoid conflict with animals or frighten
them off with noise, fire or simply by waving one's arms about.
Characters who are not paying attention may blunder into the lair
of a concealed creature or find that they have managed to corner
a savage predator without meaning to. A little bit of research at a
handy data terminal can help avoid such problems, but characters
who insist on crashing about in the backwoods with no regard to
what they might find will sometimes run into trouble.
The most likely encounters to turn nasty, however, are those
involving people. Most of the folks encountered by the travellers will
be fairly neutral towards them and will react to what they do or say.
Most people will be wary of a band of armed strangers wandering
around and trust takes time to build, but a little simple courtesy
and respect for local customs can help a lot in avoiding trouble
and obtaining cooperation. Characters sometimes forget this and
upset the people they meet – often the only consequence of this is
an increase in the locals' antipathy towards offworlders... but not
always.
The people met by the travellers should respond to what they do
and say in a logical fashion. If the characters give offence and
seem well armed or likely to turn violent, locals are more likely to
disengage and call the cops or get their gun than engage in suicidal
lone attacks. Most people will be unwilling to get involved in a fight

- armed or otherwise – but may try to use intimidation. This could
lead to escalation, of course, and as soon as the travellers start
threatening locals with weapons, things are liable to turn nasty.

Traveller does not concern itself unduly with concepts like 'play
balance'. Instead, the opposition that presents itself will be logical –
though things will not always be exactly as the players suppose. This
means that if the characters attack an isolated farm for some reason
they are likely to be dealing with a bunch of surprised, frightened
and untrained civilians armed with whatever is to hand; possibly
a shotgun or rifle or two at best. However, the farm might be the
retirement grant of an ex–Imperial Army corporal, who also retained
his Advanced Combat Rifle.

A fair way to deal with this sort of thing, if it happens at random, is
for the Referee to decide what the likely level of opposition would be
and then secretly roll two dice. The dice give the answer to a question.
In this case the question is 'how dangerous is this situation?'

A roll of near to 7 means that the situation is more or less as would
be expected. Low is 'less' and high is 'more'. So on a result of 3 on
this roll, the opposition is totally clueless and panics at the first sign
of trouble. An 11, on the other hand, suggests that this is indeed the
home of Corporal Deadly, ex–army trooper turned survivalist and
his family, who he has armed and trained to deal with intruders.
This should not be taken to silly extremes but it does provide a fair
way to determine a suitable level of opposition.

If the players are not smart enough to figure out when they are out
matched and to either find a way to win or else to disengage, they
can take the consequences. Similarly, stupid actions will result in
potentially fatal consequences. It may indeed be possible to get
through customs by walking through with a live grenade held with
the pin out, but the character doing this is not going to be allowed
to get away with it.

Exactly what the response might be depends on the world's law
and tech levels, and a range of other factors that can be abstracted
by using the above dice throw method. There will be some sort of
response though, and it will be logical, not play–balanced. This means
that the first responders may well be a couple of ill–trained rookie
cops with sidearms they barely know how to us, but if the travellers
refuse to surrender to them, they will face an escalating response
that may end up involving military forces. No world government will
allow itself to be faced down by a bunch of adventurers.

This is an important facet of the Traveller setting – actions have
consequences, and drawing weapons is not always a viable solution.
This is a good thing for the game in many ways as it closes off some
direct avenues and forces the players to think of alternative solutions
rather than simply reaching for their guns.

Overall it is a good idea to mix different problems in an adventure:
questions to be solved by logical deduction, some straight–out bad
guys out to get the characters, shadowy figures throwing legal and
administrative obstacles in the way, and a few natural hazards to
fall off of, be crushed under or burned by. This keeps the characters
guessing what is going to happen next and prevents them becoming

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^129

too focused on a certain type of problem. Add to this the ability of
many characters to make even a simple encounter go badly wrong,
and the travellers will be up against a serious challenge.

###### CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MARCHES

In a region of over 400 star systems, there is always something
going on somewhere. However, the majority of these events,
however life–altering they may be at the local level, are of no great
consequence in the wider universe. For example, the efforts of the
Tanoose Freedom League on Garda–Vilis in Vilis subsector are of
extreme importance locally but are scarcely even known about on
Lanth, a subsector away.

However, some events are of greater importance and may affect
people all across the Marches. These events may serve as background
to an adventure or the focus of one. Alternatively characters may
find themselves on the periphery of great events, for example being
hired to transport starship spares to repair a rival vessel sabotaged
by McClellan Factors agents.

Agitation, Dissent and Terrorism
Most worlds have at least one faction that is in dispute with the
world government or with big business. Most of these groups are
careful to proclaim their basic loyalty to the Imperium, though there
are anti–Imperial groups of course. A certain amount of dissent is
acceptable to the Imperium and different world governments have
their own views about free speech, the right to protest and so forth.

The Imperium only becomes directly involved when local resources
cannot handle the problem and the dissenting group threatens
the security or best interests of the Imperium, or sometimes when
a world facing internal problems requests help via its Imperial
representative. This is not always granted; worlds are free to govern
themselves and that includes failing to deal with dissent caused
by their own ineffective policies. It is not in the interests of the
Imperium to have world governments collapse, so some measure
of support and assistance may well be offered.

Some threats are considered significant enough to require a broader
response. Among these is the Ine Givar, a terrorist group of unknown
size dedicated to wrecking the Imperium. This is a rather large goal,
but the Ine Givar are prepared to fight a long battle if necessary.

Ine Givar methods vary, and they work through a variety of front
organizations. Some of these are legal and act as support networks,
gathering information and funds, and providing a cover for the active
cells to use when moving around. Others are overtly anti–Imperial
but take the guise of honorable 'freedom fighters' and 'resistance
movements' rather than terrorists. This is a useful cover as there
are many dissident groups and active rebellions that would never
deal with terrorists but are willing to accept help from similarly
inclined fellow revolutionaries. These fronts allow other groups to
be manipulated into working towards the ends of the Ine Givar.

Accusations have been made that the Ine Givar is itself a front for the
intelligence services of the Zhodani Consulate, though this has never
been proven. What is known is that the organization is widespread,
with cells on many worlds. These are well compartmentalised, with
new members given no useful information until they have proven
themselves.

While some of its front groups use only economic or irregular
military tactics, that is they do not terrorise the population the
Ine Givar as a whole is entirely willing to kill civilians. This is not
indiscriminate; that would alienate the people that the organization
hopes to win over. Instead the organization generally targets
establishment figures and those who support the Imperium. The
Ine Givar is willing to blow up a school bus if it contains the children
of Imperial personnel, but always tries to spin its attacks as 'made
necessary by illegal Imperial occupation of our world'.

The Ine Givar is dangerous because it is both local and widespread.
That is, it has considerable resources and can reach areas thought
to be safe. On the other hand, its personnel are local and in tune
with the mood of the population. The organization always presents
itself as fighting for freedom on behalf of the oppressed population,
and this propaganda comes not from a distant source but from
people who live and work in the same conditions. The grievances
that the Ine Givar cites may be hugely overplayed but they do have
their roots in reality.

(^130) AAADDVENTURINGDVVEENNTTUURRIINNGG
Travellers can become involved in many ways. They may be at a
frontier starport when Ine Givar terrorists take it over, fighting from
the inside as local law enforcement stands around ineffectually
outside. Or they may make useful contacts who put well–paid,
semi–legitimate work their way (such as smuggling), only to later
discover that they have been running guns to a terrorist cell... or
that their contact has been exposed as an Ine Givar agent and the
authorities are now looking for everyone he dealt with.
Arden: A Rising Star?
The Federation of Arden is something of a wild card in the affairs
of the Spinward Marches. On the face of it, the concept is easy to
dismiss. A single TL8 world, trying to forge an interstellar alliance,
is hardly a threat to the stability of the region. Closer inspection
reveals a rather more serious situation.
Arden is working towards acquiring a small TL9 industrial base to
allow the construction of Jump–capable vessels, but in the meantime
starships can be obtained offworld. Much more important is the
fact that Arden's position between the Imperium and the Zhodani
Consulate could be of great significance in any future conflict. Jump–
4 is the standard for many navies' warships, and Zhodani jump–4
ships could refuel at Arden and be in the Denotam system before
the Imperials knew they had left their bases in Querion subsector.
While this scenario is not likely, it is a potential threat and the
Imperium would prefer that the option to hit a naval base and cut the
communications link to Vilis in a surprise attack were not available
to the Consulate. Relations between Arden and the Consulate are
watched closely.
At present the Federation of Arden is a political alliance based on
Arden rather than a formal polity made up of world governments.
However, some local world governments are coming under the
influence of Arden–based diplomats and businesses, and there is a
steady creep towards the formation of a political entity.
Travellers could become involved with Arden in various ways. The
Federation always has a use for more starships and their crews, and
might offer a subsidy to a vessel for nothing more than economic
flag–showing. This would take the form of displaying allegiance to
the Federation while conducting normal trading operations in the
region. Ships might also be chartered on generous terms to carry out
personnel transportation or freighting missions for the Federation.
These would likely be quite legal, at least at first. Characters could
also become involved in a Federation–backed coup attempt or an
attack on Federation installations by local groups opposed to the
increasing amount of control that Arden has over their affairs.
Border Troubles
The Marches contain the Imperial border with two potentially hostile
states (not counting Arden). Wars have been fought with the Sword
Worlds and the Zhodani Consulate in the past, and tensions are
still present.
Neither the Zhodani Consulate, the Sword Worlds Confederation
nor the Third Imperium are stupid enough to want a war, nor to do
anything that will deliberately cause one. However each will, in the
pursuit of its interests, push the others somewhat and will engage
in brinkmanship from time to time, working on the assumption
that the other party does not want war either, and will grant small
concessions rather than fight a big war. This cuts both ways (or all
three ways; four if you count the Darrians) and can result in the
border zones being very tense at times.
Shipping is sometimes restricted and foreign vessels may be held
in port during a crisis. This can also precipitate a situation, where a
vessel is held for legitimate reasons such as contraband being found
aboard, but the state where it is registered decides to make an issue
of the matter because it does not want a precedent set whereby
foreigners can interfere with the navigation rights of vessels.
Of course, none of the regional powers is a monolithic organization,
especially not the Sword Worlds. As a result there may be factions
who actually do want a war, or who will pursue their own agenda
without regard to the 'big picture'. Incidents are fairly common,
creating a full–time job for diplomats and nobles as they try to keep
the peace without giving away too much. This sometimes requires
covert black–ops missions to deal with a situation that cannot be
publicly acknowledged, let alone handled.
There are also numerous 'haters' in the mix. One example is an
ex–Imperial Navy officer who lost comrades to Zhodani action
in the Fourth Frontier War and now leads a raider group striking
across the border at the enemy. They are not pirates though, never
that. They are simply carrying on the war that everybody else has
forgotten about and funding it with the proceeds of their missions,
because the politicians will not do a thing to help...
People of this kind are sometimes regarded as heroes by others who
live on the border and have reasons to resent old enemies. They tend
to regard anyone who is not with them as an enemy sympathiser and
are dangerous to the stability of the region. But the Imperium must
tread carefully in dealing with these people because acting against
them can be seen as acting for the 'enemy'. And there are those who
think that such groups are covertly approved by the Imperial nobility
since they cause damage to historical and potentially future enemies.
It suits the purposes of foreign diplomats to say they believe this,
too. Note that the Zhodani Consulate has far less 'haters' than the
Imperium or the Sword Worlders.
There are also significant tensions between the Darrians and the
Sword Worlders, not least over the ownership of the Entropic
Worlds. Matters are not helped by the huge cultural differences
between the two states, which leads to considerable racial tension
even when there is no specific reason for conflict. It seems likely that
the Darrians will try to reclaim what they see as their worlds at some
point. This could be a flashpoint for renewed war in the Marches, so
the Imperium urges restraint. This in turn strains relations between
the Darrian Confederation and the Imperium, though not hugely.

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^131

Travellers operating in the border region can run afoul of all kinds of
trouble caused by incidents they have no control over or did not even
know about, but there are opportunities too. 'Hater' groups need
weapons and supplies, and will pay well for military–grade supplies.
Meanwhile the authorities may want information on haters on their
own side, and may offer a bounty for bringing down foreign ones so
long as the whole business is officially deniable.

There are also numerous possibilities for adventure as a result of
invasion scares, heightened border tensions, covert infiltration
missions and other events short of all–out war. A major conflict
between the Imperium and its neighbors would cause serious
changes to the setting and would go on for some time, but a
shooting incident on the border, with diplomats frantically trying
to sort out what happened and avert war, could be the backdrop for
some exciting adventures without causing long–term changes.

Cold War in District 268
Trexalon and Collace have for many years now been involved in
a cold war. This started out as a cooling of relations caused by
differing attitudes towards the prospect of Imperial expansion into
District 268, but has now reached the point of outright enmity. Both
worlds routinely blacken the other's reputation with propaganda,
yet officially claim that relations are cordial and that there is nothing
more going on than a perfectly understandable difference in
viewpoints.

In practice, there is a war going on in District 268. It is mainly
fought in courtrooms and stock markets, by means of legal writs
and economic gambits, but the occasional covert operation by
black–ops units has occurred.

Both Collace and Trexalon have the same aim; to increase their own
influence and reduce that of the opposition. Aid and assistance
packages have been offered to surrounding worlds, while business
efforts by firms aligned with the opposition are frequently derailed
by the use of influence or less legal means.

Collace has the advantage of being friendly to the immensely powerful
Imperium, but this also places restrictions on what Collace can get
caught doing. Collace must be seen to play at least somewhat fair,
or at a minimum to only do what is justified by Trexalon's actions.
Many of Collace's long–term plans involve putting Trexalon in a
position where her agents must do something that the Imperium
will disapprove of, thus clearing the way for more direct action that
is now seen as justified.

Trexalon, while somewhat freer to undertake whatever actions seem
appropriate, must avoid triggering an Imperial response which it
could not survive. Actions must be deniable or taken against third
parties. Collace itself is sometimes a viable target and sometimes
not, depending on the political situation in the Imperium.

Direct military action is out of the question, and probably pointless
anyway. Even if Collace could somehow be taken out of the equation,
some other pro–imperial world would emerge to take on the mantle
of subsector–capital–in–waiting. The goal for Trexalon is to keep the
Imperium out, not to get one over on Collace.

In addition to trying to sway political opinion and interfering in
Collace business, Trexalon is rumored to be backing pirates. If this
is true it is a very serious matter, and one that will trigger Imperial
intervention if proven. However, at present there are simply some
pointed fingers and persistent rumors. The theory is that Trexalon
is diverting spare starship parts to a secret raider base or bases
somewhere in the subsector, in return for an agreement that
the raiders will hit pro–Imperial worlds and shipping bound for
Collace.

Travellers could get caught in the middle of the District 268 cold war
in several ways. They might be engaged to investigate the activities
of one side or the other, or perhaps encounter pirates working in
conjunction with Trexalon. Their ship might be stuck in port due to
the machinations of one world, and freed to proceed by the other in
return for a favor later on. There is no telling when an apparently
independent contact might not turn out to be an agent of one side
or the other, which in turn could lead to the characters having to
find out why their friend has been murdered, abducted or suddenly
wants nothing more to do with them.

Expansion and Colonization
The large Imperial corporations are always seeking new markets or
favorable places to put new facilities. This results in a steady creep
outward from the Imperial core and other centres of Megacorporate
power.

Corporations and Megacorporations sometimes move onto a world
by taking over existing industrial or financial installations, or by
building new ones at the existing cities. At other times they may
set up an operation in a remote area of the mainworld or in the
outsystem. This is more applicable to mining and heavy–industrial
facilities than financial institutions, of course. These installations
are often surrounded by a purpose–built town for employees.

Normally, a corporation that moves onto a world will pay taxes
and other fees to the local government, which can make attracting
Megacorporate investment in a new facility a very good thing for the
local economy, especially on backwater worlds with little money to
invest in their own economy.

However, this situation is not always to the liking of the local
government or population. On many frontier worlds and outside
the Imperium, the corporations play fast and loose with the rules. A
'world government' that actually rules only a few thousand people in
a small corner of the planet can do little about a major corporation
that sets up a mining base containing a town with hundreds of
employees in it, on an entirely different continent. While illegal in
the Imperium, outside the borders such rules do not apply.

(^132) AAADDVENTURINGDVVEENNTTUURRIINNGG
New industrial and financial facilities need communications to serve
them, and there is a gradual move towards investment in starports,
especially on the Spinward Main where the volume of traffic is
sufficient to make a good port a lucrative investment. Of course,
better ports tend to be soon followed by larger ships operated by
bigger companies, causing the smaller operators to move on to
more marginal routes where they can still compete.
This phenomenon has been referred to as 'corporation creep' and is
a natural consequence of a developing economy in a given region.
The Imperium as a whole benefits from such improvements in the
economic situation, but it can be bad for local businesses and even
the economies of whole worlds.
The Imperium is also involved in a certain amount of colonization
work, or at least, groups originating within the Imperium are
currently undertaking expansion. Some of this is happening within
the Imperium, either on reserve worlds or on low–population
planets whose government has agreed (or been induced) to allow
immigrants. There is also some colonization ongoing beyond the
Imperium. This is potentially a ticklish situation, as treaties with
the Zhodani Consulate ceded many worlds to the Zhodani area of
influence, and officially condoning colonization of worlds in Querion
subsector, for example, by imperial groups would be a violation of
the treaties.
In other areas there are no such restrictions in place, but colonization
is still a potential source of conflict as the new arrivals come into
conflict with the locals. The Colonial Office tries to keep control of
such efforts or discourage them completely, but it cannot always be
successful.
Thus while colonization within the Imperium is fairly well regulated,
operations beyond the border are more chaotic. Corporate
colonization for commercial purposes is undertaken with careful
planning and good support for the mission and many private
missions are well enough supplied and funded to have a good
chance at success. However, there are plenty of land–seekers who,
whether through over–optimizm or lack of understanding of what
is involved, are prepared to launch half–baked land grabs and hope
for the best.
Commercial expansion, whether colonial or economic in nature,
can result in considerable resentment among the local population.
Travellers might be dragged into a guerrilla war between corporate
mercs defending an installation and locals who want it gone.
Alternatively they might be hired to conduct an advance survey for a
prospective installation. Perhaps the backing corporation does not
want its rivals to know it is interested in the site.
Ad–hoc colonial expansion spawns all manner of adventure
possibilities. A failing colony might desperately need a shipment
which rivals are trying to delay, or the travellers might actually be
part of the colonial expedition. The early years of a new colony are a
time of intense activity and there will always be work for resourceful
and skilled individuals who can help fill the inevitable skills gap
created when a small–scale operation takes on a huge task like the
colonization of an entire world.
Imperial Politics
The politics of the Imperium are extremely complex, and even in a
smaller region like the Marches there is plenty of internal tension
and political manoeuvring going on at any given time. There are
many noble houses, each with its own agenda. Some are in direct
conflict or dispute with their rivals whilst others are affiliated
to or own business interests which bring them into conflict with
Megacorporations or world governments. As a rule, intrigue and
industrial espionage are more common than large–scale violence
in such disputes.
On a grander scale, there is a high–level dispute ongoing in the
Marches which can spill over into other affairs. The 'Mora–Regina
Split' as it is known has to do with how the sector is governed and
defended. Ironically, the 'Regina' faction, headed by Duke Norris of
Regina, wants the fleet pulled back from the border and concentrated
in a rear position near Mora, while the 'Mora' faction wants to keep
most of the heavy units well forward in the border region, including
the area around Regina.

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^133

The dispute is much deeper than whether a 'crust' or 'elastic'
defence strategy is most appropriate, however. The Regina faction,
which has supporters all over the sector and especially in less
developed regions, maintains that resources, investment and
military assets are all unfairly concentrated around Mora, while
the Mora faction dismisses this as a pointless quibble. Mora and
Trin are more developed than Regina and Jewell because that's how
history happened, say the Mora–ites, and the provincials should
spend more time on managing their investments better and less
on moaning about a situation that developed as a consequence of
simple economics.

The Regina faction seems determined to cause trouble, however.
The latest issue is a campaign to persuade the Emperor to name
a Sector Duke, and for it to be one of the provincials. Duke Norris
has already requested the title, according to some sources. This has
caused a deep rift in the Regina faction as other provincial nobles
denounce Norris as an upstart and demand to know why they
should not be considered for the role. Meanwhile Duchess Delphine
of Mora has allegedly agreed to a suggestion by her supporters that
she should perhaps make representations to the Emperor for a
formal investiture in the position of Sector Duke, which she has
held in all but name for many years.

The political wrangle can affect travellers in all kinds of ways.
Political manoeuvring has wrecked several promising naval careers
and caused a number of nobles to be greatly diminished in power
and prestige. Many of these individuals now seek a means to
climb back to prominence or at least get one over on their rivals.
Characters might be caught up in the backlash from their schemes
or play a part in them. Alternatively, the shifting political terrain
might create opportunities for a big score or some kind of disaster
for the travellers.

Mysteries, Enigmas and Rumors
There are a number of large and small mysteries to be uncovered in
the Marches, and rumors of great treasures still awaiting someone
to come along and find them. Some are well–enough known that
there are documentaries or action movies about them while others
are rather less well known.

There are numerous things that bear investigating, from the murder
of an apparently well–liked starport broker to embezzlement
on Imperial Navy supply contracts. Scientific expeditions study
everything from rogue asteroids to the wildlife of the worlds of the
Marches. Safaris visit the same worlds to shoot or photograph these
creatures. There are many mysteries in the Marches, and many
answers just lead to more questions.

The biggest enigma in the Marches is of course the Ancients. There
are plenty of theories about who they were, what they did and
why they went away but hard evidence is almost as rare as certain
facts. What is known is that they left behind a number of sites and
artefacts, and that more turn up from time to time.

The Ancients possessed extremely high technology, and many
adventurers dream of possessing an arsenal of Ancient gadgets
while living off the proceeds of their find. In fact, most of what was
left behind by the Ancients is little more than either rubble or junk.
That anything has survived the millennia at all is remarkable – it is
even more surprising that some of it still works.

Trading in Ancients artefacts is strictly limited by Imperial law,
which requires that any site containing structures, items or other
evidence of the Ancients be immediately reported. A fee of Cr50,000
is payable for finding any site as soon as it is verified, and once
investigation begins the finder can expect additional fees, of much
greater value, depending on what is discovered at the site.

Investigation of many Ancients sites is conducted in great secrecy
under heavy guard by Imperial armed forces, though some sites are
more open. Undergraduates and senior staff from some universities
are routinely sent to investigate some of the less highly classified
sites, though what they find tends to be somewhat mundane for
the most part, and security is still tight. A few sites have been
thoroughly investigated (perhaps without results) and are now open
to the public as museums.

However, it is possible to find previously unknown Ancients sites.
There are always rumors about them, though most turn up to be
spurious, if not outright hoaxes. Even if a site can be found, it may
be nothing more than the smashed remains of a small settlement,
or a crater with some debris scattered around it. Intact installations
are extremely rare.

Slightly more common are objects of various sort. Most could best
be considered curiosities, in that figuring out how to use them or
even what they are for is beyond the human intellect. Of course,
some objects can be made to work (often intermittently, unreliably
and to less than their maximum capabilities) but even then there
may be no way to know without trying a device whether it is a
doomsday bomb or the equivalent to an automated toenail clipper.

Despite this, the mystery of the Ancients continues to mesmerise
people and to lure travellers from across the sector and beyond. A
group that finds evidence that leads to an answer to some of the
big questions about the Ancients could retire on the proceeds, and
even lesser finds are likely to be very valuable. They may also lead to
a world of trouble.

The other common mystery is the 'lost ship'. Some legends are
well known, such as the loss of the INS Kinunir on an apparently
routine cruise in 1088. Documentaries, video dramas and even a
popular song have been made about this vessel, even though no
hard evidence of her fate has ever been found.

Other famous losses include the Amuar, a Leviathan class merchant
cruiser that went missing in the Outrim in 1102 and the Gyro
Cadiz task force, a multiship supply convoy that failed to reach its

(^134) AAADDVENTURINGDVVEENNTTUURRIINNGG
destination in 984, during the Third Frontier War. One ship of the
task force turned up wrecked by hostile action in a system well off
the task force's route. The only clue to the fate of the remainder of
the group was an epic poem written by one of the wrecked ship's
crew, which spoke of shipwreck and a winter spent somewhere
referred to as Twilight's Peak. The Gyro Cadiz' cargo was allegedly
worth a fortune and has never been found.
However, the most well–known rumor about starship losses
concerns the Abyss Rift in Lanth and Vilis subsectors. Numerous
vessels have been lost without trace in that region, and others have
reported anomalous conditions, minor Misjumps and a number of
other strange phenomena which, statistically, make the Abyss Rift
one of the most dangerous regions of space to transit. Despite this,
the legend of 'lost treasure ships of the Abyss Rift' draws bands of
adventurers from time to time.
Travellers can encounter mysteries by accident, stumbling on odd
artefacts or strange places while engaged in some entirely different
endeavor. At other times they may hear a rumor and decide to
investigate. Most such rumors do not lead directly to treasure,
of course. Following a totally false rumor can still lead a group
to adventure and even some unexpected gain, and occasionally a
rumor of this sort does actually lead (by a roundabout and difficult
path) to something good.
Travellers might also become involved in a mystery–related
adventure in other ways. An event may strike the characters as odd
or out of place (see notes earlier about a consistent game universe)
and lead to investigation. Alternatively, the characters might be
hired on as guards, guides or research assistants for an expedition
investigating something. This could be dangerous, and may be fairly
mundane or quite novel. Examples include a scientific expedition
into the mouth of a semi–active volcano, a safari to photograph a
supposedly extinct species that has been spotted or a search for the
grave site of an ancestor on a frontier world. Mysteries do not need
to be huge and universe–changing to be interesting.
Trade War in the Rimward Subsectors
McClellan Factors is the biggest non–Megacorporate Imperial player
in District 268 and is also important in much of the Rimward end of
the Marches. The business group also has interests just beyond the
Marches, in Trojan Reaches subsector to Rimward.
McClellan has been effective in edging out other Imperial business
groups, not least as a result of its partnerships with local (non–
Imperial) businesses. However, the Baraccai Technum, among
other firms, is beginning to make some gains in the region.
There is a great deal of corporate manoeuvring going on behind
the scenes, along with some overt operations. Among these is an
intention by the Baraccai Technum to conduct speculative trade
missions outrim of the Marches, into territory that McClellan views
as its own.
This is an outright challenge and has resulted in a situation only
a little short of an all–out trade war. Trade Wars are legal in the
Imperium, within certain limits, and of course much of the conflict
is taking place outside the Imperium. Overt attacks on shipping
and installations are not an option, if only because this will cause
retaliation in kind which, whether the trade war is won or lost,
will result in heavy financial losses for both sides. That might be
acceptable in a fight for survival, but it does not make good business
sense and this conflict is about money–making opportunities.
There are, however, plenty of other ways to conduct a trade–war
campaign. Both sides are seeking to exploit the Trexalon/Collace
situation and to stir up trouble for the other on various worlds. If
a McClellan facility suffers a serious labour dispute, BT is probably
responsible. Or at least, McClellan will assume so and look for a
way to strike back.
It is not known whether the boards of either business group would
condone working with rebels or pirates, but it seems likely that there will
be ambitious and amoral people somewhere within the management
of each, who are willing to use whatever means necessary to win the
trade war and further their own career into the bargain.
In addition to economic measures like trying to tie customers into
long–term deals that prevent them dealing with the opposition,
both BT and McClellan are currently conducting an underhanded

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^135

campaign of sabotage, troublemaking among the workforce
and interruption of the supply/delivery chain. While blowing up
starships and loading docks may be the most efficient way of doing
this, it is not really an option although there have been a number of
suspicious accidents.

Instead the method used is to strike at various points, none of
which is very serious but which ultimately reduce the ability of the
competition to bring goods to market. Thus a time–critical delivery
of components may be hijacked, key workers hired away, loading
equipment sabotaged and the contracted delivery starship detained
in port a parsec away for three weeks fighting off a spurious legal
challenge.

Although these measures will not kill the opposition's operation
in a given market sector, it will disrupt it and reduce consumer
confidence, hopefully creating an opportunity for a competitor to
steal a chunk of the marketplace.

Travellers can become involved in this dispute in many ways. They
may be hired to sneak into company offices and steal information or
plans that will enable a later strike to be made, or become involved
in a supply–truck hijacking. BT or McClellan might want a group of
adventurers to investigate or deliver something without the opposition
realising they are connected with the trade war. The same group
might be approached by the opposition and asked to do the same
thing. They may even be hired to intercept a covert delivery being
made by an adventurer group... which turns out to be themselves.

This situation could become very complex, with the group at the
center of a web of deceit. They may be able to play off one faction
against the other, or may end up being squashed in the middle.

Vargr, Aslan and Droyne
Most Vargr within the Marches are Imperial citizens and are involved
in all the same sort of activities as other Imperial people. However,
there are groups within the Marches dedicated to various causes,
most notably the advancement of their affiliated states 'back home'
in the Vargr Extents.

Most of these groups are fairly harmless, being concerned with
making a profit from cross–border trade (which includes smuggling
in some cases) or furthering various political agendas in a non–
violent way. There are some downright nasty groups active, mainly
in the Coreward–Trailing corner of the sector. These include piracy
rings and freeport operators that cater to pirates, rebels and
smugglers. Some are independent, some associated with Vargr
political groups and some are part of bands like the Kforuzeng, one
of the largest pirate organizations in the Extents.

Partly as a result of this, and partly because Vargr states from the
Extents formed part of the Outworld Coalition during the Frontier
Wars, many imperial citizens can be suspicious of Vargr in general.
This leads to problems for the millions of Vargr citizens who dwell in

the Marches leading perfectly innocent lives. Ironically, the further
away from the border a world lies, the less prevalent this attitude
is – the problem is not really racial but stems from the activities of
criminal groups who happen to be Vargr.

The vast majority of Vargr in the Imperium are as loyal as anyone else
and have nothing to do with corsairs, smugglers and assorted bad
sorts described above. It should be noted, however, that few Vargr
find 'doggy' jokes funny, and racist humor of this sort is frowned
on in most places. This does not stop racist Vargr making 'monkey'
references when talking to humans. However, for the most part
Vargr and humans get along and recognize one another as people
first and foremost, with species coming a long way second.

There are some populations of Aslan within the Marches. Some
are citizens of non–Aslan worlds, having settled there and been
integrated into the local culture. The Darrian Confederation has
a sizable minority of Aslan absorbed in this way. Other worlds
have small enclaves of 'unofficial colonists' where ihatei groups
have landed in a remote location and claimed it for their own.
Dislodging them can cause problems with their clan, so many world
governments just let them stay or even offer to recognize their claim
to the land in return for military service.

Aslan mercenary units are not common but are well respected for
their prowess and élan in combat. Individual Aslan and small groups
are often encountered on business or working a job like anyone else,
though there are strict limits on what sort of jobs male and female
Aslan will take.

There is no large–scale Aslan agenda in the Marches, some clans
trade in Imperial Space and some individuals work there. Each, and
every group of settlers where they exist, has its own agenda and will
pursue it in whatever way seems appropriate.

Similar comments apply to Droyne. They can be encountered
anywhere, though they are not common. It seems that the blockade
of Andor and Candory is not there to keep the Droyne in but to
prevent unauthorized Imperials from going to their worlds.

Droyne ships and even small enclaves can be encountered from time
to time, mostly conducting trade and other mundane activities, but
sometimes their actions are utterly incomprehensible. Other than
the Imperial observers around Andor and Candory, no–one knows
what is happening on those worlds and those that can see cannot,
in most cases, make sense of it. If there is an over–arching Droyne
agenda in the Marches nobody is aware of it.

Travellers will interact with Vargr, Aslan and Droyne just like any
other people they encounter. Any given group will have its own
goals, and these may intersect those of the players in various ways.
However, there is no single story associated with these groups; they
will be part of adventures, perhaps even the reason for them, just
like anyone else the characters may meet.

###### ADVENTURE AND CAMPAIGN TYPES

Virtually anything can happen in a Traveller game. However, there
are certain styles of gaming that tend to lead to slightly different
experiences. It is important to pick one that will not alienate some
of the players, by forcing them into a style of play that does not suit
them.

Free Trader/Independent Starship
Perhaps the classic Spinward Marches campaign has the players
as the crew of, or otherwise associated with, a free trader or similar
small starship. This might be an actual merchant vessel or it could
be a Scout/courier, a yacht or a safari ship. The basic concept is that
starships cost money to run and the group will need to engage in
trading or take jobs in order to be able to afford fuel and spares.

There is no need for a rigid command structure in this sort of game.
The ship must, under interstellar law, have a master (captain) and
obviously the owner of the ship gets to decide where it goes and
what it does. Things will normally tend to be quite informal on small
ships of this kind.

Some characters will fulfil important crew positions such as engineers
or pilots but others might be aboard for different reasons. Strong,
tough guys may double as cargo handlers, streetwise characters
can help find cargo or 'scrounge' spare parts when they are needed.
Everyone can contribute in some way to keeping the ship flying.

It is not always possible to make a profit by carrying freight or
engaging in speculative trading, so sometimes the crew will have
to take other jobs. They may also become involved in adventuring
situations for other reasons: following rumors in the hope of
making a big score, being coerced into a job in return for necessary
parts for the ship, responding to a distress call or investigating
something unusual that just popped up on the sensors.

A game of this kind offers a great deal of freedom to the players
and lets them carry around with them more or less anyone and
anything they choose. This may or may not be desirable, as it allows
the characters to avoid some situations by simply flying away. The
players may suddenly decide to head off across the sector (or even
out of it), which can cause a major problem in terms of Referee
preparation for a game.

One alternative is to provide a ship with strings attached. In return
for a subsidy that makes their ship a viable commercial proposition,
the characters may have to carry out missions on behalf of their
patron. This restricts the players to a smaller area and allows the
Referee to introduce adventures, while leaving the characters free to
do as they please the rest of the time.

A variant on this theme might be to impose conditions on an ex–
Scout character's ownership of a scout ship. Again, most of the time
the crew are free to do as they wish but the Scout Service will require
either the fulfilment of tasks from time to time or the return of the
ship.

Military/Naval
A military or naval–based game is far more structured. For one
thing the characters would be in a chain of command and expected
to obey orders. This can be a problem for some groups with very
independent–minded players, or when the senior–ranked character
is played by someone who does not want to lead – or who wants to
but cannot do it very well.

A well–run game can be very entertaining, as a rule most players
find it more interesting to play aboard a starship than in an army
unit and using fairly small ships are usually best. Tooling around
the sector in a heavy cruiser, sending the marines in to deal with
problems rather than getting in amongst it, is not to everyone's
taste.

Naval games of this sort often involve a lot of politics and difficult
decisions rather than action. This is especially true of large–ship
adventures. If the heavy cruisers of the sector fleet are firing their
guns in anger then something serious is going on, but smaller
patrol vessels can have a fairly active time of it fighting pirates and
the like without the need for a major war to justify a combat.

Frontier deployments work best for this kind of game – following
the battlefleet around a base system is hardly the stuff of heroic
adventuring. Alternatively if there is something unusual or special
about the ship, this would place it outside the mainstream naval
experience. Possible candidates include a ship belonging to naval

AADDVENTURINGVENTURING^137

intelligence, a prototype vessel undergoing testing, or a ship used
to dump misfit or no–hoper officers and given a range of odd jobs
to keep them out of trouble. The converse of the latter is also a
possibility – the sector admiral's elite trouble–shooter squad,
handling the dirty jobs that the rest of the Navy can not be trusted
with. Such a vessel might even carry oddball characters who do not
fit in the chain of command but prove useful from time to time.

A 'Scout Cruiser' game could also run in this manner. The advantage
there is that Scout Service ships tend to be run on a much more
informal basis than naval ones, and may well have civilian experts
aboard as part of the mission. Scout ships tend also to be much
more free to wander about and have adventures than naval vessels
with a patrol schedule to meet.

The adventures of a naval ship that has been damaged in combat
and made a huge Misjump could be the basis of a long–running
game as the vessel tries to get home, but this would probably take
it outside the Marches... unless it was a Zhodani or Sword Worlder
ship trying to sneak home.

Mercenary
Distinct from a military game, a mercenary campaign follows the
adventures of a band of guns–for–hire. This may be a well trained,
organised military unit of anything from squad to divisional size, or
it could be a small team of experts, not all of whom are soldiers.

The mercenary game is another classic Traveller campaign, and one
to which the Marches is ideally suited as a setting. As a frontier
there are plenty of problems that require the attentions of military
personnel. Some may be deniable, such as a dubious operation that
the Imperial administration does not want to be connected with,
some open and overt.

Not all mercenary games revolve around combat, though obviously
this is a likely facet of mercenary operations. Mercs are often put
into ambiguous situations where they must make decisions to
which there might be no right answers. What seems like a simple
assignment can suddenly make sharp left turn into something
entirety different, such as when the team goes in to remove a
group of illegal colonists and finds them all dead but for one insane
survivor who keeps babbling about monsters...

Other possibilities include a merc unit that is sent out on a radio–
silence mission just before a ceasefire is declared, resulting in them
hitting what is no longer a military target. Or perhaps the strike
goes well but the extraction is bungled, leaving the mercs stuck in
hostile territory. A merc force guarding a corrupt government from
an uprising by desperate peasants might have some serious moral
questions to deal with. The occasional straight fight is also good.

As with military games, large units are not really suited to adventure
gaming. It is better to base the game around small force or a

detachment, such as a military police, intelligence or commando
squad that deals with the things that the mainstream mercs cannot

- or cleans up their mess.

Noble/Diplomatic
Player–character nobles can be accommodated in almost any sort of
Traveller game, but adventures dealing specifically with the nobility
are a different proposition. This sort of game is not to everyone's
taste as it tends to involve a lot of intrigue and 'talking adventures'.
Opportunities for direct action are not always present and the need
to follow etiquette can be rather frustrating for some players. The
other problem is that unless every player has a noble character,
there will be a 'chain of command' issue much like that encountered
in naval or military games.

The adventuring party in a noble–based game will normally center
on a noble (obviously) but will also include his or her close retinue.
These people will be friends or experts such as scientists, bodyguards
and the like. While they may not have the same social advantages
as the party leader, they should have plenty of opportunities to use
their unique skills.

However, being a noble is not all about intrigue at court. Nobles are
often given difficult tasks to carry out. Sometimes but not always,
they are also assigned resources to use. The rest of the time they
must simply cope. Whether simply 'on their travels' or assigned to a
particular job, a noble and his or her retinue can end up confronting
a wide range of situations.
A noble campaign can thus range from investigating allegations of
corruption at the ducal court on Mora, which mostly involves talking
to people and piecing together a picture from clues, to being caught
in a disaster zone and having to cobble together a plan to save lives
or leading an impromptu assault on a pirate stronghold to rescue
hostages before the corsairs can make good their escape.
Freelance
The other classic Traveller campaign is the 'team of freelance
experts' game. This differs from a Free Trader game in that the team
does not need to concern itself with making enough money to keep
a ship flying. This may suit players who do not like keeping track of
the ship's accounts. This does not mean that the team will not have
a vessel. They may, and it could be anything from a noble's yacht to
a laboratory ship. The humble scout/courier is also a good choice.
If a ship is involved, then some of the Free Trader comments apply,
however – the ship may provide too much freedom to suit the game
needs, or it might enable the characters to move around and follow
the storyline.
In either case, a team of this sort will normally contain a range of
characters. Travellers tend to have a range of skills and to be able to
function in most situations, albeit not well in many cases. The expert
skills of the team will dictate what approaches are likely to be most
effective. Those with good streetwise and diplomatic skills might
be able to circumvent problems a combat–heavy team chooses to
steamroller. There is, in the final analysis, no one way to succeed in
a good Traveller adventure. A team that plays to its strengths will
ultimately be successful.
The 'Freelance' style of game can take characters anywhere in
the Marches. They might spend time on the frontier surveying
prospective colonies, search for lost starships further into the
Imperium and end up at the sector capital involved in a complex
web of intrigue before heading out to a backwater world to help a
band of farmers raise a militia to repel a Megacorporate attempt to
take over their world.

###### FINAL NOTES

In preparing this manuscript, I used a copy of Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches that I have had since 1983 or so. There are two extra
worlds on my map, pencilled in during my teenage years. Both are in the rifts in District 268.

One of these worlds was dropped in there because I wanted to use a magazine scenario and at the time I was not bright enough to do
more than transplant it wholesale. The other is borrowed from a novel I am particularly fond of. If you want a clue it is a low–tech world
with a small base set up by ships out of the Sword Worlds. If you know which world, and which book, that might tell you a lot about my
take on Traveller.

These days I ignore those entries. They are not in the Official Traveller Universe (OTU) and they are not even in My Traveller Universe
(MTU) any more. But there was a time when I wanted those worlds at those locations, so I put them in.

And that is okay. The Official Traveller Universe version of the Spinward Marches is a baseline for your own take on the setting (YTU

- Your Traveller Universe). It is the common starting point we all use. But the minute you play a game, the instant you decide to use your
own take on what a given world looks like, it becomes YTU. Only game designers need to care about keeping the OTU right, and then
only in official products. Everyone else is free to do whatever they like with it, including game designers playing around with different
concepts.

Is this a good time to mention that I ran a one–off a little while back where the Darrians blew up Biter's sun with the Star Trigger? It was
the reason WHY that made it interesting...

Nobody has the right to tell you what's right or wrong for your own Traveller setting. You want a black hole in the Abyss Rift? No problem.
There is not one in the OTU and my physics degree is squealing in protest, but it is YTU. You want a wormhole from the Marches to
the Solomani Rim? Why not? Blow up a couple of stars with the Star Trigger? Knock yourself out. Add a few extra worlds or move them
around? Feel free. Heck, you can dress the Imperial Navy in pink and orange stripes if you like.

You see, this is just a baseline you have in your hands. It is a starting point, and not a bad one in the opinion of the author. But that is
all it is. Where it gets good is when you take this information and use it. Except for the bits you change or ignore completely, that is.

Our future products have to follow this baseline for the Marches and be consistent with it – but your games do not. There is no right or
wrong way to play a Traveller game in the Marches, there is just the OTU, MTU and the one that counts; YTU.

We are done here; it is time to take the Marches and make them yours.
