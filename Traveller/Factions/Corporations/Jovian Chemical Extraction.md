# Jovian Chemical Extraction

Jovian Chemical Extraction (JCE) operates in a single market niche, albeit a high-value one. The firm specialises in extracting useful chemicals from the atmospheres of gas giant worlds. At its most basic level, this can be done by most starships, which dive into the atmosphere and ‘skim’ gases into their tanks for processing. Starships are equipped only to produce hydrogen from gas giants (and to condense it to a liquid state) whereas the gas-rigs used by JCE can extract a variety of useful chemicals.

A JCE operation usually takes the form of one or more gas rigs positioned in high orbit by a parent vessel and then descending to its operating level under their own power. Gas rigs are essentially spacecraft, though they are slow and clumsy ones at best. Rigs can filter gases themselves but normally operate by launching manned or remote controlled ‘skimboats’ which dive deep into the atmosphere where the gases are thicker and fill their tanks over a series of ‘skips’. A skip is a descent and climb back to a safer altitude, where the boat loiters for a while until its current load of gas has been liquefied and pumped to the internal storage tank. A series of skips is required to completely fill the storage tanks, after which the skimboat returns to its berth and pumps its cargo into the rig’s processing tanks.
