## THE MAIN INTELLIGENT SPECIES

Humans, of one sort or another, are the main intelligent race in the Spinward Marches and much of Charted Space in general. There are, however, several other major and minor intelligent species.

The term 'Major Race' has two meanings. Imperial scientists apply the term precisely to mean any race or species that invented the Jump Drive independently. In this context a Minor Race is a species that either received Jump–drive technology from another source (e.g. buying it or reverse–engineering an example found in a wreck) or has not developed interstellar travel at all.

However, the terms are sometimes used rather more loosely to refer to the power and prominence of a species. By this definition some
'major' races are actually quite unimportant while some 'minor' species are very influential.

### Humaniti

Exactly when 'Humanity' became 'Humaniti' is no longer known. While the word 'humanity' has various meanings, 'Humaniti' has only one – it is the name of the dominant species in the Third Imperium.

There are three Major and many Minor (by the definitions above) human races. All are offshoots of the same basic genetic stock and most, but not all, can interbreed. There are also vast numbers of cultural groups who may seem very different from the rest of Humaniti but are in fact genetically identical. Sometimes these are mistakenly identified as minor human races.

To truly be a minor race rather than a social or cultural group requires some significant genetic difference from the rest of Humaniti. This can occur gradually, as a result of a restricted gene pool over many millennia or as an adaptation to harsh conditions. It can also be deliberate. Some minor human races have been deliberately altered, and in a few cases this was quite radical. A few altered themselves, some were adapted as part of colonial programs and some were changed by outside influence.

It is generally thought that the ancestral homeworld of Humaniti in all its many forms is Terra, or Old Earth. Other locations have been postulated, but currently the most widely–accepted theory holds that humans originated at a single point, which was most likely to be Terra, and spread across the galaxy in the distant past, becoming disparate racial and cultural groups before the modern period.

The spread of Humaniti is generally attributed to a group known as the Ancients, a powerful and technologically advanced species or group which dominated the region 300,000 years or so in the past. Some claim that these Ancients were in fact humans; others suggest that humans were servitors or allies of the Ancients who were left behind when the Ancients disappeared.

Whatever the reasons, modern Humaniti displays an amazing diversity of cultures, philosophies, religions, and personalities. As a result, some of the most alien cultures encountered are Human. Humans are also amazingly adaptable, many times even able to fully integrate into alien run societies. Despite this diversity, all human races are amazingly similar in their physiology, even those who have been genetically engineered, such that most Human races are capable of interbreeding with each other.

There is considerable variety in skin tone, eye and hair colour, height, build and similar physical characteristics. Presumably this is because the originally transplanted humans were very diverse. It does mean that it is not possible to tell by looking at someone whether he or she belongs to any given racial group unless there are cultural clues. Dress, mannerisms, accents and such like will usually indicate a person's cultural origin.

### SOLOMANI

The Solomani often claim to be the true 'root stock' of Humaniti as they developed on Terra itself. Others point out that these are the people who were left behind when humans went or were taken to the stars during the Ancients period.

Culturally, the Solomani tend to towards being explorers and inventors, and are highly individualistic. Their societies tend to be in a constant state of change and development, which is not always positive. However, as a result of this the Solomani have expanded far out from their distant home and their cultural enclaves can be found almost anywhere, often melded with local societies.

There is a Solomani state, named the Solomani Confederation, which broke away from the Imperium just over a century ago and retained its independence, more or less, in what became known as the Solomani Rim War. Although Terra and the surrounding regions were retaken by the Imperium, the subsequent peace settlement created the Solomani Confederation, which has its own cultural outlook.

Most humans of Solomani descent feel little sympathy with the Solomani Confederation. It is physically and culturally distant. Indeed, the Solomani Confederation is sometimes seen as 'the bad guys' by Imperial citizens as it fought a war against the Imperium in recent history.

Solomani Confederation influence is low to non–existent in the Spinward Marches, though there are many Solomani cultural groups. These Imperial–Solomani are first and foremost Imperial citizens, though they may display elements of old–earth cultures. Sometimes these are vastly distorted or idealised versions of a pre–interstellar [[Terra|Terran]] culture; often they are a product of local conditions.

### VILANI

The Vilani are more culturally homogenous than the Solomani or most other large human groups. According to the best current theories, the Vilani are descendants of humans who were transplanted or made their way to the world of Vland during the Ancients period. After a long and troubled period struggling against their homeworld, which was only borderline–habitable to humans, they eventually made their way back into space.

The Vilani were probably the first humans to regain the stars after the Ancients departed. They gradually built an empire that is said to have included 15,000 worlds. Known as the Ziru Sirka, or Grand Empire of Stars, this Vilani empire is sometimes referred to as the Vilani Imperium or the First Imperium. It was highly conservative and restricted the development of many worlds in the name of stability. This seems to have worked; the Ziru Sirka lasted for over 7,000 years.

Vilani tend to be highly conservative in outlook. Tradition is a powerful force in society, and traditional methods are applied to most problems. Of course, 7,000 years is long enough to have developed an effective traditional response to most situations.

Vilani society is very group–oriented and is built around guilds and bureaus that run the various services needed to keep a society working. Some of these are today Imperial Megacorporations with fingers in many pies all across the Imperium. However, the very nature of Vilani society is such that cultural Vilani are not as widespread as Solomani. Small groups can to be found almost anywhere but the main concentrations are located in the region around Vland.

Pure–blood racial Vilani tend to live very long lives. However, this trait is heavily diluted by interbreeding. Mixed–blooded Vilani will tend to live only marginally longer than Solomani or any other mixed–race human. Most cultural Vilani are not pure–blooded members of the Vilani 'race'.

Typical Vilani view scientific and technological progress with disdain. Stability is more important than progress, and societies dominated by Vilani culture will be very resistant to change. The Vilani culture is dominant in a fairly large area of the Imperium. In these areas new initiatives from [[Capital]] tend to meet considerable resistance. Conversely, Vilani regions tend to be stable, orderly and, usually, prosperous.

Within the Spinward Marches, the Vilani culture is not dominant except in small areas on a few worlds. Most humans in the region do not hold traditional Vilani views.

### ZHODANI

The Zhodani are the third major human race. Their home region is to Spinward–Coreward of the Spinward Marches and has never been part of the Imperium. Indeed, four major wars have been fought between the Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium.

The Zhodani Consulate is the largest of the human states and also the oldest. It is extraordinarily stable by human standards, and according to available evidence, internally peaceful. The Consulate has remained stable in terms of size for many hundreds of years; it is claimed that further expansion was curtailed when the Consulate reached the maximum size that could be effectively governed.

Relations with client states along the borders are reportedly good, though the distances involved mean that little information is available to Imperial analysts. It is known that the Zhodani are active in one area. Several large and many small expeditions have been launched over the centuries, all aimed down a corridor of space leading directly towards the Galactic Core. The purpose and result of these 'Core Expeditions' remains unknown.

The Zhodani are the only major human group to make extensive and open use of psionic powers. Testing for abilities is routine and apparently mandatory, and is central to the Zhodani system of government. The upper echelon of society are nobles, who are the only class entitled to vote in what is ostensibly a democratic system. Most of the work of governance is undertaken by the Intendant class, with the majority of the population being Proles.

Imperials view the open use of psionics with distrust and distaste, and dislike the idea that there is little upwards mobility for the average Prole. The only route is via psionics. All Prole children are tested for potential and if they have a suitable talent, they are taken away from their parents and placed with an Indentant family. The new Intendant will be raised in what amounts to the middle classes and can even hope to be elevated to the nobility.

Becoming a noble can be achieved by service or by victory in the three–yearly Psionic Games. Nobles wield the real power in Zhodani society. They both lead and govern, and elect from among their number the Consuls that rule all of Zhodani space.

This all seems very unfair to the typical Imperial citizen, who is used to at least the concept of upwards mobility by various means. The idea that a Zhodani might be reading his mind is also unsettling. However, to Zhodani this is the natural order of things. The Proles are well looked after and are given fulfilling tasks to do; their happiness and welfare are important concerns of the Intendants and Nobles.

Here, too, the average Imperial finds Zhodani society a bit sinister. Not only are social sciences developed to a high level but there is an organization named _'Tvarchedl_ dedicated to finding unhappy people and 'curing' them of what is seen as a disease. Although their name translates as Guardians of Morality, most Imperials refer to the _'Tvarchedl_ as 'thought police'.

To the Zhodani, unhappiness is a disease and it is a comfort to know that there are people whose job it is to find out what is making the person miserable and either help him adjust his life to eliminate the cause of his unhappiness or else to make the mental adjustment needed to overcome him.

Most often, _'Tvarchedl_ operations take the form of helpful advice and psionically–assisted counselling. Mind–altering is actually much less common than Imperials imagine. It is usually reserved for those who are resistant to the gentler processes, such as those who have a mental illness, or those who request it because they feel it is the only way to deal with their problems.

Most Zhodani are appalled by Imperial society, which they see as a chaotic mess of deceit and lies in which people are permitted or actually forced to live in a way that makes them miserable. To the Zhodani, this is neglect or abuse of the common populace and no amount of rhetoric about the free pursuit of happiness or advancement can conceal the fact that most people never find either and are forced to make the best of a fairly unpleasant set of circumstances.

An Imperial citizen who is unhappy in his office job is theoretically free to get a different one, but may find it impossible. He or she might also not realise exactly what it is that is causing their distress and end up pursuing pointless goals in the mistaken belief that this will help. A Zhodani in the same position would receive a visitor from the 'Tvarchedl , who would help him or her figure out exactly what was causing the unhappiness. The 'thought policeman' would then either offer advice on how to eliminate that factor from the person's life, or would actively help the person find a different job where they would be happier. If that required retraining, then the 'Tvarchedl would fund or even provide it.

It might be that wider factors were at work, in which case a troublesome colleague might be reassigned or offered advice on how to better fit in with the work environment and stop upsetting his or her colleagues. Alternatively, if the office worker requested it, he or she might be offered therapy to adjust his or her viewpoint such that the aspects of the job or colleagues causing the problem might seem more palatable.

The Zhodani claim that their approach is very different from the sinister mental reprogramming many outsiders believe they engage in. They suggest that their methods are more enlightened, better for the unhappy person and all–round more effective than the Imperial system of simply letting people get on with it since nobody cares anyway. Imperials often shudder and start talking about sanctity of personality at this point.

Given these huge cultural differences and the Zhodani lack of interest in expansion, there is little interbreeding between Zhodani and other humans. As a result, there is a fairly distinct Zhodani physical appearance, which is an exception to the general trend. Zhodani tend to be tall and slim, and seem to exhibit psionic talents more commonly than other humans. This however, may be due to the fact that these are actively tested for and accepted in Zhodani society, which is not the case elsewhere.

### OTHER HUMANS

Most humans within the Marches (and the rest of the Imperium, with some exceptions) tend to be of mixed blood. Solomani, Vilani and many of the minor human groups have been interbreeding for centuries, creating a fairly 'generic' human type.

Cultural influences are generally more important than racial ones, though local conditions will influence the general characteristics of a planetary population over the centuries. Thus as already noted most cultural Vilani or Solomani are actually of mixed blood.

People being what they are, local associations tend to be more important than more distant ones. Thus the population of a given world tend to identify themselves as citizens of that world first and as Imperial citizens a long way second. Regional associations are sometimes important, such as when people identify with the Marches or Rhylanor Subsector, but even this is relatively uncommon.

A planet is a big place; about as big as most people can identify with. As a result, the average person identifies closely with their town or city, and their homeworld to a lesser extent. Far–off things like the fact that they are citizens of the Imperium rarely intrude into daily life for most people.

Cultural pollution has caused many worlds, especially those on major trade routes, to move towards a “standard–starfaring” culture, though even this is subject to local variations and tends to be more pronounced near the Starport than elsewhere. Some worlds are very different to this standard–starfaring culture. Diversity (within limits) is more frequent than commonality. However, radically different societies are normally either located in remote areas where there are few visitors, the product of deliberate isolationism, or both.

There are a number of minor human races. The Jonkeereen, for example, were genetically engineered by Imperial scientists. They breed true, creating a human offshoot race specifically tailored to survival in a desert environment. Their homeworld is in Deneb sector but they can be encountered anywhere. The Geonee are shorter and of heavier build than most other human types as a result of conditions on their homeworld. It is probable that the Geonee became adapted to the conditions there after being transplanted by the Ancients, though the Geonee have another explanation.

The Darrians, who are native to the Spinward Marches, are thought to have been genetically adapted by the Ancients in the distant past and today are one of the more important minor human races. The Darrians rule a small state on the Spinward fringe of Imperial space. This is their second interstellar polity; an ill–advised experiment involving their star ended the first.

### OTHER TERRANS

Enhanced, that is sentient, versions of several [[Terra|Terran]] species have been created. Most notable and widespread are Dolphins, who inhabit the oceans of many worlds and travel among the stars when it suits them to do so. It is difficult for aquatic creatures to do so but technology has enabled Dolphins to join the starfaring races. Some Orca (Killer Whales) were also uplifted to sentience and can be found on various worlds, sometimes co–existing with Dolphins.

Among the other [[Terra|Terran]] species uplifted to sentience were various apes. These were, in general, less successful than the Dolphin project and have tended to fade away. Some worlds nearer [[Terra|Terran]] have populations of Apes, either in mainstream society or in enclaves living in remote areas. They are rarely encountered away from their homes, though the occasional Ape does turn up in an unexpected place.

It is also generally accepted that Solomani genetic experimentation created enhanced humans. These 'Supermen' were few in number and do not exist today. The Solomani Confederation is strangely reticent on the subject.
