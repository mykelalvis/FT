# Rachele Society

The Rachele Society is a secretive Vilani supremacist group founded on Pretoria by Zid Rachele in 992. Violent from the outset, the society quickly escalated into using attacks intended to cause mass casualties. Having demonstrated a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, the Rachele Society then attempted to hold a number of worlds to ransom with the threat of such an attack.

This culminated in the attempted takeover of the Pretorian government in 1010 but nuclear blackmail backfired when 26,000 people (including 1,900 Rachelean commandos) were killed in a nuclear explosion after the society seized [[Scout Service|Imperial scout]] facilities on [[Saki]]. The [[Imperium]] tries to stay out of local politics but intervention was forced in order to protect Imperial assets and prevent further use of nuclear weaponry.

The [[Imperium]] plans to relax martial law on [[Pretoria]] over the next 10 years, although military analysts insist the Rachele Society still exists. Zid Rachele himself disappeared in 1015 after escaping the prison world [[Exile]] in the [[Usani Subsector]].
