The world of Besancon is essentially a starport on a rockball. Theoretically independent, Besancon is at the mercy of whichever power is willing to grab it. Ill- feeling towards Serendip Belt is considerable, due to forcible annexation and occupation during Serendip Beltâ€™s period of ascendancy. The Battle of Besancon was a minor skirmish to the Serendips; to the people of Besancon it is both a symbol of defiant pride and a dark memory of a very bloody hour.
