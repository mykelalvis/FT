Continuing from [[2024-06-23]]

So, per the usual, this conclusion of the [[Invasive Species]] adventure has the following:

1. Dead Shakuurzarpi x 2 with evidence of such death.
2. The Gisidi Rangers of Tinea-Fabre investigating the odd occurrences of the situations in which the heir to Alekvadin was subjected.  The Rangers have retrieved the corpse of the male.  The female corpse was too far gone
3. Everyone was granted 3 Credit as payment for services
4. The @Fated Travellers are now in possession of the _Superb Starling_ for a 180-day lease (i.e. legal possession).  Rill is accompanying them as ship's Steward.  They are responsible for all expenses at this point, including upkeep at a Class A or B starport every 4 weeks.  They are expected to return the ship in better condition than they received it.  The terms of what constitutes "returning the ship" are relatively negotiable.  Ivy and Rill  that it would be customary to somehow leave a parting gift of some value, whether that  value is uniqueness or actual cost or both, like some sort of rare wine or food or art or some such
5. This was a Significant Milestone <https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/advancement-change#significant-milestones> which means +1 Skill point (spending of which must obey the skill pyramid rules) and any desired benefits from a Minor milestone <https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/advancement-change#minor-milestones>
6. Okhotnikov as a contact.  He was reasonably and favorably impressed with your showing.  In dealings with him directly, not through an agent, he will have the aspect `Favorably disposed` to any of the Travellers.  The Travellers also have a 1-time boost of `Favored former agent of Alekvadin` that will apply to any dealings with House Alekvadin.  The ducal heir will accept your communiques.  Well, Ivy will accept them.  Even from Jerry.

Leaving Tinea-Fabre is not immediately required.  The heir is in residence for at least a month until the arrival of the Duke, and the Travellers may remain as his guests.  There will be another hunt next week.  Eddie heard "frumious bandersnatch" as the target for that, but he might have been drunk.

The lease time on the starship begins immediately, though.  So 1-day equals 1-day of the 6 month lease.

The calendar date is now `Imperial 075-1103`
