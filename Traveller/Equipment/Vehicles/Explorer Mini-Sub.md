The Explorer mini-sub is designed to fit into the rear compartment of the expeditionary crawler, which deposits it into the ocean via a deployment ramp/recovery deck. This nifty little submersible is camouflaged to avoid detection by the local sophonts. The holding tank can contain up to 250 kilograms of biomatter, mineral samples or whatever else the crew scoops out of the ocean with the manipulator arm.
