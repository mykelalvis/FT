# TRAVEL ZONES

Systems are classified as [[Green Zone|Green]], [[Amber Zone|Amber]] or [[Red Zone]]s based on their safety and accessibility to Travellers. Only a [[Red Zone]] has legal significance, usually indicating interdiction by an external power or prohibition against contact imposed by a systemâ€™s inhabitants.
