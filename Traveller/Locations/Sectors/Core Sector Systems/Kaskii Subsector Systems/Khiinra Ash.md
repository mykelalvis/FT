Khiinra Ash is a moon of a circumbinary gas giant called Khamikurde Anku, which orbits the system's pair of red dwarf stars. The two stars have similar mass and they orbit one another closely. The larger of the two accretes a small amount of mass from the smaller, making them what is known as a semidetached binary pair.

Khiinra Ash is a massive moon with a diameter of nearly 17,000 kilometers and a gravity of 1.9G. It orbits its gas giant once every 63 hours, exposing both of its hemispheres to the twin stars of the system, thereby giving it some semblance of a day-night cycle. The moon has liquid water oceans, two massive continents and several hundred islands, some of which are arranged in long, winding archipelagos. Because of its high gravity, Khiinra Ash has no large mountain ranges to speak of but its porous, cracked land masses have enormous canyon systems, some of which are over 100km in depth. The atmosphere on the surface is trace but a thin oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere may be found deep in the canyons. Not surprisingly, this is also where its complex land-based life resides. Khiinra Ash is an unlikely candidate to harbour life and yet it has a teeming biosphere.

While it is not classified as such, Khiinra Ash is effectively a reserve, with few humans living permanently on its surface. The high gravity makes it uncomfortable for humans but the Bhu'oovaakaylaa welcome expeditions when they come. When offered Red Zone status, they declined. They are a philosophical species and while few have ever left the planet – due to their size and highly specified adaptations – they welcome the idea that they are members of an interstellar community. The Bhu'oovaakaylaa enjoy speaking with visitors of all races, learning more about them and engaging in spirited debates. They speak in deep bellows and communication with them is loud and ponderous. They are a long-lived species, with an average lifespan of over 300 years and they seem to be in no hurry to rush through a conversation.

Khiinra Ash Highport is a serviceable and friendly facility but its technology is outdated. The staff see themselves as ambassadors to the Bhu'oovaakaylaa civilization and are helpful to offworlders, for whom they maintain a selection of high-G apparatuses and exoskeletons to make wandering the surface of Khiinra Ash more comfortable.
