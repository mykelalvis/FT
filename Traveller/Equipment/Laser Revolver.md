The rapid generation of energy produces a lot of heat, but a cartridge weapon offers high-power laser capability in a small package. Weapons of this sort are favoured by some militaries, not least because their lack of recoil makes them suitable for use in space and obviates the need for a separate low-g arsenal.

The laser revolver is aimed at the shipboard security marketplace and is issued to Neubayern naval officers as a sidearm. It is also used as a security gun and can be found clipped to emergency-arms stations or carried by boarding parties. Its lack of sustained firepower is not considered a drawback in any of these roles.
