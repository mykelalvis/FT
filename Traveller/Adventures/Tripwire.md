![[Trip-Cover.jpg.jpg]]

In an effort to increase their control over [[Jewell subsector]], the [[Imperium]] has announced that a new duke will be appointed to oversee Imperial interests there. This move has caused political friction with the [[Zhodani]] who have since restricted trade to their worlds.

Imperial agents' suspect the [[Zhodani]] are now planning to deploy a new super weapon, forcing the [[Imperium]] to strengthen their borders and military outposts. With tensions running high only the bravest travellers remain in business, demanding higher fees for their services.

Making the most of the current trade opportunities, the players take on a passenger who pays them a handsome fee for their services. However, the passenger is more than he appears to be and the players are soon plunged into a world of conspiracy and danger.

# INTRODUCTION

Tripwire is a _Traveller_ campaign set in the [[Jewell subsector]] of the [[Spinward Marches]]. The story takes the players to all of the worlds in Jewell as they attempt to uncover a conspiracy. Every system that they visit has at least one scenario or encounter. Additional encounters can also be found in the Appendix, which can be used throughout the campaign. The Appendix also contains a number of generic NPCs that you can use as required and equipment from the new races detailed in this book.

To run the Tripwire campaign, you will need the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. _The Spinward Marches_ is also recommended for additional background material and is referenced several times during this book.

## THE PLAYERS

The players should be part of an established group, such as free traders or mercenaries, with some loyalty to the Imperium. The party will need a variety of skills including combat, negotiation and stealth. A pilot will also be required and an engineer is also recommended. There are no restrictions on race, as long as most of the players are Imperial citizens and they have a good reason for being together.

The party must also have their own Jump-2 capable ship with a fuel scoop. This is important as it restricts where they can travel, forcing them to take specific routes. As the campaign progresses the players will acquire a new ship that can travel further distances, giving them access to more worlds in the Jewell subsector.

The campaign starts with the party located on the [[Zhodani]] world of [[Farreach]]. They will most likely have visited there to trade but you can use any reason that fits in with their backgrounds or group activities.

Most of the party should already know each other but some can join the group on Farreach if required, which can make for some interesting roleplaying if their loyalties are called into question. Additional party members can either be recruited or start out as passengers who get caught up in the events of the story.

## PROLOGUE

The [[Jewell subsector]] is in a state of political change and unrest. The [[Federation of Arden]] has become a power in its own right, albeit a minor one, and are increasing their sphere of influence in the Rimward region of the subsector. Coreward of the Jewell Cluster, the [[Zhodani]] maintain a strong military presence and continue to sponsor an anti-[[Imperial]] sentiment that has now evolved into a separatist movement.

With the Imperial region of [[Jewell Subsector|Jewell]] being threatened from both sides as well as within, a duke is to be appointed to oversee Imperial interests and maintain control of their territories. The duke will be stationed on [[Jewell]] but no date has been given and the new duke has yet to be chosen.

This move has caused political friction with the [[Zhodani]] who have since embargoed all Imperial Megacorporations. With rumors that an archduke will be also be selected to govern the [[Deneb Sector]] system, the [[Zhodani]] fear the [[Imperium]]'s motives and now threaten to cut diplomatic relations altogether.

Imperial agents suspect that the [[Zhodani]] now plan to deploy a new super weapon, forcing the [[Imperium]] to strengthen their borders and military outposts. With tensions running high, only the bravest travellers remain in business and demand higher fees for their services.

## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

Making the most of the current trade opportunities, the players take on a passenger who pays them a handsome fee for their services. After being stopped by a [[Zhodani]] patrol the passenger reveals himself to be an Imperial agent. As he disembarks at his destination, he is shot by unknown assailants and the players must get him to safety.

A second attempt on the agent's life is successful and to the players' dismay they are framed for the murder. Now fugitives, the players are plunged into a Universe of conspiracy and danger. Following the trail from one world to the next, the players unravel the mystery of their dead passenger as a deeper plot begins to reveal itself.

# JEWELL

The [[Jewell subsector]] is divided into three areas. The coreward region is ruled by the [[Zhodani]], the central region is under Imperial control and the rimward region is neutral territory.

The [[Zhodani]] have a strong military presence in the six systems that they occupy in Jewell. Although access for Imperial Megacorps is currently restricted, independent traders and travellers are free to visit as usual. The [[Zhodani]] like to maintain their influence over the neutral worlds in their territory and Imperial access to these has always been limited. However, trade is the lifeblood of so many worlds that most traders are granted access.

The Imperial region consists of eight systems, five of which are known as the Jewell Cluster ([[Jewell]], [[Emerald]], [[Ruby]], [[Mongo]] and [[Lysen]]). The region is currently under the control of the Duke of [[Regina Subsector|Regina]] but the [[Imperium]] is in the process of appointing a duke to the [[Jewell subsector]]. The 212<sup>th</sup> Fleet maintains strong border patrols, especially around the Jewell Cluster.

The rimward region consists mainly of neutral systems, many of which are becoming of strong interest to the [[Federation of Arden]]. [[Utoland]] and [[Zircon]] have already fallen under the Federation's influence.

All of the information listed in this chapter (except the timeline) is known to most travellers so the players should have full access to the descriptions listed here.

# PASSENGER

> [!info]- The [[Zhodani]] Research Station on [[Farreach]]
>
> As far as most people know, [[Farreach]] consists only of the starport and military base. However, a secret known to only a few [[Zhodani]] is the existence of an underground research laboratory. The laboratory was built several hundred years ago when the [[Zhodani]] discovered some ancient technology buried underground. The base was originally built to hide and protect the site whilst the ancient device was excavated.
>
> During the [[Third Frontier War]], the base was upgraded to its current military status. The underground laboratory has slowly expanded as the scientists continue their work on the ancient device. The work was painstakingly slow. Due to the hard rock surface, it took decades just to expose the huge device in its entirety before it could be studied. The [[Zhodani]] were persistent with their studies but a breakthrough was only made 60 years ago when they discovered [[#the Keystone]] to activate it.
>
> The device is a black tetrahedron (three sided pyramid) standing 300ft high. When activated with the correct keystone the device emits a low humming sound audible to anyone within 30ft. Prolonged exposure to the activated device results in a severe brain haemorrhage. It is these effects that have made it so hard to study and several [[Zhodani]] have been killed trying to discover its secrets. Further details on this device are [[#The Keystone|given later in the campaign]].
>
> Since the discovery of the device, others have been found on neighboring planets in the Jewell subsector. The [[Zhodani]] have also found keystones for each device and have now begun to understand the full potential of the technology as a defensive weapon.

## A New Job

The players are currently at the [[Farreach]] starport making preparations to leave. If any new characters are joining the group then this should be concluded before [[Forbes]] approaches them. You can also add any random [[#Encounters]] as required.

At a suitable time, [[Forbes]] will approach the players as they have the only ship run by Imperial citizens. He will introduce himself as [[Forbes|James Forbes]], leaving out any mention that he is an agent in the service of the Imperium. He will offer Cr. 50,000 for immediate passage to [[Esalin]]. This will most likely be a much higher rate than the players would expect for passage on their ship but if the players decline [[Forbes]] will raise the price up to Cr. 100,000.

If asked, [[Forbes]] will say that he has a business meeting to attend and if he is late it could cost him the deal. This is actually true, from a certain perspective, so despite not revealing all of the facts no deception can be detected. If the players question him further, he will simply explain that the nature of the business is confidential, which is also true.

To get to [[Esalin]] in their Jump 2 ship, the players must go via [[Ao-dai]] and [[Clan]]. Once the party are ready, they will be given permission by the port authority to leave and the ship can make the first jump.

## AO-DAI SYSTEM

## Random Encounters

The players will have no need to land on [[Ao-dai]] as it has no refuelling capabilities and [[Forbes]] will insist that they waste as little time as possible. However, if the party does land here (perhaps at the request of another passenger) then you can use the [[#Encounters]] Table.

## Zhodani Patrol

Whilst the ship is refuelling at the gas giant, a [[Zhodani]] ship will approach demanding to board and inspect the players' ship. The players are not in a position to fight or run, so they must allow the [[Zhodani]] ship to dock.

Before the [[Zhodani]] dock, [[Forbes]] will speak to whichever player is in charge. He will request that they speak in private and will reveal the following:

> 'I find I am in a situation where I must place my trust in you. I am an Imperial agent and those [[Zhodani]] are most likely looking for me. It is vital I complete my mission and I can not let the [[Zhodani]] capture me, for there is much at stake.
> I do not think they know what I look like, so they will want to question everyone on board to find out who is part of the crew and who are passengers.

The player may want to bring the rest of the crew in on this but it is their choice. They must then discuss how to handle the situation with [[Forbes]]. He will only use force as a last resort but will kill the [[Zhodani]] if no other choices remain. The players will not have long to discuss their options as the [[#Zhodani Scout ship]] closes in.

If all of the crew are in on the plan, they can attempt to lie to the [[Zhodani]] and hope they do not have any psionic abilities that will see through the deception. If the players suggest hiding [[Forbes]] they could still be vulnerable to the same abilities.

If any other passengers boarded the ship at [[Farreach]] then the situation will be even more interesting as trust issues will arise. Other passengers might not wish to deceive and potentially fight the [[Zhodani]] or they could even be a [[Zhodani]] agent.

![[Trip-320.jpg]]

### BOARDED

The party will not have long to prepare before the [[Zhodani]] ship docks and three [[Zhodani]] will board the players' ship. The [[Zhodani]] are indeed looking for [[Forbes]] but they do not know his identity, only that an Imperial agent has left Farreach with classified information.

The leader is a [[#Zhodani Agent]]. He is accompanied by a [[#Zhodani Pilot|pilot]] and a [[#Zhodani Psion|psion]]. The psion will use [[Psionics#Lie Detection]] and [[Psionics#Probe]] to see what the players know and if the Imperial agent is onboard the ship. Unless the players have been particularly clever, it will not take the [[Zhodani]] long to discover the truth.

The players can either let [[Forbes]] be taken captive (which could bring a rather abrupt end to the campaign) or a fight will ensue. If the players are reluctant to get involved then [[Forbes]] will force the issue by firing at the [[Zhodani]] when he has the best opportunity.

If the [[Zhodani]] are losing the fight, they will attempt to return to their ship where they can disable the players' ship and call for reinforcements. If the [[Zhodani]] are unable to get to their own ship, they will attempt to take control of the players' ship instead.

### VICTORY

If the [[Zhodani]] are defeated, the players will need to leave the area as quickly as possible. If any of the [[Zhodani]] are alive, the players must decide what to do with them. If questioned, the [[Zhodani]] will remain silent but if stronger measures are used they will state that [[Forbes]] is a spy and an enemy of the [[Zhodani]] Consulate.

The players may also be tempted to take the [[Zhodani]] ship but they still have to pass through [[Zhodani]] space. If they are caught in possession of the ship they will immediately be taken prisoner and interrogated by [[Zhodani]] officials. If the players search the ship, they will find some small arms but little else of interest.

There is a good chance that other [[Zhodani]] vessels will come here to investigate so the players must finish refuelling and jump to the [[Clan]] system to continue their journey.

### FAILURE

If the players were not successful then [[Forbes]] will be taken prisoner (if he has not been killed). If the party tried to help him in any way, the [[Zhodani]] will arrest everyone on the ship who is still alive. If the [[Zhodani]] made it to their ship then they will fire on the players' ship to disable it and then call for reinforcements to help capture the prisoners.

If the players manage to escape then the [[Zhodani]] will pursue and send out fugitive alerts. However, once they jump, the players should be safe for a short while until the [[Zhodani]] and fugitive alerts catch up with them.

If the players have failed to protect agent [[Forbes]] and things have gone badly, [[Forbes]] will try to tell the players about the data wafer that he has and that it must get to his contact at the Redway Hotel on [[Esalin]] (detailed later in this chapter).

If the players are captured you can use the [[#Arrested]] scenario.

## CLAN SYSTEM

### Refuelling

As before, the players will need to make their stop on [[Clan]] as brief as possible. Refuelling at the starport is the quickest method but they can also refuel at the gas giant if preferred. If the players decide to explore [[Clan]], [[Forbes]] will remain on the ship.

[[Clan]] will have an obvious ([[Zhodani]]) military presence and regular patrols. However, news of the players' previous activities has not reached here yet, so they should be safe as long as they do not violate any local laws.

Whilst the players are visiting this world, a number of optional encounters can happen. These will most likely take place in the capital city of [[Clan#Clandra]]. Pick or roll on the [[#Clan Random Encounters Table]]. Use [[#Random NPC Table|NPC]] statistics .

## ESALIN SYSTEM

### Assassination

Two [[#Zhodani Agent]]s from [[Farreach]] had already suspected [[Forbes]] as being a spy but [[Forbes]] eluded them. These two agents dispatched the [[#Zhodani Scout Ship]] that the players encountered at [[Ao-dai]], whilst the agents continued their investigations on Farreach. Hearing reports of the incident at [[Ao-dai]], the two agents guessed that [[Esalin]] would be a logical place to stop or refuel. The agents were able to get here and wait for the players' ship, which was seen leaving Farreach.

Once the players land at the [[Esalin]] starport, [[Forbes]] will thank them and disembark. As he walks down the ramp he is hit by several shots fired from laser pistols. The shots hit him squarely in the chest and he staggers back into the ship and collapses. If any of the players watched this happen, they will see two unidentifiable figures run into the shadows. There is no local law enforcement in the immediate vicinity and anyone who witnessed the event has left the area. Apart from the bleeding body in the ship, it is as if the incident never happened.

[[Forbes]] is bleeding badly. He can barely speak and beckons one of the players over. He whispers in their ear 'Redway. Get me to... Redway', before falling unconscious. A successful Medic check will stabilize [[Forbes]] but his chances are not good. For the next hour he will drift in and out of consciousness.

If the players search [[Forbes]]' unconscious body, they will find a hand computer, a data wafer and his weapon. There is nothing on the computer and the data wafer has been double encrypted, requiring two Computers checks DM –6 to access the data. In the unlikely event that the players access the data, proceed to [[#Data Wafer Contents]].

With the information they already know and with their encounter at [[Ao-dai]], the party will hopefully decide to avoid any medical or official facilities. If the players ask around or check public computer systems they will discover a hotel called 'The Redway Hotel' in a town located a short distance from the starport.

The players must now work out how to get a bleeding and unconscious body to the town without drawing attention. If they have their own vehicle then the task will be easy. If they do not they will have to hire one or figure out another way of getting to their destination.

### The Redway Hotel

The Redway Hotel is a legitimate business owned by [[Martha Redway]] who took over the family business from her father when he died 20 years ago. However, the family business is much more than a simple hotel. The Redway family and their establishment have been part of the Imperial intelligence network for over 50 years.

To avoid drawing too much attention, only a handful of agents use the facility at any time. The hotel is a safe house when agents need somewhere to stay and keep a low profile. The Redways also pass on messages and information to a courier (travelling under the guise of a free trader) who visits several times a year to gather intelligence from agents out in the field.

Agent [[Forbes]] was using the Redway Hotel as one of his contact points and is the reason he wanted passage to [[Esalin]]. Agents like [[Forbes]] who spend their time undercover will always make contact at places like this; they never make direct contact with anyone in authority to prevent their position from being compromised.

Once the players arrive here, they will have to figure out what to do. They were only given the name Redway and obviously do not know for certain who Forbes' contact is, although they might take an educated guess that it is [[Martha Redway]].

Booking in at the hotel is a good place to start and they will meet Martha. She will flirt with at least one of the players so talking to her will be easy in one respect but potentially awkward in another. If they try to get any information out of her they will get her full name. If asked she will also reveal that there are currently no other guests staying at the hotel.

If the players ask Martha if she knows Forbes, her behaviour will change ever so slightly. She obviously does not want to reveal herself but at the same time she has a responsibility to the agents who know her. She will admit that she knows [[Forbes]] but only as a previous patron who stayed here a while back. Once she knows [[Forbes]] is seriously injured, she will tell the players to bring him to a bedroom on the first floor.

Martha will tend to Forbes' wounds whilst talking to the players. If the players tell Martha enough of what has happened and earn her trust, she will reveal her true role. She will search [[Forbes]] for his data wafer, knowing that he usually has one containing his reports for the courier. If the players have already taken it, she will ask them for it back. Martha will explain that any reports will be on there and she must have it to give to the courier.

Martha will thank the players for bringing [[Forbes]] here and he should recover as long as he stays here, where she can nurse him back to health. She will suggest that the players stay here for the night and will prepare a meal for them while they settle in.

### Assassination Attempt Two

As the players are enjoying their meal cooked by Martha, the two [[#Zhodani Assassins]] have tracked the party here and want to make sure that [[Forbes]] is dead. The agents will kill [[Forbes]] in his sleep but Martha will discover them as they are leaving and fire a shot at them.

The players will hear the gunshot. If they go to investigate Martha will run past them saying that [[Forbes]] has been killed. The players should have time to intercept the agents before they can escape. The agents are on the first floor deciding their best way out now that the party has been alerted to the agents' presence.

If the entire party follows them to the first floor, the agents will attempt to climb out of a window or hide in the building. The most effective way of preventing the agents from escaping is to split up, so some players go outside whilst the rest progressively search the hotel. If the [[Zhodani]] are cornered or there are only a few players on their own, the agents will fight.

The players should be able to find and kill the two [[Zhodani]] agents with minimal casualties. However, they should now realise that they have got themselves involved in something pretty big. If either of the agents survived, the players will get no more information out of them than from the previous agents at [[Ao-dai]].

Any corpses will need to be disposed of and all traces of the incident must be cleaned in case any authorities come to investigate. Once that has been done, Martha will suggest that the players leave in case anyone comes to investigate. Martha is not sure if her position is compromised so she will stay and see what she can find out. She will not give up her hotel easily, nor will she want to risk the data falling into the wrong hands.

If the players ask Martha to contact another agent, she will explain that she has no way to contact them. There are several agents that use the hotel as a safe house and a courier comes to collect any new information. It will be a long time before the courier next visits and more [[Zhodani]] could attempt to acquire it from her during that time.

Martha will ask the players to take the data wafer, just in case any [[Zhodani]] do come back. She will also explain that it must get to the right people who can decipher the data. Martha knows that [[Forbes]] had a contact on [[Ruby]] who should be able to help the party.

The contact's name is [[Stephen Muller|'Daniel"]] and he frequents an establishment called [[Ruby#The Factory|The Factory]] in the commercial district in [[Ruby#Sawaiu|Ruby's capital city]]. He is cautious about meeting new people so the players must pass his 'test' before he will even meet them. Martha can not say any more than this, the players must work out what to do when they get to [[Ruby]].

### Fugitives

Before the [[Zhodani]] agents killed [[Forbes]], they left instructions that a fugitive alert should be issued, stating that the players killed James [[Forbes]]. This will obviously divert any Imperial pressure away from the agents.

It will be a while before the players discover that they are fugitives but once they do, they must stay ahead of the alert as it ripples throughout the [[X-Boat]] network.

# DATA

## RUBY

### Making Contact

When the players arrive at [[Ruby]], they must find their contact, "[[Stephen Muller|Daniel]]". They have been informed by [[Martha Redway]] that he frequents a bar called [[Ruby#The Factory|The Factory]] and that they must first pass some sort of test before he will deal with them. The Factory is well known and the players can find it quite easily by asking around or consulting public computer records.

![[Trip-337.jpg]]

## DANIEL

![[Trip-340.jpg]]

See [[Stephen Muller]] and [[Stephen Muller#THE TEST]]

### The Test (part 2)

The players will need to ask about Daniel again and say enough for [[Stephen Muller|Stephen]] to trust them. Once a little trust has been established, Stephen will say that he does know Daniel and can put the players in touch but he must first have more information. The players will need to explain their meeting with [[Forbes]] and his assassination at [[#The Redway Hotel]]. As long as the players are honest and explain their circumstances, Stephen will arrange a meeting for the players.

### THE MEETING

At the appointed time and place, Stephen will arrive to meet the players. If they ask where Daniel is, Stephen will reveal that he is Daniel. If the players have not already explained their needs, Daniel will ask them what they want.

If the players ask Daniel if he knows any other agents, he will reply that he does but has no way to contact them. The few agents he does know always come to Daniel when his services are required.

Daniel knows who can help the players, an expert cryptologist who agent [[Forbes]] used to create the encryption program (Daniel originally introduced them). This contact will charge at least Cr.2,000 for her services and Daniel charges a 25% commission. If the players want this information, they will have to pay Daniel Cr. 500. If the players pay up, Daniel will explain the following:

> The person you need is a [[Vargr]] cryptologist called [[Gakha]]. Gakha lives on [[Mongo]] and works as a computer technician for [[MagnetoDynamics]] but sells her services during her free time.
>
> Gakha is the best person for the job as she designed the encryption program for [[Forbes]]. She can be trusted with the information and she will not sell it on or attempt to deceive you in any way. However, you must inform her that I sent you.'

## Fugitive Alert

Once the meeting is concluded, Daniel will inform the players that a fugitive alert has just reached [[Ruby]]. The alert is for suspects wanted for the murder of Imperial citizen James Forbes. The details include descriptions of the party and their ship. Depending on the players' actions at [[Ao-dai]], they may also be wanted for the murder of the [[Zhodani]] agents and the theft of the [[#Zhodani Scout Ship]]

The players will have to leave immediately if they are to avoid a run in with the law. If they do delay for any reason then there is a chance that their ship will be inspected before it departs and they will be discovered. If this happens they will have to fight their way off the planet or they will be arrested and tried for the murder(s) as detailed in [[#Arrested]].

## MONGO SYSTEM

See [[Mongo#Details]]

> [!info]- GAKHA
>
> [[Gakha]] is a skilled computer technician but her speciality is cryptography. She was introduced to James [[Forbes]] several years ago by [[Stephen Muller|"Daniel"]]. Gakha devised an encryption program for [[Forbes]] so that he could protect his data. She has always been loyal to [[Forbes]] and the [[Imperium]].
>
> She has been a computer technician at [[MagnetoDynamics]] for almost a year and has recently become quite friendly with two other technicians, Amy Lockheart and a [[Vargr]] called Ruskad. Gakha thought she was helping them to fix a network problem but they used her to gain access to some confidential files. The nature of her job means that she does access restricted systems but she has never copied or read the files.
>
> In retrospect, it has become clear to [[Gakha]] that her new 'friends' were just using her to gain access to the files that they needed. Amy and Ruskad obviously work for a rival company or are independents who sell such information to the highest bidder. [[MagnetoDynamics]] is one of the leading specialists in mineral extraction and their technology is much sought after by rival corporations.
>
> Being a [[Vargr]], [[Gakha]] also has strong loyalties to [[MagnetoDynamics]] so she is understandably insulted that she has been arrested and interrogated. However, with this current situation Gakha believes her loyalties have been misplaced and even if her name is cleared she will not be working for this corporation again.

### Locating Gakha

The players do not have the exact location of their new contact. To find Gakha, they can either enquire at the [[Mongo#MagnetoDynamics HQ]] or attempt to hack the [[MagnetoDynamics]] computers. Whatever method the players choose to obtain the information, if successful they will discover that [[Gakha]] is currently working at the [[#MDP 1]] facility.

#### VISITING MAGNETODYNAMICS

The [[Mongo#MagnetoDynamics HQ]] is a plush suite of offices and warehouses. The facilities are high-tech and well maintained to give a good first impression for clients who visit. Public access is allowed into the main building, which serves as their administration and sales reception. The building is clearly marked as the entrance to the MagnetoDynamics site.

The players must pass through the main security gate where they are given guest passes that allow access to the sales building. Access to other buildings requires a higher security clearance. [[#MagnetoDynamics Security Guards]] are situated throughout the site and ensure anyone entering a building has the correct clearance.

Once at the reception desk, the players will need to speak to a human resources manager and they will have to approach the situation with care. They cannot simply ask the whereabouts of an employee, as all personnel data is confidential (except to law enforcement or other figures of authority).

The most common reason for meeting a human resources manager is to discuss employment opportunities, so the players can either arrange a meeting under this pretense or they could actually try to get a job and hope they can make contact once they are on the inside.

Assuming they successfully arrange a meeting, they will be served drinks while they wait for the manager to meet them. After a short time, a smartly dressed man will introduce himself as Mark, one of the human resource managers. He will lead the party to a small conference room and ask what he can do to help them.

Convincing Mark to disobey company policy and give them details on [[Gakha]] will require a Deception or Persuade check (DM -4). He could lose his job for doing this so the players will have to have a good reason for him to do so. However, if a bribe is involved the DM can be raised accordingly.

Attempting to get a job at [[MagnetoDynamics]] will require a Deception or Persuade check by each player depending on what skills they have or pretend to have. They will also be asked the following questions as appropriate:

- Why do you want to work for [[MagnetoDynamics]]?
- What role do you wish to take?
- What skills do you have?
- Do you have a reference?
- Why have you all come as a group?

If the players are convincing enough, Mark will offer some of them a job on a probationary basis but there will only be a few positions available. Details of working for MagnetoDynamics follow.

![[Trip-346.jpg]]

> [!info] MAGNETODYNAMICS
> This medium sized corporation **specializes** in mineral extraction from gases and water. They have three facilities on Mongo, which extract the mineral deposits from the oceans, process the ore and transport it to their HQ where it is sold and shipped offworld.
>
> Each facility is an independent floating platform that can be moved to areas that are rich in minerals. The platforms have several buildings that house the technology needed to filter and process the ore. There is also a landing pad for small craft used to ship the processed ore and carry personnel to and from the facility. Underneath the platform, water is piped through a filtration system that extracts the ore and disposes of the filtered water a short distance away.
>
> Further details on MagnetoDynamics can be found on page 52 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

![[Trip-354.jpg]]

### HACKING THE NETWORK

Hacking the MagnetoDynamics computer network externally requires a Computers check DM –6. However, if the hacker can gain access to a terminal on site, the task only has DM –2. The easiest way to gain access to one of their terminals is in the main administration building (described above) but they will still need stealth and caution to access a terminal without being caught by security patrols.

> [!info]+ SECURITY
> [[MagnetoDynamics]] prefer to handle any security matters themselves and the local law enforcement only get involved if a serious crime has been committed but even then the security force will investigate to the best of their ability before getting the police involved. This approach allows them to keep a handle on security breaches, reducing potential scandals and bad publicity.
>
> Security guards will check the clearance level of anyone boarding a shuttle. Random spot checks are also carried out on the platform but the risk of these can be reduced by avoiding security patrols where possible.
>
> In addition to a dedicated security force, each facility also has a number of detainment cells and 'interview rooms' for anyone caught committing a crime or breaking the corporate rules.

### WORKING FOR MAGNETODYNAMICS

If any of the players managed to get employment with MagnetoDynamics, they will be stationed at one of the three platforms or the main HQ site, depending on their skills and the role they accepted. The party can be split up at your discretion.

Because the players are new employees, their access will be limited and they will be watched closely until they are trusted and have proven themselves. Although the party have an agenda, they will still be expected to work and any deviation from their allotted tasks will have to be done carefully to avoid arousing suspicion.

The players have several options to find [[Gakha]]:

- Now they have legitimate access to the areas they work in, the players can look for [[Gakha]] by asking other employees or even their supervisors. Persuade rolls may be required depending on how the players go about this.
- The players will have easier access to computer terminals so they can attempt to hack the network as described above.

#### MDP 1

Eventually, the players should discover that [[Gakha]] is on MDP1 ([[Mongo#MagnetoDynamics Platforms|Platform 1]]). The only way on to the platforms is by authorized passenger and cargo craft. There are regular flights from the headquarters to each platform for [[MagnetoDynamics]] employees.

![[Trip-354.jpg|200]]

### CLEARANCE GRANTED

If the players have security access to the platform, their task will be much easier. They can simply get on a shuttle and be flown to the platform. Once on the facility, they will have reasonable freedom to search for [[Gakha]]. However, the players are still new so they will not be given free access to all areas and will be supervised much of the time.

### ACCESS DENIED

If the players do not have clearance to be here, they must find a way to get on to the platform undetected. There are several ways of doing this:

- Steal a pass card from another employee. However, once the employee realises that it is missing he will report it and the card will no longer be valid.
- Create a fake pass card with an Engineering (Electronics) check. This is extremely difficult (DM –6) unless the players have an existing card to copy (DM –2).
- Sneak onboard a passenger or cargo shuttle. Security checks are carried out on all passengers boarding the shuttles. However, a small distraction could provide one or two players with an opportunity to sneak onboard.

### ARRIVING AT THE PLATFORM

As the shuttle approaches the platform, the players can see it come into view. The vast, floating, structure looks much like a mining platform. Surrounding the landing pad are six buildings connected via a network of pipes, which filter the water. The processed water is ejected some distance away. The platform is a buzz of activity with workers and loading vehicles.

Once the shuttle lands, the players can begin their search for [[Gakha]]. If they ask around, the players will soon discover that Gakha and several other employees are being questioned by [[MagnetoDynamics]] security and it is rumored that they have been accused of industrial espionage.

[[Gakha]] and her suspected co-conspirators are in the detainment cells whilst the guards question them and investigate the situation. When their investigation is complete, MagnetoDynamics will contact the authorities and have Gakha and her associates arrested. Since [[Gakha]] is the only person who can help the players, they will have to either break her out or somehow prove her innocence.

### PROVING GAKHA'S INNOCENCE

If the players wish to help Gakha, they will need to find out what happened from all parties involved. With a successful Deception or Persuade check DM–2, the players will be allowed to talk to the prisoners.

When the players meet Gakha, she will be suspicious as to why a group of strangers want to help her. However, if the players explain why they are here, she will tell them her story as detailed opposite

If the players talk with Amy and Ruskad, they will both say that Gakha is lying and that neither of them had anything to do with the crime. After all, it was Gakha's security codes that were used to access the files.

The security guards have already found out some information and with a successful Persuade check, they will share their findings. The players can also make any background checks as required.

Evidence against Gakha (discovered by MagnetoDynamics security):

- Gakha's computer has software that could be used to hack and decrypt data files.
- Gakha has been spending a lot of time with Amy and Ruskad.
- Gakha's security clearance was used to gain access to the files.

Evidence in favor of Gakha:

- Gakha is the supervisor for Amy and Ruskad so it stands to reason that they would have spent time together.
- Gakha's security clearance is required for her job and there is no way to prove who actually copied the files.
- Amy and Ruskad only started working for MagnetoDynamics eight weeks ago; Gakha has been working here for nearly a year.
- Background checks on Amy and Ruskad show that they have both worked for several rival companies over the last year.
- Further checks will reveal that Amy and Ruskad were fired from their previous jobs for suspected tampering and hacking.
- The evidence against Gakha is circumstantial.

If the players have enough proof that Gakha is innocent or they have enough evidence that Amy and Ruskad committed the crimes, the security officer will agree to release Gakha. However, Gakha will be suspended and must remain available to answer any further questions that may need to be answered.

If the players are not convincing enough or they do not get enough evidence, they will have to break Gakha out of the cell.

### BREAKOUT

To get an idea of the layout in the security building, the players can ask to speak with [[Gakha]] as detailed above. The players will supervised at all times when in the security building but they will be able to see what security measures are in place.

There are usually two to three security guards present in the building at any time. The cells do a good job of securing suspects but they can be easily opened from the outside with the correct pass card or an Engineering (Electronics) check DM –2.

So, to break Gakha out of the detention cell, the players will need to overpower the security guards, open the cell and then find a way off the platform. The latter part of the plan will be the most difficult as they will either need to sneak onboard or steal one of the shuttles.

If the players are detected, the security forces will attempt to stop them and they will also sound an alarm. Once the alarm is sounded, all shuttles are grounded and non-security personnel must remain where they are.

Once the party get off the platform, they will need to get to their ship and leave Mongo as quickly as possible before the security team catch them. Police will also be notified and if the players' identities are known, they will have a new crime added to their fugitive status.

How smoothly the breakout went will determine if the players meet any resistance after they leave the platform. The quicker the security team can notify the authorities, the more likely it is that the players will have a run in with the law.

### GETTING CAUGHT

If the players are caught snooping in places they should not be or hacking computers, the MagnetoDynamics security forces will detain the players in their own private detention block as described in the Security side panel. This will play out much like being [[#Arrested]].

#### Tools of the Trade

Once Gakha has been freed she will thank the players and, in return for rescuing her, she will agree to help the party for free. However, her home has been searched and her equipment taken and kept as evidence whilst the investigation continues.

Gakha needs her software if she is to decode the data wafer and getting it back from the [[MagnetoDynamics]] security will be extremely difficult (especially if the players broke Gakha out of the detainment cells). In addition to this, the exact location of her equipment is unknown.

Fortunately, Gakha rents a small workshop on [[Lysen]] where she has equipment and copies of all her software. She has always had a safe house in case she ever runs afoul of the law, something that has happened more than once in her line of work. With the fugitive alert out on the party, the players will have to head to Lysen via [[Nakege]].

## NAKEGE SYSTEM

See [[Nakege]] and  [[Nakege II]]

### A New Ship

The party are wanted criminals and the fugitive alert is spreading across Jewell subsector, slowly catching them up. Luckily for the players, their names are not known and the main distinguishing feature is their ship.

Since they have to stop off at the planetary junkyard on [[Nakege II]], the players now have an opportunity to get a new ship. Additionally, if Gakha is informed why the party are getting a new ship she will tell the players that she knows a few people here who could make the trade off the books, so it would be very difficult for someone to determine they had changed ships here.

Not only will a new ship reduce the party's chances of being caught but they can also get a ship with a greater range. Alternatively, the players can modify their existing ship from parts salvaged from the yards to visibly alter the look (within reason) and make any improvements as required. Since they do not know where they will need to go and if none of the players think about improving their [[Jump Drive]], one of the NPCs will suggest this to make sure that they can visit any system in [[Jewell]].

The cost of parts will be very cheap compared to buying the equivalent parts new. The price will also vary depending on the condition. Likewise, the ships for sale are considerably cheaper than buying them new and the conditions of these vary. The players' existing ship will be of a much better quality than the ones for sale, so assuming that they want a ship of similar size and capabilities they can negotiate a straight swap.

The ships and parts available are completely at your discretion. However, it is advisable not to give the players too much power.

They must still feel as if the odds are stacked against them but the new ship should also give them a glimmer of hope.

Once they have their new ship or have made the necessary modifications, they can depart for Lysen.

## LYSEN SYSTEM

See [[Lysen]]

![[Trip-367.jpg]]

### Trouble on Lysen

The last year has seen increasing amounts of terrorist activity on Lysen. A group calling themselves the PFJ (People's Front of Jewell) have claimed responsibility but some fear that they are affiliated with the [[Behind the Claw#Ine Givar]]. The PFJ have focussed all of their efforts on the Hadway region resulting in many deaths and injures.

The Hadway region is ruled by [[Baron Hadway|Baron Edward Hadway]] and his security force has been unable to catch the terrorists. With the fear of continued attacks, many people have fled the region. As innocent citizens have left it has opened up room for other criminal elements to move in. As a result, crime rates have soared and some districts within the Hadway region have fallen into disrepair. One area in particular has become known as the [[Lysen#Hadway Ghetto]] where only the criminal, brave or stupid dare to enter.

[[Baron Hadway]]'s failure to control the situation is something of concern to the people and the other nobles on [[Lysen]]. Many are calling for him to be stripped of his status and replaced by someone who is capable of protecting the citizens. The nobles on [[Lysen]] are discussing ways to deal with the situation in the Hadway region but they are a long way from a solution.

Unfortunately for the players, [[Gakha]]'s workshop is located in what is now the [[Lysen#Hadway Ghetto]]. If the party ask around for information on the ghetto, they will be advised not to go there. A number of gangs have taken residence there, each vying for control of the ghetto. The exact number of people in the ghetto is unknown since anyone who goes there does not return.

### RECONNAISSANCE

Some of the players may attempt to sneak into the ghetto to get a better idea of the numbers and capabilities of the gangs. It should be stressed that this will be difficult and very dangerous. The bigger the group entering the ghetto, the more likely that they will be seen but the better the chance they will have of defending themselves. [[Gakha]] can give directions to her workshop if the players wish to investigate and maybe even get Gakha's equipment if the situation allows.

Stealth checks will be required as the players progress into the ghetto area. There are plenty of burnt out vehicles to duck behind and abandoned buildings to hide in but there are also a lot of gang members roaming the streets. Please refer to [[#The Ghetto]] for further details.

### MEETING THE BARON

Entering the ghetto on their own would not be wise so the players will need some help. The person who is most able to help the party is [[Baron Hadway]], so the players will need to arrange a meeting with him.

As one would expect the baron lives in a luxurious house with his own private security force. Upon arrival, the players will be escorted to a finely decorated room by one of the baron's aides. After a short wait, the baron will come in and greet the players.

The players will need to explain to [[Baron Hadway|the baron]] why they want to enter the ghetto. How much of the true story they tell him is up to them. Although the less said the better, the baron is an honorable man and will not cause any problems for the party now that he understands what trouble is like on the receiving end.

The baron will listen intently to the players. He will then explain that his security force has been depleted. Some have been killed in terrorist attacks, others have presumably died in the ghetto and the majority of the rest have left his service. Only his best and most trusted men remain, most of which are needed to guard here.

The players must persuade the baron to help out, not only for the benefit of the party but also to prove to his people that he is capable of controlling the criminals in his region. Hadway currently feels that there is nothing that he can do but with the combined forces of his security and the players, there is a reasonable chance of success.

Deception or Persuade checks will be required as appropriate but you can give bonuses for how well the players roleplay the situation. Depending on the players' success and motivational speech, the baron will spare up to five of his security guards. If the players were particularly successful, the baron will even join them in the fight to prove that he is still worthy of his position and restore the peoples' faith in him.

Whether the players succeed or fail, the baron will see that the party has a chance of dealing with the situation in the ghetto. To improve their chances of success, the baron will draw up some papers that authorises the party to use weapons on Lysen.

### HIRED HELP

The players, with or without the help of the baron, can also try to hire some mercenary muscle. Talking the locals into helping is difficult and requires a Persuade check DM –2. The greater the success of the roll, the more people that will agree to help but no more than four people will join the players.

Although fewer in number, there are some offworlders at the starport who can also be recruited. No Persuade check is required as long as the money is good. However, there will only be one or two mercenaries willing to do the job.

Anyone recruited in this way will want to be paid. The locals will ask for a small amount 300 credits, since they have a vested interest in cleaning up their home. Offworlders will want considerably more in the region of 3,000 credits, but will settle for 1,000 with a successful Persuade check. If the players have already approached the baron, he will pay half of the costs of any hired help and could be persuaded to pay for all of it on a successful Persuade check.

### THE GHETTO

Regardless of how much help the players get, they will have to enter the ghetto if they are to retrieve Gakha's equipment to decode the data wafer. As they enter the area they will see that the buildings have been left to ruin with smashed windows and broken doors. Abandoned vehicles litter the streets amongst a carpet of rubble and wreckage.

There are four gangs that have occupied the ghetto. Each has between 20 and 25 members but the number changes constantly. Some are killed in skirmishes with opposing gangs and new members join up in the hope of proving themselves worthy. Each gang controls a small territory within the district, with the area in between being a no-mans land where most of the fights take place.

If the players managed to get the security guards and additional hired help, they will still be outnumbered but will rival each of the gangs in force of arms. The party will get glares from gang members wandering the streets but any large party will be left alone whilst in no-mans land. However, once they enter one of the gang territories the violence will begin.

Entering a gang's territory is seen as an attack and the gang will respond in kind. The gang will all group together at a suitable place to confront the attacking party. The gang will shout insults, bang blades and fire their weapons in an attempt to scare the party but the gang will not attack until the players get close. There will also be several gang members hidden in buildings ready to take shots. Once the fight begins, use the following statistics for the various NPCs involved.

You do not need to roll for every NPC. Both sides will take casualties, so just use your best judgement depending on how many are on each side and how experienced they are.

Unless the players use good tactics such as finding cover or using grenades and heavy weapons, the gang will start to gain the upper hand. If the situation does not look good or you want to make things more interesting, another gang will join the fight. The new gang are not here to help the players but are seizing the opportunity to take out a rival gang.

When only a few gang members remain and they are outnumbered, they will run away knowing they are defeated. If the rival gang joined in the fight they will cheer their victory at defeating the other gang. For the players help in the fight, the gang will not attack them. The gang leader will even ask if any of the players want to join him.

### DATA WAFER CONTENTS

```
Date: 026–1105 Agent: [[Forbes]] 212–13

Tripwire weapon confirmed but capabilities unknown. Secret research facility located under Farreach starport.

Believe my position was compromised. Potential leak in intelligence network. Advise caution.

Separatist involvement remains unconfirmed. Ordered agent Cryer (212–24) to investigate unrest on Louzy in Durty city.

Report ends.
```

### GAKHA'S WORKSHOP

The workshop is in one of the buildings adjacent to the area where the ghetto fight takes place. The building used to be rented out as a number of large open plan offices. Gakha's workshop is on the second floor. Luckily, the gang use Gakha's computers from time to time so most of her equipment is still here. There are three situations where the players will likely enter Gakha's workshop:

- The fight is over (as detailed above).
- The players are using the fight as a distraction so one of the players can get Gakha's equipment.
- The players try to sneak in and obtain the equipment and avoid a fight altogether.

If the fight is over then the party can simply go into the workshop and get what they need. If anyone sneaks in during the fight there will be one or two gang members inside who are shooting out of the window into the fight. If anyone enters the building before the fight takes place there will be 1d6 gang members inside. Any Stealth checks have a cumulative DM –1 for each gang member nearby.

### Decoding the Data

Once [[Gakha]] has her computers and software, the party should leave the ghetto while they still can. Once they are in a safe place, Gakha can get to work. Since she devised the original encryption software, it will not take Gakha long to decode the data wafer. Once her task is complete, she will give the players a hard copy of the contents.

Now that they have the data, the players will probably have more questions than answers. However, they will now have the name and location of an agent who was trusted by [[Forbes]] and possibly under his command. With no other leads, the players need to set course for [[Louzy]] before the fugitive alert reaches [[Lysen]].

Before they leave, the players may want to ask [[Gakha]] to join them. She is not essential to the rest of the campaign so her decision to join is up to the Referee. However, since she has nowhere to go she will most likely take them up on the offer.

Gakha can also be of further assistance to the players as she was fortunate enough to have been introduced to agent [[Cryer]] by Forbes. If she is invited to join the players she will be able to recognise [[Cryer]] and vouch for the players. If she does not travel with them, she will give the party a description of agent [[Cryer]] before the players leave.

# CONSPIRACIES

## LOUZY SYSTEM

See [[Louzy]] and [[Louzy II]]

### Liberation Front

See [[Liberation Front]]

### Riot

The players will land on [[Louzy]] in the middle of a demonstration. The majority of the protestors are civilians who have been motivated (some say manipulated) by the [[Liberation Front]]. The starport is in chaos and most of the roads are blocked with demonstrators and police. What started out as a peaceful protest for independence is now escalating as the police try in vain to remove the gathering crowds from the starport.

Once the players disembark from the ship, law enforcement officers will escort the party to a safe area with other traders and travellers who are waiting to enter Durty city. The demonstrators are growing in number and start to fill the starport, blocking any access to the landing pads. More police are called in to attempt to control the crowds but this just makes things worse. Pushing and shoving soon turns to violence, which in turn evolves into a full scale riot.

The party are now caught in the middle between the rioters and the police as the fight spills out of control. The police do not have the luxury of being selective in their targets and are using force on anyone who is fighting but since innocent civilians are trying to defend themselves anyone has become fair game.

The players will be attacked by rioters who deem anyone who is not with them to be against them. Once the players defend themselves they will of course become targets for the police as well. The police will use their stunsticks where possible but will not hesitate to use lethal force when necessary.

Although the police on the front lines are fighting, those unable to help their comrades are making arrests and preventing more people from joining the riot. The police are clearly overwhelmed and the fight eventually spills out of the starport and into the city below. Once this happens the military will be called in, at which point the battle will get even more deadly and the players will need to fight through the crowds to safety.

Depending how the players deal with the situation, they could end up being arrested for being involved with the separatists, especially if they seriously injure or kill any police or military personnel. If this happens, you can use the Arrested encounter on page 88.

### Looking for Agent Cryer

Although the riot is causing many problems, it is actually a blessing in disguise for the players. All that they know about agent [[Cryer]] is that he was investigating the separatist movement here on Louzy, in particular the [[Liberation Front]]. Since the party are surrounded by separatists and their supporters, there is a good chance that agent [[Cryer]] is here too.

Finding agent [[Cryer]] amongst the throngs of rioters is not easy. Each player can make an Investigate check DM –2 every 10 minutes. There is no limit to the amount of times they can attempt this but the longer the players take, the more rioters and police they will have to defend against. If Gakha is with the players, she can also make an Investigate check with no penalty.

### SAVING AGENT Cryer

Agent [[Cryer]] will be seen surrounded by a number of rioters. who are attacking him. He is suspected of being a government agent by one of the more paranoid leaders of the seperatists, who had received a tip off someone was trying to infiltrate the group. He is clearly outnumbered and the players must be quick to his aide if [[Cryer]] is to survive. However, with the players help agent [[Cryer]] can be saved but he will be badly injured. The party will need to get him out of the riot zone and tend to his wounds.

Once the party is in a safe area and [[Cryer]]'s injuries have been treated, the players can explain their situation. If Gakha is with the party, [[Cryer]] will remember her and she will vouch for the players loyalty and expertise.

After the players have made contact with agent [[Cryer]], you can decide whether to keep Gakha in the party or not. Her skills may be useful but if you feel that your party is too big at any time then she can leave either in response to a situation or simply by saying that travelling with the players is too dangerous.

[[Cryer]] will be sad to hear that agent [[Forbes]] has been killed but will thank the players for their help. After reading the contents of Forbe's data wafer he will look concerned, explaining that he and [[Forbes]] had suspected a leak for some time and these recent events would seem to confirm this.

Having lost his friend, mentor and superior, [[Cryer]] has nowhere to turn. He does not know who to trust within the Imperial intelligence and much is at stake. Since the players are clearly capable individuals, who are loyal to the Imperium, [[Cryer]] will ask for their help.

[[Cryer]] will need help if he is to uncover these conspiracies that threaten the Imperium. He has few funds with which to pay them but once the leak is found and the threats dealt with, he is certain that the [[Imperium]] will compensate the party well for their assistance.

Assuming the players agree, [[Cryer]] will reveal that there is a connection between the separatists and the Zhodani's new Tripwire weapon. He is unsure of the details but he has a number of leads to pursue.

The players may also wish to confess their current fugitive status if they have not already done so and [[Cryer]] will most likely find out anyway. Agent [[Cryer]] will simply say that with the intelligence leak, he is operating on his own and could well be listed with them once the enemy finds out that he is also involved.

### Cryer'S LEADS

Agent [[Cryer]] has confirmed that the [[Liberation Front]], the group responsible for the riot here on Louzy, have some connection to the Zhodani. [[Cryer]] also suspects that the Federation of Arden may also be involved. He has a number of leads on the planets located in the rimward region of Jewell. Each one needs to be investigated:

- 871-438: This planet is a known haven for pirates, smugglers and anyone wishing to avoid Imperial contact. There is a good chance that the [[Liberation Front]] buys weapons and other contraband from people working out of this world.
- Gougeste: [[Cryer]] has suspected this world of separatist involvement due to the Arkesh Spacers (see page 35) outpost that exists here. The party must infiltrate the organization to see what connection, if any, exists between the two groups.
- Utoland: This world has recently been taken over by the Federation of Arden. [[Cryer]] has learnt that a member of the [[Liberation Front]], called Miranda, is located here so there could be a link here too.
- Zenopit: Even though this is an independent world, there have been several reports of [[Liberation Front]] activity here.
- Zircon: The [[Liberation Front]] has been quite active here and [[House Mallor]], who govern the planet, have done little to quell the revolt. The Federation of Arden also have some influence on this world.

Agent [[Cryer]] will tell the party that he will attempt to infiltrate the [[Federation of Arden]] on Utoland whilst the players investigate the other leads. Agent [[Cryer]] has a safe house on [[Pequan]] in the town of Neguda. He will give directions and suggest that they all meet there in approximately 12 weeks time, as detailed in the next chapter.

The players can investigate these leads in any order they wish but since agent [[Cryer]] needs to establish himself independently on [[Utoland]], the players should ensure that they arrive separately.

> [!info] Federation Notes
> The players should hopefully assume that there is a connection between the separatist movement and the [[Federation of Arden|Federation]]. However, there is no direct link other than the fact that both parties are a potential threat to the Imperium's control over Jewell subsector. Allow the players to pursue this line of enquiry and do nothing to discourage their paranoia and conspiracy theories.

## 871–438

### Liars, Guns and Money

There will be four ships here when the players arrive at [[871-438]], three in the starport and one in orbit. As the party disembark they will be met by two smuggler crews and a mercenary group, all of whom will greet the players with suspicion and guns. There are several approaches to dealing with the people here:

- If the players planned ahead, they could have some contraband that they can attempt to sell to the right buyer, thus giving them a believable reason for being here.
- A similar strategy is to come here under the pretense of wanting to purchase illegal goods.
- The players could say that they are looking for mercenaries or another service offered by the people who frequent here.
- The party could try a more honest approach and state that they are looking for someone but explaining why will probably be followed by gunfire.

For any NPCs encountered here, you can use [[#Random NPC Table|the appropriate statistics]]

Assuming the players have been accepted into the criminal fraternity, the initial hostilities will lessen but many people will still be suspicious of the party. Drinking and gambling with the people here will help gain some trust (as much as these people trust anyone).

Once the party has established themselves, they can ask about involvement with the separatist groups. The subject will have to be approached in the right way to avoid drawing suspicion. Simply asking if anyone deals with the [[Liberation Front]] will make the people here think that the party are Imperial agents.

However, asking about joining or helping rebel groups will be viewed more favorably as most criminals agree with dissident principles, even if they do not support them directly. Many smugglers will say that they do business with these groups as they tend to buy in bulk, making it quite profitable. No real information can be gained since most smugglers simply make the trade and avoid getting involved in political situations.

After a few late nights of drinking and gambling, a Vilani smuggler by the name of Meshaka will arrive. If the players share a few drinks with him, he will reveal that he often sells to the [[Liberation Front]]. He seems to know more but will not give any further details. The players could offer him some money for the information but his price will be high.

Alternatively, the players can interrogate him. To do this they will need to apprehend Meshaka, hopefully without drawing the attention of his crew or other outlaws.  Meshaka will soon break and tell the party anything they wish to know.

### GUNNING FOR THE CAUSE

Meshaka has some vital information about the [[Liberation Front]]. He is selling a small consignment of weapons to them in approximately 24 weeks. However, the deal is not just the sale of the weapons, the Front also want Meshaka to smuggle the goods onto Jewell for them. If the players ask what weapons are to be smuggled, Meshaka will say that the job is for two laser rifles with mounted laser sights.

### OPTIONAL ENCOUNTERS

There is always the opportunity for brawls and gunfights on [[871–438]]. The players can be accused of cheating, lying, stealing or simply offending an unruly pirate. You can also have a fight between rival groups and the players get caught in the middle. The fight could even involve Meshaka, forcing the players to protect him so that they can get the information they require.

## GOUGESTE SYSTEM

- [[Gougeste]]
- [[Arkesh Spacers]] and especially [[Arkesh Spacers#^asocsecurity|the security detail]]
- [[Gougeste#NPCs|Individuals of Note]]

> [!info]- THE FACTS
>
> The Arkesh Spacers do not have any direct involvement with any separatist or terrorist group. However, there are individual members that do support such groups or are actively involved with them but this is done without the knowledge or consent of the Arkesh Spacers and is in fact prohibited in the code of conduct.
>
> Consequently, the players will not find any evidence to support [[Cryer]]'s suspicions but they might discover the activities of some individuals (as mentioned previously). This can be achieved by cross-referencing the travel plans (where known) of Arkesh Spacers members with known separatist or piracy events and also by finding any outspoken individuals or member companies.

### Investigating the Spacers

Finding out what involvement the Arkesh Spacers have with the separatist movement can be done in several ways including hacking computer systems, infiltrating their organization, interrogating employees and observing their activities.

#### HACKING

The [[Arkesh Spacers]] computer network can only be accessed from inside their facilities in the Commercial Dome and the best candidate for this would be the ASOC building. Although the building security is good, there are several computer terminals that can be accessed without being spotted by the security cameras.

The computers have standard security measures, which can be bypassed with a Computers check DM –2. Once in the system, there will be no evidence linking the Arkesh Spacers to illegal activities or to the separatist movement.

If the players get information on known travel plans of member companies, they can compare this data with known piracy attacks and separatist events. Cross-referencing the data in this way requires an additional Computers check but there will be no conclusive evidence as there are too many names.

They need to narrow down the list which can be done by accessing the reports and survivor logs filed on acts of piracy. A separate Computers check DM +2 is required to access this information and will reveal that the majority of attacks were carried out by a [[Vargr]] crew. If Vargr crews are cross-checked against the travel plans (with an additional Computers check), the only Vargr that was near all of the reported cases is [[Nangu]].

#### INFILTRATION

Infiltrating the organization is time consuming but will give the players easy access to the computers and employees of the [[Arkesh Spacers]]. To infiltrate the corporation, the players will need to successfully apply for jobs. The job interview process will be similar to the players' experience in the previous chapter with the interviewer asking about their skills, experience and their reason for wanting the job. The [[Arkesh Spacers]] outpost here on [[Gougeste]] is a big organization so there are always job vacancies for a variety of roles.

Once they are employed by the company, the players will be able to access most non-essential systems and facilities, depending on their actual job description. Of course, there will be supervisors and other employees so the players must be careful if they go snooping around.

The players can also get to know some of the employees both at work and in more sociable environments. There are always workers who have a drink or two once they clock off for the day. It will become evident after a while that there is no obvious evidence that suggests the Arkesh Spacers are involved in anything suspicious or illegal.

#### OBSERVATION

The players can observe employees of the [[Arkesh Spacers]] by hanging out in the venues where the workers spend their spare time. The Spacers Retreat will not allow the players in unless they are a member or employee of the Arkesh Spacers but the players will have no problem getting into Oasis.

If the players are allowed into [[Arkesh Spacers#The Spacers Retreat]] (or they bluff their way in) then they can talk to various employees of the Arkesh Spacers. The players will not get any information about illegal activities or connections to the separatist movement but they can get small details about the security in the ASOC building with some subtle Deception or Persuade checks.

If the players spend a few days in [[Arkesh Spacers#Oasis]] they will hear lots of gossip and news but nothing of real interest to them. That is until Jessica Nash arrives a few days later. After a few drinks she will get into a heated debate with one of the locals about independence and the conversation can be heard by anyone nearby.

If the players listen more carefully they will discover that she supports free speech and the people's right to make their own decisions and to be in charge of their own destiny. The players can also speak to the locals here who will explain that Jessica is well known for outbursts like this.

#### INTERROGATION

If the players spend some time questioning the locals and employees, there will be nothing to suggest that anything illegal is going on here. The players can easily discover the names of Tina Hendrickson and Morgan Fairfax as key individuals at the outpost but nothing untoward will be said about them.

The players might want to question Tina and Morgan. This could be done in a civilised fashion by arranging a meeting, visiting them at home or talking to them in a bar. There is also the option of kidnapping and interrogation but this is rather unnecessary and will seriously harm any future relationships. Whatever method is used, the party will not glean any incriminating evidence but Tina will reveal that there are some unknown individuals who have been giving the organization a bad reputation.

### Wrapping Up

If all has gone well, the players have interrogated Jessica Nash and discovered that [[Nangu]] is a pirate. The party must now decide what to do with [[Jessica Nash]] and whether to pass on their findings to the Arkesh Spacers.

The best way to deal with Jessica is to hand her over to the Arkesh Spacers security force. The players may also explain their other findings to them. Either way, before the players leave Gougeste, Tina Hendrickson will request that the players meet her in the [[Arkesh Spacers#ASOC]]. Tina will then thank the players for their help. She will tell them that they have made an ally today and she would like to offer the party free membership to the Arkesh Spacers. If the players have recently joined the organization (most likely to aid their investigations), Tina will refund their fee but their membership will still be valid.

### Finding Nangu

This is an optional scenario where Tina asks the players to track down [[Nangu]] and bring him back here so the Arkesh Spacers can prosecute him under Imperial high Law and help rebuild the organization's reputation. If you do not wish to run this side quest, Tina will assign her own men to the task.

If the players agree Tina will pay them Cr. 50,000 now, plus Cr. 5,000 for each pirate that they apprehend and Cr. 25,000 for catching [[Nangu]] alive. If any of the pirates are killed, the players will only get half of the fee.

Tina will also give the players details of [[Nangu]]'s ship (use any spacecraft that is of a similar size to the players' ship) and his planned route, which he filed two weeks ago. It indicates that he will not be back on Gougeste for some time so the quicker he can be caught, the more potential victims can be saved. [[Nangu]]'s planned route is as follows; Zenopit, Zircon, Pequan, Utoland, Lysen, Emerald, Gougeste.

#### INTERCEPTION AT ZIRCON

If the players leave today, they should be able to catch [[Nangu]] at Zircon. Once in the Zircon system, the players will have to pilot their ship in a search pattern until they find [[Nangu]]'s ship. They will detect several ships during their search and you can even have a false alarm where the players detect a matching ship but it is not [[Nangu]]'s.

[[Nangu]] will not board a ship near a populated world and after 4d6 hours of searching the players will detect a ship that matches the description they have. There is another ship nearby and once they are close enough, the players will detect that both ships are docked.

When they are in visual range, the players will clearly see several distinguishing marks that will confirm that the ship belongs to [[Nangu]]. At close range, a sensor check will also detect high energy signatures indicating gunfire onboard the second ship.

The players must now board the ship and fight off [[Nangu]]'s crew. The party can dock with either ship depending on the strategy they use but docking with [[Nangu]]'s ship will allow them to secure the area and prevent the pirates from escaping.

[[Nangu]] and six of his team are on board the second ship and will not expect to be attacked. Two of the pirates are guarding the crew of the second ship whilst [[Nangu]] and his other men are stealing the cargo. There is also a Vargr pilot who remains on [[Nangu]]'s ship so the players will need to search both ships to apprehend all of the pirates.

There is a good chance that some of the pirates will be killed in the fight but the players should try to take as many alive as possible. Remember, Tina will pay extra for each one captured alive as she wants them to stand trial to prove that they were acting independently of the Arkesh Spacers.

## UTOLAND SYSTEM

See

- [[Utoland]]

## Access to Utane

Entry requires a [[Utoland#Trade Permit]].  Luckily for the players, the fugitive alert has not reached [[Utoland]].

### Miranda

Once the players have gained access to the city of [[Utoland#Utane|Utane]], they can begin their search for the separatist known as Miranda. With nothing else to go on, the players will have to make some discreet enquiries to see if they can find anything that will lead them to her.

It may occur to the players that the actions of the Federation of Arden seem diametrically opposed to the ideals of the [[Liberation Front]], so perhaps Miranda is trying to form a new cell here to fight against the federation. This will give the players a new avenue of enquiry and they can focus on subtle questions about resisting or fighting the federation. Although most people will not be forthcoming with such information, some will suggest that the players check out the Blue Room bar.

### THE BLUE ROOM

If the players do not know about the [[Utoland#The Blue Room|Blue Room]], agent [[Cryer]] can find the party and subtly point them in the right direction. However, his contact with the party will be subtle and brief as he does not want to compromise his position as he infiltrates the corporation.

Some of the regulars here will be suspicious of the party when they first enter and the players will often feel as though they are being watched. After spending a short time here, it will become clear to the players that this is a common venue for people to complain about the Federation of Arden and their imposed rulership on Utoland.

In the evening, the players will notice a woman having discreet conversations with some of the regulars. Unlike most people here she does not openly criticize the federation or speak out against them. Instead, she speaks subtly and quietly. There is a good chance that this is the person that they have been searching for. If the players ask anyone who she is or if they approach her directly, they will discover that this is Miranda.

### INTERROGATING MIRANDA

The players must now decide how to go about questioning Miranda. Given their circumstances, they could try talking to her as people wanting to join the revolution. She will of course be suspicious so Deception or Persuade checks will be necessary to convince her. Even if the players are successful, the information that they get will be limited and you can choose what to reveal at your discretion.

Alternatively the party can attempt to ambush and interrogate Miranda. She will be outnumbered and will favor flight over fight but with some careful planning she should soon be in the players' custody. Once the party have taken her to a private and secure location they can begin the interrogation and it will not take much coercion to make her talk.

Miranda will not know anything about the conspiracies that the players are investigating. When asked about the Federation of Arden she will spit, saying that the federation is no better than the Imperium, that the situation here on Utoland is a prime example of their willingness to reduce personal freedom and independence. She will also confirm that she was recruiting potential candidates for a new cell here on Utoland.

If pressed for further information, Miranda will also reveal that the cell she belongs to is based on Zenopit in the city of Orelia. Her contact within the cell is a Vilani by the name of Rimik.

The information obtained from Miranda will clearly prove that there is no connection between the Federation of Arden and the [[Liberation Front]]. The players also have a good lead for when they visit Zenopit. The players must also decide the fate of Miranda.

## ZENOPIT SYSTEM

See

- [[Zenopit]]
- [[Aqua]]

### Loyalties

It will not take long for the party to realise that the attitudes of the Zenopians are not only compatible with the [[Liberation Front]] but most people agree with separatist agenda, at least in principle. Most Zenopians do not actually know the identities or locations of the [[Liberation Front]] members but even if they do, they will not knowingly reveal anything that could compromise the group.

If the players have interrogated Miranda on Utoland, they will know to focus their efforts on [[Zenopit#Orelia]]. If they devise a story whereby they want to join the movement, mentioning Rimik will open a few doors. If the party does not have this information they will find it much harder as they do not have the name of a contact within a cell. There are a total of three [[Liberation Front]] cells, one based in each city.

The players will have to use cunning and guile before they can even get close to members of the [[Liberation Front]]. The fact that the party are offworlders will make it difficult for anyone close to the separatists to trust the players. If the players manage to befriend one of the sympathisers and mention that they want to join up, a meeting can be arranged but first the party will have to prove their motivations and loyalty to the cause.

### SABOTAGE

For their test, the players will be tasked with sabotaging the next Imperial ship that lands in the starport. The goal is to disable the ship to delay its departure and it must be clear that it was an attack by the [[Liberation Front]].

The players will have total freedom to do this in any way they want but they must do it on their own without any help. This is not just a test of loyalty but one of resourcefulness and nerve. The players will hopefully not be thrilled by the task and will most likely plan it to avoid any casualties. The party will be informed that an Imperial ship is in the system and is due to land in approximately 4d6 hours so the players do not have long to plan and execute their strategy.

### THE MEETING

If the players were successful in sabotaging the Imperial ship, they will receive a message several hours after completing their task. The message will request that the party leader go to a specific place at a specific time. The meeting will be at night and at a venue that is private and remote, such as an abandoned tunnel or building.

Assuming that the players are in Orelia, they will be met by Rimik. He will be at the meeting place long before the player shows up. Rimik will make sure that the person is alone, so if anyone else is hiding nearby they must make a successful Stealth check or Rimik will simply sneak off and no further contact will be made.

If Rimik is satisfied that the player is alone, he will speak from the darkness. Rimik will first congratulate the player on completing the task. He will then ask why the party wishes to join the movement and what the players' motives are. If he is satisfied, Rimik will then explain how the cell works.

Until the party can be fully trusted, Rimik will be their only contact and he will give the player his name if not already known. The party must either stay on Zenopit or visit regularly to be of use to the [[Liberation Front]]. When a job needs doing, he will contact the player to give instructions.

![[Trip-434.jpg|100]]

### CAPTURING RIMIK

Unless the players have planned to ambush Rimik at the meeting, they will have to wait until they are contacted again before they can attempt to capture him. If the players wait on Zenopit, they will be contacted several days later. As before, they will be given a message to meet Rimik where they can set an ambush to capture him.

Once they capture Rimik, he will not easily give up information on the [[Liberation Front]] and the players will have to get heavy handed before he will talk. If they are successful, Rimik will explain that he does not know the identities of anyone in his cell as his contact was recently killed. They purposely limit contact between members to avoid the cell being compromised should anyone get captured (such as now).

It will take further persuading and he must be asked the right questions but eventually he will finally reveal that there was talk of assassinating the new duke once he has been appointed to office. However, this was not being done by his cell and he does not know any more details about it.

On that bombshell, the players must decide what to do with Rimik and where to go next. They have found a key piece of information but on its own it is not much use as they do not know the where, when or how.

## ZIRCON SYSTEM

See

- [[Zircon]]

### Independence

After spending some time in [[Zircon#Landaro]], the players will soon gain an understanding of the people here and their attitudes. If they talk to any of the locals, the players will discover that the [[Liberation Front]] is not only popular here but they used to be quite active, causing problems for [[House Mallor]] and the [[Imperium]].

However, the [[Liberation Front]] have not made any attacks since they broke into the [[Zircon#Mallor Estate]] and defaced the building about 20 weeks ago. Since then, the [[Liberation Front]] have freely voiced their opinions without interference from Mallor's law enforcement.

It is unusual for any group like the [[Liberation Front]] to suddenly cease activity or work so openly, so it is a fair conclusion that something must have happened. There are two main avenues of investigation:

- [[#Infiltrating Liberation Front]]
- [[#AN AUDIENCE WITH COUNT MALLOR|Speak to Count Mallor]]

### Infiltrating Liberation Front

Unlike most [[Liberation Front]] cells, the members here do not have strict security measures since they are now free to operate on Zircon (within reason). By speaking to people in the smaller towns, the players will easily be able to make contact with the group.

The players will meet one of the [[Liberation Front]] members, a female Vargr called Inga. Inga will explain that [[House Mallor]] has recognised the group's right to free speech as long as they do not cause harm to anyone or anything. If the players ask why the count agreed to this, Inga will not know but she will say that public opinion of the Count Mallor has improved slightly.

If the players ask Inga about her connection to other [[Liberation Front]] cells and their plans, she will say that the work her cell does here is the true path for the separatist movement and that other groups seem to adopt more violent methods. She is not aware of any larger plans for the [[Liberation Front]].

### AN AUDIENCE WITH COUNT MALLOR

To speak with the count, the players will have to make arrangements through his aide. With his current objective of winning the trust of the people, [[Count Mallor]] is quite approachable and his aide will arrange a meeting.

At the appointed time, the players will be allowed access to the Mallor estate and ushered to a conference room. After a short wait, the count will enter and greet the party. Count Mallor is an intelligent man so if the players attempt to deceive or be subtle in any way, the Count will simply state that the players can get to the point without risk of insult or rebuke.

Once the players ask about his recent decisions concerning the [[Liberation Front]], the Count will explain the situation on Zircon and the tensions between the people here. Although he does not condone the previous actions of the [[Liberation Front]], he understands their philosophy and reasoning.

### CONCLUSIONS

The players should eventually realise that although the situation here is unusual, there is nothing that directly links the people here with the conspiracies known to the players. The [[Liberation Front]] cells that operate here seem to do so independently to cells on other worlds and take a different approach to voicing their opinions. If the players are particularly loyal to the [[Imperium]], they might be concerned with the amount of freedom that [[Count Mallor]] allows the separatists but there is little they can do about it at this time.

# KEYSTONE

##### PEQUAN SYSTEM

The Pequan system has nine planets with Pequan occupying the third orbit. There is also a planetoid belt in the fifth orbit

Pequan 0410 E5656B9–4 Ag Ga NI Lt In 101, Etienne Rasa led a group of colonists here to make their home on this a lush and fertile world. Rasa and his people wanted to live an agrarian lifestyle without the use of advanced technology and without getting involved in the politics and bureaucracy of the civilised universe.

The self-sufficient colony grew at a steady rate as the people turned their hands to farming the fertile lands. Travellers and traders are permitted to visit but there are few facilities to encourage ships to land here and the people rarely trade as there is little they require that cannot be obtained locally. The locals barter goods with each other so the little currency that exists here has come from selling to offworlders. Some people have still got coins that were passed down through generations of their family because they have simply not had a use for them.

Many offworlders find it unusual here for there is no hustle and bustle like most cities and there are no signs of overcrowding or rundown areas. Life here seems to happen in slow motion and after a short time here, most people find it difficult to rush or do anything quickly.

Pequan has been of interest to the Imperium, the [[Zhodani]] and more recently the Federation of Arden. However, Pequan has refused to become a part of any government or political faction, including groups from the separatist movement. Pequan is ruled by descendents of Rasa and to this day the colony has remained completely independent and neutral.

### ATTITUDES

The inhabitants of Pequan are an agrarian people who are content with the lifestyle that they maintain on this paradise world. Although determined to preserve their way of life, the people here are not isolationists and welcome travellers, not so much to trade with them but to encourage them to stay here and share their way of life.

Pequan has a stable and peaceful society. This is not just a result of their way of life but their strict legal system that imposes harsh penalties for any crime that would upset the status quo.

### LAWS

Travellers are permitted to land here but there is a strict ban on all weapons and technology TL 4, except within the confines of the starport. Anyone found breaking these laws will be exiled from

Pequan. Anyone caught using a weapon will be imprisoned and murder carries the death penalty.

### PLACES OF INTEREST

Rasa: The capital city was named after its founder, Etienne Rasa. Like all settlements on Pequan, the buildings are modest structures constructed from wood and stone. There are very few shops here as most trade is done at the daily market in the city center. There are several inns spread around the city, many of which provide accommodation.

Neguda: The small town of Neguda is situated roughly 10 km north of Rasa. It is much like Rasa but only has a population of several thousand. Agent [[Cryer]] has a safe house here that he uses occasionally.

Rendezvous with [[Cryer]] When the players land at the primitive starport on Pequan, local officials will greet them and explain that all weapons and technology must not leave the starport. The players will notice that agent [[Cryer]]'s ship is here so he must be in the safe house he spoke of.

Following agent [[Cryer]]'s directions the party head for Rasa, which is less than a kilometer east of the starport. Since technology is not allowed, the party will have to walk there. Once at Rasa they must head north out of the city and walk for roughly two hours until they arrive at Neguda. [[Cryer]]'s safe house is the outermost building on the east side of the town.

### SAFE HOUSE

As the party approach the house, they will see that it is located a good distance from the rest of the community. It is a small single storey building that shows some signs of neglect. If they approach with caution they can each make a Recon check DM –4 and if successful they will hear a voice from inside that does not sound like agent [[Cryer]].

Stealth rolls are required to successfully sneak up to a window and look inside the house. Peering through the window the players will see that agent [[Cryer]] is tied to a chair and being tortured by someone. The man is holding a blade and if the players look carefully they will see that he also has a laser pistol strapped to his leg.

If the players do not spot the torturer and just blunder in, they will be met by laser fire. Since the players will not have any weapons on them, they must find cover and devise a way to subdue the man. The players could get the local law enforcement involved but by the time they get here [[Cryer]] could be dead and the authorities could also cause problems for the party.

If the torturer is not aware of the party they will have the element of surprise but will still have the disadvantage of being outgunned. The torturer is actually a [[#Traitorous Imperial Agent]] who is secretly working for the Zhodani.

The players will eventually be able to subdue the agent but there could well be some casualties. Agent [[Cryer]] will be in bad shape but with food and medical treatment he will make a full recovery, with a few scars to remind him of the ordeal. [[Cryer]] will explain that he must have been followed by the torturer.

### INTERROGATION

The man is obviously an agent but who does he work for and why was he following [[Cryer]]? The party can interrogate the agent to get some answers but he has been trained to endure torture and will reveal very little. Depending on the success of the interrogation and the agent's resistance, he can reveal any of the following facts:

- He is actually half Zhodani.
- His job was to track down agent [[Cryer]] who was suspected of working with agent Forbes.
- He was to find out what [[Cryer]] knew and then terminate him and any associates.
- He does not know the details of the [[Zhodani]] plans, only that someone in a position close to the new duke is a traitor.
- The duke has something that the [[Zhodani]] want but the agent does not know what it is.

If the players ask about the new duke, [[Cryer]] will explain that a new duke for Jewell subsector has been chosen and the inauguration ceremony is planned to take place on Jewell in six weeks time.

Once they realise that no other information is forthcoming, the players must decide what to do with the agent who now knows the identity of everyone in the party. [[Cryer]] will be very blunt and say the agent must be killed to maximise their chances of successl.

### Putting the Pieces Together

Once the situation with the agent has been dealt with, agent [[Cryer]] and the party can exchange information and discuss the way forward. If he has not already done so, agent [[Cryer]] will pass on the news about the new duke.

[[Cryer]] will explain that his investigation turned up no evidence that the [[Liberation Front]] are involved with the Federation of Arden and are in fact opposed to them. No other evidence was found linking the federation to the conspiracies. The players can explain their findings and assuming they have been successful on all of the worlds, they should now know the following facts:

- The [[Liberation Front]] is paying for weapons (two laser rifles) to be smuggled on to Jewell. The specific timing of this coincides with the inauguration of the new duke.
- The Arkesh Spacers are not involved with the separatist movement.
- The [[Zhodani]] have agents in the [[Liberation Front]] and possibly other groups. Their job is to manipulate the separatists to cause dissention and unrest within the Imperium.
- The Federation of Arden is not involved with any political groups and the separatists are actually opposed to them.
- The [[Liberation Front]] are based on Zenopit and want total independence from the [[Imperium]] and any other political
  faction.
- The [[Liberation Front]] are planning to assassinate the new duke of Jewell subsector.
- [[House Mallor]] are using the separatists for their own agenda but [[House Mallor]] are not involved in the conspiracies.
- Someone in a position close to the new duke is a traitor. A good assumption would be that this person will somehow aid in the assassination.
- The duke has something the [[Zhodani]] want, which is most likely the reason he is being assassinated.

The key fact they should now know is that the [[Liberation Front]], under the influence of the Zhodani, plan to assassinate the new duke at his inauguration ceremony. The players must discuss how they can prevent this but given the time scale they must leave now and work out the details en route to Jewell. Agent [[Cryer]] will take his own ship and they can discuss any plans during their refuelling stops.

The main problem that the party has is they are wanted fugitives and there is a good chance agent [[Cryer]] might also be wanted now if the enemy suspects that he may know too much. [[Cryer]] will say that since they do not know who can be trusted, he will have to work in an unofficial capacity and stay off the radar. However, on the plus side, Jewell is overcrowded so it is unlikely they will be noticed unless someone is specifically looking for them.

## JEWELL SYSTEM

See

- [[Jewell]]

## Inauguration

The inauguration of Duke Benoit Zahn is scheduled to take place in two days at midday. The ceremony will take place at the park in the Imperial Dome. Security around the park will be high but public access will be allowed. Live holographic feeds will be projected around the planet so the general population can watch the ceremony as it happens.

Agent [[Cryer]] and the players have several objectives. They must attempt to save the duke's life, reveal the traitor and expose the assassins from [[Liberation Front]]. The party does not know exactly when the assassination attempt will take place but it is a safe assumption that it will be done at some point during the ceremony when the duke is most vulnerable.

As [[Cryer]] has already pointed out, they are not able to go to the authorities in case the party unwittingly reveal what they know to the enemy. If this happened, the assassins might be tipped off and the players would be silenced, permanently. The players are also fugitives and would be imprisoned and charged for the crimes of which they have been accused. This means that the players are on their own.

The second problem that the players have is that weapons are illegal on Jewell so any attempt to stop the assassins will have to be done with improvised weapons. The players could attempt to smuggle in some weapons but the additional security will make it very difficult and if the players were caught it would not look good considering their existing crimes.

The players must plan their strategy very carefully as they will only get one attempt to save the duke's life. The players should have enough information to determine that there will be two [[#Jewell Assassin|assassins]], each with a laser rifle but this might not be apparent to them. Allow the players to discuss their options but if they get stuck, agent [[Cryer]] can suggest any of the following:

- The duke will be most vulnerable when he makes his speech on the park dais. Part way through the speech Governor Gray will relinquish his position to Benoit, symbolised by handing over the Jewell keystone. When Benoit accepts the keystone he will be pronounced Duke of Jewell subsector.
- The players should investigate the park and look for potential areas where an assassin might shoot from, taking into account access and trajectories.
- The best long ranged weapon would be a laser rifle but that would be difficult to smuggle past security.
- Short ranged weapons would be easier to smuggle in but will drastically reduce the options of where to shoot from and increase the chance of being caught.
- The [[Liberation Front]] are extremists so it could be a suicide shooter or bomber.
- There could be multiple assassins.
- The party need to look out for the traitor to see what his part is in all of this.
- The traitor might be involved in the assassination or he might have another role to play.
- A risky option is to somehow have a secret meeting with the duke to warn him about the assassins and the traitor.

### THE KEYSTONE

The keystone is a small hexagonal prism made from a diamond like substance and edged in pure lanthanum. It is exactly 10cm long by 4cm wide. It is believed to be some sort of key left behind by the Ancients but its origin or purpose has never been confirmed.

The keystone was found at the site of Facet when it was first being constructed. It has become a symbol for the prosperity of Jewell and is always given to the highest ranking governor as a mark of office. The people of Jewell place great value on the keystone so it is always safely locked away until it is needed for public ceremonies.

Keystones are in fact used to activate  [[#The Tripwire Device]]s  that have been discovered by the Zhodani. The [[Zhodani]] have their own keys but the Jewell keystone represents a potential threat to their new weapon, should the [[Imperium]] discover its secret. The [[Zhodani]] have therefore planned the assassination of the duke (which has benefits of its own) so that one of their agents can swap the keystone for a fake.

If a keystone is on the same planet as a Tripwire device the keystone will glow, getting brighter the closer it is to the device. If the correct keystone is inserted into a Tripwire device it will activate. The keystones found by the [[Zhodani]] only work on specific devices but the Jewell keystone is the master key that can be used on any device.

### SECRET MEETING

This is a risky and difficult move but the players can attempt to sneak past the duke's personal security detail and speak with him. The duke will be visiting various places before the inauguration so the players can pick the most opportune moment to do this, perhaps even arranging a distraction.

It is up to the players to decide how much to tell the duke but the more they say the more believable and shocking it will be. Persuade checks will be necessary and if agent [[Cryer]] is present, the players will get a +2 DM. If the players are successful, the duke will listen to any suggestions that they have but he will not cancel the ceremony as it is too important.

The players must advise the duke not to share this information with anyone until they know who can be trusted. The players will hopefully find the assassins before they shoot but the duke should wear hidden armor just in case. The players may also want to fake the duke's assassination in the hope that the traitor will reveal himself.

### CEREMONY

When the day of the ceremony arrives, the players must ensure that they are prepared and in position for whatever plans they have in place. If they plan to find the assassins they will need to be watching the correct areas, preferably searching the buildings.

The assassins are in the Visitors Centre and Ministry of Trade where the security is weakest. However, the players might need to hide from approaching security guards in case they are detained as fugitives. If the players find the assassins before they shoot the duke, the perpetrator's can be questioned. The players may also wish to take the shot if they are planning to fake the assassination and draw out the traitor.

To spot the assassins from the outside requires a Recon check DM –4. If searching the buildings then the players must make an Investigate check DM –1. Both assassins will shoot as the duke is being presented with the keystone.

The traitor is the duke's aide and he will wait until the duke has been shot before he makes his move. In the chaos and confusion that will follow the shooting, he will swap the keystone with a fake.

The dome will be busy and the park is crowded with people from all walks of life here to see the inauguration of the new duke. Security guards and police are everywhere and it is difficult to move through the throng.

This is a major situation for the players so try to draw out the suspense as much as possible. Frequent Recon checks should be made to build the paranoia. The players will catch the eye of security guards and police, forcing the players to move further into the crowds. Some people will look suspicious but upon closer examination they will not appear to be concealing any weapons.

When the ceremony starts, there will be a series of speeches from a number of nobles. The players will have their attention focused elsewhere so will not hear the details. With the huge crowds and police presence, it will be a slow process for the players. Eventually, the duke will make a speech and be presented with the keystone.

### TAKING THE SHOTS

What happens from this point will depend on what the players have done. If the assassins get the opportunity to fire, they will both hit their target directly in the heart. If the duke was not wearing armor then he will be killed instantly. If the players were able to warn the duke and he is armored, the he will be seriously injured but will survive.

When the duke is hit, he will fall to the floor and drop the keystone. His security guards will surround him as the aide rushes to his side to make the switch. If any of the players were watching they will see all of this happen, as will the duke if he is still alive. While this is going on, the police will seal off the area and do their best to keep the crowds under control.

When the shots are fired, anyone looking in the right area for the assassins can make a Recon check DM +2 to determine where the shots were fired from. The players can then attempt to find and apprehend the assassins.

#### THE DUKE LIVES

If the players have previously met with the duke and he survived then he will vouch for the players. The duke will want to make heroes out of the party but agent [[Cryer]] will insist that their involvement remains secret until the larger threat has been dealt with.

If the players apprehended the assassins, the police will not know who is guilty and arrest the assassins and any players with them. If the players have already met the duke then he will vouch for them. If the duke does not know the players then they must prove that they are the good guys. Agent [[Cryer]] will come forward at this point in an official capacity to help the players, hoping that none of the police have been compromised and are working against the Imperium.

#### THE DUKE IS DEAD

If the players were unable to save the duke then things will be a lot more difficult for them. However, agent [[Cryer]] will still risk coming forward to help resolve the matter and hope that there are no enemy agents amongst the police and security officers.

### VINDICATION

The situation will most likely demand that the party prove that they are not responsible for the crimes that they have been accused of. If they have saved the duke, then that will certainly help their cause and agent [[Cryer]] will also speak on the players behalf.

Unless things went badly wrong, the party will be absolved of all crimes. However, this may not apply in [[Zhodani]] territory where there are agents still out to get the party.

### The Keystone

When the initial chaos is over and the players have been exonerated, they must turn their attention to the keystone. If the players have the duke's ear and saw his aide making the switch, the duke will have the aide arrested and the real keystone will be retrieved. Likewise, if the duke saw this happen the outcome will be the same.

The keystone is essential to the next part of the story so if nobody spotted the switch being made or the aide did not get the opportunity to make the switch, you will need to engineer a situation whereby the players know that the keystone is important. Ideas for this can be as simple as someone else seeing the switch or the aide being caught later on trying to take the keystone.

Assuming the aide is caught he will be questioned and will reveal that he has betrayed his people to work for the Zhodani. When he was given the position of the duke's aide, the [[Zhodani]] made him an offer that he could not refuse, to swap the keystone for the fake. The aide does not know why they want it, only that it is important to them in some way.

Agent [[Cryer]] will ask about other traitors. The aide will know that there is a spy in the Imperial intelligence network but he does not know who it is. [[Cryer]] will suggest that the information they have discovered should remain a secret until the spy's identity is known and he has been captured.

If either of the assassins were captured, they will also be questioned but will only say that they were acting on behalf of the [[Liberation Front]] to strike a blow against Imperial oppression. The assassins are unaware that they were actually servicing the [[Zhodani]] agenda.

### IN THE SERVICE OF THE DUKE

Once it is known that the keystone is more than it seems. the duke (or other noble if the duke was killed) will ask [[Cryer]] and the party to work for him. He would like them to uncover the truth behind the conspiracies and plots, as well as discover the secret of the keystone. He will also pay each member of the party Cr. 50,000 for their help so far and will pay the same amount again if the party agrees to his proposal.

Although many believe that the keystone was left behind by the Ancients, it has not been studied for centuries and has simply become a trapping of office. Perhaps some new light can be shed on it with the correct facilities and expertise. The duke will hand over the keystone and wish the party good luck.

With a bit of investigation, the party will discover that there is an expert on Ancient technology called [[Unkah]] who lives on Emerald.

## EMERALD SYSTEM

See

- [[Emerald]] and [[#Emerald Random Encounters]]

Studying the Keystone Upon arrival at Emerald, the players will need to make their way to Agrellia. Since most vehicles are prone to electrical problems in the area, acquiring transport to Agrellia is virtually impossible. Some locals will take passengers within 10km of the facility but from there visitors must walk the final distance on their own.

### TRAVELLING

Due to the danger of travelling, the cost of hiring a transport will be in the region of Cr. 500. This will include a driver or pilot who will ensure that the vehicle is not taken too close to the hazardous area.

Any vehicle that travels within 10km of the facility must roll 1d6. On a roll of 4–6 the vehicle is caught in an electromagnetic eddy and the vehicle's electrics will fail causing the vehicle to crash. Damage should be determined as appropriate for the speed and type of vehicle.

### THE LONG WALK

Once the vehicle gets to the 10km boundary or has crashed, the players will have to walk the rest of the way. If they hired a transport, the driver will either wait for them or arrange a time to pick them up.

The walk will take the party through woodlands and across the plains. The journey will not be uneventful and is potentially dangerous due to some of the indigenous creatures here. Use a few of the [[#Emerald Random Encounters]] listed earlier as the party makes their way to Agrellia.

### AGRELLIA RESEARCH FACILITY

The research facility consists of three buildings, one is the living area for the resident scientists and the other two have a number of laboratories and study areas. The entrances to the buildings are secured and comm pads provide a means of communication with the people inside.

Visitors to the facility are not a common occurrence so the players will be left waiting for a while before receiving a reply to their communication. Eventually someone will meet them and lead them through the facility to [[Unkah]]'s lab.

[[Unkah]] will greet the players in her shy manner but as soon as she is shown the keystone her eyes will light up. Smiling at the players, [[Unkah]] will tell the players that she is certain that the keystone is something left by the Ancients. The players will no doubt wonder how she knows just by looking. She will be vague in her reply, saying that she is not able to explain right now but if they could take her to Condyole she might be able to shed some light on the situation and give the players some answers.

If she is questioned further, she will be quite stubborn and repeat that she is unable to tell them anything until they get to Condyole. If the players refuse on the basis that she is holding back, [[Unkah]] will explain that she is forbidden by the [[Vexx]] (the native race on Condyole) to speak of it but if she could speak with them, they might be convinced to let [[Unkah]] share her knowledge with the party.

### ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

If any of the players ask about the electromagnetic field in the region, they will be told that several studies have been made. It seems to be a non-focalised naturally occurring phenomenon but [[Unkah]] have been unable to determine the exact cause.

##### CONDYOLE SYSTEM

Condyole occupies the second orbit and is the only habitable planet in the system. The other four planetary bodies are all gas giants.

Condyole 0101 E7A1522–8 Fl NI G Condyole is an independent world located in [[Zhodani]] territory but their attempts to influence the people here has met with minimal success. Since there is little of value to the [[Zhodani]] on Condyole they have not pursued the matter. The indigenous population are known as the [[Vexx]], a humanoid race who were seeded here by the Ancients.

Condyole used to be a world of vast oceans and beautiful horizons but at some point in its history a cataclysmic event turned it into the dry wasteland it is now. The air is poisonous and the water is foul. The [[Vexx]] do not openly speak of what happened but many believe that the [[Vexx]] did this to themselves, whilst others think it is the result of a [[Zhodani]] experiment.

The conditions on Condyole are harsh, the water is tainted and there are few useful resourses. In order to survive on this planet, the [[Vexx]] built a number of underground cities to protect themselves from the hostile conditions. Over the centuries they have slowly rebuilt their civilization and they now number just over 600,000. Some offworlders have made their home here and joined the [[Vexx]] society but such people are rare.

The [[Vexx]] have had to be resourceful in order to survive on Condyole. Each city has a number of wells that draw untainted water from deep underground. The wells are usually located in the larger caverns that serve as market places and public concourses. Each city also has a dedicated hydroponics garden to create a sustainable and natural environment in which to grow food for its population.

### ATTITUDES

The [[Vexx]] are a hard working race who, against all odds, have survived and are gradually rebuilding their civilization. The [[Vexx]] are a patient people who never act without careful consideration and planning.

The [[Vexx]] have little interest in space travel and make no effort to monitor or maintain their rundown starport. Visitors to Condyole are few and the [[Vexx]] are cautious but friendly to anyone they meet.

### LAWS

Random [[Zhodani]] patrols will deter travellers from landing on Condyole but the [[Vexx]] will not prevent travellers from landing here. All dangerous and addictive narcotics are banned but there are no other restrictions on trade and cargo.

### PLACES OF INTEREST

Korondia: Korondia is the capital city located approximately 20km from the starport. Like all of the cities here, it was built underground to protect against the poisonous atmosphere. In many respects it is quite primitive but it is functional and has a homely feel. Technology has its place here but it is used sparingly and only where needed.

[[Unkah]]'s Discovery Six years ago, [[Unkah]] was given permission by the [[Vexx]] to excavate a site that she believed was used by the Ancients. With help from the locals she discovered a device buried under the ground. The [[Vexx]] knew this was something of importance and urged [[Unkah]] to keep its discovery secret. In return, the [[Vexx]] let her spend the next two years studying the device.

Neither [[Unkah]] or the [[Vexx]] discovered what the device was for but [[Unkah]] was able to determine that it was built by the Ancients. The only feature she found on the device was a small hexagonal slot at the base, which she assumed was for a key of some sort. Without a key her research came to a dead end. She left Condyole and the device was secured, hidden and forgotten.

### MEETING THE VEXX

When the players land on Condyole, the keystone will be glowing faintly. [[Unkah]] will introduce the players to the [[Vexx]] and the party will be welcomed into Korondia. The [[Vexx]] only speak their native language of Vexxian, so [[Unkah]] will translate when required.

Once the players are comfortable, [[Unkah]] will have a private meeting with Damo who was her contact concerning the Tripwire device. Whilst [[Unkah]] explains why the party are here, the players are free to explore Korondia and purchase any [[#EQUIPMENT| equipment or supplies]].

A short time later when the players have finished investigating the city, [[Unkah]] will return and inform the players that she has been given permission to show them the discovery made on Condyole six years ago.

[[Unkah]], accompanied by Damo, will take the players to the excavation site. It is located a few hundred kilometers to the south west and Damo can acquire the use of a few cars (vehicles are not common on Condyole but they do exist) if the players do not have their own means of transportation.

### THE SECRET

After a few hours the party will arrive at their destination. Whoever has the keystone will notice that the glow has been getting brighter. [[Unkah]] will be very excited to see this and Damo will seem intrigued.

A short distance from where the party have stopped is a large sturdy hatch on the ground. Damo will tell the party that what they are about to see is known to only a few of his people and they must now swear not to reveal what he is about to show them. Once everyone agrees, he will unlock the hatch and open it. Damo will then activate the lights and climb down to a lift platform. When everyone is on the platform, the lift will begin its descent 100 meters beneath the surface.

When they reach the bottom, Damo will lead the party down a tunnel into a huge chamber that is roughly 100 meteres in diameter where the players will see the Tripwire device, which is currently inactive.

### ACTIVATING THE DEVICE

Once the players have taken in the sight of the enormous black pyramid, [[Unkah]] will show the players the hexagonal slot in the base that is identical in size to the keystone. No doubt the players will insert the keystone, at which point the device will emit the low humming sound and a holographic display is projected from the keystone.

The display is in an unknown language but [[Unkah]] will reveal that it is the language of the Ancients. She will spend some time studying the device before pressing some of the controls, at which point a subsector map will appear with some systems showing in different colours.

### The Tripwire Device

The device is a black tetrahedron (three sided pyramid) standing 90 meters high. When activated with the correct keystone the device emits a low humming sound audible to anyone within 10 meters. Anyone standing this close to the device will get a splitting headache after roughly one hour. After two hours the nose bleeds start and an hour after that anyone still in proximity will suffer a severe brain haemorrhage.

### THE TRIPWIRE NETWORK

Most of the planets in the coreward region of Jewell had a Tripwire device placed there by the Ancients. Together, these devices form the Tripwire network, which is able to disrupt Jump Space.

If two devices are active and they are no more than two parsecs apart, a 'tripwire' is formed between those two devices. Any ship attempting to jump into or through the tripwire will be forced out of Jump Space at a random location (treat this as a misjump as described on page 141 of the Traveller Core Rulebook ). Additionally, the Tripwire devices will also show where the tripwire was triggered.

The only reason that the [[Zhodani]] have not yet activated the network is because they have been developing technology to render their ships immune to the effects. They are now close to realising their goal and once the Tripwire network goes online the [[Zhodani]] will have complete and total control of ships passing through their territories as well as a warning system against any potential invaders.

The map is a direct match to the system within Jewell subsector. Although the players do not know it, the fact that they have the master key is the only reason that they are able to see the map of the Tripwire network. If the [[Zhodani]] had possession of this key, they would have mastered the Tripwire network centuries ago.

The players must work out what the different colours mean but [[Unkah]] can help out if they get stuck but she will incorrectly assume any active devices on other planets show up as yellow and there are currently no orange systems.

Once the players have activated additional devices (detailed in the next chapter) they will soon realise the true meaning of the colour codes and that some devices have obviously been moved from their original designated locations.

By this point, everyone close to the device will be suffering from a throbbing headache. Hopefully someone will have the common sense to either deactivate the device or move far enough away from it, at which point the humming will stop and their headaches will slowly dissipate. If they do not deactivate the device then further symptoms will occur as detailed in the text box.

[[Unkah]] and Damo will want to continue with their research but it should soon become clear that they must have frequent breaks. The longer the device is off during their breaks, the longer they can work on the device before the side effects kick in again. After several days of studying the device, [[Unkah]] will explain her findings. Read out the following explanation to the players:

'This keystone is a master key that has given us greater access to the device and its databanks. There are a number of these devices on several worlds as indicated on the subsector map, although Chwistyoch is now orange and not yellow.

From what we can tell, when any two devices are active and within range they can disrupt Jump Space, effectively preventing anyone from crossing the line between the two devices. We think that any ship affected in this way will also be indicated on the display.'

If anyone asks if there is anyway a ship could negate the effects of this, [[Unkah]] will say that she is not sure. Agent [[Cryer]] will point out that the [[Zhodani]] have at least two of these devices, the one shown as active on Chwistyoch and the one discovered by agent [[Forbes]] on Farreach.

Although they seem to be defensive weapons, if the [[Zhodani]] attacked and relocated one of the devices, they could prevent the [[Imperium]] from taking back any captured worlds. There is also the effect this would have on trade as the [[Zhodani]] would control many of the communication and trade routes. These devices could completely change the balance of power in Jewell and are clearly

### COLOUR MEANING

White No known Tripwire device. Red Designated system but device not currently active. Any device that is moved will remain coloured in red. Orange Inactive Tripwire device in undesignated system. Yellow Active Tripwire device in undesignated system. Green Active Tripwire device in designated system.

### TRIPWIRE HISTORY

The Tripwire devices were built by a faction of the Ancients during their war. How the devices affected the outcome is unknown but before the Ancients destroyed themselves the devices were deactivated and buried. There were seven devices in total, located on Condyole, Clan, Esalin, Farreach, Foelen, Louzy and Grant.

The [[Imperium]] discovered the Grant device in 811. They knew such technology could potentially be very powerful and kept its discovery secret, declaring Grant a red zone system and preventing anyone from even getting close to the planet. Researchers have been attempting to unlock its secrets for centuries but without a key they have made little progress. Unfortunately, the Jewell keystone is not common knowledge and the isolated researchers on Grant continued in vain without knowing that the key they needed was only five parsecs away.

The [[Zhodani]] discovered their first Tripwire device on Farreach in 833 and immediately began researching the technology. However, they did not have much success until the key was discovered in 1090. Soon after, they began searching other worlds for similar devices using the key to locate them.

The [[Zhodani]] found all of the devices except for those on Condyole (possibly due to radioactive interference) and Grant (due to restricted access). With the Louzy device buried under an industrial complex, they were content to leave it buried but they assigned agents to monitor the area in case the [[Imperium]] ever discover it. To establish a defensive border, the [[Zhodani]] moved the Esalin to Chwistyoch and the Foelen device was relocated to Riverland.

important to the Zhodani's plans; important enough to justify the assassination of the duke.

Disabling the Network Once the players realise the power of the Tripwire network and the consequences its use would have, they must devise a way to disable or destroy the network. If the players do not suggest this then agent [[Cryer]] will say that the [[Zhodani]] must be planning something where these devices play an important part and therefore the party must find a way to destroy them.

The party can discuss their options with [[Unkah]], who will have to do some additional research. Eventually she will discover that if at least five Tripwire devices were activated and networked, the master keystone could create a feedback loop that should destroy all active devices in the network. This would mean finding each device and activating it.

[[Unkah]] is confident that the devices can be set to activate on a time delay. The master key can also be used to lock the devices so that once they activate at the designated time, only the master key can deactivate them.

At this point, Damo will make it clear that although the [[Vexx]] understand the danger of these devices, they would like to keep this one intact. Not only would they like to study it further but if they could obtain a keystone then their world could potentially have a powerful defense if required.

The party now have a job to do and [[Cryer]] will ask [[Unkah]] to join them in case her knowledge and skills are needed. The players may have reason to believe that the [[Zhodani]] have moved some devices, so worlds within their borders will need to be searched to make sure that all of the Tripwire devices are found.

If the players have not determined that the keystone can detect the presence of a Tripwire device then [[Unkah]] will point this out to them. She is unsure of the range but it would appear to be planet wide. However, it is unlikely that the keystone can detect a device on the opposite side of a planet so the players will have to be on the same hemisphere to be certain.

If the players suggest that they could search by flying a low planetary orbit, [[Unkah]] will agree that the approach might work but some systems will restrict ships to the starport only.

# TRIPWIRE

The systems listed in this chapter are all the known locations of the Tripwire devices. However, since some have been moved, the players will need to check every system in the [[Zhodani]] region. Once the players land on a planet, they will know if a device is present (whether active or inactive) by seeing if the keystone is glowing. The keystone will glow brighter the closer they are to the device so they can use this to pinpoint the location of a device on the planet.

The party can visit the systems in any order they wish but they will need to plan their route so they know when to set the timed delayed activation for. Remember, if any of the Tripwire devices activate too early, Jump Space could be disrupted in all systems between the connecting devices that are active.

It is up to the players whether they attempt to destroy all of the devices or just those on [[Zhodani]] worlds. Once the players have set the activation of each device and are ready to overload the Tripwire network, proceed to the next chapter.

Visiting the Duke Before the players begin their search, they may decide to explain their findings to the duke (or high ranking noble if the duke was killed). Since the players know there is most likely a device on Louzy and Grant, those devices may need to be destroyed if the party are to be successful in shutting down the Tripwire network.

Duke Zahn will be genuinely surprised when he hears what the players have to say. Like the [[Vexx]], the duke will see the importance of the Tripwire devices and would want to keep any that are currently in the possession of the Imperium. However, if the players make it clear that the [[Zhodani]] have a network of these that are related to something they are planning, the duke can be persuaded that it is better to destroy them all rather than risk the [[Zhodani]] activating their network.

If the players inform the duke as to which Imperial controlled systems might have one of these devices, he will tell them that he knows of nothing like that on Louzy but he does know that there is something on Grant, which could well be a Tripwire device. If the duke has been convinced to destroy the devices then he will give the players an Imperial seal that will give them access to Grant and anywhere else that they will need to go to complete their mission.

## [[Ao-dai]] SYSTEM

Details on the [[Ao-dai]] system can be found on page 9.

### Tripwire Search

If the players land on Ao-dai, the keystone will not glow. Since Ao-dai is a small planet they would be within range if a device was present but they might want to travel around the planet to be sure. Eventually the players will conclude that there is no device here.

> [!warning]- SETTING THE DEVICES
>
> For each device the players find, they must insert the master key and set a time delayed activation command. [[Unkah]] is the best qualified person to do this but she will also show the players what to do in case something happens to her.
>
> Once the key has been inserted, a Computers check DM –2 is required to set the timer correctly and lock the device in the active status (to prevent anyone from deactivating it again). The process is time consuming and takes 1d6+5 minutes to complete so repeat attempts can be made if the players have the time to do so. If anyone fumbles the Computers check, then they will believe they were successful but roll on the [[#Timer Fumble Table]] to find out what happens:

## CHWISTYOCH SYSTEM

See

- [[Chwistyoch]]

### The Chwistyoch Device

The device on Chwistyoch was relocated here from Esalin in 1097 and situated inside the [[Chwistyoch#Military Base]] (See note below). Using the keystone, the players will be able to determine the location of the device but they will not be able to get too close to the base without drawing the attention of the security.

> [!info]- Referee's Info
> A new section was added to the base in 1097 to hide and guard the Tripwire device brought here from [[Esalin]].

As one would expect, security is extremely high and breaking in will not be easy. There are three security towers strategically placed with turret mounted weapons and a unit of [[#Military Base Security Guards|guards]]. Cameras are situated around the surrounding walls that stand 5 meters high. At night time, spotlights light up most of the base and surrounding area.

There are two entrances to the base. The main entrance is for most traffic coming in and out of the base and security check anyone entering the base for valid ID pass cards. The second entrance is located by the hangar and is only used when large vehicles are required to enter or leave the premises.

The party will not know which building the Tripwire device is in until the can get inside the base, so they will need to figure out a way to get inside. There are several options available to the players as follows:

- The players can make contact with the [[#dissidents]] and seek their help.
- The party can create a diversion or [[#distraction]] to help them gain entry.
- The players can try to obtain or forge some [[#pass cards]] to give them access to the base.
- The players can attempt [[#smuggling]] themselves inside cargo containers being delivered to the base.
- The party can try the [[#stealth]]y approach and sneak in undetected.

Once inside the base, the players will also need a way to gain access to the building and get out again without being   detected.

#### DISSIDENTS

Once the players get a feeling for the situation here on Chwistyoch, gaining the support of Onak and his followers could prove beneficial. Making contact and proving that they are trustworthy will be the players' biggest challenge but this should be something they are used to by now.

The same process and principles apply here as with other groups that the players have tried to infiltrate and join. Onak and his group will of course be suspicious but since [[Unkah]] knows so much about the [[Vexx]] and also speaks their native tongue, she will be invaluable in gaining the trust of the dissidents.

Once the players are trusted they will be introduced to Onak and will soon understand why he has gained such a following. He will immediately come across as intelligent and very charismatic.

It is up to the players to decide how much to tell Onak but they will feel as though they can trust him. The more they explain, the more likely it is that Onak will agree to help them. If Onak is told the full extent of the Zhodani's plans he will be eager to help the players to stop the Tripwire network from being used as it could seriously affect the people in Vexxtown.

The players must make a Persuade check to convince Onak to aid them in their task. You can give a DM bonus depending on how much they tell Onak. Once the party have Onak's support, they must discuss strategies of how they will gain access to the base as listed above but with Onak's help their task should be easier.

#### DISTRACTION

Creating a distraction to divert the attention of the bases' security guards might be necessary or at the very least aid the players in their plans. The nature of the distraction will vary depending on their specific plans but the support of Onak and the dissidents could be vital here.

#### PASS CARDS

In order to obtain a pass card the players will have to steal one from someone who has access to the base. Anyone serving on the base will have a full access pass card and some merchants (such as Kuno) have limited access cards that allow them to make prearranged deliveries.

Anyone who has their card stolen will notice within 2d6 hours and will inform security their card is missing. At which point the card will no longer grant access to the base and anyone using it will be detained and questioned (you can use the Arrested encounter detailed on page 88). If the players obtain a card they can attempt to make a forgery with an Engineer (Electronics) check DM –4. If the check is fumbled then the player will not know they have failed until they try to use the card.

If the players use pass cards to gain entry to the base, they must also disguise themselves appropriately. For example, if they are using a merchant's card the players must deliver some goods and unless the delivery is prearranged they must bluff their way past the security guards. Using a card for military personnel would not be wise unless any of the players look like Zhodani.

#### SMUGGLING

The party can attempt to smuggle themselves inside cargo containers destined for the military base. To do this, the players must investigate what sort of cargo is regularly delivered to the base and determine where it is sourced from. They must then find a way to get themselves inside the containers.

The easiest way to accomplish this is to gain the support of the dissidents as detailed previously but subtle investigations and observations can also reveal the information they need. There is a [[Vexx]] merchant called Kuna who makes regular shipments of food to the base, so this would be their best option.

Kuna has a small warehouse with minimal security. It has standard electronic security locks and two security guards monitor and patrol the facility. Kuna is a trusted businessman who has been supplying the military for several years so the [[Zhodani]] only perform random checks on his cargo.

If the players have gained the support of Onak, he will be able to make an arrangement with Kuna to smuggle the players inside and give them a greater chance of success.

Assuming the players successfully hide themselves inside the cargo containers, they will be delivered to the military base. Roll 1d6 and if the result is a six, the [[Zhodani]] security will perform a [[#EVENT CUSTOMS INSPECTION|cargo search]]. The [[Zhodani]] will make a quick Investigate check DM –2. If successful the players will be found and [[#arrested]].

#### STEALTH

The stealthy approach is best done by a small number of people and only those with sufficient skills. Although the base is well lit, there are some areas that remain in darkness so a night time approach will stand the best chance of success. The main problem will be avoiding the cameras and to a lesser extent, the security guards in the towers. Anyone attempting to sneak in must make a Stealth check DM –4 with additional DMs from the [[#Stealth DMs Table]].

Once the players get to the wall they must climb over. Climbing the wall requires a grapple, grav belt or similar climbing aid.

### SEARCHING THE BASE

If the players successfully get inside the base, they must locate the Tripwire device, gain access to it and set the activation timer. Although security inside the base is not as high as outside, there are frequent security patrols and there are also military personnel who will be roaming the facility. Stealth checks will be required periodically with a –2 DM during the daytime.

The building that houses the Tripwire device looks like a warehouse and the front section has a number of crates and containers to support the masquerade. Most of the military personal here are unaware of its presence. The device here is simply waiting to be activated; all research pertaining to the Tripwire devices has been done at other sites.

Once inside the warehouse the players will need to bypass the inner security door to gain access to the device itself. The inner room has been dug several hundred feet below ground level to help conceal the Tripwire device inside. There is a small platform with a ladder that leads down to the base of the device where the keystone can be inserted.

Assuming that the players have made it this far without being detected they will be able to set the activation sequence without interruption. However, if they used a distraction to gain entry to the base, an elite security force will eventually check to make sure that the device has not been discovered.

## Return to the Clan System

The Clan system is detailed on page 11 and random encounters specific to Clan can be found on page 12

### The Clan Device

The Tripwire device on Clan was discovered in 1090. Rather than the security overkill used on other worlds, the [[Zhodani]] decided subtlety would be the best approach on Clan to avoid drawing too much attention.

The device was discovered on the opposite side of the planet to the starport near a small settlement. To prevent anyone from seeing the excavation of the Tripwire device, a research facility was built on top of the site before the device was unearthed. The keystone for this device was found during the excavation.

The research facility is actually a fully operational biological research center that specializes in medical research. The research facility has little in the way of security, using standard electronic locks. Scientists work here around the clock and there are always at least three security guards stationed in the building, enough to protect against opportunists but not too much to attract attention.

The Tripwire device is hidden in a secure part of the facility that is marked as a hazardous area containing dangerous biological substances. Access to this room is restricted and guarded by an additional security guard.

There are two main approaches to accessing the research facility, brute force or stealth. Once the players are inside the building, locating the Tripwire device will be a simple matter of using the keystone.

### BRUTE FORCE

The [[Zhodani]] never thought that anyone would discover the Tripwire device as very few people know of its existence, so a simple hit and run tactic is entirely feasible here. Since the facility is in a remote area with minimal security, the players can assault the facility, take down the guards and break into the secured area.

As long as the operation is quick the party should be able to activate the device and make their escape before the police can get to the scene. The plan does have some risk but the party will most likely outnumber the security guards so there will be very little opposition to stop them. Most of the scientists will avoid conflict with the party but a few of them will put up a fight using whatever improvised weapons they have to hand.

### STEALTH

If the players decide to go for a more subtle approach, sneaking inside the building is relatively easy. The party have broken into places a lot more secure than this before so this will be child's play in comparison. All security and stealth related skill checks are standard with no DMs.

The only place where they cannot use stealth is in the secured room where a security guard is stationed by the door. He will have to be dealt with by more conventional methods.

## Return to the Esalin System

The Esalin system is detailed on page 13.

Tripwire Search The party will be able to search by flying their ship in a low orbit around the planet. However, their search of Esalin will reveal that there is no Tripwire device on the planet.

Visiting Martha While the players are here they may want to pay a quick visit to the Redway Hotel and check on Martha. She will be happy to see the players and will offer to put them up for the night. If she had any particular interest in one of the players then she will continue her advances.

Martha will report that no [[Zhodani]] agents came after the players left but she has not been visited by the courier either. Further investigation by [[Cryer]] will reveal that the courier is missing and presumed dead (he was killed elsewhere and no connection to

Martha was established). This is no doubt a result of the spy within the Imperial intelligence whose identity remains unknown.

## Return to the Farreach System

See

- [[#FARREACH SYSTEM]]

### The Farreach Device

The device on Farreach was discovered in 833 and was the only device known to the [[Zhodani]] for over 250 years until they found the keystone. After their discovery, the [[Zhodani]] built the laboratory, military base and starport to facilitate their research of the ancient technology. Even after the [[Zhodani]] unearthed other Tripwire devices, Farreach remained their primary research facility for these devices.

The keystone will glow brightly as the players land on Farreach, confirming that the Tripwire device is beneath the starport. It is essential for the players to set the time delay on this device, without it there is no way of networking five other devices together to initiate the overload.

Farreach has a number of security zones. The starport is in Zone 0 and is the only region accessible by visitors. Zone 1 is for the employees of the facility. Zone 2 is a restricted area for military personnel and leads to the military base. Within Zone 2 is a sub- zone designated Zone 2b where the research laboratory is located, concealing the Tripwire device.

Each zone has a different type of pass card to gain access to that area. With the experience the players have in breaking into secure facilities they should have no problem getting into Zone 1 using the same techniques they have before. However, getting into Zone 2 and 2b will prove much more difficult as the military personnel are all [[Zhodani]] and the party will stand out.

The players will need to devise a new tactic to gain entry to the restricted zones but once they are in Zone 1 they can do some investigation by hacking the computer network (Computers check DM –4) and discreetly asking employs of the starport (Deception or Persuade DM –2). If successful, they will discover that due to the lack of atmosphere on the planet, the starport and military base have an emergency procedure in case there is a breach in the pressure dome.

The procedure states that all non-essential personnel must make their way to rescue bubbles or sealed buildings that are situated throughout the facility. Once safe they must wait for the emergency to be dealt with, at which point they will be notified that it is safe to emerge. If such a breach does occur, the [[Zhodani]] will assume that it is a fault in the dome, enemy forces attacking the facility, a meteor strike or other natural phenomenon.

As a precaution against an attacking force causing the breach, all spacecraft will be launched and placed on high alert. Military personnel that remain planet-side will don combat suits and vacc suits as appropriate. Some will continue to make sure the dome remains secure whilst the rest take defensive positions against a potential ground assault from outside the dome.

With the emergency procedure in progress, party will be able to wear combat suits or vacc suits to disguise themselves without drawing attention. Additionally, with the chaos that will result from the emergency, it will be easier to avoid security checks and patrols as base personnel will primarily deploy themselves to defend against an outside attack.

In order to initiate a breach alert, the players will have to physically damage the dome (not easy as it is self sealing) or hack the computer network to reprogram the safety systems to trigger the alert. Alternatively, they could try to overload the fission reactor that powers the facility but this has obvious risks. If the party is caught at any time you can use the Arrested encounter detailed on page 88.

### BREACHING THE DOME

As one would expect, the pressure dome surrounding the starport and military base is extremely tough and designed to withstand a lot of damage before it is in danger of breaching. However, the structural integrity of the dome is engineered to protect damage striking from the outside, not the inside.

The best chance of causing enough damage would be to set a high explosive charge on the inside of the dome. Once damaged, the dome will vent atmosphere causing loss of pressure, breathable air and gravity. Depending on the severity of the damage this could take minutes or hours. Repair crews will immediately be sent to find and repair the breach.

The difficulties with this plan are getting the explosives, ensuring the explosives are not found by customs and planting them by the dome without being noticed. The players must also consider that they will still need to accomplish their mission once the breach occurs so causing too much damage might hinder their progress. Additional equipment might also be needed such as grav belts.

### HACKING THE NETWORK

Hacking the computer network to initiate the emergency breach procedure can only be done from a secure terminal inside one of the security zones. This can be done from one of the engineering buildings inside Zone1 (such as the power grid control, engineering systems or computer control center).

The usual stealth procedures will be needed to gain access to the appropriate building. Once inside a Computers check DM –4 is

required to hack into the system and an additional Computers check DM –2 to reprogram the safety protocols.

### REACTOR OVERLOAD

This can be done in much the same way as causing a breach, either physically causing an overload (which could result in a large explosion and many casualties) or by alerting the computer safety systems to act as if an overload is in progress.

Causing an overload requires accessing the power core, which has a high level of security (pass cards and security guards) and making an Engineering (Power) check DM –4. Hacking the computer network is done as described above.

ZONE 2 Whichever method the players use to initiate the emergency procedure, once it starts the players must be prepared and act quickly. With their vacc suits on they can move around the facility relatively unhindered. There will be people rushing to safety areas and military personnel trying to control the situation once they are protected by armored combat suits or vacc suits.

Anyone in a vacc suit will have a one in six chance of being stopped by military personnel but amidst the chaos the players can avoid such attention with successful Stealth checks. If the players can obtain [[Zhodani]] issue combat suits then they will not be challenged.

Once the party gets to the Zone 2 perimeter they will have to be cautious but with so many people rushing about during the initial phases of the emergency, successful Stealth checks will allow them to avoid the security guards. An Engineering (Electronics) check DM
–2 is then required to bypass the security system and into the base.

Once inside the military base, the players will have to repeat this process to gain access to Zone 2b. However, there will be security guards monitoring the entrance and checking pass cards. It would be prudent for the players to observe the security measures before attempting to gain access.

set the activation sequence quickly and get out before activity on the base returns to normal as indicated in the [[#Base Return To Normal Table]]

If the players do not have a pass card they can either try to obtain one from someone leaving Zone 2b or try to bluff their way past the security guards with a Deception check DM –4. Failing that, the players can use force to overwhelm the guards but they will have to be quick to avoid being detected, and some of the players will need to take the place of the guards or their absence will be noticed.

If the players mange to get this far then finding the Tripwire device and setting the time delay sequence will be easy in comparison but they must still be on the lookout for security patrols. They must also

## FOELEN SYSTEM

See

- [[Foelen]]

### Tripwire Search

As the players approach the planet, the keystone will not glow. If they attempt to orbit the planet to search for the device a [[Zhodani]] patrol ship will instruct them to land at the starport. Once the players land, they will immediately be met by clerks from the port authority. The clerks will be Chokari, probably the first time the players have

encountered this species. The Chokari clerks will inspect their ship and ask why the party is visiting here.

Whilst two Chokari inspect the ship, a third will do a background check using a hand computer. He will then motion for the players to go inside the ship and follow them in. Read out the following to the players:

_'I am Uren. Do not be alarmed but our records show you are wanted for the murder of several Zhodani. We do not like violence but we do not like [[Zhodani]] either. You tell us why you are really here and perhaps we will help.'_

If the players ask why the Chokari would help the party, Uren will explain the situation here on Foelen. Uren is clever and he will know there must be a good reason why the players risked coming here and will ask them to explain their purpose here. If the players tell Uren they are looking for the Tripwire device or at least say they are working against the Zhodani, Urel will reply as follows:

_'We can help you but you must help us too. There are some of our kind that need passage away from here to start new life. We can help each other, do you agree?'_

Assuming the players agree, Uren will nod to his companions and lead the players to a safe house situated a short distance from the starport. Uren will explain that he will return when his shift finishes and the party should remain here in case any [[Zhodani]] recognise them.

Several hours later, Uren will return. The players must explain that they need to travel to the far side of Foelen and Uren will say that he can arrange transport for them. A short time later, the Uren will drive the party out of Bizentia and head to Kalesh, which is located on the other side of Foelen.

By the time the party arrive at Kalesh it will be night time and there is no indication that there is a Tripwire device on this world. Uren will suggest that they spend the night here and will arrange accommodation for the players.

The following day, the players will have a few hours to spend in Kalesh before Uren takes them back to the capital. While they are here they can visit the market and local shops to buy anything they might need (see page 91 for details of new Chokari equipment). When the players are ready to leave, Uren will take them back to Bizentia.

Cargo

Uren will explain that the Chokari are forbidden to leave Foelen, which is why he needs the players' help to get some of them offworld. Uren will ask the players to smuggle 1d6 Chokari refugees from Foelen and take them to any habitable world that does not have a [[Zhodani]] influence.

The refugees are at the safe house in Bizentia and Uren will explain that although some of his people work at the starport, they only deal with inbound spacecraft. All ships requesting to depart are administered by the [[Zhodani]] who perform random cargo inspections.

The players must plan a way to smuggle the refugees onboard the ship without the [[Zhodani]] noticing. If the players get stuck, agent [[Cryer]] and Uren can suggest any of the following:

- The refugees can be smuggled onboard inside cargo containers.
- The refugees could be disguised by wearing concealing clothes or armor.
- Uren could get some of his tribesmen to cause a distraction,
  which might prevent the [[Zhodani]] from inspecting the cargo as they deal with the disturbance.
- The players might have hidden compartments in their ship where the refugees could hide.

Whatever the players decide, it is entirely up to you as to what the [[Zhodani]] do and how it plays out. If things go badly then the players could simply take off but they will have to deal with the [[Zhodani]] patrols which will either be a Scout or System Defense Boat ship (see page 78 of the Appendix for details).

## GRANT SYSTEM

See

- [[Grant]]

> [!info] Referee's Notes
> The [[Grant#research facility]] was built on top of [[#the Tripwire device]]

### The Grant Device

Since the [[Zhodani]] only have four devices, the device on Grant will potentially be needed as the final device to overload the Tripwire network.

Upon arriving in the Grant system, the players will be challenged by the patrolling fleet. They will have to do some impressive persuading to convince the fleet to let them land on Grant and then access the device. Agent [[Cryer]] will assist here but all Deception and Persuade checks have a –6 DM and can only be attempted if the players make it clear that they know an Ancient device is located here.

However, if the players have obtained an Imperial seal giving them authority to access Grant and destroy the device, their task will be much easier. Once confronted by the fleet, the party must dock with the flagship so they can show the commanding officer the duke's orders. The officer will not be happy but the seal is authentic so he must comply with the party's wishes.

Assuming the players have convinced the fleet commander to allow the party access to Grant and to destroy the Tripwire device, the party must make sure the research facility is evacuated before the network overload is triggered. However, if the party do not have authorization from the duke they will find it virtually impossible to talk anyone into letting the party destroy the device.

One other point to consider is that once the party produce the keystone, the scientists will immediately know it fits in the device and will want it to further their research. If the players are not here on the authority of the duke, the party could find themselves in a situation where ownership of the keystone becomes an issue. With the Imperial fleet in orbit the players might have to relinquish the keystone until they can get the authorization that they need from the duke or other noble.

## Return to Louzy

See

- [[#LOUZY SYSTEM]]]

### The Louzy Device

As the players approach the starport the keystone will glow faintly. Once on the planet, the players will need to take a vehicle to track down the exact position of the Tripwire device.

It is located roughly 500km south east of the starport and as players get closer, they will discover that the device is buried beneath an ore processing plant. The device would have to be excavated in order for the keystone to activate it but in order to do that the processing plant would have to be dismantled.

The players must now decide whether to leave the device buried or try to convince the Louzy government to shut down the facility. However, since the processing plant is situated next to one of the few remaining mining facilities, shutting it down would be catastrophic for the local economy and the government will not allow this to happen.

The players may try to enforce their decision if they have authorization from the duke but the government will challenge this as it would have a serious impact on the livelihood of both the neighboring settlement and the planetary economy.

Another approach is to explain that leaving the device could potentially endanger the lives of the people here. If the [[Zhodani]] ever found out that the device is here (which they do already) they might attempt to take it by force. This argument will carry some weight with the governor but it will still need a successful Persuade check DM –4 before they agree to demolish the processing plant.

Even if the players manage to convince the governor to excavate the Tripwire device, it will take many months and the Louzy government would demand that the [[Imperium]] not only pay for the work to be done but also to compensate the Louzy government for the loss of trade.

Assuming that all this can be done and the players do not mind upsetting the local economy, they will need to figure out a way of excavating the device in secret or risk exposing their operation to [[Zhodani]] spies. If the [[Zhodani]] knew the [[Imperium]] were excavating this device it could lead to a number of unwelcome consequences.

## PUPARKIN SYSTEM

See

- [[Puparkin]]

### Tripwire Search

Searching Puparkin for the device is straight forward as the players will be able to fly their ship in a low orbit around the planet. However, the keystone will not glow signifying that there is no Tripwire device here.

### Quarantine

This is a stand-alone and optional encounter that can be used if the players land here. A ship carrying bio-hazardous material has crashed onto the surface of Puparkin. Contaminants from the cargo have leaked into the lava flows and made their way into one of the energy plants that provide power to Garok.

The contaminants have been superheated by the lava and mutated by the energy harnessing process. This has resulted in a deadly virus being released into the city. During the time the players' sped here, several people have fallen victim to the virus and a quarantine has been declared. The city and starport have been locked down, no one is allowed to leave or enter Garok until the virus can be studied and an antidote found. Not only will the players be delayed but they are also at risk of being infected by the virus.

You can also make the situation more difficult and have some [[Zhodani]] agents appear. They have tracked the players here and are closing in.The players must end the quarantine or break it in order to escape before being caught by the agents.

#### VIRUS

The virus is airborne but does not infect everyone. Anyone who comes into contact with the virus must make a successful Endurance check or be infected. Repeated exposure requires an additional Endurance check to be made every 24 hours. Once infected, the victim will begin to feel tired after 1d6 hours. 1d6 hours later the victim will feel nauseous and death will occur roughly 12 hours after this.

The virus is being spread through the life support system so there is no way to stop it spreading without killing everyone inside the city. However, wearing a vacc suit or similar protective clothing will prevent infection. Access to the starport and ships has been restricted to prevent people from breaking the quarantine.

If the players have protective clothing they can choose to wait out the crisis but they will need to replenish their air supply as it runs out. The quarantine will last 1d6 days before a cure is found (or sooner if the players help out as described below). If the [[Zhodani]] agents are after the party then there is a good chance that they will be found during this time.

Alternatively, some of the players might have the necessary skills to help find a cure for the virus and want to help the Vargr scientists. To do this, the source of the virus must be found. An Investigation will reveal that the contaminants came in through the energy processing plant and from there the players should be able to trace it back to the ship. With the original bio-material, a Science (Biology) check DM –2 will eventually find a cure.

If the players did help to find a cure (they would not have done this single handed but been part of a team) or they helped out in some other way then they will have made some new allies on Puparkin.

## RIVERLAND SYSTEM

See

- [[Riverland]]

### The Riverland Device

The Tripwire device on Riverland was brought here from Foelen in 1097. At the time the device was moved, the underwater city of [[Riverland#Netzba]] was being built so the device was hidden inside the city's water processing plant in a secured area.

The processing plant is used to extract minerals from the water and is situated above the city. Due to its location within the city there are always people in the area, including workers, civilians and security. Security access to the facility requires pass cards and an access code, which is frequently changed. Guards are stationed at the entrance and the area is monitored by cameras.

The processing plant consists exclusively of [[Zhodani]] workers and with the security measures it has, gaining access is extremely difficult. However, anyone with an appropriate scientific or engineering skill will know that there must be inlet and outlet pipes for the mineral extraction process. These pipes could provide means of entering the facility without being detected and is the best way for the players to get inside.

If the players do not think of this or they want to try alternate methods of entry, agent [[Cryer]] will advise accordingly. Trying to gain access by any other method will be too risky given the layout and security measures in place here.

### DIVING

The pipes connected to the water processing plant are roughly 25m below the surface. In order to dive down to this depth, the players will need to get the appropriate diving gear (listed on page 90 of the Appendix). Diving equipment is commonly used on Riverland and can be obtained from most towns and cities.

The dive itself is quite simple, requiring an Athletics (Co-ordination) check. As the players approach the processing plant they will see a number of large pipes protruding from the facility. Some of these pipes take water into the processing system to extract the minerals and other pipes release the processed water back into the ocean.

Since the players do not know exactly how the water is processed they will not know what is inside the inlet pipes, it will therefore be safer to enter via an outlet pipe. However, they will not be strong enough to swim against the water flow so they must observe how often the water is released and swim into the pipe between each outflow. A successful Investigation check will reveal that four of the pipes sequentially release water every four minutes in one minute intervals, so anyone swimming through one of the pipes has three minutes to reach the end.

A second Athletics (Co-ordination) check is required to swim along the pipe. The pipes are 1.5m in diameter so the party must swim down one at a time. It will be dark inside the pipes and light sources will be needed. It takes roughly two and a half minutes to swim the length of the pipe.

As the players swim through the pipe, they will eventually come to a large impeller, which is used to force the water out through the pipe. It is currently stationary and is large enough for most people to fit through the gaps between the blades. Once past the impeller, the players will emerge in a small pool of warm processed water.

The pool is situated in a large room that has a variety of equipment, consoles and pipe networks. There are three other pools here that sequentially expel water through separate outlet pipes.

A successful Recon check will reveal a technician working at one of the consoles. Anyone in the pools can make a Stealth check to climb out and hide or wait d66 seconds for the technician to move on to another console. The players can also attempt to subdue the technician but if he sees or hears them approaching he will run and alert security as detailed below.

If the players wait too long in the pool, the impeller will start up and they must make an Athletics (Strength) check to avoid being sucked back down and killed by the impeller blades.

### SEARCHING THE FACILITY

Once the players are inside the processing plant they can use the keystone to locate the Tripwire device. Security guards regularly patrol the facility and there are always technicians overseeing and maintaining the equipment. Regular Recon and Stealth check are required to spot personnel and avoid being detected by them. Any worker who spots the players will attempt to run and notify security. Security guards will immediately report an intruder if the players fail to stay out of sight.

The Tripwire device is inside a purpose build containment room with an advanced security lock. There are no permanent security guards posted here but there are regular patrols that pass by every 1d6 minutes. Bypassing the lock requires an Engineering (Electronics) check DM –4 and takes three minutes.

Once the activation sequence has been set on the Tripwire device, the players will need to make their way back out through the pipes. They can easily see when each pool is pumping out water and swim out as soon as the pumps stop. Assuming that everyone will quickly swim past the impeller blades, anyone caught in the pipes when the pumps start will be flushed out into the sea, taking 1d6 damage.

# CODA

## OVERLOAD

Once the players have found as many Tripwire devices as they can, they must wait for the network to activate at the preset time. Hopefully they have timed it well and do not have to wait long. Once the time delay expires and the network activates, the players must act fast to set the overload sequence – the longer the network is active the more ships will be affected by the Jump Space distortions.

For every 10 minutes that the network is active, 1d6 ships will be forced out of Jump Space. If the network is active for a long period of time then news will eventually spread that Jump Space travel has become hazardous in the affected systems but this could take many weeks.

Before the overload command can be initiated, [[Unkah]] will explain that the subsector map needs to be updated. She would have mentioned this before but it can only be updated now that they have confirmed all of the locations. The master key can be used to update the map with the new designated locations of each device and update any locations where the devices have been moved. To update the map requires a Computers check DM –2.

When the network is active and the map has been updated, another Computers check DM –4 must be made to start the overload procedure. Setting the overload takes 1d6 minutes and can be attempted as many times as required but the longer it takes the more ships will be affected. Once the overload procedure has begun, the party will have 1d6+10 minutes to get to a safe distance. [[Unkah]] will not know the exact effect that the destruction will have so the party will need to gain as much distance as possible.

### Boom

When the overload reaches critical mass, any active devices in the Tripwire network will explode. The severity of the explosion can be randomly determined or selected from [[#the Boom table]]. Please bear in mind that the greater the explosion, the greater the casualties and the more it will affect the surrounding area. You can make separate rolls for each device or use the same result for all of them

### AFTERMATH

News of these explosions will spread throughout [[Jewell subsector]] relatively quickly and the players will eventually discover the damage and casualties caused by their actions. The consequences will largely depend on the severity of the explosions but if any [[Zhodani]] bases were destroyed they might see this as a prelude to invasion.

The [[Zhodani]] will most likely strengthen their borders and there will be some serious political tensions and debates between the [[Imperium]] and the [[Zhodani]]. [[Duke Zahn|The duke]] will be thrust into the middle of this and have his work cut out to reduce any political fallout. The situation could easily get out of control, especially considering the political issues of the last few years.

The exact results and consequences of the Tripwire overload is up to you. Do you want this to have a significant effect on Your Traveller Universe or will it all blow over and the situation return to normal?

In addition to the political effects that this has on your universe, you must also consider the physical, economical and social effects. Some worlds might be permanently changed by the Tripwire explosions so you need to consider how this affects your game. The worlds and possible changes are listed in the table opposite

See [[#The Aftermath Table]] for results on the various worlds.

##### SPECIAL OPS

With the devices destroyed, the players' task is complete. They can now report to [[Duke Zahn]] who promised to pay them for their services. The duke will be extremely busy dealing with the political ramifications and only when the players show their authorization (if they have any) will the duke's aides take notice and arrange a meeting. Alternatively, agent [[Cryer]] can use his influence to achieve the same result.

Once the duke knows that the party have requested a meeting he will make it a priority to see them. The players will be ushered into the duke's private study and he will enter soon after. Read out the following:

> 'Well, you have certainly caused me some problems but I believe we made the right choice. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that what you know must stay within these walls.
> _As promised, here is another 50,000 credits. I also have another, more permanent, offer for you. It is clear to me that a team is needed for dealing with matters such these, matters that must be dealt with outside the normal Imperial channels._
>
> _You have proven yourselves to be both capable and loyal and I would like you all to be part of a new special operations unit. You would work for me, under the command of agent [[Cryer]]. You will be well equipped and well paid for your services. You can have some time to think it over and discuss it but I'm hoping that you will accept.'_

Assuming that the players accept the duke's offer, you now have a great setting in which to play additional scenarios and campaigns. A whole universe of adventures is now available to you and your players as they carry out secret missions for the duke and serve the Imperium.

Duke Zahn will want the players to start work immediately as there are several matters that need looking into. Given the party's knowledge and activity over the last year they are perfect for the job. The players' first mission will be to expose the spy that still exists in the intelligence network and the [[Imperium]] must also discover the Zhodani's motives for using the Tripwire network. Finding and questioning the spy might also help the [[Imperium]] discover why the [[Zhodani]] are employing the use of technology like the Tripwire devices.

Under Cover
Since the players are working as undercover operatives, the duke will suggest that they keep their current ship and maintain their current status as free traders. This gives the party a believable cover story whilst giving them the freedom to go anywhere they need to without arousing suspicion. Duke Zahn will pay for any upgrades needed to the ship as long as the players' can justify the expenditure.

Duke Zahn will also pay any expenses incurred by the party, covering ship maintenance, fuel, accommodation, food, ammunition and other supplies. The duke may look after the needs of his new operatives but do not allow the players to abuse this privilege; any requests that are excessive must be justified and should not reveal the party's true nature, so military grade hardware, illegal and other exotic items will not be permitted.

The duke will impress upon the party their need to remain deep undercover and stay 'under the radar' to minimise their exposure and keep their connection to the duke and intelligence network a secret. To this end there will be no records of the players working for the duke or the intelligence network. If they were to be given full access to Imperial outposts and facilities it could alert the enemy and expose their operation.

If the players get into trouble then they must resolve the situation themselves, they cannot use their new connections to bail them out when things go wrong. Duke Zahn should only be used to pay the party's wages and brief them on mission details; he is not a crutch for the players to lean on in times of need. The players have already proven their resourcefulness and this is why the duke has employed them.

No-one said this would be an easy job but if at any time the players do find themselves in a desperate situation you can have the duke intervene as a last resort but he should be used sparingly in this role so the players do not become dependent on him for support.

You may wish to keep agent [[Cryer]] as an NPC, depending on the current skills and size of the party. He might serve as their leader, or perhaps as a liaison between the players and the duke but it is entirely up to you what role he continues to play, if any. If agent [[Cryer]] does join the party full time then his official records will show he is no longer in the service of the [[Imperium]] to help maintain the party's cover.

#### Known Facts

There are a number of points during the players' travels where the situation resulted from the spy's involvement. The players have also met a number of contacts who are known associates of Imperial agents. Since the party is tasked with rooting out the spy they must consider everyone who was known to agents [[Forbes]] and [[Cryer]]. Unless the story unfolded differently than detailed throughout the campaign, the players' should know the following facts and potential suspects:

- Agent [[Forbes]] was aware of a potential leak before he was assassinated, as noted on his data wafer.
- Two [[Zhodani]] agents assassinated agent [[Forbes]] on Esalin. It is a reasonable assumption to conclude that they knew something about him and tracked him from Farreach, which would explain why [[Forbes]] bought passage on the players' ship to begin with.
- No [[Zhodani]] agents returned to the Redway Hotel after the assassination, meaning their whereabouts was unknown or perhaps Martha Redway was somehow involved.
- Martha Redway is a trusted contact but the fact she was not injured during the assassination and was determined to remain could implicate her. However, she did give the data wafer to the players, an act that surely proves her innocence?
- If agent [[Cryer]] is present he will know that the courier was killed on Esalin but does not know the details. This does not necessarily exclude Martha Redway as a suspect.
- On Ruby, Daniel is a trusted contact for several agents but he works in an unofficial capacity and has many contacts involved in illegal activities. Could he be an informant, or is one of Daniel's contacts using the relationship to gain intelligence on Imperial agents?
- Gakha, who the players met on Mongo, is another potential suspect who has already been implicated for industrial

### THE SPY

The spy is a cunning individual who works for the Zhodani. She is a human psion who was taken in by the [[Zhodani]] as a child and was trained in the use of her powers. Her true identity is unknown but she usually goes by the name 'Alice' and has a number of different identities she can use when needed. With her psionic capabilities and [[Zhodani]] upbringing, Alice soon learnt to distrust humans and other races, making her a prime candidate as an operative.

Alice's job is to investigate any potential threat to the Zhodani, primarily from the Imperium, and pass any information to other agents who then deal with the problem. She never deals with any threats herself unless absolutely necessary. For the most part, Alice is simply an information gatherer and limiting her involvement and exposure is the reason she has been so successful.

If anything Alice discovers is a serious threat, [[Zhodani]] agents will usually respond by removing that threat. Other times, Alice will be ordered to monitor a particular situation or person to find out more about the Imperial intelligence network and its activities.

Alice's travels in tracking agent [[Forbes]] is detailed in the relevant sections in this chapter. By following her trail, they players will eventually obtain enough information to track her down.

The party will also have a number of other contacts they have met through the course of this campaign. They can continue to use these contacts and should be encouraged to do so. Building up a good network of contacts can be essential in this line of work but the player's should be mindful of who they trust.

### MAKING CONTACT

Duke Zahn will also explain to the players how they will stay in contact with each other. When on Jewell, the players may contact the duke using an encoded signal that is known only to the duke and the party.

A few of the duke's most trusted couriers are also available to deliver encoded data wafers, again only the duke and the party will have the means to decode the data. Duke Zahn will also arrange for the party to have some permanent accommodation on Jewell so the couriers can better contact the players between missions.

##### TO CATCH A SPY

Before the players embark on their first mission as operatives, they will most likely want to stock up with supplies and make sure their ship is in full working order. Once they are fully kitted out and ready to start, the duke will send the party an encoded data wafer containing their mission briefing.

'Our first priority is to find and capture the spy that we know exists within the Imperial intelligence network. I'm sure that other spies and informants exist but whoever was behind the murder of Agent [[Forbes]] is a known fact and I think there are enough pieces of the puzzle to expose them. This spy is very good and has caused us many problems, so I am relying on you to find this person and if possible bring them to me alive for questioning.'

espionage. Could she have fooled the players from the beginning?

- The [[Zhodani]] agent encountered on Pequan must have been give his orders by someone else and that person knew that
  [[Forbes]] and [[Cryer]] knew each other. There is a good chance that whoever gave the orders to the agent was in contact with the spy.
- If the players enquire about duke's aide who was the traitor at the inauguration ceremony, the duke will explain that the man
  was interrogated but he knew nothing about the spy.
- The spy obviously travels a lot and may not be based at any single location so tracking them down will be difficult.

The players should begin by discussing these known facts and decide which leads they can investigate. With all the Contacts the players have made during their travels, they will now have to question the loyalties of these people. Each potential lead is detailed later in this chapter and the players are free to visit them in any order they wish but starting on Esalin is recommended.

Once the players have enough clues, you can proceed to encounter
'The Elusive Alice' at the end of the chapter.

The players will only travel here if they discover the lead from the Redway Hotel. Once they arrive at Emerald, the players must attempt to confirm the identity of Alice Chamberlain. As the duke would have already explained to the players, they are undercover so they cannot simply walk in and demand the information as Imperial operatives; they have no such identification or authority and doing so could potentially expose them to the spy.

The players will need to obtain the information by other means, which they can do by speaking with the right people or by hacking computer systems to find any records. Whichever method the players decide to use, they must make sure they are dealing with the area of the Ecannis family who are responsible for food production.

### ASKING FOR INFORMATION

The players will only be able to speak to a clerk or salesperson. They will obviously not give out employee information without good reason so the players must convince the person to release the information on Alice. The less information the party asks for, the more likely they are to get it. For example, only asking for confirmation that Alice worked here will be much easier that asking for her personal details.

### COMPUTER HACK

Hacking the computer system requires a Computers check DM –4. An exceptional failure will alert the computer administrator to the

attempted hack and could potentially trace it back to the players. If the players can gain access to a computer terminal it will lower the penalty to DM –1 but getting inside one of the buildings is not an easy task.

The computer terminals are located in offices connected to the grain warehouses. During the day these buildings are very busy. Any previous tactics the party might have used will not work here since everyone in the offices know each other and the players' presence would be noticed.

The players' only other option then is to sneak in at night. Night- time security is fully automated using security robots to patrol the building perimeter. Warning signs are clearly visible stating that the robots are programmed to respond with deadly force to any trespassers or intruders.

There can be as many robots as you deem necessary to make it difficult for the players to succeed. Once the players have got past the robots, breaking into the building requires an Engineering

ALICE'S TRAVELS Alice has never visited Emerald under the name of Alice Chamberlain but when using this identity she always leaves her details as a salesperson for the Ecannis family. This avoids suspicion and also serves as a decoy should anyone attempt track her down.

(Electronics) check DM –2. Once inside the building, the players can attempt to hack the computers with only DM –1.

WHO IS ALICE? However the players go about finding out the information, they will discover that there are no records of her working for the Ecannis family. Since the Ecannis family run all food production on Emerald, anyone working here would be on the records so Alice Chamberlain must have left false information at the Redway Hotel.

The players might conclude that Alice Chamberlain is not even her real name and she could well be the same person as Alice Gibson, in which case they will have a new suspect as both identities were present at the hotel when agents were visiting. This is of course correct but the players will have no way to confirm this until they obtain further information by following other leads.

### MORGAN DRAKE

If the players are also here to investigate Morgan Drake's story that he negotiated a shipment deal with the Ecannis family, the players will find records that confirm his story. Morgan Drake was here from 046-1105 to 070-1105 and attending six meetings with the representatives of the Ecannis family that resulted in a deal for the Jewell Cluster Freight Co. to transport several shipments every month to neighboring systems.

Esalin: Courier Murder

Fully investigating the murder will not be easy. Not only did it happen almost a year ago but some records will be in the possession of the local law enforcement. Some information can be gleaned from the media but for any detailed information such as autopsy reports the players must hack the computer records or find some other way to covertly obtain the information.

If the players have already spoken to Martha (see page XX) they know that the courier's name is Robert Lewis and they should have also discovered that Morgan Drake is a potential suspect as his visits to the hotel corresponds to two of the visits by the courier.

### MEDIA RECORDS

A simple search of media records will reveal that Robert Lewis was found stabbed to death at the Esalin spaceport on 064–1105. No suspects were found but it is assumed he was a traveller who was just an unfortunate victim of a mugging gone wrong. The case remains unsolved.

### POLICE RECORDS

Hacking the police records requires a Computers check DM –4. The case report will include the information that was released to the media and will also state that prior to the crime the victim had recently arrived at the spaceport and had travelled here from Ruby. The autopsy will reveal that one of the wounds severed the aorta and the other wounds were superficial. The victim bled out and died within minutes. The reports concludes that it was either a professional hit made to look like a mugging, or that the attacker simply got lucky with the fatal strike.

### FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS

Knowing that Robert came to Esalin from Ruby, it is a reasonable assumption to conclude that he might have been visiting Daniel, a known contact for Imperial operatives. The party can follow the trail to Ruby as detailed on page 16.

Esalin: Redway Hotel

Esalin is a good place for the players to start their investigations and there first stop will most likely be the Redway Hotel. Not only can they question Martha but they also know that the hotel is a place they can stay whilst pursuing other leads here.

The players should be on friendly terms with Martha given their previous encounters with her and any player who formed a special relationship will be eager to either prove her innocence or discover the truth. This will probably make questioning Martha a little awkward. Her replies will be honest and forthright but she will understandably be upset and angered that she is being accused of treason. However, the players should be able to appeal to her better nature that they are simply following all leads and ruling out all suspects. Possible questions and Martha's responses are as follows:

- Why did you remain here after the assassination, knowing how risky it would be?
  _'I did not want to compromise the operation here or tip off any_
  _enemy agents. My family has been serving the [[Imperium]] for_
  _nearly 40 years and our loyalty has never been questioned.'_
- How well did you know the courier?
  _'I did not know Robert that well. To avoid exposing himself as an_
  _operative he acted like an average traveller and only spoke to me_
  _like most other patrons would.'_
- When was the last time you saw the courier before he was
  murdered?
  _'He last came by here about a month before I met you all.'_
- When did [[Forbes]] last visit here before we arrived with him?
  _'It was the same time as the courier, quite by chance I think.'_
- What other agents frequent your hotel?
  _'We try to minimise the number of agents coming here to avoid_
  _drawing attention. In the last five years, only Adam Dunn, Joss_
  _Webb and Rachel Logan have come here.'_
- When was the last time these agents stayed here?
  ' _Agent Dunn was here about a month ago. Webb would have_
  _been a short time after I met you and Logan hasn't been here for_
  _about two years.'_
- Are there any customers whose stay coincided with any of the
  agents or couriers?
  _'I will have to check the records. It will take some time but I will_
  _get the information for you.'_

If the players are with agent [[Cryer]], he can confirm the identities of the agents mentioned by Martha and further checks will confirm

ALICE'S TRAVELS Alice had discovered that Robert Lewis was a courier for the intelligence network when she first followed agent [[Forbes]] to the Redway Hotel. By pure chance Robert was already at the hotel and by reading his surface thoughts, Alice was able to determine his secret and expose the operation at the hotel.

With the knowledge that the Redway Hotel was a hub for Imperial intelligence, the [[Zhodani]] decided to use it to gain valuable information about the Imperium. However, to avoid revealing their knowledge of this place, agents would only monitor the situation periodically.

When Robert made his last journey here from visiting Daniel, Alice knew that Robert was carrying some important information and reported to her superiors. Knowing that the Robert was heading to the Redway Hotel, an agent was able to arrive at Esalin in time to kill Robert and prevent the information from being delivered.

### SECURITY ROBOTS

Security robots are essentially flying guns mounted on a grav floater and equipped with a variety of sensors. These robots are programmed to patrol a specific area and will fire a warning shot near any unauthorized person entering the predefined security zone. If the intruder does not leave the security zone or if the robot is fired upon, it will then attack its target and other nearby robots will also join the fight.

SECURITY ROBOT (TL 10) STR DEX INT EDU SOC HULL STRUCTURE 10 (+1) 10 (+1)9 (+1)6 (0)0 (–3) 4 4 Traits: Armor 8, Integral System (grav floater), Integral System (every sensor available at TL10 and below), Computer/2 (running Expert Gun Combat (Energy Rifle)/2, Expert Recon/2) Weapons: Laser Rifle (5d6 damage)

that the recorded dates they stayed at the hotel match the known activities of the agents and couriers.

Examination of the records should reveal the following conclusions:

- Morgan Drake is a potential suspect as his name coincides
  twice with visits of Robert Lewis, implicating Drake in the
  murder.
- There are two Alice's – could they be the same person? If asked,
  Martha will not recall if they are the same person or not as it
  was over a year ago.

### ALICE CHAMBERLAIN

Alice Chamberlain is recorded as being a business woman but is in fact the spy. Her details indicate that she works as a salesperson for the Ecannis family on Emerald and sells grain with other systems in the Jewell Cluster. See page 55 for details of following this lead.

### MORGAN DRAKE

Morgan is a businessman who travels to Esalin regularly. Further checks in the customer records will reveal that he has stayed at the Redway hotel a number of other times over the last few years. His business address on Ruby is included and is detailed on page 16.

### ALICE GIBSON

Alice Gibson is another alias for the spy. Her details indicate that she is a free trader with no known address.

Farreach: Investigation Depending on the result of the Tripwire explosions, there might not be anything left on Farreach to investigate. If the base was completely destroyed then there will be nothing left but rubble. Searching the rubble will reveal nothing of interest.

If something of the base does remain, then the [[Zhodani]] will either be repairing the damage or evacuating the facility depending on how your universe has changed as a result of the Tripwire effect. There

ALICE'S TRAVELS Alice followed agent [[Forbes]] here from Ruby (as detailed on page 16) before he travelled to Farreach to investigate the Tripwire lead where this campaign began. Once at the hotel, it did not take Alice long to uncover the secret of the Redway Hotel and Martha's role here.

Martha and her hotel were not seen as a threat but another resource that the [[Zhodani]] could use to infiltrate the Imperial intelligence network and so Martha was left alone allowing Alice to periodically monitor agents and couriers who passed through the hotel.

### CUSTOMER RECORDS

is a good chance that visitors will not be allowed here so the players might need to find a way to sneak onto the base undetected.

### FINDINGS

Although the players have a good idea that the spy was here, there is no actual evidence or leads to be gained by searching whatever remains of Farreach. If the players manage to gain access to any computer terminals here (as detailed in the previous chapter on page XX), they can attempt to hack the systems for any reference to suspects they might have but no records will be found to implicate any of their suspects.

Gakha
If Gakha remained with the party then it is unlikely she will be a suspect but if she left the group at any point the players might want to question her. However, from their previous experience with Gakha the players should be aware that questioning her loyalty is not something that she will respond well to.

Gakha's current location will depend on where the players last encountered her as she will either be in the same place or in a neighboring Imperial system. If the players visit her last known location they can ask the locals there for Gakha's whereabouts. Gakha is a friendly and memorable person so most people should be able to help the players and point them in the right direction.

Once the players have found Gakha, she will be pleasantly surprised to see them. However, once her loyalties are questioned her attitude will soon change and she will be difficult to placate. Until the players can pacify her and justify their attitude she will not cooperate with them. If the players to manage to calm the situation, they will be able to question her and can find out any of the following as appropriate to their questions:

ALICE'S TRAVELS
When agent [[Forbes]] was investigating Farreach Alice had followed him here from Esalin, knowing he was an agent but not yet sure what he was up to. Alice informed two [[Zhodani]] agents of Forbes' presence but he escaped on the players' ship. The agents then tracked [[Forbes]] back to Esalin where they assassinated him.

- Gakha would have been on Mongo at the time the courier was murdered.
- The party rescued Gakha approximately one week after the courier was killed.
- She has no loyalties to the Zhodani.
- Gakha has always lived and worked on Imperial or neutral worlds.
- She does not travel much, which can be confirmed by checking records of places she has worked such as MagnetoDynamics,
  which the players should recall that she worked there for several years.

Gakha may reveal other information depending on where and when she parted company with the players but there will be nothing that links her to any spy activities. She will also add that she was the person who created the encryption program used by agent [[Forbes]] and she also helped the players decode that information, risking her life in the process. Why would she do all that if she were working against the interest of the Imperium?

Once the players have finished with their questions, Gakha will ask them to leave and will request that they never return here as she remains insulted by their accusations. However well the players did to calm her down, this is not something she will easily forgive or forget. The players have now lost a good friend and a useful Ally.

Ruby: Daniel There are several clues that might lead the players to Ruby so they can question Daniel, the contact they met whilst trying to decode the data wafer. Daniel can be found The Factory bar (see page XX) where he is known to conduct most of his business. He will remember the players and gesture for them to sit at his table.

Daniel deals with all types and is used to being questioned about his associates, so he will not take offense at the players when they begin their questioning. Daniel will provide the following information as appropriate to the questions he is asked:

- Daniel never leaves Ruby and rarely travels far from The Factory because that is where his contacts know to find him. This can easily be confirmed by asking any local people.
- He does not know Alice Chamberlain or Alice Gibson but he does know an Alice Long. She is one of his many contacts who works as a private investigator.
- Daniel does not know where Alice lives but she visits The Factory every few months to see if he has any work for her.
- He can describe Alice and provide a sketch so the players have a reasonable idea of what she looks like and he could easily point her out if she were to visit here.
- Daniel does not know anyone called Morgan Drake.
- He does know Robert Lewis and suspected he was some sort of operative but Daniel knew better than to ask Robert about his work.
- Daniel last saw Robert just over a year ago. Daniel does not keep records so does not know the exact date but if the players ask if it was just prior to 064-1105 Daniel will confirm that it would have been around that time.
- A few months prior to when Daniel last saw Robert, Rachel Logan had left a data wafer for Robert to pick up. Robert collected the data wafer and that was the last time Daniel saw Robert.
- He has not seen agent Logan since that time either.

Some of the information here is vital for the players to catch Alice but these clues will only be revealed if the players ask the right questions that they will only know from their investigations on Esalin.

Ruby: Morgan Drake Morgan Drake is a legitimate businessman and can easily be tracked down with the information he left at the Redway Hotel. Morgan works for a small but reputable freight company called the Jewell Cluster Freight Co. His job is to negotiate transport contacts with other companies.

The Jewell Cluster Freight Co. is a modest building in the upper city situated near the starport where they have a small fleet of ships. After speaking with the receptionist the players will be permitted to meet with Morgan in a small conference room.

After questioning Morgan, it should become clear that he is not involved with the [[Zhodani]] or any other covert activities. He is a simple businessman who just happened to visit the Redway Hotel at the same time as Robert Lewis. For the entire month prior to Robert's death, Morgan was staying on Emerald negotiating an important deal with the Ecannis family to transport grain from Emerald to several worlds in the Jewell Cluster. This can be followed up and confirmed if the players visit Emerald (as detailed on page 55).

##### THE ELUSIVE ALICE

Once the players know enough about Alice and her activities, they must devise a way to track her down. They could wait for her in The Factory on Ruby or at the Redway Hotel on Esalin but if she spots them she might go into hiding. There is also a good chance that during the players' investigations, Alice has already deduced that they are on to her or at least suspects the party are getting too close to the truth. However, if the players can think of a way to entice Alice the familiarity of these locations could work to their advantage.

Setting the Trap
The best way to capture Alice is to set a trap to ensure that they can capture her alive. The players do not know that Alice is a psion so their surface thoughts could give them away unless there is another psion in the party who could counter her attempts. For any ruse to work, the players will probably have to involve one of their contacts such as Daniel, Martha or another agent known to Alice. In the latter case, agent [[Cryer]] can arrange this.

The players will then need to get the decoy to collect a data wafer or similar item and take it to another location. For example, the players might have an agent collect a data wafer from Daniel and take it to the Redway Hotel. During this time, subtle clues must be left as to the data content to make sure that Alice hears about it and is interested.

Unless the decoy waits for Alice to make an appearance, there will be an element of luck as to whether Alice is in the area. If unsuccessful, the process might have to be repeated several times until Alice takes the bait. The less the decoy knows about the real plan, the less likely Alice will detect the trap.

Remember that Alice might get other [[Zhodani]] agents involved if she thinks the data is a high enough risk to warrant killing the courier. With only a little information Alice will have no choice but to follow the decoy and play right into the players' hand.

ALICE'S TRAVELS
Having discovered that Daniel had worked for several Imperial agents, Alice set herself up as one of his contacts so she could better monitor the activity of the agents who came to Daniel. Daniel was never seen as threat but an asset; an entry point into the Imperial intelligence network.

Alice's relationship with Daniel meant that she could frequent The Factory (where Daniel spends much of his time) and see many of the people that Daniel met with. It was here that Alice first saw agent [[Forbes]] and discovered he was an Imperial agent and from here she followed [[Forbes]] to Esalin (detailed on page 13).

Agent Logan had collected some information on Alice and left a data wafer detailing her findings with Daniel. After Robert Lewis collected the data wafer, Alice sent a [[Zhodani]] agent to intercept him on Esalin where he was killed. Another [[Zhodani]] agent killed agent Logan but her body was disposed of, so nobody knows she is dead.

There are many variables to consider for both you and the players but do not make this easy for them, Alice is not stupid and is always aware of her surroundings. The players would also be advised to have a contingency plan in case things go wrong, which is most likely to be the case.

The players can choose any location to wait for Alice but there is a good chance it will be somewhere familiar to them. Some suggestions are detailed here but if the players choose a different location simply modify as required. These locations work equally well if the players simply wish to hide out and wait for Alice to make an appearance.

### REDWAY HOTEL

The hotel has the advantage of allowing the players to better control their surroundings. Martha can get rid of any other guests if necessary so no innocents get involved and the players would then have full run of the building.

Once Alice or any other [[Zhodani]] agent is in the building, it can be locked down to prevent their escape. The players should then have no problem apprehending the intruders.

### THE FACTORY

The Factory is known to the players and with Daniel's help it is a good location to set the trap. However, the fact that many other people frequent the establishment could make things difficult, especially if the local police get involved once a fight or kidnapping is reported.

The players would be advised to deal with Alice in a private booth if possible. Alternatively the party could apprehend Alice as she enters or leaves the building but again the players must be careful of any other onlookers. Following Alice as she leaves the building provides a better opportunity to catch her at a convenient moment but this plan runs the risk that she could elude the players.

### [[Zhodani]] AGENTS

If Alice calls in any other agents then the players will have to either apprehend or kill them. Interrogating a [[Zhodani]] agent will reveal Alice's last known location. Further questioning will reveal that she usually heads to the planned target location a day later to make sure the situation has been dealt with.

The agents will not know any of the larger [[Zhodani]] plans and will not reveal any other information that the players are after.

### FAILURE

If the players' plan to capture Alice fails, she will make her escape and the players will have to try a different tactic but she will now be aware that the party is on to her making further attempts more difficult.

Alice will also inform other [[Zhodani]] agents who will attempt to track down the party and kill them. These agents will begin by checking all known havens for the players and their associates, which could include places such as the Redway Hotel and The Factory. What they know will depend on what Alice has discovered about the players.

### SUCCESS

If the players are successful then they will have Alice in their custody. Assuming she is still alive the party can deliver her to duke Zahn or agent [[Cryer]] (whoever they report to) as detailed on page 76.

Escape Alice will not be an easy prisoner to transport and she will use every means available to escape. Using her psionic abilities Alice can render any player unconscious with a telepathic assault, so the party will need to ensure she is safely secured on the ship.

If Alice does escape, she will employ guerrilla tactics and take out members of the party one by one. She will head towards the bridge in an attempt to make contact with any [[Zhodani]] agents in the area, giving them her status and position. This could cause serious problems for the party so they will need to quickly take control of the situation or they could end up fighting several [[Zhodani]] ships and be boarded.

## Zhodani Secrets

During the journey to deliver Alice to the Jewell, the players may wish to interrogate her to find out exactly what she was up to and what other [[Zhodani]] secrets she might have. This is not mandatory and the players might prefer to let the duke's people handle this matter. If agent [[Cryer]] is with the players he will want to interrogate Alice as soon as possible.

During the interrogation, Alice's dislike of the [[Imperium]] will become clear and she will eventually confess that it was her investigations that led to the murder of agent Forbes, Robert Lewis and Rachel Logan. The latter might come as a surprise as nobody knew that agent Logan was dead.

Alice will also know that the [[Zhodani]] see the [[Imperium]] as a threat, largely because the last few years has seen the [[Imperium]] tightening their control over Jewell subsector. Knowing a duke was to be appointed, the [[Zhodani]] had no option but move up their timetable for the deployment of the Tripwire devices. If the Tripwire network had been activated, the [[Zhodani]] would have had total control of their borders in Jewell, preventing any possible attack from the Imperium.

### COMPROMISED

Alice might also reveal that she discovered the secret of the Redway Hotel and Daniels involvement with Imperial agents. Once this is known, it will become clear that the Imperial intelligence network has been compromised at several levels. The operation at the Redway Hotel will have to be shut down but the players may still go there if they need a place to stay. Daniel will also have to be used carefully and sparingly from now on, if at all.

### Reporting to Duke Zahn

Once on Jewell, the players must contact the duke using the prearranged encoded signal. Once the players have made their report, the duke will thank the players for a job well done and arrange to have someone escort the prisoner from the players' ship.

If the players did not interrogate Alice duke Zahn will set his own people to the task. Once the information has been obtained, the duke will send an encoded data wafer to the players with the details so they are aware of the situation.

### CONTINUING THE STORY

Where you go from here is up to you. The stage has been set and any number of missions await the players. Many of the party's contacts have been compromised so the players might want to start by making new contacts or setting up safe houses and intelligence hubs. With the current political climate and the aftermath of the Tripwire effect, it will not be long before the duke sends the party on beforetheir next mission...

# APPENDIX

This appendix has a number of random encounters, NPCs, new equipment and spacecraft that can be used as required. There is also an 'Arrested' scenario, which can be used anytime the players find themselves in trouble with the local law enforcement or other authorities.

## ENCOUNTERS

Starport Encounters The players will need to earn some money to pay for the running costs of their ship and the best place to find work is at a starport. Most of the time they will find a passenger or some cargo but other events can happen also.

A number of encounters are presented here as alternatives to those in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ and are more appropriate to this campaign. If you roll an encounter that is not suitable for the situation, simply roll again. For any encounter where the players meet an NPC you can use the NPC tables detailed later on.

|  D66  | ENCOUNTER                      |

| 65–66 | Make two additional rolls      |

### EVENT: CUSTOMS INSPECTION

Officials conduct a routine inspection to search the ship for contraband. If the players are law abiding citizens and are aware of local laws they will not have a problem. However, if they have any contraband or illegal passengers then things could get interesting. If they are found to be in possession of illegal goods or are wanted for another crime, use the Arrested encounter described on page 88.

### EVENT: REPAIRS

The ship's engineer or a dock worker will notice a problem on the ship. This could be from wear and tear, poor maintenance or damage sustained from a battle or bad piloting. Minor problems do not necessarily need to fixed straight away but could get worse with use. More severe issues will need to be fixed as soon as possible to prevent a failure of that system. The players must get the ship repaired and may also require additional tools or parts to complete the work. Roll on the tables below to determine the location and severity of the problem.

D 66 LOCATION 11–12 Hull: staterooms/births 13–14 Hull: cargo hold 15 Hull: engineering 16 Hull: bridge 21–22 Hull: fuel storage 23–24 Hull: other (passageways and living space) 25–26 Fuel scoop 31–33 Jump drive 34–36 Maneuver drive 41–46 Weapons 51–53 Power plant 54–56 Luxuries 61 Computer 62 Communications 63 Sensors 64 Other electronics 65–66 Life support

| 2–3 | Moderate (1d6+2 hours)    |
|  4  | Major (2d6+2 hours)       |
|  5  | Severe (1 day)            |
|  6  | Catastrophic (1d6+1 days) |

### EVENT: UNREST

This encounter should only be available on Imperial worlds so roll again if it is not suitable for the situation.

The separatist group, [[#Liberation Front]], has stirred up trouble in the starport by staging a demonstration about independence. Some of them have chained themselves to ships and cargo to get attention. Local law enforcement are on the scene trying to control the situation but the chaos has meant that they have had to close down the starport until the demonstrators can be removed.

The separatists will not resort to violence at this time but any situation like this can easily spin out of control. With the disruption caused to the starport, many protestors are being arrested and the law enforcers are not being particularly selective.

It will take the law enforcement several hours to regain control of the starport and if the players get involved in any way, there is a chance that they will be arrested (see encounter for details). If the players are in a rush to get to their next location, they will now have to persuade or bribe officials at the starport to allow their ship to depart.

### CARGO: MERCHANT

The players are approached by a merchant to deliver some cargo to a specific destination. The destination should be a world that is either on their intended route or a minor diversion from it. To increase the chances of an encounter related to the cargo (such as a customs inspection or patrol) pick a destination that is at least several jumps away.

The merchant will be travelling with the goods and he will pay the party a standard commission on the sale value. Roll on the Trade Goods table on page 165 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ to determine the type of goods that the party will be transporting.

### CARGO: TRADER

A trader approaches the players to sell them some goods for a reasonable price. Roll on the Trade Goods table on page 165 of the _Traveller Core_ Rulebook to determine what goods are for sale. The players can negotiate the cost and once the deal is concluded, it is entirely up to the party as to where there sell the goods and for how much.

> ![Info] PASSENGERS
> Passengers are a good way of getting a new player or NPC to join the party. Once the story begins, there is a good chance that any passengers onboard the ship will get caught up in the events of the campaign. However, if you do not wish to add a new permanent party member, the passenger will not get involved or be unaware of the events as they transpire (for example, they stay in their cabin) and will simply disembark at their desired destination.
>
> Any passengers will make certainly make things more interesting at certain points in the story (such as when the [[Zhodani]] board the player's ship at [[Ao-dai]]). This is also a good encounter if you want your players to land in other systems and can potentially lead to additional encounters at the destination.
>
> The passenger's race will largely be determined by the world but you can use the [[#Race Table]] if required. If you need to determine the reason for travel, roll on the [[#Travel Reason Table]]

### PASSENGER: DIPLOMAT

A diplomat, most likely accompanied by at least one aide and one bodyguard, requires urgent passage. He is on Imperial business and his own ship is being repaired. The diplomat will pay well but will insist that he is left alone for the duration of the journey. If you want to make things more interesting, the players' ship could be attacked or boarded on the way by an opposing faction (perhaps somebody who is after the diplomat).

### PASSENGER: FAMILY

A family requires passage offworld. The couple will have two children who spend most of the journey chasing each other around the ship, shouting and generally making a nuisance of themselves. The parents do not really see a problem with this but it will drive the players crazy and could interfere with ship operations.

One of the children could also go missing, trapped in some part of the ship and possibly injured. The family will ask the party to help find the lost child.

### PASSENGER: GROUP

A group of 1d6 people are travelling together and want some cheap transport. They will negotiate for the best price possible but once onboard they will not cause any problems unless the ship is boarded or another event befalls the players, then the passengers will complain and make the situation much worse.

### PASSENGER: INDIVIDUAL

A lone traveller books passage on the ship. He will be friendly and try to strike up a friendship with some of the players. He may even help the players if they are boarded or get into trouble.

### PASSENGER: MERCENARY

An out of work mercenary is looking for new employment. If the players do not require his services then he will simply pay for transport to another world where he has a better chance of finding some work.

### PASSENGER: PRISONER

An agent or bounty hunter is escorting a prisoner. They will pay double the standard rate and assure the players that the prisoner is either not dangerous or securely restrained as appropriate. Roll on the [[#Crime Table]] to determine what the prisoner has been accused of.

This provides several opportunities for additional encounters whilst they are onboard the ship. The prisoner might ask players to free him or he could escape and the players must help to capture and restrain him.

### PASSENGER: REFUGEES

A group of 1d6 refugees who have escaped some local trouble seek free passage offworld. They will offer to earn their keep during thejourney but they do not have any money. Alternatively, it could be someone who has lost his job and is down on his luck.

### PASSENGER: STOWAWAY

A stowaway has managed to sneak onboard the ship. The players will discover him during the journey and must decide what to do with him.

> [!info] CRIMINALS
>
> There is always a chance that one or more of the passengers are criminals. Roll d66 to determine if a passenger is actually a criminal. On a roll of 63–66 they are a fugitive. Roll on the [[#Crime table]] below to determine their crime.
> As with the Prisoner encounter, this can provide similar opportunities onboard the ship. A patrol or inspection could reveal the identity of their passenger, or the fugitive may even continue to commit the crimes he is accused of whilst onboard the ship.

## Arrested

There are several situations in this campaign where the players might end up being captured by either the [[Zhodani]] or the Imperium. If this happens they will be interrogated and will most likely want to escape. This scenario can be used for most circumstances where the players find themselves in such a situation but you may need to modify it slightly to fit their current predicament.

If the players are arrested by the [[Zhodani]] then the situation will be much more difficult for them, especially if it is related to the main plot of the campaign and [[Zhodani]] agents are involved.

### MINOR INFRACTION

If the players have been caught smuggling contraband, get caught up in local trouble or there is only circumstantial evidence against them, then proceed with this part of the encounter. For more serious crimes, refer the Major Crime section.

Each party member will be briefly questioned about their criminal activities. Deception or Persuade rolls are required here to either lie their way out of the situation or prove their innocence. If they attempt to deceive and fail then they will make the situation worse.

If the players can prove their innocence, make a convincing bluff or the evidence against them is not strong enough, the authorities will have no option but to allow the players to go free. However, there is a good chance (depending on circumstances) that the incident will be put on record, naming all parties and their ship.

If the players are found guilty, they will be punished accordingly. Use the guidelines on page 174 of the Traveller Core Rulebook but they will most likely have to pay a fine.

### MAJOR CRIME

If the players are accused of a major crime such as murder or spying, they will be in some serious trouble. Each party member will have all personal effects removed and they will be locked in holding cells whilst they are each questioned in turn. The players' identities, documents and backgrounds will each be checked and their ship will be searched.

Proving their innocence or deceiving their captors will be difficult for the players unless they have some conclusive evidence or independent witnesses. Depending on the legal system where they are imprisoned, there might also be a trial.

If the players are found guilty, they will be punished accordingly using the guidelines on page 174 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. The most likely punishment will be imprisonment or exile.

### FRAMED

If the players have been arrested for the murder of James [[Forbes]] and/ or [[Zhodani]] agents, then other [[Zhodani]] agents will frame the players by planting evidence and bribing locals to testify as witnesses.

### BREAKOUT

If the party are found guilty and are imprisoned or continued investigation into their backgrounds gets them into further trouble (such as knowledge or involvement in the various conspiracies), they will need to plan a breakout if they are to uncover the secrets and complete the adventure.

The chances and method of escape will largely depend on the government, security and technology level of the world the players are on. However, the players' best chance will be to escape before they are transferred to a penal facility. The players will most likely have to escape by themselves, but any party members or contacts on the outside could prove critical to their success.

If the situation makes it impossible for the players to escape their captors, you could have an undercover agent or sympathiser aid their escape. Any agent that helps the players' might know of their activities through one of the other agents or contacts the players have already met.

## EQUIPMENT

As the players travel Jewell subsector, they will encounter several new races and cultures that have unusual goods and exotic items. This appendix lists some of the new equipment that is available to them as well as a number of new spacecraft the players will encounter on their travels.

Chokari Equipment

### FISH

As one would expect, fish is the staple diet of the Chokari and they eat it in large quantities. Although all Chokari are capable of catching their own fish, those who have other jobs prefer to buy their supplies from the markets or local merchants. All tribes have their own fish farms to prevent overfishing.

ITEM TL RANGE DAMAGE HEFT MASS (KG)COST (CR.) Fish 0 - - - 1 1 Harpoon 2 Ranged (thrown) 3d6 1 2.5 25 Light Jar 2 - - - - 5 Net 1 Ranged (unarmed) - 1 1 10 Seaweed 0 - - - 0.5 1 Twine (10ft) 1 - - - 5

### HARPOON

Harpoons are typically 4–6 ft long with a barbed tip and are primarily used to spear fish. A rope can also be attached to the butt if required.

### LIGHT JAR

A reusable light source made from a bioluminescence algae stored in a glass jar. Light jars can last up to two years with regular light exposure.

### NET

Nets are primarily used by the Chokari for fishing but they can also be used as a weapon to entangle an opponent. If the net is successfully thrown, the target is grappled and must make an Athletics (Co- ordination) check or cut through with an edged weapon.

### SEAWEED

Another common food for the Chokari is seaweed. The underwater plants found on Foelen are full of nutrients and can be dried to give a shelf life of up to three months. Most tribes have several seaweed farms to feed the population.

### TWINE

The Chokari make twine from a type of seaweed that grows in the sea's on Foelen. It is strong, thin and flexible, making it ideal for use with their harpoons. Twine is bought in 10ft lengths up to a maximum of 100ft.

Diving Equipment During the course of the campaign, the players might need underwater equipment to achieve their plans. Although vacc suits can be used underwater, most are unwieldy and not ideal for underwater activities (–2 DM to all skill checks in addition to any other vacc suit penalties).

Water conducts heat away from the body 25 times more than air (when in a standard atmosphere), which can result in hypothermia even in warm water. Unless the players have access to TL 14 vacc suits they will need to get proper underwater diving gear.

### DRY SUIT

A dry suit is a sealed garment offering greater warmth than a wet suit. Clothing can also be worn underneath, which can further insulate the wearer. Although dry suits allow the wearer to survive in colder conditions than a wet suit, the dry suit is more cumbersome (–1 DM to all skill checks). If a dry suit is punctured, it will act as a low quality wet suit as it fills with water.

### HEATED DRY SUIT

A heated version of the dry suit protects against even colder conditions but gives off a much greater infrared signature making it

easy to detect the wearer. The suit has an integrated heater that is powered by batteries that provide six hours of heat.

### SCUBA

Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. This life support system is designed for underwater use. It uses one or two tanks of compressed gasses that are passed through a breathing regulator. A Scuba tank will provide breathable air for roughly one hour. Scuba gear must be used with a dry suit or wet suit.

### WET SUIT

A wet suit is made from neoprene and retains body heat by trapping a layer of water against the skin. This water is warmed by the wearer's body heat and acts as insulation.

[[Vexx]] Equipment

### EXCAVATION TOOLS

The [[Vexx]] society is contained underground and their settlements are continually expanding and changing. They have developed their own tools for excavating through the rock and earth, which include hand tools (picks and spades) for small jobs and larger mechanical equipment for large scale excavations. The larger equipment is expensive to make and the [[Vexx]] do not sell these machines to offworlders.

### HYDROPONICS

Hydroponics is the science of growing plants and crops without the use of soil, something that is essential to the [[Vexx]] as there is no fertile soil on Condyole. A small hydroponics set will last for over a year and consists of containers, chemicals and light bulbs that simulate sunlight.

Growing food with hydroponics equipment is relatively easy and requires a basic Science check to be made once per week for three weeks. A failed check means that the crop fails but exceptional successes can reduce the cultivation time by several days.

### SEEDS

The [[Vexx]] have spent centuries cultivating their crops and breeding plants to create seeds that grow quickly and produce nutrient rich foods. When grown correctly, one container of seeds can grow enough food to feed a person for about one month and take three to four weeks cultivate.

ITEM TL MASS (KG)COST (CR.) Dry Suit 5 2 500 Heated Dry Suit 7 5 900 Scuba Set 6 10 600 Wet Suit 5 1 250

### WATER PURIFIER

Even water obtained from underground is tainted on Condyole and the [[Vexx]] have to filter it before it is safe to drink or use for their hydroponics. Water purifiers come in portable varieties or larger systems.

ITEM TL MASS (KG)COST (CR.) Excavation Tools 1 2 20 Hydroponics 6 1 100 Seeds 6 – 5 Water Purifier (small) 4 1 10 Water Purifier (large) 4 10 50

### Zhodani Spacecraft

[[Zhodani]] spacecraft are very similar to those used by other races. However, the main difference is that [[Zhodani]] ships use psionic switches for a variety of simple functions such as doors, light switches, environmental controls and communication devices. Anyone trained in Telepathy can activate a psionic switch with a successful Telepathy check (no Psi points are expended).

| Chwistyoch | If the military base was damaged then the [[Zhodani]] will repair or rebuild as required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Clan       | The destruction of the Clan device will have little effect on the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Condyole   | The destruction of this device will have no effect to the [[Vexx]] society here but Damo will be less than happy and may even forbid the players to return.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Farreach   | If the explosion was big enough then the base and starport would have been destroyed leaving nothing behind. Even if there was little collateral damage, without the device the base and starport serves little purpose.                                                                                              |
| Grant      | Without the device (and most likely the research facility) Grant will no longer need to be a Red Zone planet and the patrol fleet will not be required. This will open it up for potential colonization.                                                                                                              |
| Louzy      | If the processing plant was dismantled to excavate the device it will have a serious impact on the ore exports and therefore the planetary economy. If the Tripwire device remains intact, the [[Zhodani]] will have a strong interest in recovering it as it will be the only surviving device that they know about. |

D66 ENCOUNTER
11–16 Uneventful
21–26 [[#Difficult Terrain]]
31–33 [[#Weather Storm]]
34–36 [[#Crashed Vehicle]]
41–43 [[#Corpse]]
44–46 [[#Survivor]]
51–56 [[#Borekin Attack]]
61–66 [[#Gorta Pack]]

### DIFFICULT TERRAIN

The party encounter some difficult terrain that slows their progress. Everyone must make an Athletics (Co-ordination) check to avoid tripping or snagging themselves. A fumbled check will result in a minor injury such as a sprained ankle.

### WEATHER STORM

A violent weather storm engulfs the region. The players must find shelter to wait out the storm.

### CRASHED VEHICLE

The players discover a crashed vehicle, most likely the result of the electromagnetic energy in the area. If they search it they might find a few items of interest but nothing of great value. This can lead on to the Survivor encounter.

### CORPSE

The players come across a corpse that is the result of a crashed vehicle or an animal attack. If it is the latter, it can then lead on to the appropriate creature encounter ([[#Borekin Attack]] or [[#Gorta Pack]]).

### SURVIVOR

The players meet an NPC (randomly determine using NPC table on page 88) who has been injured and unable to walk. This can be the result of a crashed vehicle or an animal attack. If it is the latter, it can then lead on to the appropriate creature encounter (Borekin Attack or Gorta Pack).

### BOREKIN ATTACK

The borekin is an indigenous creature much like a bear but instead of fur they have a tough hide. They are territorial creatures known to be aggressive and cunning. They are usually found in pairs, one of them will hide whilst the other lures out its prey. Whilst the prey has their attention focussed on the lure, the other borekin will make a surprise attack.

```

```

### GORTA PACK

The gorta are pack animals that resemble deer with a pair of short horns on their head. If the players make a successful Recon check they will spot the gorta and can walk around the pack. However, if the players get too close, the pack will attack them.

## Clan Random Encounters Table

|  D66  | ENCOUNTER       |
| :---: | --------------- |
| 11–16 | No event        |
| 21–23 | [[#Ally]]       |
| 24–34 | [[#Followed]]   |
| 35–36 | [[#Contact]]    |

| 51–56 | [[#Mugged]]     |
| 61–63 | [[#Questioned]] |
| 64–66 | [[#Framed]]     |

### ALLY

A human who frequents the region will approach the players saying that he has information for them but it has a price of Cr. 200. The man will not negotiate but if the players pay he will tell them that they are being followed. He is not sure why but he can point out the person or group.

With knowledge that they are now being followed, the players can either elude their stalkers or ambush them to find out more details. Refer to the next encounter for details of who is following the players.

### FOLLOWED

The players are being followed by one or more people. Roll on the [[#Stalkers Table]] to determine who they are and which encounter this leads to (if any).

### CONTACT

A freelance agent called Gant will attempt to contact the players in secret. Agent Gant knows that [[Forbes]] is a passenger on the players' ship. He will explain that [[Zhodani]] agents have been pursuing [[Forbes]] from Farreach and now suspect the players' ship is involved. If the players ask why Gant is helping them, he will simply say he is loyal to the [[Imperium]].

Gant was on [[Ao-dai]] when the players encountered the [[Zhodani]] patrol. More agents turned up shortly after the players left to investigate the situation. Gant avoided any suspicion and travelled here (it is the only logical place that they could have jumped to) hoping to find the players and warn them to leave as soon as possible.

Once the players leave [[Clan]] agent Gant will also leave, making it unlikely that the players will see him again. However, if the players are in trouble, maybe Gant will make another appearance?

### ROBBED

One or more of the players are robbed by a thief who will attempt to steal something without the players realising. He might even try to sneak aboard their ship while the players are exploring the city but there is a chance [[Forbes]] or anyone else onboard might catch the thief in the act.

### MUGGED

One or more of the players are confronted by a group of 1d muggers. Assuming they are not outnumbered, the muggers will demand any valuables from the players. If the players refuse to comply, the muggers will attempt to beat them down and then take what they want.

If this encounter results in a fight then there is also a chance that the police might get involved, which is something that the players will want to avoid.

### QUESTIONED

A [[#Zhodani Agent]], accompanied by 1d6 [[#Zhodani Pilot|bodyguards]], has been following the players. The agent is simply checking out new arrivals and he has no knowledge of [[Forbes]] or the players' previous activities.

However, if the players are acting suspiciously, the [[Zhodani]] might confront them to ask some questions. Why are they on [[Clan]]? Where have they come from? Where are they going? Unless the players say something revealing there will be no consequences but the encounter should serve to increase their paranoia.

### FRAMED

A group of 1d6 criminals who are under suspicion by local law enforcement frame the players for the crime. Details of the criminals and their crime can be determined by rolling on the table below:

The method of framing the players will depend on the crime but can include any of the following:

- Planting evidence.
- Bribing witnesses.
- Falsifying documents.

Once the players have been framed, they will be [[#arrested]]. There may be evidence against the players but they do have truth on their side so convincing the authorities of their innocence should be within their capabilities.

If the party has been split up, then some players might have eluded capture. Any party members free to do so can investigate the situation and expose the real criminals.
