# The Justice for All Initiative

Authoritarianism runs strong in the [[Core sector|Core]]. There are dozens of worlds in the sector with exorbitantly high Law Levels, many of which also have high populations, in stiff competition with one another for dominance. One of the primary realms of competition is industry. The [[Core sector|Core]]'s industrial giants seek the means to sell their goods to the largest, most far-reaching customer base possible but industrial dominance is but one of many paths to political hegemony.

[[Ase]] is in an advantageous astrographic position on the [[Sylean Main]] but there are several factors that prevent the world from achieving its goals. Stagnant population growth, being surrounded by tough competitors and liberal governance on its neighboring worlds are among the reasons [[Ase]] cites as impediments to its success. The [[Ase#World Government|Resource Concordat]], which governs [[Ase]], believes that by exporting its unique brand of plutocratic authoritarianism, it can enhance its power and status significantly. The Imperium typically frowns upon such impositions. Individual worlds are allowed to govern themselves even when they are subsidiaries of other worlds. Impeding their liberty defies one of the key tenets of Imperial law. However, like most Imperial laws, the independence of worlds is not codified and therefore subject to debate on a case-by-case basis.

Resource Condordat commissioners have collaborated with members of the Imperial bureaucracy to author an initiative called Justice for All. This initiative purports to provide additional security and prosperity along the [[Sylean Main]] by raising the Law Levels of its worlds. [[Ase]] depicts the region as a lawless and blighted swath of space where insurgents and terrorists scheme against the Imperium. While [[Ase]] has provided little concrete evidence of a widespread problem, they have the support of other authoritarian worlds, which combined carry a great deal of political weight. If the initiative passes in the Moot, all subsidiary worlds on the [[Sylean Main]]  - those owned by another world â€“ will have their Law Levels increased to that of the owning world. This will drastically increase the presence of authoritarian governments along the main and limit personal freedoms and self-determination. 

Should the initiative pass, the following worlds will be affected:

| Owning World                          | Subsidiary World                    | Law Level Increase |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | :----------------: |
| [[Fornol]]/[[Core Subsector]]         | [[Curast]]/[[Core Subsector]]       |         +8         |
| [[Ikarus]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]     | [[Deseca]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]   |         +5         |
| [[Irlu]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]       | [[Relle]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]    |         +7         |
| [[Irlu]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]       | [[Protalus]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]] |         +9         |
| [[Sketola]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]    | [[Randar]]/[[Bunkeria Subsector]]   |         +2         |
| [[Shibashliim]]/[[Cemplas Subsector]] | [[Eshon]]/[[Cemplas Subsector]]     |         +6         |
| [[Ase]]/[[Core Subsector]]            | [[Affinity]]/[[Chant Subsector]]    |         +10        |
| [[Skeen]]/[[Chant Subsector]]         | [[Akin Akun]]/[[Chant Subsector]]   |         +5         |
| [[Umgadin]]/[[Core Subsector]]        | [[Shashuua]]/[[Dingtra Subsector]]  |         +3         |
| [[Reel]]/[[Cadion Subsector]]         | [[Qungwyld]]/[[Cadion Subsector]]   |         +8         |

As author of the initiative, [[Ase]] expects to vastly increase its standing in the region but its ambitions do not end there. The Resource Concordat hopes to use its newfound power to dominate the [[Sylean Main]] politically and financially.

## Other Worlds

Other authoritarian governments in the [[Core Subsector|Core]] are watching these developments with keen interest. [[Aursis]], in [[Ch'naar Subsector]], owns three other worlds, all of which have Law Levels significantly below those of their owner. Should [[Ase]] succeed in its gambit, worlds like [[Aursis]] might impose their laws on their subsidiary worlds based on the precedent established by "Justice for All".
