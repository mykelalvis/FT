Shimaraak is the homeworld of the [[Ssienjhiovla]], a species of mollusc-like omnivorous sophonts, which had developed to approximately TL3 when discovered by the Ziru Sirka thousands of years ago. The Ssienjhiovla evolved from a strictly aquatic to an amphibious species at some point in their evolutionary development. Shimaraak has a remarkably old and stable yellow main sequence star, so catastrophic stellar flares are an unlikely culprit to have brought about the mutation. In addition to the Ssienjhiovla, the world has a bountiful and varied ecosphere.

Shimaraak is a large, high-gravity world with a thin, low atmosphere. The world has few mountain ranges of note but its shallow oceans are rich in high-grade metals and rare-earth  minerals. The industrial worlds of Saregon are eager to get their hands on these untapped resources but the Scout Service has acquired a proclamation from the Emperor that denies them access. The scouts would like to interdict the system but the highly social Ssienjhiovla have requested that they refrain from such extreme measures. The Ssienjhiovla have acquired and adapted to Imperial technology and very much want to continue being participating citizens of the Imperium. Slapping an Amber or Red Zone on the world would segregate them from the interstellar community, which is the last thing the Ssienjhiovla want. While there is no scout base on Shimaraak, the scouts visit often and vigilantly watch over the world.
