# DINOM

Dinom is a typical rockball world, a member of the [[Imperium]] under the governance of the [[Dinom Corporation]]. Settled for economic reasons, it is officially listed as an oligarchy in the [[Scout Service|IISS]] database but could be considered a corporate state in which the main shareholders and owners of facilities form a planetary nobility.

The planetary economy is based on mining and ore processing, and the owners of the major ore-handling plants, mines and industrial facilities more or less constitute the government. The World Board, as it is known, has some representation for those who are not shareholders in the main economic assets of the world and for the small populations dwelling outside the main cities but, for the most part, their voices are drowned out by the major shareholders in the Dinom Corporation.

Orbiting a considerable distance from a very bright star, Dinom is far too small to retain an atmosphere of any kind and therefore lacks liquid water. It is a quasi-moon, once belonging to the system's gas giant. Having been perturbed out of its orbit, it was captured in the gas giant's trailing Trojan point and follows the bigger planet around in its orbit.

Dinom rotates at the same rate as it orbits its star, little more than a small bright disc in the sky. The star puts out enough energy to make the surface pointed towards it very hot, while the opposite side is exposed to the cold of space. Dinom thus has a 'bright face' and a 'cold face', as well as a zone of twilight where temperatures are less extreme. All major settlements are built in this zone.

There are three major cities on Dinom, with a total population of less than 250,000. Most live and work in these cities, which are connected by a monorail link or, rather, will be connected 'very soon'. The monorail system has been due for completion 'very soon' for an inordinately long time and cynics suggest it will never be completed.

There are an unfortunately large number of cynics on Dinom. Although wages are good, many people are ceasing to see Dinom as a place to earn a salary and instead consider it their home. This shift has increased disaffection among the populace, who (probably correctly) believe Dinom Corporation is all about wringing profit out of the world rather than looking after the interests of the people who live there.

At present, the unrest takes the form of grumbling, labour disputes over minor issues that would have been ignored or cleared up in minutes just a few years ago, along with the occasional strike. The World Board has made a number of concessions to the workers but has not addressed major issues regarding Dinom-as-home rather than Dinom-as-workplace.

The World Board believes it is simply not cost-effective to implement social programs and improve Dinom as a place to live. In this, they too are probably correct.  The Dinom Corporation looks after its workers well enough but does not see the need to consider long-term development of the world.

There are those who have begun suggesting that what Dinom needs is a change of government. This hypothetical new government would allow the Dinom Corporation to continue its operations but would spend much more on long-term social development. The World Board is unlikely to accept this proposal and, in any case, it is unworkable. The money for these programs would have to come from the only real source of wealth on the planet â€“ the Dinom Corporation.

While the major processing works are located in the equatorial cities, there are small settlements a short way into the cold and bright faces. The only reasons to venture outside the relatively safe equatorial zone are economic. On the cold face, there are veins and deposits of minerals to be dug out of the ground and it is possible to extract frozen gases from deposits. These are purified and shipped in solid form or piped as liquids back to processing centres for industrial use.

Operating on the cold face is hazardous. In addition to the dangers of an airless world such as dust pools that seem only centimeters deep, micrometeorite showers and the occasional deep crevasse, super-cold terrain has its own unique ways to harm unwary Travellers.

Cold face hazards include lakes of frozen gas that rapidly sublimate when exposed to heat, such as that given off by an ATV. Deep crevasses are also present, where rock has been split by explosive sublimation in the past, when a deposit of frozen gas is exposed to heat.

The bright face is, if anything, more dangerous.  However, the extremely high temperatures are beneficial in some ways when mining for metals.  Conventional mining is carried out and there are other, less commonplace, ways to obtain minerals in this environment. It is possible to encounter pools of liquid metal that can simply be piped into holding tanks.  These metals tend to be those with a lower melting point but pool-draining is a quick way to obtain a large amount of metal. The occasional geyser of molten metal is far more hazardous, although if the period of the geyser can be predicted it is possible to send in teams to harvest clumps of solidified metal after an eruption.  This is dangerous but has the advantage that metal so obtained tends to be very pure.
