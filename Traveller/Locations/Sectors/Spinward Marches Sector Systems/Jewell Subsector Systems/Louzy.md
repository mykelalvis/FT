 Louzy 0804 D322A88–8 0804 D322A88–8 I Hi Po NA NII Hi Po NA NI

 Louzy lives up to its name due to the tainted, thin, atmosphere and lack of water but due to the rich mineral deposits it enjoyed rapid colonization and industrialization. Less than 100 years later, the demand for the resources had dropped and many mineral deposits were mined out. Louzy is now an overpopulated world with a continuing decline in money and resources. Full details can be found on page 30 (Conspiracies).

There are two colonized planets in the Louzy system. Two additional planets occupy the inner orbits but are far too hot to be colonized.

Louzy 0804 D322A888 I Hi Po NA NI Louzy gets its name from the unpleasant nature of its atmosphere and the lack of water on the planet. It is also overpopulated with a poor economy and the only reason that it was colonized in 624 was for its rich mineral deposits.

With so many high paid jobs on offer, as well as education and training, people flocked to Louzy. The rapid expansion, aided by Imperial funding, drew in more corporations and soon minerals and money were flowing through Louzy.

However, the ‘gold rush’ came to and end in 707 when demand for the resources dropped and many of the mineral deposits had been mined out. Over time most of the corporations pulled out, leaving an overpopulated world with a failing economy and a dwindling supply of raw materials. Representatives from the mining towns and remaining corporations formed a new government in 739. Some settlements were consolidated and with careful management, the situation improved.

Most of the cities on Louzy are underground and are usually huge sprawling constructions. The high population and poor economy have resulted in rising levels of crime and numerous slum areas.

# ATTITUDES

The poor conditions on Louzy mean that few people are happy or satisfied with their lot. Many seek ways to improve their lives, hopefully by leaving Louzy for greener pastures. Since most people do not have the money to buy passage to other systems, many people that leave are recruited to join mercenary groups or offworld mining corporations.

# LAWS

Anyone is permitted to land on Louzy but will be subjected to cargo searches. All weapons and drugs are considered contraband.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Durty City

In-keeping with the naming tradition of the Louzy system, the capital city certainly lives up to its name. The southern part of the city is given over to ore processing plants and other industrial functions. Although the pollutants created from these processes are piped out to the planet’s surface, the dirt and grime is

carried through to the rest of the city. Since Durty is one of the few productive cities on Louzy, it has simply become an accepted part of life here.

Lifts from the starport take travellers directly to the city center below. From the center, vast tunnels lead off to separate zones including habitat, commercial, agricultural and industrial zones.

## LOUZY

It is not hard to see how Louzy got its name. A small world with an atmosphere both tainted and too thin to breathe, lacking much in the way of water, it was hardly a garden world nor a prime prospect for colonization.

Nevertheless, Louzy was indeed colonized and the colonies grew rapidly. The world proved to be rich in mineral resources and enjoyed something of a ‘gold rush’ in the mid 600s as the sector’s industrial base was hugely expanded to meet the needs of the Fleet Asset Replacement Program. FARP was implemented in several sectors that had lost a large proportion of their naval assets in the Civil War or as reinforcements sent to the Marches to fight the Zhodani.

At that time, the Imperial Navy was facing a crisis. Its strength had been built up steadily, literally over centuries. The massive losses of the Frontier Wars and, more importantly, the Civil War meant a large percentage of the fleet needed replacing and fast. System defence assets also required replacement in heavily fought-over systems. Crash-building programs covered the worst of the deficit within a couple of decades but this created a second crisis as ships suffered block obsolescence, all needing replacement at once rather than over time.

All this meant there was a massive need for mineral resources in the coreward end of the Marches and significantly at the military shipyards of neighboring Efate. Huge extraction and ore processing operations were rapidly set up, along with towns for workers and associated secondary and tertiary industries.

The expansion was extremely quick; Louzy was a metaphorical goldmine of minerals and the industry of the Marches could not get enough of its riches. Wages were high and living conditions in the mining towns were as good as the corporations could make them. The best corp towns were operated by Sternmetal Horizons but other firms followed a similar practice, in order to attract workers.

It succeeded. Louzy was the place to go if you needed a job, or if you wanted to learn, for education and training packages were included among the extra benefits offered to workers coming to Louzy. Seemingly every week there was a new mine or processing plant opening, with new arrivals coming to operate it and seasoned hands taking promotions to head work gangs in the new facility.

It had to end sooner or later and, by the early 700s the voracious demand for minerals had tailed off. So had Louzy’s massive productivity; easy-to-access deposits were mined out and some installations closed, plus many industrial centres were getting their raw materials elsewhere, at a better price.

Some operations moved to less viable, but still productive, sites and carried on. The megacorporations pulled out, to their credit taking care of their own people by moving them to new sites or investing in corp towns to make them self-sustaining. These former corp towns ended up in better shape than most settlements, as their former corporate owners helped create a modest industrial base. Most other settlements had little industry outside of repair workshops for their mining equipment.

The Louzy Slump followed, inevitably. The world’s riches had come from exporting processed ore and not only was that more difficult to get at, there was little in the way of local manufacturing capacity to make use of raw materials now that the interstellar market was not buying everything that could be torn out of the ground.

Louzy struggled through hard times. Its economy was based on ore that needed advanced machinery to mine and keeping that machinery (as well as the cities themselves) operating consumed the money from ore sales. Occasionally, fighting broke out over a claim or attempt to salvage equipment from a previous mining operation.

However, things settled down in time. A world government was formed out of representatives of the mining settlements and collective bargaining improved cashflow. Many smaller settlements were salvaged and closed down, the population migrating to cities that had industry and services, mostly former corp towns. Careful management of the expansion program prevented the creation of ready-made slums and ensured people that came in from the failing settlements were an asset to local industry rather than a drain.

Today, Louzy is strictly-regulated but stable, with a modest mid-tech industrial base exporting some raw materials and an increasing amount of finished goods through the remains of what was once a very extensive starport. The latter is currently rated as a D class port but could be refurbished to C or even B class with suitable investment.

The world’s main problem is overpopulation in its sprawling cities, which are constructed largely underground to maintain atmospheric integrity. Money is tight and there is little investment but investment is desperately needed in order to get more from the world’s huge population. Needing money to generate wealth and not being able to get it, Louzy is facing a downward spiral. Crime is on the increase and most citizens feel they have few prospects. It may be that the valiant effort made to halt the great slump has merely slowed it and made the decline more painful.

Efforts are underway to improve matters. Imperial funding and megacorporate loans have been requested, without much success, although there have been some instances of private concerns moving into Louzy on very favorable terms. The world government seems increasingly willing to entertain distinctly borderline schemes if they bring in hard cash.

There is a steady exodus of people offworld. Some are the best and brightest, using their skills to find a better home for their families. Most, however, are semi-skilled at best. Some simply buy a ticket for anywhere or work passage aboard a passing ship in the hope of finding a new start in a better place. Others are recruited by mercenary units and other high-risk companies seeking personnel. Ironically, the biggest recruiters operating on Louzy are mining companies seeking entry-level workers.  Although these recruitment operations are small-scale at present, they are expanding. This is a good thing – a few less people is exactly what Louzy needs right now.
