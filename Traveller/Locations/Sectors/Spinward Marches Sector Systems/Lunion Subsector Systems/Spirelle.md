### SPIRELLE
A prosperous mid-tech world located on the Spinward Main, Spirelle is well designated as a rich system. There is plenty of water, a standard atmosphere and an environment hospitable to humans. The population expanded steadily after the world was initially colonized and now there are several hundred million people on Spirelle.

The populace is spread across the globe, mostly around coastal regions. Sea and river transport is the main way to move goods and people between the cities; although road and air links are well serviced, water transportation is cheap, which makes it attractive for non-urgent goods.

Spirelle exports large quantities of TL8 goods to nearby worlds and much of the world's industry is geared to the export market, producing rugged items that are easy to maintain with limited facilities. Produce aimed at the local market tends to be more complex and sophisticated.

There is a good starport, with government-licensed traders handling most negotiations for private cargoes.  The starport is, not surprisingly, co-located with the world's largest seaport, with huge container ships delivering cargoes from all around Spirelle for export.  These are often shipped in standard (interstellar) shipping containers, which can be handled by normal starship-loading equipment and carried aboard freight vessels with no need to unload or repackage.

Another important export is bulk seafood and related products. Extensive fishing fleets and sea-farming techniques produce a great deal of food. Some goes into the local diet but a sizable amount is processed and shipped out for export. Live fish and seafood are also exported, although this requires careful handling and makes the produce expensive to the end purchaser.

With so much of the population living along coasts or on islands, inland areas tend to be sparsely populated.  Spirelle has been settled for centuries, so there are few areas truly uncharted and most localities have a few scattered villages. However, there is wilderness throughout the continents, with mountains, rain forests and tundra covering much of the interior, making it useless to the world's inhabitants.

The [[Scout Service]] has a base on Spirelle, mainly existing as a training establishment and making use of the extensive wilderness to conduct survival training as well as navigational and problem-solving exercises.  There are also areas leased as large-scale free-fire zones, used to train weapons skills.

Although the Scout Service is not one of the Imperial armed forces, scouts often have to defend themselves and most personnel can handle weapons with at least a basic level of proficiency. The training areas are used for basic and refresher courses for a broad cross-section of personnel and the scene of much more advanced training.

The Scout Service also maintains a security arm to protect its bases and personnel. Normally, these teams simply act as guards, however some are trained in hostage-rescue and object retrieval. The latter is a catch-all term used from getting a valuable alien artefact back from thieves to storming a hijacked Scout Service vessel.

Within the leased areas are mock-ups of various Scout Service vessels and other common starships, most with internal gravity equipment so they can be stormed in a range of conditions from zero-gravity to a 'shirtsleeves' environment.

The scout base is located in a remote area, with mountains restricting access from some directions. It has its own port, which is not available for non-official vessels to use. There is a sizable community at the base and a small presence is also maintained at the main Spirelle starport for liaison and recruiting.

Spirelle is, to a great extent, the sort of world the [[Imperium]] was formed to support and protect. It is home to large numbers of people who contribute to the Imperial economy as both producers and importers of goods, and may eventually develop into a major world.  In the meantime, Spirelle lacks the high-technology industrial base to construct an effective system defence fleet. While a few imported system defence boats can make a huge difference, a world of this kind cannot truly protect itself from large-scale interstellar threats and must rely on the Imperial Navy.
