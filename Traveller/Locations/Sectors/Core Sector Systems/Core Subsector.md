![[TImp-CoreSubsector.jpg]][[TImp-CoreSubsector.jpg|Core]]

Core is home to [[Capital]], the world where the Emperor of the Third Imperium sits upon the Iridium Throne. Because of their proximity to [[Capital]], the worlds of the [[Core subsector]] are scrutinised closely and modifications are made when it is deemed that the safety of [[Capital]] is at stake. Some of these alterations are subtle and some are blunt. Unrequested surveillance software might be added to a starport security system or the Imperial Guard might drop troops onto a world where trouble is suspected. While the Imperium is not shy about doing what it must to protect [[Capital]], it tries to do so with a soft touch â€“ or at least the appearance of one. One of the credos of Imperial rule is to defend the space between worlds without applying a heavy hand to local politics. Individual worlds are left to their own devices as long as they do not break Imperial law, allowing for a broad range of social and political variation. This is also true in the Core subsector but the Imperium does have its security to think about. As with any powerful polity, there are those who would do it harm if they could and the Imperium pulls out all the stops to defend the Emperor.

Most of the worlds of the [[Core subsector]] understand their unique place in the Imperium and tolerate a more intrusive government presence. [[Capital]] does what it can to remind them how unique and important they are. The fact that there are a number of Sylean worlds goes a long way to ensure a cooperative environment. The Syleans were largely responsible for  he success of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] and those with Sylean blood are especially proud of their part in its history and more willingly submit to the higher level of scrutiny.

Core contains 11 of the 25 worlds that form the Sylean Worlds cultural zone. These worlds were settled by pureblood Syleans and people of mixed Sylean blood after the formation of the Third Imperium and were casually referred to as 'the Sylean Worlds' long before they acquired the official designation. During the Civil War, the Moot refused to endorse many of  he pretenders who laid claim to the throne. Naval battles were fought in [[Capital]] and other nearby star systems. The Sylean Worlds called upon the Imperial Navy's 1st and 4th Fleets to protect [[Capital]] and the heart of the Imperium. The Moot waited for a proper candidate to appear and, for a time, the Sylean worlds became an autonomous region. To a degree, this event inoculated the rest of the Imperium from the chaos of the Civil War. The move localised the conflict and enabled the remainder of the Imperium to carry on, unaffected by events on [[Capital]]. The region was later converted into an official cultural zone to harbour and preserve Sylean culture and serve as a reminder that when things get tough, the Imperium closes ranks and safeguards its capital.

The subsector has two reserve worlds, [[Lectorsen]] and [[Crompton]]. Lectorsen's unique twilight-band jungles caught the interest of Emperor Martin II, an avid naturalist who made it an Imperial protectorate and emplaced a soft interdiction to strictly control access to the planet. The world's extensive staff of administrative and wildlife maintenance professionals carefully cultivate the planet to preserve its pristine state. With a far smaller staff, Crompton has been reserved as a playground for the Imperial family and other high-ranking nobles who come for rest and recreation. Crompton's hardy ecosphere is stocked with game from throughout the Imperium. Its staff conducts, extensive safaris for the world's guests, during which they may hunt or simply observe its animals.

There is a cultural rift between the Sylean Worlds and a group known as the Wayward Worlds. The Wayward Worlds are not an official district or cultural zone but do have a unique place in history that has some carryover to modern times. These were the worlds that were part of the Sylean Federation at the dawn of the Third Imperium but chose to reject the offer of membership in the fledgling empire. Cleon Zhunastu accepted this betrayal with aplomb but ultimately acquired these worlds over time. In truth, they had no choice. As the Imperium grew, the Wayward Worlds became increasingly isolated and were ultimately forced to accept Imperial membership. It is said that time heals all wounds and such is the case with the Wayward Worlds. The descendants of the traitorous powers who rejected Cleon's advances no longer pay for the sins of their ancestors; however, the schism did result in a distinct, non-Sylean culture that is still evident among these worlds to this day.

In spite of its high security, the [[Core subsector]] is part of a vibrant trade route: the [[Sylean Main]], which includes all of the Wayward Worlds, several of the Sylean Worlds extending into [[Kaskii]], along the coreward flanks of [[Chant]] and [[Cemplas]], and ultimately broadens to include most of the systems in [[Bunkeria]] before wending its way into the neighboring [[Dagudashaag Sector]]. Most of these subsectors are lightly populated, so the [[Sylean Main]] is not as lucrative as those found in heavily populated sectors like [[Massilia sector|Massilia]] or [[Ilelish Sector]]. Savvy traders contend that any shortcomings the Sylean Main may have are more than made up for by the sheer quantity of development opportunities present. While [[Capital]] has always sought to avoid becoming directly involved in the affairs of its worlds, it has been somewhat of an embarrassment that the trade main upon which it sits is so utterly provincial and underdeveloped. There are those among the nobility and megacorporate community who seek to change that.

The [[Core subsector]] is defended by the hallowed 1st Fleet, which is headquartered on [[Capital]] itself with squadrons spread throughout the subsector. The fleet consists of eight full squadrons including five BatRons, two AssaultRons and a TankRon to assist with deployments and training exercises. The Core's Subsector Fleet is supported by large elements of the Sector Fleet, which are rotated into service in the subsector regularly. In addition to its many bases, there is the Imperial Marine Training Centre on Codsen, a rough outpost with a challenging environment where marines are trained in the arts of survival. The system has not been assigned a base symbol on purpose; only barebones housing and other facilities are present, which hint at the challenging environment that lies before trainees.

### The Wayward Worlds

At the dawn of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]], Cleon Zhunastu's appeal to the worlds of the Sylean Federation were not accepted by all. Thirteen worlds initially rejected membership in the new [[Imperium]]. Cleon managed to convince six of them to reconsider only to see three flip-flop once again shortly after his coronation. Only eight of the original Sylean worlds accepted roles as founding systems of the new empire outright. The founding worlds were Kiiri (now [[Nesdo]]), Lauursha ([[Shudusham]]), Khash ([[Rhylea]]), Laairer ([[Rib]]), Idmum ([[Ercan]]), Gikuu ([[Codsen]]), Kuunen Ish ([[Yirsh Poy]]) and of course Sylea itself, which became [[Capital]]. The Syleans had deep cultural resentment of the Vilani after a millennium of oppression and were quick to shed the Vilani names of most of their worlds. Only [[Shudusham]], which had already changed its name shortly after being contacted by the Sylean Federation, retained its name largely due to the presence of such a large Vilani population.

The Wayward Worlds were Unrair (now [[Thass]]), Unkuu ([[Balpan]]), Irurk ([[Ankod]]), Aggii Ganaan ([[Ploiqu]]), Irmap Muu ([[Traak]]), Nirinirk ([[Crompton]]), Bala ([[Morii]]), Zuarkri [Ion]([)]and Kain ([[Onon]]). Many of these worlds retained their original names for many years before being renamed one-by-one in an attempt to shed the burden of their traitorous past.
