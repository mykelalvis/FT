## History

Established in [[IY1040]] with an [[Imperium|Imperial]] charter and a mineral exploitation grant for [[Fulacin]].

- Following the severe economic downturn associated with the [False War](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Fourth_Frontier_War "Fourth Frontier War") ([1082](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/1082 "1082") to [1084](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/1084 "1084")), the company encountered a cash slowdown, and suspended operations for a period. In [1089](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/1089 "1089"), an influx of capital allowed the company to resume operations. In partial support of this new era, the company also established a large starport facility (currently typed as class A, minus) with construction and overhaul facilities to 10,000 tons. Completed in [1099](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/1099 "1099") and opened by Lady [Erika Kirama](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/index.php?title=Erika_Kirama&action=edit&redlink=1 "Erika Kirama (page does not exist)")[[1]](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/MagnetoDynamics#cite_note-IL614-1) and others.
- The starport facility, envisioned as ultimately supporting mineral export traffic, has served an interim purpose of supporting (through landing fees and other income) the on-going survey of the world for ultimate exploitation.
- MagnetoDynamics' exploitation grant expires in [1199](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/1199 "1199"), with a renewability clause for an additional 100 years upon demonstration of efficient and profitable operations.
