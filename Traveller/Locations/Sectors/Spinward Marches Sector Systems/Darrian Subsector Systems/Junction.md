### JUNCTION
Junction lies on the outer edge of the Spinward Marches, requiring a long transit through neutral space or a potentially hazardous journey through the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] for Imperial traders. As a result, most ships that visit are independent or of Darrian registry. The system is important to the Darrians as a jump-off point for expeditions into Foreven, although there are few reasons to stay rather than just pass through.

Junction is home to a few thousand farmers and ranchers who have little interest in the outside universe. The 'starport' is nothing more than a large town with a landing area and part-time traders, plus a detachment of Darrian personnel who operate a refuelling and resupply service for Darrian vessels only. Newcomers to the world find the locals hospitable enough but unimpressed by technology or tales of interstellar adventure. Junction is listed in several interstellar navigation guides as 'a little port that could be anywhere and does a pretty good job of being nowhere'.
