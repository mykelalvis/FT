# GrafeYart


GrafeYart is nothing but a myth, a scare-story told by spacers to frighten impressionable new crewmembers. Yet the myth persists of a ‘starship’s graveyard’ where misjumped ships end up. According to the tales, some Misjumps lead to an area of deep space where hundreds, perhaps thousands, of derelict vessels float endlessly. The gravitational attraction between these wrecks is small, but some of them have been there long enough that they have drifted together to form clumps.


From time to time a new vessel misjumps in to the GrafeYart (the origins of this corruption of ‘Graveyard’ are lost in antiquity) and slowly dies, its power running out and the crew perishing in the cold of space. Yet there are tales of those who have escaped the GrafeYart by plundering the wrecks of other ships for components and fuel. These few escapees are supposedly the source of the wild tales about this strange place.


According to the survivors, the GrafeYart contains vessels from many races, and some that seem to belong to unknown species. There were bodies aboard the wrecks, not all of which were identifiable as a known race, and some of the ships were very strange indeed. The wilder versions of this already outrageous tale include some kind of robotic devices harvesting components from the derelicts to build a fleet of monstrous hybrid ships.


This variant of the tale would seem completely impossible were it not for the Impecilia Incident, which occurred many years ago. The Impecilia , a large freightliner operated by a reputable shipping line and with a first-rate captain, encountered a mysterious vessel said to look like ‘someone bolted together bits of several vessels’. Analysis of the few images available from the incident match the descriptions of ‘GrafeYart Ships’ contained in the wilder tales. Some components and hull sections could be identified in terms of the interstellar power that built them; some were of totally unknown origin. One ship was positively identified among the conglomerate; a naval escort that went missing, presumed Misjumped, centuries ago. Those who like to tell tales of the GrafeYart will loudly proclaim that this proves the story is true. Most are skeptical.


The idea that there may be some sort of device that attracts Misjumped ships or even causes them to go astray and end up at the GrafeYart is unsettling, as is the idea that someone or something may be cobbling the wrecks together into new ships and sending them out for purposes unknown. There are also rumours of a Superweapons project based on the Misjump-attractor concept. If this device is real, it could deny an area of space to hostile vessels or be used to scatter an incoming fleet. Naturally, there are those that are certain that it exists and has already been deployed aboard naval vessels or at some secret base or station.
