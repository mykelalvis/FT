## Introduction

This adventure details a small corporation operating at the Coreward end of the Spinward Marches - Spinward
Salvage LIC (Licensed Imperial Corporation). The company got its start after the 3rd Frontier War salvaging wrecks
and bases left behind from that war. Spinward Salvage is a company with a reasonable reputation, but it has been
known to employ freelancers of somewhat more dubious reputation - no doubt like Traveller characters in your
games. Hence this book is presented as a setting for an ongoing Traveller campaign, either in the form of odd
jobs the characters are given by the company, or as a complete Adventure, roughing it on and beyond the frontier,
searching for that big salvage strike that could land the characters a fortune - or a whole lot of trouble.

Complete stats are included of all starships operated by Spinward Salvage, its operations, home base on Efate
(Regina Subsector), and an adventure which can be undertaken by the characters. Details of key employees of
Spinward Salvage are also given.

**STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS**
In order to use this supplement you will need a set of **_Mongoose Traveller_** rules. Statistics are included for _Mon-
goose Traveller,_ though other rules sets can be used with a minimum of work. This supplement is designed to be
used in the Official Traveller Universe (OTU) although the company details and ships could be used in any setting
that uses Traveller’s basic background.

**Dates:** All dates correspond to the standard Imperial calendar from the OTU. This supplement is officially dated
320-1105 (the 320th day of the 1105th year since the founding of the Third Imperium).

**LIBRARY DATA**

**THE THIRD IMPERIUM**

Also called The Imperium. Founded in 0 by Cleon Zhunastu from the Sylean Federation in what is now Core Sector.
The Imperium grew swiftly during the pacification campaigns and more slowly thereafter until stability was reached
in the 600’s, by which time the Imperium had absorbed much of the territory of the First and Second Imperiums.

The Imperium can be best thought of as a form of feudal confederation. Member worlds of the Imperium agree to
pay taxes and obey a few fundamental laws which the Imperium promulgates, known as the High Laws. In return,
the Imperium agrees to patrol the space between the worlds, to protect interstellar trade, to encourage travel and
commerce, and to arbitrate diplomatic relations between worlds Beyond this, individual worlds are left to their own
devices so long as they acknowledge the power of the Imperium to rule the space between the stars. Imperial
power is present on member worlds in the form of consulates, bureaucratic offices, and bases. Sometimes, larger
enclaves of Imperial power are placed where they can enhance the emperor’s strength.

The Imperium’s territory is divided into sectors, which are in turn divided into subsectors and systems. Groups of
sectors, called domains, have been created above the sector level.

**THE SPINWARD MARCHES**

The Spinward Marches is a frontier sector of the Third Imperium, an empire that covers about 11,000 worlds. The
Spinward Marches Sector lies 44 weeks Jump from the core of Imperial power (Core Sector), and is a place of
grand opportunity and danger. The coreward (“north”) end of the Marches lies on the frontier of Imperial space.
Further to Coreward lies the Vargr Extents, while to Spinward-Coreward is the Zhodani Consulate, a huge empire
of psionically aware humans.

**FOURTH FRONTIER WAR**
Lasting from 1082 to 1084, the 4th Frontier War between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate was over before
battle orders from the Emperor reached the Imperial Admirals in the Marches. Sometimes known as the false war,
it was largely confined to Jewell subsector and Regina subsector. The Battle of the Two Suns in 1084, fought be-
tween Yres and Menorb in Regina subsector, resulted in an Imperial victory, and the Zhodani signed an armistice

that continues to this day.

**LING STANDARD PRODUCTS (LSP)**
LSP is a huge Imperial mega-corporation that spans the entire Imperium. LSP started thousands of years ago as a
mining firm, but has expanded its activities into many other fields, including manufacture of electronic equipment,
ground vehicles, air vehicles, starships and their armaments, power and drive systems, software and many other
mid to high tech items. It is also involved to a limited degree in banking and insurance activities. A small portion of
its operations are conducted beyond Imperial borders.

## Spinward Salvage History And Fleet

Spinward Salvage officially started operations in 988, after the close of the 3rd Frontier War. Two loud and obnox-
ious, but commercially savvy brothers, Minton and Friar Delware, started operations with an old converted X-Boat
Tender that was itself salvaged by the Scout Service in 986, then sold to the fledgling company. The brothers started
up on Efate, buying (it seems) the worst polluted and cheapest piece of dirt they could find - 40 hectares on the
outskirts of 30 South city. The city is so named because it is 30 south of the equator.

The Tender was renamed the _Diamond in the Rough,_ and a tug and cutter were also leased to provide lighter sup-
port and hulk-shifting capacity. It turned out that the Tender provided an excellent platform for salvage operations,
with its multiple boat bays and comprehensive sensor suite. Over the next decade, civilian and Imperial Navy craft
of all tonnages were identified and salvaged, with parts accumulating and onsold at a staggering rate back on its
home patch on Efate. The Navy and Scout service also engaged Spinward Salvage in formal contracts to clear
out wrecks left behind by the war. The Tender operated mainly in the Louzy, Nakege, Mongo and Lysen systems
in Jewell Subsector, and the Yres, Menorb, Efate, Feri and Alell systems in Regina Subsector.

In 993 a competitor emerged, Salvage Factors based out of Feri in Regina Subsector. This operation is partly
(10%) funded by Ling Standard Products, and has been a major threat to the commercial existence of Spinward
Salvage ever since. LSP is however, only a silent partner, which is just as well because of the falloff in work in the
last decade. Salvaging teams need decent wars to stay in business, and the 4th Frontier War (1082-1084) did not
prove bloody enough to keep both operations flush with work. In recent years both companies have been involved
in clashes with each over salvage rights of wrecks, and both have taken to diversifying in the downtimes. Spinward
Salvage sometimes charters its vessels, especially for specialized freighting contracts, and this practice continues
to this day. The company also manufacturers low cost starships using refurbished parts. This is undertaken at its
dry dock at its Efate headquarters.

By 995 the operation expanded considerably, with the addition of two more surplus X-Boat Tenders converted in a
similar manner to the original Tender. Other small craft and starships soon followed particularly smaller scout/couri-
ers for identification work and small craft for system sweeps.

The brothers died in an accident during a salvaging operation in 1001, and ownership of the company was handed
over to the employees in the form of share ownership. Depending on the level an employee holds in the company,
they take a certain percentage of shares upon joining. Employees are only allowed to sell the shares to another
company employee, hence the company remains in the hands of the staff - a very democratic method of apportion-
ing company profits (and losses). The employees remain fiercely loyal and independent, having rebuffed several
attempts to be brought out by Salvage Factors.

**OPERATIONS**
The company divides its operations into five segments, each led by a “salvage captain”, a fancy name for a man-
ager. Each captain has command of a starship, and each starship has a number of attached small craft and even
scout/couriers, depending on the scale and type of operation. There are three venerable X-Boat Tenders in the fleet,
each commanded by a Salvage Captain. The only Survey Scout is also commanded by a Salvage Captain, and
this ship is used for long range missions where it is not practical to move the Jump-1 Tenders. The final Salvage
Captain runs the base on Efate, and generally has extensive negotiation, trade and negotiation skills for dealings
with potential buyers.

The current fleet consists of the following ships and small craft:

## Converted X-boat Tenders

Scout Service X-boats are unable to maneuver without assistance, so are serviced by tenders. The standard X-boat
tender in Imperial service is a Jump-1, 1-G vessel with five 120 ton boat bays capable of holding 600 tons of small
and large craft, or cargo, or fuel bladders. The three examples acquired by Spinward Salvage are older designs (the
so-called “First Millennium” design), but are well maintained by their engineers. Minor changes have been made to
the fitout of the boat bays, but they remain essentially unchanged from their days in the Scout Service.

The Tenders are of a standard configuration, with vertically arranged decks. The top deck, A deck, contains the
bridge, 10 staterooms, low berths and two small cargo bays. A special operations suite also handles the operations
of the boat bays, and contains a special observation window which provides extensive views.

Decks B through F are the boat bays. Each is capable of holding a scout/courier shaped vessel up to 120 tons
displacement. Spinward Salvage usually reserves B deck for housing any embarked small craft (usually a modular
cutter, extra module and 30 ton tug). The remaining decks are usually given over to cargo, fuel bladder and stor-
age space for salvaged parts.

G Deck contains fuel, while H Deck contains fuel and a small cargo bay with a dedicated area for an engineering
shop. The final deck is I Deck, which houses the drives and powerplant.

Standard armament consists of two dual beam laser turrets, and a triple sandcaster turret. This mix has been re-
tained in the salvage variant operated by Spinward Salvage.

Spinward Salvage maintains a standard crew complement of 10 for these ships: Salvage Captain, three pilots (who
also act as gunners), navigator, two engineers, two small craft pilots (who can also act as gunners) and a medic.
There are also between two and six “Salvage experts“ embarked, a fancy title for what amounts to freelancers who
provide ship-board skills and manpower for the various salvage operations that are undertaken.

## Telemon Class Survey Scout - Jeramiah

A somewhat unusual acquisition made in 1082, the 400 ton Survey Scout was purchased as a barely salvageable
wreck from the Scout Service and extensively rebuilt to the standard _Telemon_ specification. The ship now operates
as a high Jump ship capable of independent search and salvage operations in the Jewell and Querion subsectors,
where distances between systems are much greater than the Regina Subsector. The _Telemon_ class Survey Scout
is an old design that is still produced in some numbers across the Imperium, but has been replaced by the newer
_Donosev_ class survey scout. The design is noted for its powerful sensors, which aid in detection of salvageable
materials.

The port cylinder houses the bridge, computer system, avionics, staterooms and the port maneuver drive. A pas-
sageway links the port cylinder with the starboard cylinder, which houses the primary powerplant, port maneuver
drive, Jump drive, Cutter module bay, a small 7 dton cargo bay and the observation lounge. The Cutter bay normally
houses an additional utility or salvage module, while a fuel module is attached to the Cutter. The observation lounge
has a huge bubble window and doubles as a relaxation lounge, but its primary function is as a sensor suite, with
three sensor workstations controlling the extensive sensor arrays.

B Deck, which is “below” the A deck, consists entirely of fuel, except for the starboard 40 ton cargo bay, which is
accessed from A Deck’s lift. Loading and unloading is undertaken via an extendable iris airlock, allowing ship-to-ship
transfer of cargo. Transferring the Cutter module to the Cutter is a simple process. The Cutter module bay doors
are opened, and small thrusters “push” the module clear of the Survey Scout. The Cutter then maneuvers to pick
up the module. A similar process is undertaken when stowing the module.

Standard crew for the _Jeramiah_ consists of 8: a salvage captain, two pilots, navigator, medic, cutter pilot and two
engineers. Additional “salvage experts” are added as necessary.

## The Scout/couriers

The three scout/couriers in service with the company are standard models, and are used for scouting missions to
find and appraise salvageable ships or other installations. All three have had aeroforms fitted to assist with flight
performance in atmospheres, although most company employees consider them to be a complete waste of time
and have merely been fitted so these ships “look sexy”.

## Cutters And Modules

A cutter is normally carried on each X-boat Tender and the _Jeramiah_ as a fuel collector, lighter, or salvage ship
with the company’s salvage module. The general purpose modules have been used as mini-space stations when
needed, as well as a ground station when undertaking planetary salvage missions. A special Salvage module has
been designed and build by Spinward Salvage, and the company now builds a limited number for other salvage
companies - so long as they do not operate in the Spinward Marches.

**INTRODUCTION**

Starships are the lifeblood of the _Traveller_ Universe. Most campaigns will revolve around at least one starship – the charac-
ter’s. If characters do not possess one, they will likely travel on starships many times in the course of a campaign. Starships
run by characters take on a life of their own as they are husbanded between star systems, illegal operations, and overdue
overhauls. Properly detailed small starships add color to any campaign, even if they are used as encounters rather than PC
starships. Hence this line of booklets from Avenger Enterprises.
This booklet outlines Ling Standard Product’s 300 ton modular starship, The ship designed to be a multi-purpose workhorse
capable of easy customization through the changeout of standard 30 ton Cutter Modules. The ship is seem throughout the
Imperium, and with its 6 module capacity is used in roles as diverse as military support, cargo hauling, exploration and
research.

**STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS**
In order to use this supplement you will need one of the **_Traveller_** rules sets. Statistics are included for T20 and for Classic
**_Traveller_** (CT), though other rules sets can be used with a minimum of work. This supplement is designed to be used in the
Official Traveller Universe (OTU) although the design could be used in any setting that uses Traveller’s starship design rules.
**Dates:** All dates correspond to the standard Imperial calendar from the OTU. This supplement is officially dated 320-1110
(the 320th day of the 1110th year since the founding of the Third Imperium).
**Place:** The starship detailed in this supplement can be used anywhere in charted space, although the adventure seeds and
background details are based in the Spinward Marches Sector.
**Theme:** This supplement provides detailed information on a particular starship used in Charted Space, along with back-
ground details, history, operational use and adventure seeds for using the starship. Deckplans are also provided.

## Vehicle Module

30 tons. The Vehicle module can carry up to two wheeled or tracked AFVs and includes a space for a maintenance
area to allow quick repairs of grav, wheeled and tracked vehicles. The 20 ton vehicle bay allows transport of other
types of vehicles as well. For example, the module could carry 4 air/rafts, or 2 G-Carriers. This module is used by
civilian as well as military organizations for a wide range of roles: pure vehicle transport, vehicle repair and carriage
of AFVs into a battlezone.

The Vehicle Module is essentially a large open bay. The floor of the bay contains a ramp which may be used to
disembark vehicles. The side bay door also open to provide another means of egress. Most of the larger shop tools
and vehicle lift equipment are suspended from the ceiling with additional tools stored in the upper walkways.

## Utility Module

30 tons. The Utility Module is designed to be a multifunction module that provides considerable flexibility for a
modular cutter or ship. The four staterooms can be used for either crew or passengers. A 5 ton space is provided
on the lower deck which can serve as either a vehicle hanger for an air/raft (or some other light vehicle), or cargo
space. A single turret is ventrally mounted, and a small power plant is included to power up to one laser in the tur-
ret. The turret however, relies on the carrying cutter’s or ship’s computer and sensors. A half ton armory is also
included, and is sometimes used as a missile magazine if the laser is replaced by a missile rack.

The Utility Module is sometimes used as a small space station, or landed on a planet for use as a small forward
base.

## Salvage Module

30 tons. The Salvage module is built exclusively by Spinward Salvage, and consists of a modified Utility Module
with an attached grappling arm for handling components externally and the staterooms ripped out to make room for
storage of salvaged parts. A cockpit is fitted to control the grappling arm, which can telescope out to 250 metres,
providing great flexibility during operations. The pulse laser is retained as at a lower power setting, the laser can
be useful if metal needs to be cut during a salvage operation.

## Spinward Salvage Home Base - Efate

Spinward Salvage has maintained a base on Efate for over a century, just outside the city of 30 South. The 40
hectare site contains numerous facilities, including an administration office, fuel depot, engineering shops, hang-
ers, landing pads, a small drydock and storage space for wrecks and ship hulks. A portion of the site is still vacant,
but it is filling up year by year. The site is virtually a mini starport, and has five landing pads that can support up to
1000 ton ships. Overhauls of the company’s 1000 ton Tenders are undertaken at the base, but it is a slow process
to bring the ungainly Tenders down through the atmosphere for landing.

The dry dock can also accommodate ships of up to 1000 tons, and is used to modify existing ships or construct
new ships - mainly with salvaged internal parts. These low-cost ships have new-build hulls, so their structural in-
tegrity is good, but there may be quirks in some internal systems. Spinward Salvage has been in the business of
constructing such ships to order for over 50 years.

The powerplant is a fusion plant which powers all systems in the complex, making the operation independent of Efate’s
power grid. Communications systems housed in the same building provide Advanced level sensors throughout most
of the Efate system, providing the company with a secure means of communicating with their ships in-system.

Because of the non-existent law level on Efate, there are extensive security measures in place to prevent unwel-
come visitors to the site. The entire compound is fenced with barbed wire, security cameras and security drones
who will use stunners to incapacitate intruders. In addition, armed guards conduct regular patrols in two air/rafts
and two ATV’s. The guards are armed with assault rifles and stunners, and have flak jackets. The ATVs and air/rafts
are also armed, with light machine guns. At any time there are two patrols each of four guards operating, 24 hours
per day.

The perimeter is also patrolled by small drones armed with stunners. These provide support and backup for the
human guards.

REGINA
SUBSECTOR

**Grant**

**REGINA SUBSECTOR**
The Regina Subsector lies at the Coreward end of the Spinward Marches Sector. To Coreard (“north” on the map
lies the Vargr Extents, while to Spinward “left” on the map lies Jewell Subsector, which borders the Zhodani Con-
sulate.

The following Amber Zone is set in the Red Zone system of Grant, which lies on the Regina/Jewell subsector border.
This system is also denoted on the Regina Subsector map.

## Adventure: We’ve Lost A Shiny New Scout Cruiser - Can You Help Us Find It?

**PLAYERS’ INFORMATION**
The players are hired by the chief recruiter as a freelancer crew on a world in the Regina Subsector (preferably
Efate, but it could be any world). The pay offered is Cr6,000 per month per crew member, plus 1% of the value of
all items salvaged for the entire group of freelancers. In all, a lucrative deal. The salaries are high because salvag-
ing has such danger attached to it that “hazard pay” is offered.

They are taken to the HQ of Spinward Salvage on Efate, and treated to a massive dinner with much free-flowing
mead. The players are taken the next morning via Modular Cutter into orbit, and are transferred to the ship they
will be commanding, the Survey Scout _Jeramiah_. On the bridge they are introduced to the Salvage Captain for the
mission, Fera Jemasie, an ex-Merchant Vargr. Jemasie explains the job.

The Scout Service has commissioned Spinward Salvage to locate and salvage a ship they have lost. The Scouts
are “99%” sure that the system the ship was lost in was the Grant system in Jewell subsector - Grant being a Red
Zone. The ship is a 1000 ton _Machii_ class Scout cruiser. It is so new only two have been built - the _Machii_ being the
lead ship of the class and therefore could be classified as an experimental ship. It has been designed to replace
the old 1000 ton _Qasar_ class Scout cruisers, which have been in service for over two centuries and in dire need
of replacement.

The role of the _Jeramiah_ is to use its powerful sensors to locate the stricken vessel, investigate and if possible sal-
vage as much equipment as they can from the wreck. The situation on board the _Machii_ is unknown, but the Scout
Service is sure that they are dealing with a salvage scenario rather than a rescue scenario. Jemasie explains that
the search started when it became two months late arriving back at its homeport. The search proved fruitless, but
the Scouts discovered that the ship’s final Jump was from the Lysen system into the Grant system, so the search
should naturally start in the Grant system.

It should become evident to the players that the Grant system is a best guess. The ship may not in fact be in that
system. It could have misjumped, in which case the _Jeramiah_ will be looking for a needle in a thousand haystacks.
The Grant system itself is a Red Zone. Jemasie says that the reason for the Red Zone is rumored to be an at-
mospheric contagion, but the interdiction force is actually a number of Navy-run satellites in geostationary orbit that
will shoot down any craft approaching the planet. Automated warnings are in place to advise ships to refuel at one
of the two gas giants. A small Scout Service detachment is also operating at one of the gas giants, to serve as an
additional warning to ships that may pass through. The “space station” there is nothing more than 5 cutter modules
docked together, with a lifeboat for emergency use. In a Service where isolated duty is often the norm, this posting
would be the most isolated posting of all the isolated postings.

The _Jeramiah_ has been outfitted with a standard Modular Cutter, a fuel module and a salvage module. The per-
manent Spinward Salvage crew members on board are the Salvage Captain and the two engineers. The other
positions that require filling are: two pilots, navigator, medic and small craft pilot. Two additional “salvage experts”
could to be carried if there are additional characters who need to be part of the crew.

**Required Skills and Equipment**

Shipboard skills are essential, particularly pilot, engineer, computer, sensors, zero-G and astrogation skills. If the
players don’t have at least some of these skills, they won’t be hired. Additional useful skills for part two of this ad-
venture would be streetwise, investigate, carouse and stealth skills.

**REFEREE’S INFORMATION**
Spinward Salvage has built up a good working relationship with the Scout Service in the Marches over the decades,
partly due to the company’s willingness to buy surplus Scout ships, and partly due to the company’s great track
record undertaking salvage work for the Service. These connections are invaluable, as the Scout Service has
another job for the company - an important one.

The Scout Service is also looking for the _Machii_ in systems other than the one Spinward Salvage is looking in, but
all involved are doubtful that they will find the _Machii_ in any mainstream system - otherwise it would have been
located by now.

The lush jungle world of Grant is interdicted because the atmosphere of the planet has a particularly nasty hal-
lucinogenic effect on humans - inducing extreme paranoia. The first Scout mission to survey the planet ended in
disaster, as the crew ended up killing each other after blowing up their scout/courier. Further missions revealed
that the atmosphere somehow penetrated hostile environment suits, so after the loss of more Scouts, the world
was permanently interdicted. The players may find this out the hard way if they decide to run the satellite blockade
for some strange reason. Within 2D **hours** of exposure to the atmosphere, the players will be actively engaged in
trying to kill each other.

**JUMP TO GRANT**

After the necessary preparations are complete, the Survey Scout will Jump to the Grant system. The system itself
has two gas giants, Grant itself, three rockballs and two asteroid fields. There is a significant amount of space to
cover to try to detect the ship.

The system statistics are as follows:
0.4 AU*: ROCKBALL 100000-0
0.9 AU: GRANT 664100-0

4 AU: SMALL GAS GIANT (Scout detachment of 5 people in a small space station)
5 AU: ROCKBALL S00000-0

6 AU: ASTEROID FIELD
10 AU: ROCKBALL S00000-0
21 AU: SMALL GAS GIANT

25 AU: ASTEROID FIELD
100 AU: OORT CLOUD

- Astronomical Units

On exiting Jump space, the ship will be hailed by the Scout space station. “Spinward Salvage vessel _Jeramiah_ , this
is Scout station 01 at Grant A, welcome to the welcoming Grant system. We have been expecting your arrival.“ The
Scouts explain that no ship can enter orbit around Grant, otherwise they will be shot to smithereens by the Navy
satellites. They explain that if one were to land on Grant, they would be committing suicide, as an atmospheric
contagion causes death in hours. Other than that, the Survey Scout is free to search the system. The Scouts fur-
ther note that they did not detect the _Machii_ or any other Scout Service vessel entering the system in the last two
months, so they are adamant the ship is not in the system. Their lifeboat has been used to make some sensor
sweeps of the 4 AU gas giant orbit, as well as the Grant orbit, but nothing has been found.

However, such a search is the domain of a ship like the _Jeramiah_. Within a one light year volume of a star lies 9.46
trillion cubic kilometres of space, so there is a lot of volume to search.

**THE DISCOVERY**
The _Machii_ is in fact in the Grant system. It is however, drifting without power in the outer asteroid field. Depend-
ing on where the _Jeramiah_ starts searching first, it may take days or weeks to find the ship. Each orbit should be
searched with 12 formidable rolls (one every 6 hours - 4 per day) against Sensors skills and intelligence and the
associated modifiers for the sensor suite the Survey Scout possesses. The Oort cloud will take ten times as long ie:
120 formidable rolls - and they wont find the _Machii_ there anyway. The search through each orbit can be widened
if the Cutter is used, but the cutter’s sensors are poor compared to the Survey Scout, so the cutter may search the
25 AU orbit, but will not find anything.

Eventually (hopefully), the Survey Scout will find the _Machii_. It will be a lucky find, with false returns from asteroids
confusing the sensor picture. Returns may seem to indicate a ship, but only if the formidable roll is made, will the
ship actually detect the _Machii_.

Salvage operations can now begin. The Survey Scout and/or the cutter will pull alongside the hulk, and there will
be no signs of power on the vessel. There is some considerable damage to the hull, so the ship appears to have
suffered a mishap of some sort, either in Jump space or when it arrived in the Grant system. The crew will investi-
gate the wreck through some reasonably dangerous EVA. Everything is recorded through cameras on the vacc suit
helmets, so footage can be reviewed in the future. The ship’s structure is largely intact, but much of the interior of
the ship has been trashed - methodically so. A search of the entire ship will reveal the following disturbing facts.

1. There is no sign of the crew - no bodies, nothing. However, if the characters decide to undertake a scan
of the surrounding area (a difficult check against sensors skill), they will find the bodies of two dead scouts float-
ing in space, a male and a female. They are not wearing vacc suits, and appear to have suffered from explosive
decompression. The bodies should be retrieved for return to their families.
2. The damage to the hull can be discerned by anyone with engineering skill to be impacts from asteroid type bod-
ies. This is what caused the explosive decompressions.
3. Both small craft (the lifeboat and the launch are missing). The air/raft is still in its bay, so this is salvageable.
The ATV bay is empty, but the briefing indicated that no ATV was carried. This may lead the characters to scan for
the small craft. They will find none.
4. The turrets are also salvageable, and will require an average mechanic check to successfully remove. An ex-
ceptional failure could mean major issues out in the zero-G environment. The work is hard and time consuming,
but the eight beam lasers are in good condition. The sandcaster turret is smashed however, by an impact from an
asteroid fragment. This is easily confirmed because the fragment is firmly wedged inside the turret.
5. The bridge controls and computer systems, as well as all the sensors, have been carefully removed, as if by a
salvage team. A difficult roll against computer skill is required to retrieve some data from the few remaining systems.
The data reveals that the _Machii_ successfully entered Jump, but upon exiting Jump in one of the Grant system’s
asteroid fields both the ship’s power systems suffered a massive overload, frying all electronics and power conduits.
Floating helpless in space, unable to even send a distress signal, the ship seems to have simultaneously suffered
a collision with a debris field, causing explosive decompression. It is a strange and cruel set of circumstances. The
data stops when the ship’s power system was fried.
6. Any salvageable parts from the Jump drives have been removed (Zuchai crystals etc).
7. The cargo bay, ship’s locker and staterooms has been stripped clean of anything valuable.

During the salvage, each significant action undertaken during EVA will have to be checked against zero-G skills.
There is considerable danger in the tasks, hence the need for checks. Exceptional failures will result in the need
for remedial action. For instance, an exceptional failure in retrieving debris floating in space with a thruster pack
could see the character concerned needing to be rescued by others. An exceptional failure in opening a struck
hatch could mean a tear in the character’s vacc suit that may need repairing. The table below outlines the kinds
of actions that require checking.

Task Characteristic Difficulty
Open a stuck hatch in Zero-G (1-6 minutes) Strength Easy
Force open a struck valve in Zero-G (1-6 minutes) Strength Easy
Retrieve debris floating in space (such as bodies) using a thruster pack
(10-60 minutes)

Dexterity Difficult

Use the cutter module’s grappling arm to move an object (1-6 minutes) Dexterity Routine
Crawl through a small accessway on the Machii (10-60 minutes) Endurance Routine
Move a large object in space with a thruster pack (1-6 minutes) Strength Difficult

The salvage operation is now complete - the hulk is all that remains to be picked up by a larger ship. The burning
question is however - who beat them to the salvage? How did this mystery salvage team know where to look - in
a Red Zone system that hardly ever sees any traffic? Why did the Scouts in their little space station not detect
another ship in the system? Why did this salvage team (or bunch of scavengers or whoever they are) not take the
weaponry and the air/raft?

**QUESTIONS ON EFATE**
These questions should be asked back at the headquarters of Spinward Salvage. Once back in orbit around Efate,
the characters take a trip to the home base via the Survey Scout’s cutter. The debriefing at the administration office
is attended by the CEO of Spinward Salvage, Lar Derren, and his head of security, Diane Hertzog. The small item
of payment for the salvage is also taken care of. A payment of Cr 82,750 is made, being 1% of the value of the
salvageable material. The hull is not counted, as it is probably not salvageable, according to Derren.

Arrangements are made for the Scout Service to retrieve the hulk in the Grant system using a 20,000 ton Scout
ship, which will leave from Efate as soon as possible.

The debriefing continues, with the details conveyed through the character’s descriptions of events as well as video
footage of the salvage itself. At the end of the discussion, Hertzog, who has said nothing but recorded everything
on a digital dictaphone, speaks up.

“Either we have a mole in our company passing information to a rival - or the Scout Service in the subsector has
a mole. Either way, the only way a rival firm could conduct a salvage so quickly was if they had information about
the system where the scout cruiser was last headed to. Our preparations for salvage didn’t move quickly enough.”
She turns to Derren, who is contemplating what to say next.

“I think we need to do some digging ourselves. We need to find out what Salvage Factors knows about the _Machii_
and its fate. We would like your team to investigate this further. I think the best way to go about this is to get to Feri
as soon as possible and find out whatever you can about the current operations Salvage Factors is undertaking.
Their home port is Feri, so it may be best to start there. We will keep you on the payroll for a bit longer, until we get
to the bottom of this. You should take the _Jeramiah_ - it will only take one Jump and you will be there. If you find out
it is Salvage Factors doing the dirty on us, you will be handsomely rewarded.”

Should the characters be pushed on what “handsomely” means, the CEO will merely say that at the very least, he
will keep the team on the payroll, having done such a good job so far. “We have plenty of work to be done, and
plenty of resources at our disposal.“

The team should leave for Feri as soon as possible. The Salvage Captain steps aside from this mission, as it is not
a salvage mission, but a corporate spying mission. The characters will take command of the _Jeramiah_ directly.

**FERRETING ON FERI**
The Jump into the Feri system proceeds immediately. Hertzog accompanies them and during the Jump discussion
takes place on how to approach the mission. Hertzog recommends Jumping into the system as far as possible
away from the mainworld, and approaching via cutter. She does not want the _Jeramiah_ to be detected, and then
for questions to be asked at the starport and in the Feri underground. Several avenues exist for extracting the
required information. If the characters do not think of them, Hertzog will suggest them. Cunning characters could
think of more.

**1. Go to Feri’s Highport or town where the Salvage Factors offices are located and start asking some ques-
tions amongst people who may know what is going on.**

Following this approach will reveal some startling facts - Feri locals generally like the company, and they seem to
dislike offworlders who come to the planet to ask questions. No amount of bribery will generate any useful informa-
tion. In fact, at one bar near the Salvage Factors offices the characters will be confronted by five thugs who will not
take kindly to the questions being asked. They will start a brawl. It is not initially clear whether these thugs are in
the employ of Salvage Factors, but it soon becomes clear that they are low level workers for the company. They
are burly men with a great deal of loyalty to the company, and will be very aggressive.

Only after this encounter will someone useful contact the characters and ask to meet them in a private location.
Jane Armitage, a middle aged woman with a nervous disposition will meet with the characters. She will show her
Salvage Factors employee card, and show other credentials to prove her links to Salvage Factors. Armitage seems
uncomfortable with what she is doing, but explains that she is looking after her sick husband who cannot work, and
asks for Cr 50,000 before she will talk. Hertzog initially rejects the offer, but relents given that there are no other

leads. The payment is made, and Armitage gives a full explanation along with stolen data on disk to back up the
story. See “A Minefield of Information”, below.

**2. Hack into the Salvage Factors computer network and obtain the information illegally.**
If any of the characters have reasonable computer skills this could be a possibility. The characters can gain access
to the network via the Feri’s Worldnet computer grid. To break into the system will require a Very Difficult roll against
computer skill with intelligence modifiers. The task will take 1-6 hours. Intrusion programs can be used, and security
programs are being run by the company. Hertzog has available on her hand computer a TL 11 Intrusion program,
but if the characters want a higher level intrusion program, they may have try to purchase one on Feri, a Very Dif-
ficult task against any streetwise or investigate skills the characters may possess. The company is running a TL
12 Security program on their internal network. An exceptional failure will mean the characters have been detected,
and will be hunted down by the local police. An average failure will mean the intrusion attempt will be detected the
next day by Salvage Factors staff, but the source of the hacking cannot be determined.

Such an encounter depends on where the characters have their gateway to the Worldnet. If the characters have
positioned themselves and the gateway on the planet’s surface or in the Highport in orbit, the police will arrive within
1d6x10 minutes and attempt to arrest the characters, assuming they are still in that location. If the characters have
accessed the Worldnet from a more remote location - for instance via a commlink from orbit on the cutter, their ship
will be approached by an armed police ship’s boat within 2d6x5 minutes and asked to heave-to and be boarded.
The ship’s boat will be armed with a single pulse laser. This will lead to arrest and possible imprisonment.

**3. Break into the Salvage Factors offices on the surface of Feri and collect the information needed.**
While it is a given that the characters will find the information they are looking for, it will be a difficult task to break
into the offices, and a very good chance of being caught. A brief survey of the offices, which are located in a high
rise building, reveals extensive security - armed guards, sniffer dogs and controlled access to the floors. This may
be a last resort, but Hertzog will not stand in the way of such an approach. However, the characters will probably
be caught, injured and possibly even killed in the attempt.

**If the characters are caught doing anything illegal,** Spinward Salvage will come to their aid and hire the best
lawyers to get them off. They will be banned from entering the Feri system again however. If the characters kill or
injure anyone in any of their attempts to gain the information, they will be charged and convicted, and sent to a
Feri jail. There will be little Spinward Salvage can do about this. Obviously, going around maiming or killing people
on a high law level world will have devastating consequences. Injuring others will attract a 1d6 year prison term,
and killing 1d6+10 years.

**A MINEFIELD OF INFORMATION**
Assuming the characters come across the verifiable information their employer requires, it will not be good news
for Spinward Salvage, LIC. But the information will prove of great value to Spinward Salvage, and the group will
be paid a bonus of Cr 100,000 on their return to Efate, as well as continued employment with Spinward Salvage,
should the characters wish to do so.

Essentially, the relationship Salvage Factors has with Ling Standard Products (LSP) has proven to be of great
value. LSP provided Salvage Factors with the complete flight plan for the shakedown cruise of the _Machii_ in Jewell
subsector. After all, it was LSP who built the ship on Mora, and LSP engineers were part of the crew of the _Machii_.
Obviously, LSP did not expect the _Machii_ to be lost, but as soon as LSP operatives in Regina subsector found out
their new-build ship was overdue, they traced the last Jump to the Grant system and immediately contracted Salvage
Factors to conduct a secret search and possible salvage operation. A LSP-registered Jump-4 ship was hurriedly
prepared at an LSP facility in the Feri system, with a stealth coating applied to the ship to make it almost invisible
to sensors. Crewed by salvage experts from Salvage Factors, the ship Jumped to the Grant system, located and
conducted the salvage before Spinward Salvage arrived. It was an incredibly lucrative operation for both LSP and
Salvage Factors.

It seems LSP wanted to find out what went wrong and collect what was salvageable, as well as get paid for the
rebuilding of the _Machii_. However, Spinward Salvage has now found out about the deception, and as soon as Lar
Derren is presented with the information, he travels with the characters and Hertzog to the Scout Way Station

orbiting Efate, to present to the local Scout Service officials. The meeting lasts only two hours, but at the end the
Way Station commander points out that it is highly unlikely LSP will be building any more scout ships of any kind
for the Service in the Marches, and they will probably have the contract to build the _Machii_ ships cancelled. As for
Salvage Factors, he would make sure the Scout Service in the Marches would never undertake work with them
again. Their favoured company would remain Spinward Salvage.

Derren and Hertzog can barely contain their glee at the stupidity of LSP and Salvage Factors. Derren points out
that it is a tough market, and any kind of edge over Salvage Factors is a huge advantage.

**ALLIES AND ENEMIES**

The characters will gain some new allies, notably the CEO of Spinward Salvage and their staff. However, the local
Scout Service personnel a the Way Station in the Efate system will also become allies of the characters, especially
when they are in the employ of Spinward Salvage.

It is the enemies the characters have gained that will be an issue however. Salvage Factors staff are now even
more implacable enemies of the characters and Spinward Salvage staff, and any meeting between them will usu-
ally result in some kind of violence. LSP staff in Regina subsector now become enemies of the characters, and this
may become an issue outside of Regina subsector over time.

Two weeks after the meeting with the Scout Service, the Spinward Salvage compound on Efate is attacked by
mortars. There is some damage to a hanger and no injuries, but it serves as a reminder that the cold war between
Spinward Salvage and Salvage Factors is about to get much hotter. It is also learnt that the informant on Feri “com-
mitted suicide” - a police investigation is underway, but it shows what a high stakes game corporate espionage is,
and LSP and Salvage Factors mean business.

The characters are asked to stay on. They are given a choice of roles. One is to crew the Survey Scout to conduct
a salvage of an old mining base in Lanth subsector. Unfortunately the world’s critters are a tad un-welcoming,
as is the climate. so there may be some bloody critter-clearing to do. There is also the command of a company
scout/courier up for grabs for another corporate spying mission against Salvage Factors in the Regina subsector.
It’s their choice...

## Machii Class Scout Cruiser

The _Machii_ is the lead ship of a new class of long range Scout Cruisers designed to operate independently both
within the Imperium and beyond its borders. The design is rather more rational than its predecessor, the _Qasar_
class Scout Cruiser, which included a 100 ton scout/courier as one of its “small craft”. The _Machii_ has extensive
redundant systems, including a backup Jump drive, thrusters, computer and backup powerplant. The _Machii_ also
packs in extensive sensors and probe drones, designed to collect vast amounts of data while surveying worlds and
systems. The _Machii_ also carries an extensive complement of small craft - a Launch, a Lifeboat (which can be easily
configured to carry passengers), an air/raft and ATV. The _Machii_ is designed to land of the surface of worlds.

Built by Ling Standard Products at its Mora dockyard, the _Machii_ was on one of its shakedown cruises in the Jewell
Subsector when it was lost. The second ship of the class is currently building at the same shipyard, and is currently
un-named.
