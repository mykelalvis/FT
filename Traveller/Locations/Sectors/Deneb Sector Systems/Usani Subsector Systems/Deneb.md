### DENEB

The Deneb system was named for its blue-white giant primary rather than its mainworld, although eventually the name of the mainworld was changed. Deneb is the homeworld of the Nenlat, an amphibious minor race who had achieved only the most basic technology when humans arrived.

The Nenlat evolved in low-lying wetlands and most still occupy these areas. Their traditional villages are capable of maintaining a TL4 society, with some imported high-technology items here and there. 'High technology' in the case of the Nenlat means around TL6-8 for the most part. Higher-tech items require too much support and do not remain functional for long in the damp conditions favored by traditional Nenlat.

Some Nenlat live among the 'interstellar' society of Deneb, which is made up mostly of humans with some Vargr and other species scattered among them. These Nenlat are thoroughly Imperial in outlook and consider themselves superior to 'traditional' wetlands Nenlat.  This manifests itself as contempt and a tendency towards patronising protectiveness. There is no real animosity, just a lack of understanding between the two cultures.

Deneb is a major center for the Church of Stellar Divinity, which is hardly surprising since the system's primary is one of the most impressive stars in Charted Space. The local variant of the Church considers that
'their' star-god is bigger and better than the others and that, therefore, they are the chosen people. This does not go over well with other worshippers, who consider the Denebian branch of the faith to be a bit too holier-than-thou.

Religious law is very strict in the cities of Deneb and enforced with vigour. There is no secular law, other than regulations for interstellar trade and commerce.  Everything else is governed by religious law, although most of it is broadly similar to the codes used by other civilised societies. Visitors can fall foul of the many peculiar technicalities of Denebian law but most infractions are dealt with by a token fine (described as a donation towards good works and actually used for that purpose in almost all cases) and a requirement to perform a minor penance. This is almost always a trivial task accompanied by a sermon on how it relates to the key elements of Denebian faith. The system is intended to teach visitors about the world's religion and perhaps win converts, although most offworlders find it tiresome.

Deneb has what is thought to be an Ancients site. It is quite extensive but almost completely ruined and appears to have been a major city at one time. Most of the ruin is semi-submerged in the wetlands, although the land was probably well drained when it was built.  Nenlat children play among the tumbled spires and broken walls, gaining access despite the best efforts of a private security firm to let only properly authorized scientists study the remains.

NENLAT



ANIMAL HITS SPEED Nenlat 21 6 m SKILLS Melee (natural) 1, Survival 1 ATTACKS Stinger (1D)
TRAITS Amphibious BEHAVIOUR Omnivore, Sophont

The Nenlat are semi-aquatic sophonts native to Deneb's wetlands and equally at home walking on land or swimming in shallow water. Their barrel-shaped bodies are trilaterally near-symmetrical, with three legs, three arms and three flippers. A head containing the brain and most sensory organs faces the 'central' arm and leg, with the shorter central arm used for most fine manipulation tasks and the longer 'side-rear' arms better suited to manoeuvring through weed-cluttered waters.

Nenlat have a stinger at the back of the neck, which can curve up over the head to strike a target gripped by the Nenlat. Normally, the stinger lies along the back, although it may twitch about when the Nenlat is agitated.
The stinger's venom is capable of killing smaller creatures but is painful rather than life-threatening to humans.
