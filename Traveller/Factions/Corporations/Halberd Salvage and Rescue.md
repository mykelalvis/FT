# Halberd Salvage and Rescue

Halberd Salvage and Rescue is primarily a salvage and starship-breaking company. It has small yards at various Class C starports where old or damaged ships can be dismantled for spare parts. These yards sell components but do not undertake repairs. However, starfarers will often take the components they have bought out of the yard and the landing pad across to their own ship where they install them with the assistance of a technician from the yard. This practice puts a little legal distance between the company and the ship if something goes wrong.

Halberd operates legally, and takes due care to ensure that it only handles legitimate components whose origin can be traced. This can be a nightmarish exercise in bureaucratic puzzle-solving but it has gained the firm a solid reputation for fair and honest dealing. There is still the occasional legal complication, especially where salvage laws differ from one system to another. For example, some world governments claim that legitimate salvage undertaken in one system becomes illegal because the components were transported through its territory, even though the operation was legal at both ends. Halberd refutes such claims but as a rule tries not to become embroiled by avoiding systems with convoluted salvage laws. Even if they have no means to enforce them in space, such world governments can cause legal trouble, usually with the intent of gaining ownership of the ‘illegal’ salvage.

The dismantling and component-sales side of the business brings in a steady income from starship captains who want to save money on spares and repairs, and is augmented by a flotilla of rescue and salvage tugs. These have the ability to tow a distressed vessel
(though multiple tugs would be needed to tow a larger ship) and have facilities to take off a crew who have no option but to abandon their vessel. Among the standard fittings of a Halberd tug is a device designed to catch escape pods and bring them into a rescue bay. This system is, unfortunately, also used by some smugglers who will drop an escape pod containing contraband to be picked up by another vessel. Halberd tugs are regularly boarded and searched, but have never been implicated in smuggling.

Halberd Salvage & Rescue operates out of several Class C and D starports, most of which cannot afford rescue craft of their own and instead hire a Halberd tug for a flat fee. The firm’s reputation for getting there in time and averting a catastrophe is sufficiently good that the presence of a Halberd vessel often influences trader captains’ opinion of a system’s safety. Halberd craft are usually armed for self-defence but routinely refuse to be nudged into a pirate-deterrent role. Their standard contract explicitly states that they are not obligated to enter a situation where weapons fire is ongoing or hostilities are likely. Halberd ships will sometimes assist a vessel under fire anyway, but they are careful to avoid creating a situation where port operators use them as defensive craft.
