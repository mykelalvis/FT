Space that has been explored by humans is referred to as Charted Space. Within this region are many areas densely populated and well-travelled by starships. Others are backwaters or have never been more than superficially mapped.

The most prevalent sentient species in Charted Space is human, and the most powerful human state is the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]], although there are many other powers, great and small, along with independent worlds and political groups.

There are few areas about which absolutely everything is known and, even if an area had been properly explored, the data may not be publicly available or the public version may be entirely incorrect. There is still plenty to be discovered, even in the settled regions of Charted Space, and beyond the core areas many mysteries await discovery.
