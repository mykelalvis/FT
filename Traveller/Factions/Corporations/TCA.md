# TCA

It is quite difficult to find out what ‘TCA’ stands for, but those in the know may reveal that it is an abbreviation for The Courier Alliance. This is more than likely true, since the ‘firm’ (it is really more of a loose association) exclusively operates Type S Scout/Couriers.

The vast majority of these vessels are operated by former Imperial Interstellar Scout Service personnel who have been assigned a vessel when leaving to go on Detached Duty. This means that most of TCA’s ships are old and battered but serviceable, and more importantly they are maintained by the Scout Service and cost the operators nothing more than life support and running costs. Many people associate small ships like the Scout/Courier with the ‘small package trade’, which is often a euphemism for smuggling. In fact, with such a low overhead a Type-S operator can make a reasonable profit entirely above the law... though that does not preclude the occasional piece of smuggling if the opportunity arises.

TCA specialises in small-cargo shipping and courier work, to which its vessels are well suited. They can also carry a passenger or two, though not in great comfort, and undertake a variety of mapping, survey and contract-science operations for independent clients. There are many who resent the fact that The Courier Alliance has essentially been provided with its vessels for free and can undercut operators who have mortgage payments and other overheads, but there is little that can be done about it.

Competitors often try to discredit TCA by pointing out that its personnel are detached Scouts with a duty to provide intelligence to their active-duty colleagues back at the nearest IISS base. TCA members are quite open about this, however, which makes it hard to present as a dirty secret. TCA ship operators will confirm that any chart they make or scientific mission they carry out will be included in their next report, but that report may not be made for a very long time. If the client wants confidentiality, they can pay someone else a whole lot more to carry out the same job.

TCA has found a niche in the local commercial sector, and the Scout Service is apparently quite happy with the situation. Presumably the flow of information from TCA members is deemed useful enough to be worth essentially subsidising private business on the part of the scout ship operators. Although TCA is a loose organisation, and not really a business firm in the usual sense, it does fulfil a traditional meaning of the term
‘company’, i.e. an association of individuals engaged in the same enterprise. Its members look out for one another and will occasionally gather several ships together for some purpose.

The most famous incidence of this was when sixteen Scout/Couriers mustered and a cargo of valuable artefacts was placed aboard one of them, with the others acting as decoys while the principal ship made its run. Hiring sixteen starships for several weeks was not cheap, but the gambit worked well enough that it has been used on a smaller scale on other occasions.
