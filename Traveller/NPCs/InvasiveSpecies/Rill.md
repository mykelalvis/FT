RILL DUNKNEVER
[[Vilani]] Male 51 (667859)
![[Rill_Portrait.jpg]]

Rill is the ducal heir’s personal steward and attends to his every need during the expedition. During the jumps from [[Sirma]] to [[Tinea-Fabre]], the Travellers come to know and appreciate old Rilly’s excellent cooking. Even when the _Superb Starling_ is sputtering and stalling due to poor maintenance, at least they get to eat well.
