Also known as the 'sandlion'. This 100 kilogram four- legged predator resembles a [[Terra|Terran]] lion in form but is more similar to an armadillo in other regards. The dunvic is a stealthy animal with a carapace that provides camouflage, making it difficult to find, much less sneak up on. Hunters of the creature must take care lest they become the hunted.
