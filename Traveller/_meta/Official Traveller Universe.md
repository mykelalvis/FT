# The Official Traveller Universe (OTU)

The Official Traveller Universe (OTU) was first created in the 1970s. It was gradually added to and developed through many years to become the standard setting for Traveller games. The body of information set in the OTU published over the years has become known as the 'Traveller Canon'. However, since canon was developed by different people at different times there are inevitably a few inconsistencies and even contradictions.

This means that at times it was necessary to choose between conflicting versions of 'canon' or to eliminate concepts that jarred with either the remainder of the setting or with common sense. Where this was done any changes made as a result are as subtle as possible.

However, canon is something that game designers worry about. It is a baseline used to ensure that published materials do not clash or contradict one another. Once an individual Traveller Referee starts running a game, the Official Traveller Universe becomes that Referee's Traveller Universe. Fans often use abbreviations like MTU (My Traveller Universe) and YTU (Your Traveller Universe) when discussing this.

What this all means is that once you get your hands on this book, the Traveller Universe (TU) becomes YOURS. You decide what concepts to ignore, which ones to use and which ones to replace with something that fits the setting you want to play in more closely.

There are also a few places where something is not mentioned that can be found in another supplement covering the same area. Unless it is specifically said that it is not there, there is no assumption that it does not exist. That is up to you. If you have an old magazine that says that planet X has a moon made of cheese strings and it has been omitted here, you get to decide whether you want cheese– string–moon in or out of your TU. This sourcebook is a starting point, not a straitjacket.
