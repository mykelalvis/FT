# AMBER ZONE

An Amber Zone is a warning to Travellers. It may be an official warning from an interstellar polity, the world itself or it may be a classification of a private service such as the Travellerâ€™s Aid Society. Conditions warranting an Amber Zone designation may include natural hazards, such as a corrosive or insidious atmosphere, very high pressures or temperatures, severe geologic activity or high risk of meteoric activity such as in a primordial star system. Human factors, including lack of a government or law enforcement, extremes of either or both, an ongoing war or civil disturbance may prompt an Amber Zone designation.
