## PIRACY ON THE SPINWARD MAIN

The practice of piracy involves more than a crippling shot, a boarding party and a swift escape into the blackness of space. Even pirates must obey certain laws; the laws of economics, ecology and political reality. Piracy has flourished in particular places and follows a progression from simple outlawry to organised business (sometimes to the formalised status of privateer). Mutineers, hijackers and other 'wildcatting' pirates appear dashing but successful long-term piracy requires intelligent, planned adaptation to conditions, like any other enterprise. In the words of the overused phrase, 'there are old pirates and bold pirates but there are few old, bold pirates'.

The major feature distinguishing the business of piracy from the merchant's trade is its systematic acceptance of illegal violence to enhance the normal effort to buy low and sell high. Under certain conditions, the pirate entrepreneur may slip freely back into the merchant role. Like the merchant, the pirate requires a ship, crew, source of goods and a market in which to sell them. He faces the same risks of accident, malfunction and remoteness from aid in a crisis. His routine varies only as dictated by his status as an outlaw.

Poverty, mutiny, other crimes or temperament can force experienced spacers into piracy as a livelihood. The illegal acquisition of a starship will be a relatively easy task for experienced spacers (albeit rather dangerous). Obvious approaches include hijacking, mutiny and 'skipping'; a successful pirate might someday boast funds enough for an outright purchase of a ship! An exchange of ships may sometimes be useful, when the crew's current vessel is damaged, 'hot' or inadequately equipped.

What sort of ship suits the pirate's needs? The requirements of illicit space travel come into play here. Streamlining is essential for frontier refuelling without recourse to port authorities. The jump drive should be sufficient for rapid travel but not so large as to require excessive crew. Piracy itself dictates hardpoints and turrets, plus space for cargo and captives (perhaps in low berths). Superior sensors will detect nearby ships and altered transponders will lull suspicions of both victims and police. Forged documentation is, of course, a necessity if the ship is to survive in patrolled space.

Realistically, very few pirate vessels will have all (or even a majority) of these facets. Scout/couriers and far traders will be most common in the 'trade', with their integral hardpoints, streamlining and jump-2 capability obvious assets. Without mortgage repayments, the costs of operating a starship are low; fuel can be skimmed from gas giants or remote oceans and even a minor success will generate the few tens of thousands of Credits needed for salaries, life-support and maintenance.

Prizes can be stripped of costly equipment or sold intact to illegal buyers. Kidnapping for ransom, extortion and the fencing of valuable cargo can offer other sources of cash. There are major problems, however. Access to facilities, not their expense, is the key to on-going piracy. Basic ships stores can be extorted from casual traffic, purchased under a 'cover' identity or delivered through a second ship (willingly or under duress). Annual maintenance and repairs of battle damage will require lengthy stops in a Class A or B starport. Battle damage can be difficult to explain to port authorities (bear in mind that not everyone can be bribed and not all those who can will stay bought). Secure maintenance can be a difficult and expensive proposition, and such bases will delimit the natural 'ranges' of successful pirates. Without secure bases of operation, pirates will lead a hand-to mouth existence, extorting or conning their way through groundside repairs, always one jump ahead of the fleet, having to abandon vessels with great frequency, or operating unreliable ships increasingly prone to dangerous malfunctions. Pirates with such handicaps will be no match for the local authorities, armed merchantmen or jealous rivals.

Personnel must be taken into consideration as well. Few ship's crew will care to spend their entire lives onboard ship, slowly accumulating money. Ship's crew must be given rest and recreation in port at frequent intervals or they will soon desert or mutiny. In addition, pirate crews are not renowned for their high moral fibre or extreme loyalty; many a second-in-command has 'promoted' himself with murder. Many crewmembers will get revenge for a slight (real or imagined) by betraying their ship and turning state's evidence. A captain who took command by mutiny could very well have set the precedent for his own downfall.

Pirates must seek out Class A or B starports beyond the borders of major states and controlled by authorities too weak or too immoral to bar suspected criminals from their facilities. They must also remember the cardinal rule: Don't get greedy. If you become enough of a threat to business, either the business will go away or somebody (not necessarily the law) will remove you as a threat. No matter how big you are, there is always somebody bigger and it is usually a good idea not to attract their attention. In seeking prey, cost efficiency directs pirate attention to ports of Class C or better, with their higher volume of traffic. Such ports provide immediate targets for piracy but also present the danger of a rapid response from the authorities. A laden merchant is most securely looted at a distance from its last known location; Intimidated, hijacked or lasered into compliance, a ship can be boarded and re-programmed for jump to a nearby empty system, with time in jumpspace for a leisurely inventory of the take. The main problem with piracy is that a given region can only support so many 'predators'. If trade is disrupted too much, merchants will avoid the area and the pirates will 'starve'.

The analogy to nature can be carried further; shepherds expect a few losses from their flocks as part of the cost of doing business. If wolves begin killing too many sheep, however, the shepherds will find it worth their while to organise a large-scale hunt to wipe the wolves out or drive them away.

### SPINWARD SPECIFICS

Only five worlds in the [[Spinward Marches]] combine the technical and political requirements of a pirate haven with a convenient proximity to under policed stretches of space:

[[Thanber]] ([[Querion Subsector|Querion]] 0717) Class B starport, Government 5, Law Level 3. Thanber lies at the edge of a region of a dozen worlds between Zhodani space and the [[Darrian Confederation]]. The [[Zhodani]] are not a market for stolen goods but some business can be done with the [[Darrians]].

[[Tremous Dex]] ([[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] 1311) Class B starport, Government 1, Law Level 1. Tremous Dex has access to nearly 20 systems outside of the Imperial borders in the [[Jewell Subsector|Jewell]] and [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] subsectors.

[[Debarre]] ([[Darrian Subsector|Darrian]] 0830) Class B starport, Government 2, Law Level 3. Debarre adjoins a range of some 12 worlds between the [[Darrian Subsector|Darrian]] and [[Sword Worlds Subsector]]s and connects to the next range.

[[Asteltine]] ([[District 268]] 0931) Class B starport, Government 0, Law Level 2. From here there are connections with 20 systems along the fringes of the [[Sword Worlds Subsector|Sword Worlds]] and across [[District 268]].

[[Trexalon]] ([[District 268]] 1339) Class B starport, Government 5, Law Level 1. From Trexalon, another 20 worlds extend from the limits of the Asteltine range rimward through District 268 and into the Outrim Void.

Referees should bear in mind that the populations and governments of these worlds will not openly condone piracy and will aid in its extermination if it begins to cut too much into the circulation of trade in the region. Remember, a small, discretely run operation will be the most successful in the long run. Inspiration can be drawn from the way pirates in the 'real world' operated. Research the Caribbean pirates and privateers of the late 1600's to early 1700's AD. Note in particular the career of Henry Morgan, a pirate/ privateer for the first part of his career, then a privateer for the British in his later life.
