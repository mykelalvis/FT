### SAURUS
Saurus is a border world, strategically significant only in that it provides a jump-2 link from Sword World space towards Lanth. It is an entirely habitable world that has remained undeveloped partially for lack of trade links passing through and partly due to a combination of local factors.

Saurus was named for the great variety of reptilian life encountered by early explorers. Some creatures are very large, posing a threat to farms and settlements within their territory but the most notable reptiles are a minor race catalogued as [[Saurian]]s by Imperial researchers. Their own name for their species is difficult to pronounce so the nickname has become universal.

Human colonists arrived on Saurus before the native inhabitants were identified as sentient and claimed areas of the planet with a stable TL7 society, which incorporates significant numbers of Saurians as workers. These 'humanised' Saurians operate vehicles and machines at a basic level but are insufficiently intelligent to be safe without supervision. 'Like a Saurian in an air/raft' is a local figure of speech for well-meaning ineptitude.

There are larger numbers of native Saurians living all over the planet. Those dwelling close to human-dominated settlements trade for tools and can be quite inventive in their use.  More distant groups are still living as they were when humans arrived, using well-made stone and wooden tools. A number of scientific expeditions have visited Saurus, observing the influence of a more advanced society on the developing [[Saurian]]s.
