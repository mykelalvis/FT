# INTRODUCTION

**TRAVELLER**

Portraying an alien race or a member of one is
a challenge. It is easy to pick a few significant
characteristics and overplay them, creating a
caricature, or turn them into a generic human with a
different hat by not accentuating their differentness.
The key to a plausible alien is to understand their
motivations and what makes their society work. Nobody
does anything without a reason, even if the reason is
unknown or incomprehensible to outsiders.

The Zhodani, for example, have developed a way of
life that seems entirely natural to them. The idea that
rather than striving for the things they want, Zhodani
citizens may be conditioned to stop wanting them may
seem strange to outsiders, but to the Zhodani it is a
much better option than being unhappy due to a desire
for things a Traveller does not need and cannot obtain.
This is not dissimilar to someone who has left behind
the desire for material things upon finding religious
revelation and his happier for it.

It is worth considering the implications of a culture's
beliefs in terms of what they think of others. The
Zhodani are likely to view advertising in the Imperium as
a crude and rather nasty way of modifying the thinking
of citizens in order to deprive them from their money.
This is not done for the benefit of the people; quite the
opposite in fact. Advertising is largely intended to make
people unhappy so that they try to remedy the situation
by buying what the advertiser wants.

The other cultures in this book can be viewed in the
same light. Vargr may seem fickle for the way they
gravitate from weaker leaders to stronger ones, but this
results in a stronger and more resilient society than
one in which leadership can be achieved by playing
the system or being good at a non-leadership role. A

bureaucrat who eventually becomes head-penpusher in
their organization is suddenly forced to lead others but
may have no idea how. A typical Vargr would consider
this situation ridiculous – should the leader not be
someone who has proven fit to hold the position? And
should they not be cast aside when they fail in their
leadership role?

The Aslan are warriors, but not warriors for the sake
of fighting or killing everything in sight. They fight
to gain land and status, with the strongest taking
the most. This can produce a strong and stable
society capable of withstanding any challenge, if
internal conflict is kept within acceptable limits.
Thus the Aslan have rules of precedence and a highly
developed notion of honor. The need to behave in an
acceptable manner regulates ambition and ensures
that any conflict has purpose.

Likewise, the strict hierarchy of the K'Kree gives
strength to their society. As herd creatures who cannot
stand to be apart, they need a strong social order.
Theirs is based upon the leadership of a noble class
raised to lead and command rather than the turbulent
meritocracy of the Vargr or the rigid demands of Aslan
clan society, but it serves the same purpose. As a
herbivore species, K'Kree are determined to destroy all
carnivores because otherwise sooner or later they will
become prey. It is an extreme viewpoint, but one that
has a certain logic to it.

So, the societies presented within this book are
internally consistent. Understanding their mindset
is a learning experience, and will allow them to be
portrayed in a much more interesting manner than a
two-dimensional caricature of a few critical points.

# ASLAN

**CHAPTER-ONE**

The Aslan are a race of intelligent beings; their
starfaring culture is the youngest of all the Major Races,
having had star flight for less than 3,200 years. Despite
their youth, their spread through space has been rapid,
driven by the instinctive territorial desires that are
central to the Aslan male.

PHYSIOLOGY
Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous
pouncer stock, which was originally near the top of
the food chain in the forests of their homeworld,
Kusyu. About 1.8 million years ago Kusyu's climate
shifted, with the result that the extensive forests of
Tafohti (Kusyu's largest continent) almost completely
disappeared. As the forests dwindled, so did the small
fauna upon which the Aslan had preyed, forcing them
to venture out into the expanding grassland plains. The
large grazing animals in these regions were too much
for a lone Aslan to kill and they began hunting in _ahriy_
(prides) of several families. The strongest male became
the leader and his family received the best parts of
kills, choice sleeping places and were first in line at
any waterhole.

The Aslan that has evolved from those beginnings is,
like a human, an upright biped averaging two meters
in height and 100 kilograms in mass. There are two
sexes: male and female, of which the most notable
external difference is the male's increased size and more
impressive mane. Females outnumber males by a ratio
of three to one.

The Aslan hand has three fingers opposing one
medially-placed thumb and all have retractable claws.
In addition, Aslan have a single highly specialized
claw under each thumb; this dewclaw folds back jack-
knife fashion into a horny covering in the base of the
thumb and palm. The presence of these claws and the
general nature of their body structure make the Aslan
somewhat clumsy by comparison with humans but what
they lack in dexterity they more than make up for in
strength and endurance.

Aslan all have tails, although the length of this
appendage has diminished over time and is now little
more than a vestigial stump in some bloodlines.

Aslan sleep about one-third of the time; shaped by their
homeworld's rotation period, their sleeping time is roughly
10 to 11 hours (one-third of Kusyu's 32-hour day). Like
humans, lack of sleep degrades their abilities drastically.

The Aslan gestation period is roughly one _ftahea_ , or 10
months in human terms. Most are single births – twins
are virtually unheard of and are almost always female.
Male twins are rare enough to be virtually unknown. The
young are born encapsulated in tough embryonic cauls,
which are then cut away by the mother using a claw (or
in modern times, by a surgeon's laser). Cubs mature
quickly, learning to walk in only two months.

True to their pouncer ancestry, Aslan are capable of
short bursts of speed somewhat greater than that
manageable by humans. They also have slightly superior
hearing and night vision. Otherwise, they are one of
the most human-like of all alien races, excepting, of
course, the Vargr (who are, after all, genetically-altered
mammalian stock originally from Earth).

Early Terran explorers regarded Aslan as 'lion-like' and
the simile has stuck ever since, although Aslan bear
little resemblance to Terrestrial lions. Nonetheless, this
early misnomer has influenced a great deal of human
thinking about them, including terminology (the use
of pride to translate _ahriy_ , for instance) and ascribed
behaviour, which is not at all leonine. The derivation of
the word Aslan is unknown but is sometimes credited to
human explorers who first contacted the race.

LIFESPAN
Aslan develop faster than humans and are considered
adult at 15 years. A male Aslan is in his prime from the
age of 20 to around 40, whereupon he begins to decline
rapidly. Males live naturally into their 60s; females
reach the mid-50s on average. Gerontology is not a
priority for Aslan medical science, so aged Aslan who
wish to prolong their lifespan unnaturally must seek out
alternative sources of medical treatment.

DIET
The Aslan are almost exclusively carnivorous. They
consume a few nuts, fruits and berries but scorn root
vegetables, grains and other plant-based foods as being
fit only for 'herd animals'. The Aslan practise extensive
agriculture to maintain their vast herds of livestock and
there is some archaeological evidence to suggest that
early Aslan had a diet higher in vegetable matter but
cultural emphasis on predation and carnivorous behaviour
means no modern Aslan would willingly eat plants.

The Aslan have the technology to produce synthesised
meat but it is consumed only by the poorest members
of society or on worlds too scantly populated or
inhospitable to support agriculture. Even frozen meat is
considered extremely poor fare – in any civilised Aslan
house or restaurant, the meat is slaughtered right on
the spot and rich Aslan even hunt their own food on a
regular basis, stalking prey across private estates. As
a single herd animal provides far more meat than even
a teenage male could eat, almost all Aslan dinners are
communal affairs. A whole family plus guests will dine
together. Aslan normally eat one large meal a day and
sleep after eating.

Small animals are eaten raw, while larger cuts of
meat are lightly cooked and heavily spiced. The Aslan
have an astonishing repertoire of spices and chemical
preparations both subtle and bold. Aslan try to maintain
such culinary practices even on spacecraft, using
mouse-sized robots covered in a meaty sheath to mimic
live prey and carrying herd animals in cryoberths for
later consumption.

Aslan cannot naturally digest Terran-derived meats but
adding a few genetically-engineered stomach bacteria
corrects this. Some Aslan take pills when visiting human
worlds to adjust their biochemistry, although many clans
now include these bacteria in medical treatments given
to all children soon after birth.

SOCIETY
The Aslan have long been a warrior race; they are noble
and proud, devoted to those in authority above them and
responsible for those who owe fealty from below. Aslan
society is based on family and its relationships.

FAMILY STRUCTURES
An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family
( ekho ) of 2–12 persons under a patriarchal leader. This
family will generally include the male family head,
one or more wives, plus children and various blood
relatives of the leader (unmarried brothers and sisters,
aged surviving parents no longer maintaining separate
families, adopted orphans of blood relatives).

The Aslan do not distinguish between mothers – all cubs
sired by a male are cared for equally by all the male's
wives. Patrilinear descent is all that is important in Aslan
society. Cubs are more capable than human infants and
grow more quickly. A cub can walk by the age of three
months and can speak within five or six months.

A child is considered part of the father's family until:

- She is married off to a male (if female)
- He acquires Territory (if male)
- The father dies

In the latter case, the father's Territory passes to the
eldest son. The eldest son may choose to include his
siblings in his family but is under no formal obligation to
do so.

Several families combine into a pride ( _ahriy_ ), with
one family dominant. The leader of that family is also
the leader of the pride. Other families owe him and
his family their fealty. A number of prides form a clan
(huiha), with one pride dominant. Again, prides in the
clan owe fealty to the clan's leader. The clan's leader is
expected, in turn, to protect and provide for members
of the clan settling disputes between prides within the
clan, and administering his holdings wisely and well.

Clans may, in turn, owe fealty to more powerful clans,
particularly where blood relationships exist. The Tlaukhu
consists of the Twenty-Nine pre-eminent Aslan clans,
the strongest within the Hierate; many other clans owe
them fealty, either directly or through a chain of other
clans. Overall, however, clans owing fealty to one of the
Tlaukhu are in the minority; most clans are independent
and function accordingly.

BELIEFS
Aslan are spiritual without being especially religious;
they honor their ancestors and ask for their blessings
but do not worship them per se. Every Aslan home
has a Shrine of Heroes, containing relics of important
ancestors; most Aslan will also carry a pouch
containing other keepsakes or some other heirloom.
Honorable behaviour comes from obeying the
traditions of the ancestors.

The Aslan do not recognize any supreme being or divine
plan but believe the universe is alive in some fashion.
Perfect actions – actions unfettered by doubt, by fear, by
irrelevant worries or concerns – can bring an Aslan into
accord with the universe for an instant. Such moments
are called _aokol_.

DUELLING AND

HONOUR
Aslan pride makes them a touchy race and it is quite
easy for Aslan to give or take offence. This behaviour
originated in the struggles for dominance within families
and prides, and remains a basic part of the Aslan
personality. Over the centuries, Aslan touchiness has
grown formal and extremely ritualised; this rigid pattern
of behaviour has been necessary to reduce conflict and
injury in the settlement of personal disputes. It should
be noted that this struggle for dominance is so deeply
embedded into the Aslan psyche that it cannot be
unlearned. An Aslan can no more ignore an infringement
on his Territory or challenge to his authority than a
human could ignore the urge to breathe.

Non-Aslan who do not understand these ritual forms
of conduct find it difficult to get along with individual
Aslan. For their part, most sophisticated Aslan have
learned a certain amount of tolerance towards those who
do not fit into the Aslan cultural pattern but the cultural
patterns are deeply ingrained and offence is still taken
from time-to-time.

Aslan society generally categorises abrasive, uncultured
or offensive behaviour into three classes; familiarity,
impoliteness and discourtesy.

Familiarity is the treatment of social superiors as equals;
it involves social interaction, extreme friendliness
or condescending treatment by a lower class Aslan
toward an upper-class Aslan. Touching an Aslan without
permission is an instance of familiarity.

Impoliteness stems from a lack of proper education
or upbringing; it might include failure to address a
social superior by the correct honorifics, failure to
respond promptly when addressed or losing one's
temper in public.

Discourtesy is a deliberate insult and springs from
contempt, a lack of respect or malice; outward actions
may often be perceived by Aslan as discourtesy although
not meant to be so by someone alien to Aslan culture.

Failing to immediately apologise for familiarity is
impolite; failing to apologise for impoliteness when
corrected is discourteous. An Aslan may apologise
verbally or by making signs of submission (offering one's
throat to the offended party or abasing oneself). Without
an apology, any of these three behaviours can give
offence and an offended Aslan becomes an enemy.

Discourtesy, however, is grounds for duelling. Duelling
is a common way by which insults and slights are
resolved, especially if rituals and other tension-
relieving forms fail to defuse the problem. Duels follow
well-established rituals and are fought to the death
only rarely. The rules of conduct and protocols that
govern them clearly state what is allowed and not
allowed. A challenge to duel is never made lightly. At
the same time, reluctance to challenge is seen in Aslan
culture as weakness, a trait few Aslan wish to exhibit.
Most challenges are issued in response to discourtesy;
elaborate but informal rituals have evolved wherein
one party is discourteous and actually gains stature if
the other does not reply with a challenge. Much of this
behaviour seems incomprehensible to individuals not
steeped in Aslan culture.

The rituals for duelling, however, are strictly segregated
by gender. Males and females never duel; insults and
slights by the opposite sex are dismissed with the
excuse that males (or females) do not understand
female (or male) honor. When a transgression
becomes too blatant, too extreme or too unacceptable,
then a member of the insulted Aslan's immediate
family (and of the correct sex) will respond to the
discourtesy with a challenge.

The barriers against certain duels within a family are
almost as strong as those for cross-gender duelling.
Children never duel with their parents (which socially
includes any adults in their family of the previous
generation, not just their biological parents).

To issue an informal challenge, the offended party
need only bare his or her claws and roar a challenge
to the other Aslan. Informal challenges are resolved as
quickly as possible and often fought on the spot. Formal
challenges are more involved and reserved only for the
most important disputes, such as legal arguments. To
make a formal challenge, the offended party must contact
the clan head or a sanctioned representative of the clan
head. The clan head will then decide whether or not
to permit the duel and state the time and place of the
contest, which will usually be in a clan duelling arena.

Duels between Aslan take place as personal combat.
Combatants use only their hands (and dewclaws);
combat continues until one side receives a wound.
In the case of grave insult, the fight may continue to
unconsciousness for one participant. The winner has his
or her honor satisfied; the loser is required by social
and ritual standards to apologise (even if he or she
was the one originally insulted). Duels to the death are
not unheard of but are sanctioned only in the rarest of
cases. Armor other than light armor is banned, as are
combat drugs and other temporary augmentations.

Those too sick or old to duel may appoint a champion
in their place but this is extremely rare. Traditionally,
there is a clan champion whose responsibility it is
to fight for those clan members who cannot duel but
in a pinch, any Aslan of the correct gender can be
nominated as champion.

For non-Aslan, one way to gain an Aslan's respect is
to be willing to challenge when required and to duel if
challenged. Aslan consider those who do not embrace
their culture to be tahiwihteakhtau (barbarians).
Willingness to behave in the honorable fashion is an
indication that one is not a completely ignorant barbarian.

Since Aslan respect prowess in battle, upholding one's
honor in a duel is especially respected. However,
if both parties agree, the duel can be replaced by a
contest of a different kind, such as a debate, board
game or even the roll of a dice. Such substitution is
frowned upon in most circles, as it is seen as degenerate
and weak but is common in places like the scientific
community, where females will debate the validity of
different theories with logic and mathematics, not claws.

In space, Aslan fighter pilots have been known to duel.
Such fighter duels have even decided the outcome of
whole fleet engagements, where both sides agree to
abide by the results of the duel instead of fighting.
Fighter duels are fought to the first successful hit.

A duel ends when the loser is wounded (or slain, in
the case of duels to the death). The victor may not
deliberately slay the loser but (if male) is within his rights
to scalp the loser. Duels can also be fought challenging
one party's right to breed (this is normally done in
response to one Aslan male having sex with the wife of
another), in which case the victor may geld the loser.

**Duels and SOC**
Most duels are over trivial matters and do not affect the
Aslan's SOC. However, formal or especially notable duels
can make or break the reputation of an Aslan. A Traveller
who wins a formal duel against another Aslan of equal
or higher SOC gains DM+1 to any SOC-based check with
Aslan; a Traveller who loses a formal duel suffers DM-2.

**Honor**
Honor among the Aslan is primarily a male concern.
Females are expected to be honorable but it is the
males who are obsessed with their honor (or, to quote
the poet Tarelriylr, only males have the _greatness of soul_
to be truly honorable).

The Aslan concept of honor rests on three pillars.
The simplest form of honor is respect, specifically,
respect for the territory of another. An honorable Aslan
does not trespass on the territory of another without
permission or without intent to conquer. Territory, in
this case, covers all the possessions of another person –
land, money, wives, everything. An Aslan does not walk
on the land owned by another unless the other Aslan
allows him access or unless he intends to take it openly
from the other Aslan. Conquest is honorable; theft is
not. Aslan do not work in secret (even Wars of Assassins
should first be declared openly).

From this concept of respect for territory, the Aslan have
built a whole system of feudal honor. Lords respect
the territory of their vassals, vassals respect the territory
of their lords. A good Aslan respects the privacy of
another and does not gossip, as this is a form of social
trespass, leading to strange situations where an Aslan
might studiously ignore the questionable actions of
a neighbor for years, never mentioning it to another
soul, and then violently intervene without warning. An
honorable Aslan takes everything he can hold and keep
but does not overreach himself, nor does he fail to live
up to his potential. An honorable Aslan, therefore, is
boastful to human ears – his boasts show the limits of
his strength and ambition, and show his neighbors how
far they can push him.

Respect even informs how the Aslan conduct their wars.
An Aslan 'respects' his neighbor's territory by taking
as much of it as he can in times of war. Whatever the
neighbor manages to hold onto, however, is sacrosanct.
An honorable man holds everything he can and not a
square inch more or less. Only males can hold territory;
all others are worthy of respect only when they are
associated with a territory-holding male. During the

Border Wars, this tenet of Aslan honor confused many
humans – an Aslan warrior might bomb a human city
indiscriminately, then tend to the victims with great care.
What had changed was that now the city was conquered
by the Aslan, the humans were now chattels of a land-
owning male. The Aslan warrior now respected the
humans, as part of his respect for the conquering lord.

The second pillar of honor is tradition. The ways of
ancestors and heroes are the correct ways for an Aslan
to behave. This does not mean Aslan are slaves to the
old ways – new technologies make life easier and better,
and Aslan must adapt to new worlds – but it does mean
any new developments must be viewed through the eyes
of tradition. The teachings of the priests and poets must
be obeyed, especially those relating to war and duelling.

An honorable Aslan keeps to the traditions of his sire
and his sire's sires. He fights their feuds and helps their
allies. He fights duels fairly and makes war according to
the limitations agreed on by both sides in the presence
of an earleatrais. He keeps his word when he gives it
and obeys the commands of his clan elders.

The third and final pillar of honor is harmony of action ,
or khoafteirleao. This is the hardest of the pillars to
master and difficult to even explain to non-Aslan. Of
human beliefs, perhaps zen comes closest. The Aslan
believe the universe is a thought in motion and that
perfect actions can move in accord with that thought.
An Aslan who attained khoafteirleao is expressing the
will of the universe. Khoafteirleao can be reached in any
context or deed but is most commonly found in combat,
poetry or speech.

Feuds
Disputes between families or prides usually take
place because of slights, insults, mistreatments
or problems that have not been resolved to both
parties' satisfaction. The families may back different
scientific theories; one family member may have won
a competition which the other family had traditionally
won; a family may have rejected a proposed marriage
between it and the other family.

Feuds are an intermediate step between duels
and wars. Strangely for Aslan society, they are
unstructured and lack rituals to control them. If kept
at a low level, a feud is a pretext for discourteous
behaviour and sparks many duels. If allowed to get
out of hand, it involves the vassal prides and families
of each side and can erupt into war.

**Reaction Table Results**
Hostile reactions usually lead to 'discourtesy' rather than violence. In such an instance, the response
given by that reaction would be one that normally would provoke hostility in return. Treat discourtesy as
grounds for a formal challenge (but Travellers need not issue such a challenge – although this would take an
enormous amount of restraint on the part of Aslan Travellers).

An Aslan who receives discourteous treatment may easily be provoked into an attack. Such an attack may
be immediate (which is a violation of ritual and protocol) or may take the form of a challenge to a duel,
with the time and place specified. Duels are not (usually) lethal; they are fought to first blood only. The
embarrassment and loss of honor one suffers in declining a challenge or refusing a duel is far worse. In
addition, for humans, the respect gained by engaging in a duel to defend one's honor can be beneficial in a
struggle to fit into Aslan society.

CREATING ASLAN

WORLDS

**The Military**
Each clan maintains its own armed forces to defend
and protect it and many companies own mercenary
forces, which are hired out to clans–or to groups
outside the Hierate–for profit. The necessity for such
forces is demonstrated by the fact that clan warfare
is constant in the Hierate; somewhere there is always
a clan war in progress. Although such wars are formal
and governed by elaborate rituals, they are no less
deadly for the combatants.

External threats to the Aslan are infrequent (the last of
the great Aslan Border Wars ended in 380 Imperial) and
also are handled on the clan level.

One problem Aslan sometimes have is recognizing that
non-Aslan are less likely to fight by the strict set of rules
that govern Aslan-Aslan conflicts. Until realised, Aslan
often fight at a disadvantage. When they do recognize
the enemy is not abiding by the supposed rules, Aslan
tend to over-react and begin all-out warfare.

**Organization**
Military organization for the Aslan military places
males in leadership and fighting positions, and females
provide administrative or technical support. Unit
commanders are male, assisted by a female executive.
The commander leads the troops and determines
tactics, while the executive oversees logistics and has
a strong influence over operations through her creation
of battle plans. Maintenance and supply units are
staffed by lower-class males and females. Fighting units
are staffed mostly by males, support units mostly by
females, although there is some crossover. Males of low
social level in combat units have some chance of social
(and hence military) advancement, while those in non-
combatant arms have virtually none.

**Mercenaries**
Mercenary units are typically organised as business
ventures by a female (often as part of a corporation).
The owner, or a female relation appointed to act as
representative of the owner, negotiates tickets and
generally sees to business. This individual accompanies
the unit headquarters and is the ultimate source of
decisions regarding the employment of the unit. In
practice, however, she lets the (male) commander make
the combat decisions, intervening only when the male's
lack of a balanced viewpoint threatens the best business
interests of the unit.

The profession of mercenary is an honorable one,
since there are usually more landless males (lower-
class and ihatei alike) than there are positions in a
clan's military force. Mercenaries win land, honor
and glory through their actions and females have run
mercenary units as a source of wealth since long before
the Aslan went into space.

Some mercenary units are composed of highly trained
assassins; skilled less in mass warfare than in individual
or small unit combat techniques. These units need
fewer females, since logistics and similar operations
are less a part of a war of assassins. There is nothing
dishonorable about such assassinations, as long as
they are part of a prescribed clan war. Such units
might be comparable to the ninja of Japan but without
the stigma attached to ninja by contemporaneous
samurai society. All in all, however, assassins and wars
of assassins are far less frequent than more orthodox
warfare and military forces.

Language and Naming
All Aslan (with the exception of a few lost colonies) share
a common language and culture. However, this culture is
highly complex and custom-bound, and individual names
and words can become rather unwieldy.

The clan head of an independent clan (vassal to no
other clan) is known simply by the clan's name; where
differentiation is necessary, the particle ko (himself)
is added. For example, the head of clan Hlyueawi
would be known as Hlyueawi or Hlyueawiko. At the
opposite extreme, an Aslan lower in the social order
(but still a noble) might be named HlyueawifiyAhroay'
ifiyWahtoiLayeauiwahfeaktelihlalikhtyeiteyahahtateisiyu ,
roughly meaning, 'unmarried first son of the third son
of the grandfather of the head of the pride which holds
the valley in the fork of the Iwahfeal River, part of clan
Wahtoi , which is a vassal of clan Aroaye'i , itself a vassal
of clan Hlyueawi .'

Females are named for their husbands, fathers or
brothers, depending on circumstances. Non-nobles
are named for the nobles of whom they are vassals or
clients. Needless to say, while formal or ritual speech
(which is frequent) calls for Aslan to use their full
names, nicknames are commonly used among intimates.
Nicknames usually commemorate some supposed
virtue or achievement and can be chosen and discarded
whenever the holder desires.

In coming up with names or words for Aslan Travellers,
places or things, a simple system for generating random,
Aslan-sounding words is provided. This neatly avoids all

considerations of syntax and vocabulary. Simply generate
a word as desired and assign a suitable meaning to it,
such as 'Killer of Ten Thousand' or, less bloodthirstily,
'He Honors His Ancestors' or 'Place of the North
Wind'. Since Aslan does not translate well into English
(most Aslan words are an entire phrase of meaning,
much like written Chinese ideograms), meanings can
vary considerably. Tehleikhoi is the name of an Aslan
mercenary regiment; it can be translated as 'Soldiers
of the Falling Night', 'Knights of the Setting Sun', or
'Warriors of the Evening Star'. There is a great deal of
latitude in the development of Aslan words and names.

**Aslan Language**
The Aslan common language is called _Trokh_. Humans
find it difficult to learn but quite beautiful to listen to.
For the most part, _Trokh_ is a lyrical tongue, although
there is the occasional dissonant growl or roar. There
are several dialects of _Trokh_ ; all of the major clans have
their own version of the language and _Trokh_ has been
greatly expanded by the females to cover scientific and
economic topics. Common _Trokh_ can be understood by
all Aslan but males are quickly left behind when females
start talking in the technical dialects. A male dialect of
_Trokh_ exists; this is a highly formal language, used in
legal and political circles.

A few ultra-conservative clans preserve older Aslan
languages, such as Trow or Haeto.

Aslan Script
The common Aslan writing system is composed of
hundreds of glyphs called Ta o. These glyphs were
originally pictorial, coupled with several symbols that are
clearly derived from claw-marks but have become greatly
stylised. Common sentences can be understood with
knowledge of only three dozen common Ta o.

A scientific form of Ta o is used by females for technical
purposes. On board an Aslan ship, consoles used by
males will use simplified, traditional Ta o , while female
controls will be labelled using the female glyphs to
provide more accurate information.

Aslan Mathematics
The Aslan have four fingers, so they naturally use base
8 mathematics (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 20 and so on). Powers of 8 are therefore nice
round numbers to the Aslan. An Aslan epic poem might
say that 4096 warriors died in a battle or that a warrior
took 64 wounds before dying; these are not precise
measurements but the equivalent of a human saying
10,000 people fought in the battle or that the warrior
took a 100 wounds.

Generating Aslan Words
Words in Aslan, like English, have definite letter
frequencies and syllable patterns that are independent
of information content; it is possible to randomly
generate words that look and sound Aslan. Aslan
syllables are composed of up to three elements; an
initial consonant, a vowel and a final consonant.
The Aslan sound frequency table shows the relative
frequencies to be expected for various sounds in the
Aslan language. For example, the relative frequency of
'f' as an initial consonant is 5:87 and that of 'h' as a
final consonant is 10:47.

Pronunciations: This table is a guide to Aslan speech
but many Aslan sounds are not reproducible by human
vocal cords.

*Separately means that the two letters are pronounced
separately but very close together.

Aslan has four syllable types; those consisting of just a
vowel (V), those beginning with a consonant (CV), those
ending with a consonant (VC) and those both beginning
and ending with a consonant (CVC). In Aslan words,
their relative frequency of occurrence is about 3:3:2:2.
Out of 10 syllables, three will be V, three will be CV, two
will be VC and two will be CVC.

A few rules govern how sounds are grouped together.
No syllable ending with a consonant can be followed by
a syllable beginning with a consonant. A single letter
vowel can never be followed directly by the same single
letter vowel; for example, aa should not occur but aeae ,
or even aeei, could.

ASLAN ANIMALS
The Aslan regularly import creatures from their
homeworld of Kusyu to their new colonies. Most imported
creatures are livestock, brought to supply the race's
ceaseless hunger for fresh meat. A few are predators
hunted by the Aslan for sport or creatures useful for other
products or their place in the ecosystem.

AUA (HOOFMEAT)

AUA'KA

ATEKTEIA (SCORPION)

_Aua_ are large herbivores that have been the Aslan's main
prey for millions of years. Modern _Aua_ have been bred and
genetically engineered to grow quickly, to thrive in a variety
of environments and to consume a wide range of vegetable
matter. _Aua_ look like a cross between a rhinoceros and a
cow. They are quite docile under most circumstances.

These huge animals are rare on Kusyu outside reservations
but have been successfully transplanted to numerous
colony worlds. The _aua'ka_ are titanic creatures, more like
walking tanks than animals. Hunting an _Aua'ka_ is a difficult
prospect, and best accomplished with a rocket launcher, but
they are part of many Aslan ceremonial feasts.

_Atekteia_ are large poisonous insects who lay their eggs in
aua dung. The vermin have spread along with the Aslan
livestock herds and now infest worlds across the galaxy.
They are disturbingly resilient; the Aslan have used various
methods to wipe out the insects but nothing keeps the
species down for long.

_Khta_ are fast-moving predators that the Aslan have

horses but they are primarily carnivorous. They are foul-
tempered beasts and have a taste for human flesh.

_Stii_ are small furry simian-like creatures about the size of
a human child. They are omnivorous scavengers, eating
almost anything from fruit and nuts to fabric and bark. The
Aslan consider them a tasty snack and also keep them as
living garbage disposals in small communities. Humans look
like overgrown shaven stii to Aslan, a fact that never ceases
to amuse them.

These predators are hunted by the Aslan for sport. They
are highly aggressive and have been known to attack
lone travellers.

Traveller creation for Aslan follows the same procedures
and concepts as described in the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. Although Aslan are covered on page 50 of the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ , it is assumed Travellers created
that way were born and raised within the Imperium or,
at least, human-based society. The _Traveller_ creation
rules presented here are suitable for Aslan born and
raised within the Hierate. Unless otherwise stated
in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules
described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

As you will discover, an Aslan's gender and clan have
far more bearing on the Traveller's career choices than
those of a human.

INITIAL TRAVELLER

GENERATION
Use the characteristics and traits for Aslan Travellers
shown on page 51 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

However, male Aslan Travellers have an additional
characteristic, Territory (TER), which starts at 0, and
SOC for all Aslan is determined by Ancestral Territory,
described below.

**Gender**
Aslan may be either male or female. Aslan biology
dictates there are approximately three females born
for every male. As a result, males are in the distinct
minority. Travellers may select their gender or it may be
determined randomly on the Aslan Gender table.

**Aslan Gender**

2D Gender
2–5 Male
6–12 Female

In Aslan society, males are permitted to be warriors,
rulers and diplomats; females are the scientists,
technicians, merchants and managers.

Territory
The Territory (TER) characteristic is unique to the
Aslan. TER measures the amount of land owned by
that Aslan male. It is the foundation of Aslan SOC

- for a landless male or female, his or her SOC is
derived from the TER of his or her sire. A mated
female's SOC is based on her mate's TER.

TER can be used in place of SOC. For example,
instead of rolling Diplomat using his SOC DM, an
Aslan lord could use roll Diplomat and add his TER
DM instead.

In Aslan social contests between males, TER can
be used to trump SOC – a male with TER may
automatically win any social contests against
a male who has less TER. Any amount of TER
trumps any amount of SOC – the son of an Aslan
clan head with TER 0 and SOC 15 will lose a
contest to a penniless mercenary who has TER
1 and SOC 2. That does not mean that the
mercenary is more important in Aslan society
than the clan heir but he has Territory and that is
what counts, and he can overrule the clan heir (of
course, doing so would be a greivous insult and
would likely result in some ally of the clan heir
overriding the mercenary soon after).

CLAN, FAMILY

AND PRIDE
To determine if a Traveller comes from one of the 29
Great Clans of the Tlaukhu or a minor clan, roll on the
Clan table, or the Referee may choose to dictate which

clan the Traveller comes from. Note that if any Travellers
are kinfolk with one another, they will share a clan and
possibly a family.

Clan
1D Clan
1–3 Minor Clan
4–6 Major Clan. DM +1 to Ancestral
Deeds roll.

There are hundreds or thousands of families in a clan.
To determine the SOC of the Traveller, roll on the
Ancestral Deeds table and twice on the Past Deeds
table to work out what Territory his forebears acquired.
Ancestral Territory starts at 0. The first Past Deeds roll
is for the deeds of their grandfather and the second is
for the deeds of their father.

Only the first son in the family inherits the family
Territory. Next, determine your Traveller's place in
the family. In the case of multiple Travellers from the
same family, only the eldest need roll on the Family
Inheritance table – all other Travellers in that family are
automatically younger.

Family Inheritance
2D Male Female
2–3 First Son Eldest Daughter
4–10 Second Son Middle Daughter
11–12 Third Son Youngest Daughter

Finally, at the start of Traveller creation, the Traveller
has left their parent's pride. The Traveller may become
part of another pride through Life Events or form one
during a campaign.

STARTING AGE
Aslan Travellers begin their careers at 16 Aslan years
of age (about 14 standard years). Careers are resolved
on the basis of Aslan terms of service which are four
Imperial years (4.5 Aslan years) each.

NAMES
The material on language on page 11 gives some basic
guidelines on names and words used by the Aslan.
Travellers may wish to use Aslan names (if so, they are
encouraged to pick relatively pronounceable ones!).
There is no necessity for doing so, although it adds
flavor and atmosphere to a campaign.

Even when names from the Aslan language are chosen,
these are unlikely to be the individual's full names,
since an Aslan name is a long, sonorous and intricate
structure that changes to note the background,
accomplishments and life of its owner. Names for game
purposes are of necessity greatly shortened.

Because the particle ko on the end of an Aslan name
means himself and is used exclusively by the head of a
clan, care should be taken that an Aslan name ending in
ko not be chosen unless the individual is the head of a
clan (usually SOC 16).

Titles
Aslan do not have titles, as such, although a high
social standing may be denoted by certain portions of
the individual's name. In Aslan society, the social level
characteristic denotes the relative status of both the
individual and his or her family but no special titles are
applied for specific social levels.

Travellers have SOC equal to their Ancestral Territory. If
you have SOC 10+ and are male, gain Leadership 1.

AKUAEUHREKHYEH

(RITE OF PASSAGE)
At the age of 15 (Aslan years), all Aslan Travellers
undergo a rite of passage, the _Akhuaeuhrekhyeh_. This
rite tests the individual's fitness to enter society and has
an impact on careers.

The actual rite is a test that examines the Traveller's
abilities and qualities, and males and females undergo
different rites.

A male Aslan rolls 2D, which is compared to each of his
characteristics apart from TER. A Rite of Passage score
is created by adding +1 for each characteristic greater
than the roll.

_Example: Two male Aslan siblings, Hwelryr and Karinvyr
both have the same characteristics: STR 10, DEX 7,
END 8, INT 6, EDU 5, SOC 7. Hwelyr rolls a 6 for his
rite of passage; Karinvyr rolls a 10._

_Hwelyr's Rite of Passage number is +4 (+STR, +DEX,
+END, +SOC). Karinvyr's Rite of Passage number is +0._

A female Aslan rolls 2D which is compared to INT, EDU
and SOC. A Rite of Passage score is created by adding
+2 for each characteristic greater than the throw.

If doubles are rolled for the rite of passage, consult the
Rite of Passage Events table.

**Rite of Passage Events**

Roll Event
1+1 You are believed to have a great destiny, and
the clan looks for great things from you. You
must excel or disappoint your ancestors. He
gains 1D Clan Shares.
2+2 Impressive Performance. You are given Cr
as a reward for your exemplary performance in
the rite.
3+3 You befriend one of the other young Aslan
undergoing the rite that day. Gain a Contact.
4+4 One of the other Aslan undergoing the rite tries
to outdo you. Gain a Rival.
5+5 You are wounded in one of the tests, leaving a
distinctive scar across your fur.
6+6 I Will Not Fail! Your rite tests you to the limit,
but you are determined not to give in. Gain
END +1.

CAREERS
Aslan careers, in general, are used in the same way
as described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However,
there are exceptions, which are noted here.

Note that some Aslan careers are restricted to a
specific gender.

Ceremonial: The Aslan have a rich cultural heritage.
Those involved in ceremonial tasks occupy a position of
great importance within their clans.

Envoy (Males only): Interclan relations are often
entrusted to specific Envoys empowered to arrive at
agreements and commit clan resources. The term
Envoy (rather than diplomat) is used because the
individual represents a clan rather than a government.

Management (Females only): Many female Aslan opt
to enter a business-oriented career, rather than
pursuing marriage and family. Such females may
rise to positions of importance within the structure
of various corporations. The career gives a variety
of skills concerned with commerce, finance, and
relations with others.

Military and Military Officer: These careers are
equivalent to both Army and Marine in the Traveller
Core Rulebook. They represent clan military forces
that may be employed in interclan warfare, on
Hierate service, as mercenaries or as adjuncts to a
corporation's activities where the military force is
needed for security or other purposes.

Males in Military service are fighters or combatants;
females are support personnel. Male Military Officers
are commanders and leaders; females serve as staff
and advisors.

Outcast: Outcast Travellers, for one reason or another,
do not fit within normal Aslan society. Generally
scorned as misfits, they tend to pick up an unusual
assortment of skills; frequently such Travellers will
be more independent but also nurse a fierce desire to
prove themselves and thus rejoin the society that has
scorned them.

**Outlaw:** Some Outcasts become Outlaws, travelling
between the stars raiding other clans or other races.
Such activities represent a deviant subculture within
Aslan society; normal standards for male and female
pursuits have broken down to some extent, with each
learning and performing tasks of the other. Pirates, like
Outcasts, privately nurse a desire to return to normal
Aslan society but see little chance for success.

**Scientist (Females only, with the exception of Healer):**
Travellers involved in the pursuit of the sciences
(whether biological, physical, or social) can become
Scientists. In Aslan practice, most scientists are actually
technicians, adept at the creation of mechanisms to
accomplish specific tasks.

**Spacer and Space Officer:** These two careers embrace all
forms of interplanetary and interstellar service which
may be carried out by a clan, including operation of all
forms of spacecraft. Thus, the career is similar to both
the Navy and Merchant (and to some extent, Scout)
in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, members of
this career are strictly concerned with the operation of
ships; a clan vessel involved in trade would also carry
Travellers of a management background for the conduct
of business.

Spacer males are primarily gunners; females are
technicians or support personnel. Male Space Officers
are pilots, gunners, and leaders; females are navigators,
engineers, and staff advisors.

**Wanderer (Males only):** Many _ihatei_ are given vessels
by their clans and then use them for exploration in the
hopes of discovering new landholds. Wanderers are
much like the Scouts of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ,
exploring in a lonely, risky way which provides a wide
range of skills but also great chance of disaster.

It should be emphasised that most careers (except
Outcast and Outlaw) are governed on a clan level. The
Hierate has no integrated Army or Navy; individual clans
maintain forces which may be contributed to the service
of the Hierate, or not, as the situation and attitudes of
the clan dictate.

QUALIFICATION
Once a career is selected, the Traveller attempts to
qualify for it. For Aslan careers, the Rite of Passage
score is used as a DM to qualify for all careers except

for Outlaw and Scientist instead of the standard
characteristic check. If the Traveller fails to qualify, they
are immediately reduced to SOC 2 and become Outcast.

If any event during creation indicates the Traveller has
become Outcast, they must either take the Outcast
career in their next term or attempt to qualify for the
Outlaw career. Alternatively, they may instead leave
Aslan space and attempt to become a Rogue or Drifter
from the Traveller Core Rulebook.

After serving at least three terms in a career (other
than Outcast or Outlaw) an Aslan Traveller may attempt
to qualify for another career or assignment using the
standard rules – the Aslan are a more hidebound culture
than the Imperium and expect Travellers to remain in
a single career for some time. Aslan who have spent
time as Outcasts or Outlaws may only attempt to qualify
for other Outcast or Outlaw assignments while in Aslan
space, as their past is too dishonorable to allow them
to enter a more respectable career (such Travellers
may be best served by either leaving Aslan space or
mustering out and starting the campaign).

SKILLS
The Aslan deal with skills primarily on a gender basis

- males feel that some skills are dishonorable and
beneath them; females feel that some skills are shallow
or simply unsuitable. As a result, Aslan perceive and
identify skills as common (available to both sexes),
male (suitable only for males) and female (suitable
only for females).

In addition, there are a few skills that a non-Aslan would
classify as rare (generally unknown or unappreciated
in Aslan society). On the rare occasions that an Aslan
learns a skill inappropriate for his or her gender, that
fact will usually be kept secret; for the fact to be
revealed would be shameful. Further, Aslan society is
rigid enough on the subject of skills that no respectable
Aslan would hire someone for a job that required a skill
inappropriate to the employee's gender.

At times, Aslan are forced to learn what they consider
inappropriate skills in order to survive. For example, it
is widely known that Wanderers often learn Engineering
on the small ships they commonly use; polite society
ignores this breach of propriety and a former Wanderer
with Engineering skill would never discuss it and never
expect to be hired as an engineer.

New Skills for Aslan
The following two skills are unique to Aslan.

INDEPENDENCE
The Traveller is capable of dealing with the
concepts of money. In Aslan society, money is
traditionally a female responsibility and males
(particularly upper-class males) rarely understand
such matters, a fact that handicaps them in a
technological society.

Independence is an Aslan male skill, acquirable
only by males; females have no need of it. When
Independence skill appears, males must roll 2D
and score higher than their SOC to acquire the
skill. Independence is a guide governing the
Traveller's ability to function without supervision.
Lack of the skill indicates no concept of money
at all; the Traveller must be looked after by a
wife or companion who can pay for things and
generally see that he has his financial needs
cared for.

Realising a Price is Extortionate : Average (8+)
Independence check (INT or EDU)
Understanding an Economics Treatise : Difficult
(10+) Independence check (1D x 10 minutes, INT)

TOLERANCE
The Traveller is accustomed to dealing with
non-Aslan and has learned to ignore lapses in
propriety on the part of such persons. It should
also be used to help determine the degree to
which an Aslan is capable of getting along with
others outside of the family, pride, clan and race.
An Aslan without Tolerance is unlikely to be found
in the company of non-Aslan.

In any Aslan's dealings with others, Tolerance
offsets the negative DM called for under the
reaction rules (see page 9).

**Male Skills:** Some skills can be learned in Aslan society
only by males. Females consider such skills naturally the
province of males and rarely try to learn them. In some
extreme circumstances, females may learn them but will
almost never admit to it in polite company. Most direct
combat skills are the province of males.

Independence is a uniquely Aslan male skill in that it
indicates the degree to which the male has overcome Aslan
cultural and psychological barriers to the comprehension of
money. Females do not need Independence since they are
not faced with these barriers.

**Female Skills:** Some skills can be learned in Aslan
society only by females. Males consider such skills
dishonorable for them to learn and will avoid learning
them if at all possible. If they have learned them,
honor forbids them from admitting it.

**Rare Skills:** These skills may be learned by Aslan but are
extremely rare.

The Aslan Skills table indicate which skills various Aslan
might consider distasteful or unacceptable to learn. The
rare Aslan skills table shows skills that very few Aslan
would learn.

Skills not shown as male, female or rare may be
considered common skills.

AGING
Aslan aging is slower in its onset but more severe in
effects than in human Travellers. The first roll on the
Aging table is not made until age 40 (after six terms of
service have been completed); thereafter, it is checked
every term and _twice_ the Traveller's number of terms
served is applied as a negative DM to the roll.

as, by ancient tradition, males are allowed to

MISHAPS TABLE

EVENTS TABLE

MUSTERING OUT
Aslan receive mustering out Benefits when they leave
the service as normal.

**Kinships**
Kinships are secret societies and trade guilds within
Aslan society. A Traveller given membership in a kinship
may ask other members of the kinship for aid, learn
skills or obtain funding for further studies related to
the kinship's purpose. There are scientific kinships,
engineering kinships, warrior secret schools and so forth.

**Pensions**
There is no pension system for Aslan. An old Aslan
should have accumulated Clan Shares to have enough
money to live on.

**Cash Benefits**
Females, being more skilled in handling financial
matters, may consult the Cash column any number
of times. Males are restricted to consulting the Cash
column no more times than they have levels of the
Independence skill; in addition, males receive only half
the amount rolled for.

**Other Benefits**
Some Benefits are unique to Aslan.

**Brotherhood of Stars:** This grand kinship of starfarers
grants the Traveller one free Low Passage per month and
one free High Passage per year.

**Ceremonial Kinship:** A Traveller who is a member of a
ceremonial kinship gains D3 Allies within the
Aslan hierarchy.

**Clan Shares:** Aslan Travellers do not receive Ship Shares.
Instead, they receive Clan Shares, which represent
the clan placing an increasing amount of trust in the
Traveller's abilities and the Traveller gaining more
control over the assets of the clan.

A Traveller may trade Clan Shares for any of the
following benefits. Travellers from the same clan may
combine Clan Shares.

**- Cash:** A Traveller may trade Clan Shares for simple
    cash. Each Clan Share gives the Traveller Cr10000.
**- Corporation:** The Traveller owns an operating
    corporation. It has MCr500000 in assets per Clan
    Share spent and produces gross profits equal to
    1D-5% of its assets per year. The Traveller need not
    do anything to administer the corporation but may
    become involved if desired.
**- Favors:** Clan Shares can be kept in reserve, and
    used to apply political pressure to the clan in the
    future. A Clan Share can be spent to acquire a
    Contact in the clan's upper echelons, or turn such a
    Contact into an Ally.
**- Land:** This option can only be taken by a male Aslan
    with SOC 9+. The Traveller receives a landhold.
    Owning lands is the dream of all Aslan males, the
    chief ambition which drives them. To determine
    the landholding's quality and size, first select or
    generate the world where the landhold is located.
    The size of the holding on that world is then
    determined based on the number of Clan Shares
    invested in the holding. Three Clan Shares grants
    TER +1.
**- Ship Shares:** Clan Shares may be converted to Ship
    Shares directly on a one-for-one basis.

Scientific Kinship: A scientific kinship is a school of
experts on a topic. A Traveller who is a member of a
scientific kinship may make a Difficult (10+) SOC check
once per year; if successful, they obtain the use of a
kinship laboratory ship for six months.

Scout Ship: This is as detailed on page 45 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook , but will instead be an Ihateisho
scout ship, as detailed on page 72.

Secret School: A secret warrior school teaches secret
combat techniques. In addition to being part of this
brotherhood of warriors, the Traveller may obtain DM+1
to attack rolls in any one of the following situations:

**- Melee (natural):** When duelling
**- Gun Combat (energy):** After having aimed for at least
    two rounds
**- Gun Combat (slug):** After having aimed for at least
    two rounds
**- Heavy Weapons (any):** After having aimed for at least
    two rounds
**- Gunner:** When engaging a target at Adjacent range

**Aslan Life Events**

if you have none of your own). Make a Diplomat, Broker, Melee (natural) or Gun Combat check and
increase or decrease your TER (or SOC, if you have no Territory) by the Effect of the roll.
5 Change in Marriage Status: If not married, you are now married (either to an existing Ally or Contact,
another Traveller, or a mate arranged by your clan). If already married, roll 1D. On 1–4, another female
is added to the pride. On a 5–6, your mate is slain. See page 5 for the effects of marriage.

yourself, you drop to SOC 2 and become Outcast.

    Zhodani agent or a telepathic plant.

gain no Benefit rolls for it.

ASLAN LIFE EVENTS
Outcast Aslan must use the Life Events table on page 44 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , reflecting their
disconnection from Aslan society. All others use the Aslan Life Events table.

Aslan equipment is broadly similar to human items. While
the aesthetics are different – Aslan items are bigger and
heavier, and much more likely to include natural materials
like wood, fur or bone, or at least synthetics that resemble
natural materials – both races are physiologically similar
and Aslan borrowed much of their advanced technology
from humanity.

There are obvious differences between items made for
Aslan males and those made for females. Male items, such
as most weapons, are simplified to the point of elegance
(or beyond). A human laser rifle has a wealth of options
and controls, allowing the user to set power consumption
rates, adjust the weapon's focus, connect the weapon
to different types of heads-up-displays or diagnostic
equipment and conduct field repairs. An Aslan laser rifle
has an on-off switch and a trigger. Nothing comes between
the warrior and his kill. There are no distractions, no fuss,
no pointless female's work – just the kill.

By contrast, female Aslan items have a wealth of
controls and options, and seem overcomplicated or even
deliberately obfuscated to human operators. This is partly
because of the Aslan love for decoration; every item of
worth is engraved, gilded, jewelled or adorned in some
fashion. It also serves to reinforce the cultural bias of the
Aslan that technical topics are the preserve of females.

In cases where an item is designed to be used by both
genders, such as a vehicle, there will generally be two sets
of controls, or else a core control system and a wealth of
secondary controls. In general though, the further one
gets from the core Aslan worlds and the influence of
the _Tlaukhu_ culture, the more the two strands of Aslan
interface design merge – rough colony worlds do not
always have the luxury to accommodate what is essentially
a cultural affectation.

The Aslan have reached TL14 but are well behind the
Imperium in several key fields.

PERSONAL

PROTECTION
Armor is a much more common sight in Aslan society
than it is on human worlds. Most upper-class males will
at least wear ceremonial armor as part of their daily
wardrobe and virtually all military personnel habitually
wear heavier body armor than a human would feel
comfortable in. Aslan armor is always ornately decorated
and includes furs and other natural materials.

Many suits of armor also include full-face masks made to
resemble the features of the wearer or an ancestor. These
masks are a sign of prestige among the Aslan and worn
only by those of high status.

Unless otherwise noted, an Aslan may use his dewclaw
while wearing armor.

**AUA-LEATHER**
Aua-hide clothing is the traditional garb of most Aslan warriors and the
heavy, musky stench of the leather is part of the bouquet of every Aslan
world and starship. The Aslan produce so much aua-hide that it is used for
everything from armor to cargo restraints to children's toys.

Aslan battle dress is bulkier and less advanced
than human designs. It lacks the built-in computer

protection from environmental hazards. An Aslan

ASSASSIN'S GARB**
Assassin's garb consists of a form-fitting body glove studded
with small armor plates. It is designed for stealth rather
than protection and granting the wearer DM+1 to Stealth
checks. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this
armor. More advanced versions replace the armor plates
with a reactive layer that becomes rigid when struck and also
incorporates the Vislight Chameleon option (see _Traveller Core

These ornamental breastplates are designed to deflect the razor-

these breastplates at all times – wearing such armor without the

Hierate. It uses a sandwich of composite materials over a 0.5cm
layer of bonded superdense plating and is then coated in a
reflec lacquer. The armor is too heavy for most humans to wear
and even Aslan warriors find long fights in su'yerl to be difficult
propositions. Travellers with STR 8- suffer DM-2 to all checks
involving physical actions while wearing su'yerl.

The Aslan vacc suit is similar to human models. The Aslan find the open
vistas of space to be highly disconcerting and so most have narrower
viewports than human models to compensate. A standard vacc suit provides
life support for six hours. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this
armor. More advanced models are self-sealing and considerably lighter.

HEAVY VACC SUIT**
Heavy vacc suits are designed for use in hostile environments,
much like the human HEV suit. The _suya'uiyekhva_ includes powered
actuators to aid the wearer's movements, as well as a limited built-

CLAW PORT
A claw port allows an Aslan to use his dewclaws in combat while
wearing armor. Basic claw ports are flexible orifices that are
hooked onto the muscles at the base of the claw. When the Aslan
unsheathes his claw, the movement pulls the claw port open. More
advanced claw ports, designed for use in hostile environments,
allow the claw to be extruded without damaging the suit. Aslan
planning to use their claws in such environments should invest in
Claw Coating (see page 58). A claw port must be of at least the
same TL as the armor it is fitted to.

**A11/58231 COMMAND SUITE**

This upgrade adds a specialized computer weave and

BOUNDARY BOX
A necessity for any Traveller on an Aslan world, the boundary
box contains maps of the planet's surface as well as a
database demonstrating which territory is owned by which
Aslan noble. The box signals the Traveller when he is about
to cross into an Aslan's territory, ensuring he does not
inadvertently cause offence. Additional maps for a boundary

**CLAN COMM**
The standard Aslan personal communicator has dedicated
channels for the owner's family, pride and clan in addition to
normal comm features. The gift of a clan comm to an outsider

**SLASHPATCH**
The slashpatch is a specialized bandage designed to treat
dewclaw cuts. It glues the wound shut and releases painkillers
and clotting agents at a rate optimized to deal with slashing
injuries. If a slashpatch is applied within one minute of a claw
attack, it immediately heals 1D points of damage.

PERSONAL AUGMENTATION
The Aslan of the Hierate frown on augmentation and genetic engineering. Cybernetics are a necessary evil, as
many Aslan are maimed in duels or wars and need replacement limbs but attempts to improve the species through
technology are against tradition. Other Aslan states such as the Glorious Empire are less conservative and permit
limited augmentation.

All the augmentations listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ will be available somewhere in Aslan space but often at
a cost of at least 50% higher than normal.

**A11/58231 CLAW COATING**

seal that protects it from environmental damage such as
extremes of temperature and pressure.

**CLAW EDGING**
This augmentation sharpens a dewclaw and lines its cutting
edge with a blade so sharp it approaches monofilament. It also
includes all the benefits from Claw Hardening and increases
the damage from a successful claw attack to 3D. At TL14, the
Claw Edging is enhanced with an arc-field, increasing damage
to 5D with AP30. Arc-field weapons cannot be parried by any
weapon of a lower Tech Level.

**CLAW HARDENING**
Claw hardening weaves carbon nanotubes and bands of
tough synthetics into a dewclaw, making it tougher than most
armor. A Traveller with claw hardening can scratch a starship
hull or parry an attack from a chainsaw without damage.
A dewclaw that has been augmented with Claw Hardening
inflicts 2D damage.

**CLAW IMPLANT**
Human Travellers living in Aslan space are at a disadvantage
as they lack dewclaws. They can carry _hi'a'soi_ blades or,
alternatively, can go all the way and have an artificial dewclaw
implanted into the forearm. The human claw is embedded into
the forearm; when unsheathed, it slides forward and projects
under the palm. A human with a claw implant may make claw
attacks dealing 1D damage.

**PREDATOR SUITE**
This enhancement was developed by the _Awyraolr_ clan
during the Kinstrife and is banned throughout Aslan space.
Nonetheless, some clans have kept the technology and even
refined it. The predator suite sharpens the recipient's senses
and tweaks the endocrine system, enhancing the predator
instincts of the Aslan. This augmentation increases the
recipient's STR, DEX and END by +2 permanently, although
INT and EDU are both reduced by –2, and DM-4 is applied to
all Tolerance checks.

**A11/58231 ASSASSIN'S BLADE**
The traditional weapon of an assassin is a curved blade,
often with funnels in the blade containing poison. The
delivery of a _soisu'soi_ is part of the ceremony that begins a
War of Assassins. Modern blades are made of sensor-baffling
materials, fold down to the size of a small coin and contain
poison tailored to the metabolism and genetics of the
intended family. An Aslan of the target genetic family who is
struck by a modern assassin's blade must make a Difficult
(10+) END check or suffer another 1D damage every hour for
the next 1D hours.

and frequently worn like a sash or belt. It can be used in a
variety of ways – looped, it can be used to snare or throttle an
opponent using the Melee (unarmed) skill; it can also be used
as a sling or the loose strands at each end can be tied around
weights to form an improvised flail or bolo (taking two rounds),
using the Gun Combat (archaic) skill. Highly decorated _fierah_

**REAVER'S AXE**
An oversized great-axe, the _yuhaih_ is a weapon of terror, as it makes a thunderous noise
as it is whirled through the air. Dewclaws are needed to wield the _yuhaih_ properly, as the
wielder's claws slot into a round hole in the shaft, allowing him to spin it at great speed
before he drives it into a foe's skull.

uses a dual magazine feed with an internal mechanism that
strips cartridges from one magazine until it is empty and
then proceeds to strip cartridges from the other. As a result,
the total magazine capacity is a massive 64 rounds and the
weapon can be reloaded with a single new magazine whenever
the remaining rounds are less than 32.

**GRAVITY SPEAR**
This weapon is a recent breakthrough by the Aslan and still largely
experimental. It works on the same principle as a gravity plate or repulsor,
projecting a 'lance' of gravitational force forward. Anything within the path
of the beam is subjected to a 10G force, pulling it towards or away from the
_hlaulrakh_. The _hlaulrakh's_ beam flickers on and off a dozen times a second
and circles around a small area, causing thousands of tears and fractures in
the internal organs of the target. Armor is never counted against the damage
caused by the gravity spear.

WEAPONS OF THE HUNT
When it comes to firearms, Aslan have many equivalents with slug weapons of the Imperium and other races,
with Hierate-manufactured autopistols, autorifles and submachine guns commonly found throughout Aslan space.
However, the Aslan have developed some weapons that have arisen directly from their culture and history.

The _trakhtyaua_ (laser pistol), _triluealikhe_ (laser carbine) and _trolitakheal_ (laser rifle) are functionally identical to
human models and, indeed, were originally based on borrowed human technology. Only ergonomics to accommodate
differing physiology and cultural bias were changed.

Unless otherwise stated, all the weapons here use the Gun Combat (slug) skill.

A primitive version of the human PGMP, this weapon lacks the magnetic

hot matter over a wide area. Proper use of the wye'oiheasarl requires proper
protective gear (the operator takes 1D damage when the _wye'oiheasarl_ is fired,
although this damage can be reduced by armor).

The clawbike is an oversized four-wheeled
dirt-bike, used for both civilian and military

to scramble over especially rough terrain and
climb very steep surfaces. Considerable strength
is preferable when driving a clawbike, as the

Heavy tracked crawlers are multipurpose
utility vehicles. The four track sections are
individually powered, giving the vehicle
considerable agility at the cost of power and
added complexity. The body of the crawler is
akin to a flattened dome but is divided into
sections with a healthy amount of space for
passengers to make long journeys comfortable.
The driver's cab is located in the front third of
the dome.

A successful Mechanics check and a suitable
crane allows the rear section of the dome to
be removed, effectively making the Crawler a
flatbed carrier. This reduces Passengers to 1
(to sit alongside the driver) but increases Cargo
capacity to 8 tons.

Military crawlers have only 1.75 tons of cargo
space but feature a second dome with a small
turret. These versions cost Cr295000.

A variation on grav platforms, grav barges
are large, stately vehicles used by Aslan as
semi-mobile bases when travelling through
their territory. The barge hovers using anti-
gravity suspensors but is propelled by sails or
drawn by beasts of burden like a giant flying
chariot. Most grav barges can actually move
under their own power but it is considered
gauche to actually fly a grav barge; the
whole point of the vehicle is to slowly tour
one's territory in a traditional manner.
Understandably, grav barges tend to undergo
a great deal of customization – fortunately,
space is the one thing they do not lack.

Despite outward appearances, Aslan ships use much
the same technology as human vessels and either race
can readily utilise ships belonging to the other with
a minimum of difficulty. However, Aslan do display a
slightly different approach towards ships and this is
reflected in their design.

Aslan have no special regard for luxury and the Hierate
does not have separate High Passage tickets. All paid
passages are Middle, Basic or Low. However, any
Aslan of SOC 9+ will receive the services of the ship's
steward automatically and the Middle Passage baggage
allowance increases to 500 kilograms. Aslan nobles
always have precedence and usually bump passengers
of lesser standing. Working Passage is common within a
clan but rarely available to non-clan members.

The following are customs within Aslan space.

**Space is not Territory:** No Aslan male may claim a
region of space. A Traveller need not ask permission to
enter any region of space – but before he puts a single
foot on the ground, he must give all traditional honors
to the landowner.

**Clan Hospitality:** There is a strong tradition that 'the
clan takes care of its own'. If members of a Traveller's
clan live on a particular world, they will offer free
food and lodging and provide a Middle Passage ticket
upon a Difficult (10+) Persuade check. Outcasts or
Travellers who have been Outcasts are not extended
this hospitality.

Referees can determine the presence of an Aslan's
clan on a world through materials they have previously
prepared; alternatively, roll 10+ on 2D, modified by the
Clan Presence table.

**Clan Presence**

Condition DM
Local Population 9+ +1
Local Government type H +1
Aslan is member of one of the Tlaukhu clans +2
Per sector distant from the clan homeworld –1

**Swapping Stories:** Aslan with time on their dewclaws
enjoy telling stories of their exploits and adventures.
During the long days of a space journey, the passengers
(and crew with no immediate jobs to perform) meet in
the galley or central lounge and take turns telling stories
of what they have seen, what they have done and what
they plan to do.

Participants in these story-swapping sessions gain
acceptance into the group as well as diversion from the
boredom of a long journey. In addition, the stories told
are often the source of further adventures or expeditions.

Decoration: Aslan ships are invariably heavily decorated
with inscriptions and clan heraldry; even control
systems can be decorated with gold, jewels or other
art. Even on military vessels, the Aslan like to decorate
their surroundings.

CREWS
Aslan crew standards vary since there is no central
authority to prescribe the number and type of crew
required. The fundamentals of ship operation mean the
requirements for pilot, astrogator and engineer are the
same as for human ships. Pilots are almost always male;
astrogators and engineers are almost always female.

Stewards are not required. Most properly staffed ships will
include at least one because noble males taking passage
on any ship require the services of one steward per four
nobles and if no proper steward is provided, another crew
member will be co-opted for the position. A well-prepared
ship thus provides a steward in order to avoid losing an
engineer or astrogator at the wrong moment.

Medics are not required either; the position of medic is
filled when the ship's owner feels it necessary or when
the crew demands it forcefully enough.

Because of the nature of Aslan society and upbringing,
most ships have a male in formal command of the ship
and a female who deals with many details (specifically
finances) that are beneath the male's dignity. The male
captain is almost always the pilot. On military ships,
the female is the captain's executive officer, while on
commercial ships, she will be the purser. In both cases,
she may also be the astrogator.

Purser: A merchant ship engaged in commercial activity,
trade, commerce, cargo transport, passenger transport
or charter activity must have a purser. Invariably, the
purser will be female and must have a minimum of
either Admin 1 or Broker 1. The purser is paid a salary
of Cr5000 per month.

The Aslan Crew Requirements table replaces that on
page 29 of High Guard.

- This can be presumed to be an average taken across
all officer positions on a ship. In practice, it will vary a
great deal between junior and senior officers.

Note that any smaller craft carried by a ship will have
their own crew in addition to those necessary for the
mother vessel.

**Societal Standards:** Because of expectations within Aslan
society, all but pirate ships will restrict crew positions
to the proper gender. Only males may be gunners
and pilots. Only females will be astrogators, pursers,
engineers, medics and stewards. Otherwise undefined
crew positions (security personnel, mechanics,
technicians, small craft pilots, and clerks) are open to
any properly skilled individuals, although noble males
will refuse most positions other than gunner or pilot.

ASLAN CONTROL

SYSTEMS
Aslan controls fall into four categories – male, female,
dual and reconfigurable. Male controls are deliberately
simplified and abstracted, displaying only the most
vital information. Female control displays are overly
complex, giving a bewildering array of options to the
user and requiring great skill to master. Dual controls
include both male and female control systems in the
one system; either the male controls are a clearly
demarcated subset of the female controls or the control
system is compact enough to have two entirely separate
interfaces. Finally, reconfigurable controls are the most
advanced and can dynamically change themselves to
present the appropriate interface.

On most large spacecraft, the piloting and gunnery
interfaces are male, while all other control systems are
female. Dual controls are more common on smaller
ships, where a smaller crew makes it more likely that an
Aslan will have to perform duties commonly associated
with the opposite gender. Ships built at TL13 or higher
always have reconfigurable controls throughout.

A female Aslan will never suffer penalties for using male-
configured controls (although she will likely become
frustrated at their simplicity), but male Aslan using female-
configured controls suffer DM-2 to all relevant checks.

Aslan dislike automated systems, so few Aslan ships
come equipped with Evade programs and Fire Control
software only offers DMs to attack rolls – it cannot make
automated attacks by itself.

SHRINES
All Aslan ships carry a Shrine to Heroes, where Aslan go
to meditate on (and gain confidence from) the thoughts,
deeds and philosophies of their ancestors. This is
typically a small, private room, draped in tapestries and
decorated with scenes of conquest.

An Aslan ship of more than 100 tons must have at least
one Shrine to Heroes (smaller ships may have them at
the option of their owners) and larger ships must have
at least one per 10,000 tons. A Shrine is treated as if it
were a normal stateroom (consumes four tons and costs
MCr0.5) but it cannot be used for occupancy and does
not incur any life support costs.

HRAYE-CLASS SCOUT

Using a 100-ton hull, the Hraye scout
is intended primarily for exploration
duties (the variant Ihateisho -class scout
is a more common sight outside Hierate
space). This ship requires a crew of two,
pilot and engineer/astrogator (although
one individual with pilot, engineer and
astrogator skills can handle the ship alone).
The Hraye's cheap running cost means
these vessels are often found serving as
couriers or transports in small colonies.

IHATEISHO-CLASS SCOUT

This is one of the iconic Aslan vessels.
Ships of this design are given to the ihatei
of nobles, to roam the galaxy in search of
territories to conquer. Contrary to most Aslan
vessels, the controls of this ship have a high
degree of automatation, to allow less than
technically adept males operate it without
female help.

The ihateisho is capable of making four-
parsec jumps, allowing it to reach systems
beyond the range of a standard scout. A
typical ihateisho exploration lasts two to
three years, at which point the wanderer
returns to the nearest ihatei camp and
gathers an army to conquer the most suitable
territory found during his wandering. The
ihateisho is then either returned to the clan
or traded for a share in a larger vessel. An
ihateisho is sometimes considered especially
lucky if former owners have gone on to find
good territories.

EAKHAU-CLASS TRADER

The Eakhau is an Aslan tramp trader,
commonly crewed by a single family.
Nomadic Aslan families travel in this
fashion as part of a pride-fleet of a dozen
or so ships and whole generations can
be born, live and die on these cramped
vessels before the pride finds suitable
territory. Out of the shipyard, 11 tons
of space is unallocated but new owners
quickly fill this with weapons, vehicles and
other optional extras.

The Eakhau is one of the few Aslan designs
to carry escape pods, which are seen as
inviting failure. A true warrior will never flee.

KHTUKHAO-CLASS CLAN TRANSPORT

Using a 600-ton hull, this clan transport
is a large freight and passenger vessel
used by clans and companies upon major
trade routes. A 95-ton shuttle is carried
as ship's vehicle which, with a generous
passenger or cargo capacity means the
transport does not require a streamlined
hull itself and the shuttle's cargo bay is
often utilised to increase the total tonnage

IYELIY-CLASS MESSENGER

The Iyeliy -class is the Aslan equivalent of
the Imperial X-boat. Larger clans have a
network of these vessels and some Aslan
news corporations have their own fleets
to relay information across the Hierate.
The Aslan network is much less extensive
than the Imperial X-boat system but the
Iyeliy are capable of five-parsec jumps
and so information moves faster within the
Hierate. Due to the limited crew positions
on the messenger ship, astrogation is often
relegated to Intellect software, unless the
female purser/engineer is unusually skilled.

Using a 1,000-ton hull, the Aositaoh-class
cruiser is built for small-scale clan troop
transport and combat operations. Ten triple
turrets are installed, typically mounting
six triple beam lasers, three triple missile
racks and one triple sandcaster. The ship
also carries a launch, two pinnaces, four
ATVs and four air/rafts; the pinnaces can
each carry two ATVs, allowing the cruiser
to deploy a considerable fighting force
comprising two full platoons from orbit.

Both this ship and the Ekawsiykua-class
escort have low cargo capacities for
their size and are often accompanied by
Owatarl-class tenders.

OWATARL-CLASS TENDER

The Owatarl -class are military tenders
but also see use as corporate freighters in
regions where normal cargo ships would be
vulnerable to attack. Three turrets provide
basic cover, although many Owatarls refit
some of their cargo bay to carry auxiliary
fighters. The tender is unable to land, so it
carries a shuttle for cargo transfer. Tenders
assigned to supply other ships may replace
the shuttle bay with a suite of repair drones
and smaller launches.

These heavy carriers are designed for
invasions and open wars. If a Sakhai
appears in the skies over a world, then it
will be under the claw in a matter of days.
The Sakhai's distinctive 'horseshoe' profile
allows its batteries of beam lasers and
missile racks to rake targets on either side,
while protecting the mighty fusion bay
mounted in the center. It can carry 160
marines in addition to its normal 40-person
crew; there are another 200 low berths for
frozen troops or captives.

While the Sakhai is capable of landing
on a planet, it takes a skilled hand at the
controls and a dedicated team of engineers
to keep the ship spaceworthy after
touching down. A bad landing can warp the
ship's dorsal struts, effectively crippling
it. Many far flung Aslan outposts have a
downed Sakhai at their hearts.

HKISYELEAA-CLASS SLAVER

The slaver is commonly associated with the
Glorious Empire but it can be found throughout
the Hierate. They are converted agricultural
transports, with the low berths designed for
freezing large food animals. A Hkisyeleaa would
land on an agricultural planet and load up on
hundreds of live animals, taking them to be
devoured by rich nobles.

The Glorious Empire has adapted their
Hkisyeleaas for slave raiding. Unfortunate
humans are captured by Aslan raiders riding
ATVs and thrown into the freezing chambers.
A fully-stocked Slaver can carry more than
1,500 slaves if the captain is willing to cram
as many bodies as possible into the low berths;
750 is more of a safe number. Slavers are
comparatively lightly armed and have little
protection from attackers, so are normally
escorted by more combat-ready ships.

Overcrowding Low Berths
Only the most callous captain would intentionally
set out to squeeze two bodies into one low berth, as
this is highly dangerous and subjects are unlikely to

AOA'IW-CLASS LIGHT TRADER

A popular design inside the Hierate,
especially within the Trojan Reach, the
little Aoa'iw is a 300-ton trader that
combines a sizable cargo bay with space
for passengers, enough firepower to serve
as a raider or defend itself from piracy
and vehicles to support a flexible mission
profile. Aoa'iws are often owned by clans,
as they are capable of performing a wide
variety of tasks. On the border worlds, the
Aoa'iw is nicknamed the 'pouncer', as it
does resemble a crouching animal from
certain angles.

HALAHEIKE-CLASS POCKET WARSHIP

This so-called 'pocket warship' is a 1,200-ton
spacecraft used by smaller clans for military
operations. The Halaheike is heavily armed for
its size, with a range of missile racks, lasers and
particle beams and carries a fighter complement
of ten fighters and two launches for boarding
actions and customs inspections. Some owners
convert the cargo bay to hold troops or some 200
low berths (although this will put a serious strain
on the power plant), allowing the Halaheike to
serve as a troop transport.
The design is known for maintenance issues and
jump drive failures but the vessel's main problem
is that it tries to do too much in one package,
requiring the most advanced Aslan technology
just to function. The Halaheike might be a
carrier, assault cruiser, system defence boat and
troop carrier all in one but is sub-par in all those
roles. Larger clans that can afford specialist
vessels rarely field Halaheikes.

# THE K'KREE

**CHAPTER-SIX**

The K'kree are a race of herbivorous herd-creatures
whose home lies to trailing of the Imperium. They are
quite possibly the greatest threat to the survival of
Humaniti as a species.

The K'kree are sometimes colloquially referred to
as Centaurs, after ancient Terran myth. They have a
quadruped main body and hindquarters, with an upright
frontal torso; well suited to roaming the plains of their
homeworld, their large bodies impede the ability to
carry out highly technical tasks. In particular, the K'kree
are not natural spacefarers as, in addition to their
considerable size and bulk, they are psychologically
dependent on the support of the herd. A K'kree isolated
from its friends will soon go mad with loneliness.

The K'kree are militant herbivores. Millenia of battling
for survival against the predators of their homeworld
has left them with a pathological hatred for what they
call G'naak – meat-eaters or, more properly translated,
vermin. This is how the K'kree view most other species:
inferior, threatening and worthy only of extermination.
K'kree folk tales contain many references to trampling
G'naak under the massed hooves of the herd and they
have taken this manifest destiny with them to the stars.

This makes K'kree rather difficult to get along with,
both on a personal and political scale. They are realistic
enough to realise they cannot exterminate all G'naak
in the universe, not all at once, but that does not stop
them wanting to. K'kree can and do build friendships
with non-K'kree but this is very rare and usually on the
K'kree's terms. G'naak who have been subjugated and
follow a herbivorous diet are tolerable; everyone else is
somewhere on the to-kill list.

This section contains details of K'kree society and
culture, including their critically important family and
herd structures and presents rules for playing a K'kree
Traveller. In almost all cases a K'kree Traveller will not
be alone; they will be part of a small group which, in
many ways, acts as an individual. There is no 'hive
mind' for K'kree but they have such strong family
identity and clearly defined roles that often a family
can be thought of in much the same way as a human
individual... only taking up a lot more space.

Also detailed are K'kree technology, weaponry
and starships. Their unusual physical and social
characteristics require a very different approach to
vehicles and vessels. Nevertheless, they are considered
to be one of the Major Races as they developed the
jump drive independently of all other species.

The K'kree are very different to other aliens and should
be approached with caution (both in-game and around
the gaming table) as they are utterly inflexible in some
ways and some characteristics can make them hard
to play. As herd creatures, K'kree absolutely must
be close to others of their own kind or they become
distressed and, eventually, insane. A 'lone wolf' K'kree
Traveller could conceivably exist with a suitable
backstory but they would have ceased to be K'kree
in the eyes of their fellows and probably could not
function for long between breakdowns.

This is reflected in K'kree Traveller creation, where a
K'kree gains a family as well as skills and it is the group
rather than the individual that is played. This is open
to exploitation, perhaps using the extra family members
as cannon fodder or to carry out dangerous tasks but
such acts would be out of character for K'kree, who are
instinctively compelled to safeguard and protect their
family and herd. Playing the patriarch of a group of
K'kree rather than a conventional Traveller is a challenge
that should only be attempted by experienced players
who understand what they are getting into.

K'kree are also strict traditionalists who have a
pathological hatred of meat-eaters of all kinds. There
is no flexibility here; meat-eaters are the enemy,
always, and the strict hierarchy of K'kree society must
be obeyed. Travellers are typically characterised by a
desire to 'do their own thing', often in disregard for
social norms and rules. Such individualism is something
K'kree _just don't do_. There is no such thing as a 'bit of a
rebel' in K'kree society; an individual who behaved that
way would be outcast or perhaps just killed as a threat
to the herd – changes to traditional values and way of
life are as big a threat to the K'kree as casualties among
the population – and once outcast would be subject to
the ill-effects of isolation.

K'kree can be played as Travellers but doing so is a
unique experience that requires exploring the mindset
of a totally alien race. That is a rewarding experience
because it is difficult and the Referee should ensure
anyone wanting to play a K'kree family as a Traveller
knows what will be required. It is not a good idea to
allow play of more than one family member unless
the subordinates know they are required to obey in all
things and are willing to do so. If the Travellers want to

give it a try anyway, good for them! The Referee should
have no mercy on those who stray from the tenets of
K'kree existence. The K'kree themselves have none, as
we shall see...

PHYSIOLOGY
The K'kree are described by scientists as herbivorous,
homeothermic (warm-blooded), bilaterally symmetrical
hexapods, breathing an oxygen-nitrogen mix. A typical
adult is around 2-2.4m tall and masses about 550kg –
about eight times the average human. K'kree bodies are
covered in thick fur, which is usually grey or black.

The two forelimbs end in manipulatory organs similar,
but different in construction, to the human hand. K'kree
'fingers' are actually tubes of cartilage, with only the
opposable thumb containing bone. This allows the
fingers to be pulled out of the way for the hand to be
used as a surprisingly effective blunt instrument. The
K'kree hand is highly dextrous but generally weaker in
grip strength than a human hand.

The four rear limbs are proportioned for walking and
end in feet often colloquially referred to as hooves. In
fact the rear feet combine the function of a hoof with a
less dextrous version of their hands. The 'toes' (which
are again cartilaginous rather than bony) begin well
short of the sole, allowing them to be retracted whilst
the sole is being used as a hoof. By extending its toes,
a K'kree can improve its ability to feel the ground or
even manipulate objects.

K'kree feet are capable of limited gripping and
significant changes of shape, making them much more
sure-footed in rough terrain than might be expected.
The ability to grip objects with their fees is not sufficient
to manipulate anything complex but it does allow an
item to be held ready in a middle foot whilst the K'kree
stands on the other three and can be used to secure
a K'kree in low gravity. This gives rise to the ability to
rush through a starship or installation with no artificial
gravity, using whatever hand and footholds present
themselves. The effect can be amusing or utterly
terrifying for observers depending on why the K'kree is
moving in such haste.

K'kree have two genders, male and female, and give
birth to live young. Family groups usually comprise a
male and on average four females, with additional non-
breeding family members of both sexes. This family unit
is the building block of K'kree society and has political
as well as social significance. Herds are built up of
multiple families owing allegiance to the herd's leaders
through layers of sub-leaders.

It is widely believed that the K'kree underwent rapid
evolutionary development as a result of disaster
striking their homeworld of Kirur. A supernova event in
nearby space caused significant ecological and climate
changes, forcing the surviving K'kree to develop in
response. Sophisticated tool use and the ability to
communicate complex plans allowed the K'kree to turn
the tables on the predators that had previously kept their
numbers down. From semi-intelligent herd creatures and
prey for their world's carnivores, the K'kree became first
warriors and then exterminators.

The social order of the K'kree was established in this
time. The most successful warriors and leaders in the
fight against the carnivores became lords of the K'kree
herds. Since then, physical prowess and charisma
never went out of fashion. Those who can protect a
family and their herd are the most attractive mates and
rise to positions of power according to abilities and
family connections. Weaker individuals are relegated
to the fringes of the herd and are to some extent
considered expendable.

At the same time as the K'kree were evolving
intelligence, at least one carnivorous species on their
homeworld of Kirur was undergoing the same process.
The result was a long period of warfare that stimulated
technological growth on both sides. Although the
K'kree gained the upper hand, their enemies developed
primitive spaceflight technology before their final doom
became apparent. Some were able to escape to Kirur's
moon where they built a colony. Eventually the K'kree
followed them there and exterminated their foes at last.

The name of this enemy is not known. It seems that
the early K'kree were not content with eradicating them
but wanted to destroy even their memory. Today they
are simply known as G'naak like all other meat-eaters,
although those with a familiarity with K'kree speech
claim to detect a slight change in inflection when this
particular species of vermin are mentioned. Outsiders
refer to the K'kree's great foe as the Kirrixurians but
generally find it safest not to mention them at all – by
any name – when dealing with K'kree.

SOCIETY
Once they had become the dominant society of their
homeworld and removed the G'naak threat from their
moon, there was less impetus for the K'kree to develop
technology and move away from the free-roaming
lifestyle of their ancestors. Progress did occur but was
balanced by social conservatism in a way that resulted
in cultural features being retained where other species
would have forgotten them. Among these traditions was
the highly complex caste system of the ancient K'kree,
based upon dominance of a leader and value to the

herd of an individual. Although at times not well fitted
to interstellar society, this system has survived to the
present day and is unlikely to be altered much by the
passing of time.

The caste system is subtle and contains many nuances
too complex to be understood by non-K'kree but in
broad terns there are four commonly understood
echelons within K'kree society. Only males have caste;
females are casteless until they join the household of
a husband. Outsiders consider casteless unmarried
females to be grouped with outcast males and orphans
in the 'casteless' category, although there are many
distinctions – one unmarried female will be treated
differently to another for reasons not immediately
apparent to non-K'kree.

Within casted society, the lowest status group is
generally referred to as 'servants' by non-K'kree. The
servant caste includes some actual servants but is
mostly made up of physical workers and those whose
professions traditionally require little or no education.
Thus despite a modern factory worker, functionary or
farmer needing to be highly knowledgeable about their
field, they will belong to the 'servant' caste and be
considered of low importance in K'kree society.

Educated professions traditionally formed the
'merchant' caste, including scientists, technicians,
administrators and actual merchants. In ancient times
a K'kree needed a certain level of wealth and status
to enter an educated profession, so these positions
became hereditary. Nothing has changed; despite it
possible to provide a good education and chances of
advancement in society, the very idea is ridiculous to a
K'kree. Caste determines caste and other requirements
such as education must be provided to permit the next
generation to maintain their status.

The highest caste is commonly referred to as 'nobles'
by outsiders and includes military commanders as
well as diplomats, governors and those few who have
transcended the upper boundaries of the merchant
caste. Social mobility in a downward direction is not
uncommon and is a constant threat to any K'kree family
struggling to maintain its status. Upward movement is
much rarer but does happen. Sometimes this is due to a
K'kree emerging as a leader in a crisis or being rewarded
for actions that impressed superiors. Others have
become so successful in their field they have ceased to
be merchants and become nobles. K'kree society has
many wealthy traders within the merchant caste but the
leaders of a major commercial or industrial group will be
nobles rather than merchants. The defining point seems
to be where a K'kree ceases to carry out the function of
his caste and instead commands those who do.

- Casteless K'kree are essentially expendable. They
    include unmarried females and males who are not
    part of a casted household.
- Servants serve and support the herd by undertaking
    work that may require specific skills but involves
    little decision-making and thus no real understanding
    of wider issues. The servant caste is sometimes
    described using a K'kree word that translates as
    _those who obey the Steppelord in all things_.
- Merchants are the backbone of the herd's economic,
    scientific, technical and political life. They are
    expected to obey their superiors without question
    but know their business sufficiently well as to be
    able to carry out orders effectively even in complex
    situations. Their title reflects their importance in
    K'kree society; it can be translated as _those who are_
    _the herd_.
- Nobles lead and govern. The least important of them
    handle specific tasks on behalf of the herd. More
    senior nobles lead the herd or represent its interests
    in diplomatic relations with other powers. There are
    numerous titles for nobles, varying with importance
    and specific areas of authority.

Social organization begins with the 'little family',
which can contain as few as half a dozen individuals.
The caste of the family is determined by its dominant
male. Other family members include the male's wives
and children, with some unmarried males, usually
related to the dominant male. They carry out whatever
functions are required, from drivers and guards to clerks
and workers. There may also be a few unmarried adult
females but normally a female is promised in marriage
to a suitable male before she comes of age and marries
into his family as soon as she is old enough. There
is a little leeway for those who cannot do this due to
circumstances and an unmarried female eventually
becomes casteless and is driven out of her family.

Several little families are usually grouped into a 'big
family'. Many members will be related to other little
families within the grouping and often it is obvious when

a child is born whose little family she will eventually
marry into. A big family will contain several dominant
males and their close associates, with one of the males
leading the extended family. The caste of a whole
extended family will be the same; big family is the
highest social grouping where this is the case.

Several big families, of differing caste, are organised
into a 'field-family' – more commonly referred to as a
herd. A herd will be led by a noble K'kree and supported
by big families from the merchant and servant castes. A
herd might have some casteless individuals associated
with it; these have a nebulous status, not part of the
herd but receiving protection and condescending
support from it. They are likely to be sacrificed in a
crisis and are sometimes referred to as 'decoys' or
similar terms implying they are kept around to distract
predators (possibly of a metaphorical sort) from the
herd's real members.

Multiple herds are grouped into clans, sometimes
referred to as 'pasture-families'. A clan will have a
dominant noble (clanlord) who rules the clan as a whole,
plus additional noble families who carry out specific
tasks as well as the ruling nobles of the member herds.
A small K'kree city is the modern equivalent of a clan
and will be governed by a clanlord. Larger cities may
contain several clans and will either be ruled by the
most senior clanlord or, if large enough, be considered a
'plain-family'.

Multiple clans or small cities will be grouped into a
'plain-family' led by a senior noble and several such
plain-families make up the equivalent of a K'kree
nation. These groupings are ruled by an individual
known as a Steppelord, with subordinate plain-families
led by nobles holding the title of Lieutenants-of-
the-Steppelord. Above the Steppelords are planetary
governors and rulers of groups of worlds, while above
them stands the Grand Steppelord of the Two Thousand
Worlds, ruler of all K'kree.

**K'kree Groupings**

Grouping Number of K'kree Ruler
Little Family 6–24 Dominant Male
Big Family 100–200 Dominant Male
Herd 300–800 Herdlord
Clan 1000+ Clanlord
Plain-Family 10,000+ Lieutenant-of-the-Steppelord
Steppe-Family 25,000+, often far more Steppelord
All K'kree on a given world Possibly millions Lord-Of-Steppelords
All K'kree Grand Steppelord of the 2,000 Worlds

Politics between nobles of similar rank can be complex
but all noble K'kree understand the subtle nuances
that dictate their exact place in the hierarchy of nobles.
One Steppelord may rule a far larger area and number
of K'kree than another and will be ranked more highly
despite an outsider potentially not being able to tell
the difference. Attempts have been made by human
observers to assign additional levels of Steppelordship
based on the nature and size of holdings but the K'kree
themselves do not need such things; everyone knows
their place – and everyone else's place too.

SOCIAL VALUES
The herd mentality is strong in all K'kree and defines
many of their social and cultural values. Their social
hierarchy is so deeply ingrained that few K'kree ever
wonder what it would be like to question authority, let
alone do it. The head of a household is the absolute
master of its members and his superior in the herd
or clan holds absolute power over him. The word of a
distant Steppelord is law throughout his entire domain.

This respect for authority extends to the worship of
ancestors. They are not gods in the usual sense but a
combination of cultural heroes and paragons of how a
K'kree should live their life. The ancestors showed the
present generation how to live and struggled against
great odds to ensure the survival of the species. This is
true throughout all of K'kree history – most families have
favored ancestors they particularly venerate but respect
all those who came before, right back to the dawn of
K'kree civilization.

This mentality is in part due to the status of K'kree as
prey animals. Most intelligent species are predators to
at least some extent and have deep-rooted instincts that
tell them they can dominate other creatures. The K'kree
think prey-if-we-let-ourselves-be-prey and are constantly
mindful that if they fail to impose their will on the
universe they will once again become food for G'naak.

K'kree responses to problems are thus often rather
extreme. Once a threat crosses the threshold to become
significant then it must be stomped out of existence;
there is no middle ground. An intelligent predator tends
to think – at an instinctive level – in terms of 'not hungry
right now, no need to do anything until I am' whereas
the K'kree mindset is more like 'that thing will kill me
and eat me when it gets hungry, which will happen
sooner or later'. This refusal-of-prey-status mindset was
one of the fundamental changes the K'kree underwent,
and drives their response to almost every situation.

K'kree are highly social and cannot function without the
proximity of their kind. They display great hospitality
to strangers, providing those strangers are considered
friendly. Other K'kree almost always fall into this
category, as do some other species. Their property
is subject to an unusual system of family ownership

- which essentially means the family head owns
everything and grants its use to his subordinates – with
varying degrees of communal availability.

It is quite normal for a member of a different family
to simply take items without asking but someone who
failed to return or replace them would be breaking the
social code, which is virtually unthinkable. Likewise,
taking something that is needed or which the owning
family considers 'not available' is also a major breach
of social norms. Exactly how outsiders are to know what
is available for communal use and what is not, is a
question that has baffled non-K'kree for many years.

K'kree have a pathological hatred of carnivores and
omnivores who have not converted to a herbivorous
diet. Being an eater of meat means being G'naak and
G'naak are the enemy. There are no exceptions and
there is no tolerance. K'kree can detect faint traces of
pheromones that indicate recent meat-eating, so anyone
who has consumed an animal in the past few days will
experience the 'G'naak reaction'. This is an instinctive
unease or revulsion, depending on how strongly the
Traveller smells of flesh consumption. Some K'kree can
fail to recognize the cause of their unease and may not
immediately realise they are in the presence of G'naak.
Those that do tend to react violently.

A common rule of thumb is to avoid meat products for
30 days before going anywhere near K'kree, although
it is rumored there are those who can tell if a person
has ever eaten meat. It is not clear if these claims are
true or just an excuse for K'kree zealots to attack anyone
they please.

PSYCHOLOGICAL

TRAITS
The following traits are common to almost all K'kree and
should be borne in mind when portraying members of
the K'kree race.

Herd Creatures: K'kree are more than just gregarious. They
quite literally cannot cope with being alone and will suffer
severe mental trauma leading to madness if separated
from others of their kind. The minimum number of K'kree
for comfort is four; any less is not a herd.

**Group Identity:** K'kree think of themselves as a member
of a family, herd, clan and so forth, rather than an
individual. Property belongs to the group rather than an
individual. A visit from a K'kree means a visit from his
whole family, which can be two dozen individuals.

**Claustrophobia:** K'kree are extremely claustrophobic and
cannot stand being confined. Even being in a large room
with the door shut is troubling to them. Their vehicles
and structures are large and open, often with the
capability to retract walls.

**Conformity:** There is virtually no concept of individuality
or individual worth in K'kree society and little deviation
from social norms is permitted. A K'kree who does not
want to venerate his ancestors and do the bidding of the
Steppelord is worthless and will be cast out from the
herd or even killed.

**Veneration of Ancestors and the Environment:** K'kree
honor their ancestors with many complex rituals and
are highly respectful of the natural world. They find most
'planet-taming' operations at best distasteful (except
the massacre of predators; that is right and proper) and
are moved to anger by construction projects that destroy
beautiful grassy plains.

**Conservatism:** K'kree are conservative to the point of
being violently reactionary. Traditional dress, weapons
and modes of speech are favored wherever possible.
K'kree warriors will happily use the latest weaponry but
will like it a lot better if it is styled after the armament
of their forefathers.

Militant Vegetarianism: K'kree view all meat-eaters as
G'naak and there are only three kinds of G'naak – those
that have already been exterminated, those that can
be exterminated in the near future and those powerful
enough that the K'kree must wait for the day they are
strong enough. Interstellar political relations are based
on this concept – every meat-eater in the universe must
be converted to a vegetarian diet or wiped out. Those
that will not change will someday be destroyed but in
the meantime the K'kree must co-exist and perhaps
even cooperate.

DAILY LIFE
K'kree live and work in social groups and although
society has become urbanised the wide plains of Kirur
still hold a spiritual attraction. Cities are usually small,
with dispersed buildings and open spaces between and
if a larger metropolis exists it typically takes the form
of a network of smaller groupings. The arrangement is
similar to the way a herd is made up of multiple self-
contained families and indeed larger communities are
sometimes referred to as herds-of-cities.

Structures in general tend to be low and broad, and
spaced out allowing the horizon to be seen between
them. Greenery is common and enclosed spaces are
built on an open-plan basis as far as possible. K'kree like
natural light, which can be provided by large windows or
retractable outside walls. K'kree need to be able to see,
hear and smell others of their kind and artificial attempts
to create the illusion of a herd have generally failed. Thus
K'kree workspaces tend to be very open and their tasks

designed to allow movement. This is partly for the comfort
of the individual – K'kree evolved from wandering grazers
and do not like being still for long – but also for the
benefit of colleagues. Having a fellow K'kree wander by
from time-to-time is comforting and helps keep workers
relaxed and productive.

K'kree do settle airless worlds and other planets that
require a sealed environment but even with large indoor
parks they find the lack of natural wind and open spaces
to be draining. Society is noticeably more fractious than
on Kirur-like worlds and the situation is even worse
aboard spacecraft or orbital installations. K'kree are
capable of operating these for an extended period but
it is unnatural to them. Whereas humans and other
sophonts have taken to life in space and to some extent
made it their home, K'kree are always out of place away
from the plains of a Kirur-like world.

Many daily tasks are performed by robots or semi-
autonomous machines. K'kree are big creatures,
ill-suited to crawling along an inspection conduit or
undertaking work close to the ground. Thus K'kree of all
castes grow up using robotic assistants and tend to have
an aptitude for it. The exception is those lucky few who
live a traditional lifestyle on a mid or low-tech world.

THE TWO THOUSAND

WORLDS
Today's K'kree control a large interstellar state,
organised on the same family/herd/herd-of-herds
basis as their ancient existence on Kirur. Segments
of a herd, or a single family group, can be broken
off and dispatched to carry out a task but K'kree are
uncomfortable unless close to their herd and distressed
by any situation where they are not in close proximity
to others of their kind. Thus it is families led by an
individual rather than individuals themselves who
conduct the business of the K'kree and their response to
a situation is often on a very large-scale basis.

The politics of the K'kree race as a whole tend to
reflect their origins. It is a fact of life that the odd herd
member will fall to predators and someone who cannot
protect close family members is of little value to the
herd. However, when it is possible to deal with a threat
or when the herd as a whole is threatened the K'kree will
act decisively, sometimes to a genocidal extreme.

The region dominated by the K'kree is known in their
own language as T't'tkahk Xeng Kirr , which translates as
the Two Thousand Worlds. This is a metaphorical rather
than precise figure; it is not clear how many star systems
the K'kree rule nor how many planets are inhabited
within them. The Two Thousand Worlds is one of the
oldest political entities in Charted Space and one of
the most stable. There have been occasional rebellions
against the Steppelords but these are rare and localised.

Those who might challenge the authority of the Grand
Steppelord are either eliminated or exiled to frontier
regions and reabsorbed into mainstream K'kree society
after a few hundred years or collapse due to internal
dissent. At the present time there is one such group
of major importance – known as the Lords of Thunder

- and possibly other, smaller polities along the fringes
of K'kree space. It is widely thought that these exiled
groups serve a similar purpose in the grand scheme
as casteless males do in a herd – predators will fall on
them first, in which case nothing has been lost.

K'kree Language
The K'kree language, like their society, is wrapped
up in tradition to the point where it changes only
imperceptibly over time. This has advantages; all
K'kree speak the same language with virtually no
cultural drift despite living on worlds dozens of
parsecs apart. On the other hand, K'kree routinely
use archaic phrases in a context that did not exist
when their language was formulated, leading to
sometimes clumsy and roundabout wording. The
introduction of words from other languages is
anathema to K'kree, no matter how much simpler
the situation would be if they are adopted.

The K'kree language includes a number of glottal
stops, clicks and other sounds suited to K'kree
mouthparts but difficult for most other species
to pronounce. This is a source of pride to most
K'kree, who see their native tongue as too good for
anyone but them to use.

The K'kree call their language !xeng'ri but since
most humans and other intelligent species cannot
even pronounce its name, it is typically known
by the title of its commonest dialect. Thus most
humans think the K'kree tongue is named Raxkiir
and may be unaware that this is a dialect of the
true K'kree language.

THE MILITARY
All K'kree males have an obligation to serve as warriors
for a time upon coming of age. It is usually during
this period that a young K'kree establishes his status
and demonstrates fitness to lead a family or hold an
important position within one. Not all K'kree warriors
serve in the armed forces of the Two Thousand Worlds,
however. Some are taken into the service of a clanlord
or Steppelord where they may be soldiers or bodyguards
depending on the needs of their master.

A K'kree enters his military service at a level determined
by his caste. Servants make up the rank-and-file,
merchants begin training to become low-level leaders
(equivalent to a sergeant or junior lieutenant in human
terms) or provide specialist capabilities. Nobles
are trained to lead or, occasionally, join extremely
prestigious units where every rifleman is the son of a
clanlord. Such forces are expected to routinely perform
legendary actions and tend to suffer high casualties
trying to live up to this expectation.

Units are occasionally formed from casteless males,
usually for near-suicidal operations. This kind of service
is actually desirable to many casteless K'kree as it offers
a win-win situation; either the warrior distinguishes
himself sufficiently that he is elevated into casted
society or he dies in the service of the herd and earns
his place in the ancestor-songs. This is a far better
outcome than lingering on in the misery of 'walking in
the footprints of the herd' as the saying goes.

K'kree are large creatures, not well suited to operating
vehicles or engaging in urban combat. They are,
however, excellent infantry (or perhaps a sort of
cavalry). Their quadruped hindquarters provide a highly
stable firing platform for dextrous front arms and their
unassisted movement over open ground is second to
none. K'kree infantry typically use weapons based on
those of the ancient past. Lances are the traditional
armament of the clan warrior and used for more than
ceremonial purposes. Modern versions of the lance are
issued to many warriors, useful in hand to hand combat
but also incorporating a laser rifle. However, traditional
lances are also carried into action, along with a small
shield which is carried on a sling when not in use.

**Military Organization**
The organization of the K'kree military reflects a strange
mix of traditionalism and pragmatic adaptation to the
modern combat environment. The emphasis is on small
groups of warriors on foot earning glory and status by
engaging the enemy at close quarters but given all
possible support with advanced technology.

There is no prescribed organization in the manner of
more formal militaries but strict traditional precedents
must be followed, which leads by a different route to
a certain uniformity. The lowest level of organization
is a small force known as a 'fighting-band' of 4–10
servant-class warriors led by a merchant-caste leader. A
fellow member of such a band is a friend for life, with
a bond known as 'sharing grass', which refers both to
eating together and being laid to rest in the same grave.
Members usually carry a mix of equipment, although any
given band will be biased towards an infantry function
such as close assault, long-range sharpshooting or other
specific battlefield task.

Several bands are assigned to a noble-caste leader and
his immediate retinue, creating a 'warring-band', which
is roughly equivalent to a platoon in other militaries.
The warring-band leader's retinue normally contains
one or more drone operators, who control and direct
robotic fire support platforms. Equipment for doing so is
designed to be used on the move, even at full gallop, so
an entire warring-band can undertake rapid maneuvers
or a headlong charge at the enemy. Warring bands can
contain up to six or more fighting-bands, with a typical
strength of about 30–40 K'kree and an average of one or
two fire support platforms per fighting-band.

Warring-bands are a near-permanent formation, although
there are no regulations regarding this. Once formed,
a fighting-band and the warring-band it is part of are
bonded and no right-thinking K'kree (which is all of
them, except filthy outcasts) would consider breaking
that bond. Thus rather than being formally designated in
the manner of other militaries, a warring-band would be
recorded and spoken of as 'the warring-band of Aux!vur,
which is known to favor rapid maneuver and correctly
equipped for this style of combat'. Such designations
make operational planning a long-winded and complex
matter but are traditional, and that is far more important
than efficiency.

Joining a fighting-band or a warring-band is an occasion
for great ceremony, for the young K'kree is joining a
family he will leave only upon death – and perhaps even
then he will lie forever beneath the bloody grass with
his comrades. All members of the band share in its
tasks and its fights, its glory and its shame. The deeds
of former members are recalled in tales and rituals, and
there is intense pressure to live up to the legends of
those who went before.

Fleeing a battle, for example, does not merely dishonor
the warrior; it also brings disgrace upon his comrades
and all their forebears. A band whose story ends in
gallant disaster or heroic folly might be remembered

with a certain condescension but a band that collapses
in surrender or panic undoes all gallant deeds of the
band right back to its formation. The ultimate disgrace
is to be brought before the warleaders for dissolution of
the band. Most warriors would beg to be allowed to stay
together and undertake a suicide mission to salvage the
honor of their forebears, even if their own is forfeit.

'Redemption-bands' of this sort are useful as shock
troops or cannon fodder, although wise commanders
are more likely to use them as rearguards in a retreat
or to carry out missions from which no retreat is
possible. The use of such troops has given rise to the
K'kree reputation for mindless fanaticism, although the
motivations of the warriors involved are more complex.
A redemption-band might be sent well forward to trip
a suspected ambush, identify a minefield or similar
hazard in the most basic manner possible, or clear a
path through mines and obstacles with their bodies.
Alternatively, they may be ordered to strike at a target
that could not be reached by troops who hoped to
get out again. Their ferocity is legendary and their
tenacity goes beyond that of even the most motivated
conventional soldiers.

**Higher Formations**
A number of warring-bands will be grouped together
as a battle-force under the command of a more senior
noble-caste officer known as the battling-captain.
Such formations are more fluid than warring-bands
and fighting-bands, and may eventually be broken
up, but some battle-forces have existed for centuries,
rejuvenated by new warring-bands or replacement
personnel. The personal retinue of the battling-captain
will contain additional support personnel and vehicles
plus a few attached small units providing additional
capabilities, enabling the battle-force to function as a
self-contained combat unit.

Most situations do not require much more than a
battling-force, although sometimes more than one
battling-force will be deployed to an area without an
overall commander or higher formation. In this case
precedent, tradition and the reputation of the forces
involved will determine which battling-captain directs
the efforts of the others.

Larger formations are formed at need and dismantled
again when their task is over. A campaigning-force might
be built out of several battling-forces and kept together
as a garrison or on-call formation for some years.
Additional support in the form of artillery, vehicles and
attached forces may come and go in that time but the
core units of the campaigning-force will, by tradition,
remain together as long as feasible.

It is not uncommon for a campaigning-force to be held
ready as a placeholder, at need gaining additional
supports and undergoing rapid expansion into a higher
formation such as a warring-force. Such formations are
normally assigned to a higher commander, providing
an immediate response capability and framework for
the integration of additional units. They also provide
administrative services for support units, which can
create a situation where a campaigning-force goes to
war with artillery and specialist supports that would
normally be assigned to several such formations. K'kree
commanders are quite happy with this; overkill is more
commonly a goal than a flaw.

Large formations are only put together for major
wars and tailored to the needs of the region or (more
commonly) dictated by what is available. Two or more
campaigning-forces under the command of a warring-
captain creates a warring-force roughly equivalent
to an Imperial brigade. Two or more warring-forces
commanded by a great captain are known as an
exterminating force. The (very) rough equivalent of a
division, an exterminating force armed with advanced
weapons is capable of subjugating a lower-tech world
and slaughtering its predators.

If the need arises, a lord captain will assemble a
'grand force' for a major campaign. Lord captains and
the grand captains who stand above them also have
responsibility for the security of an area – typically
several minor star systems or part of a major world – and
exert authority over lower-level commanders in their
area of responsibility. There are often no intermediate
leaders between a lord captain or grand captain (or
more commonly, his staff) and a lowly battling-captain
responsible for securing a city on one of the worlds
in his area of influence. The grand captain has the
authority to build higher formations at need, assigning
commanders and support formations as he sees fit.

In general, political leaders are empowered to appoint
military commanders to a level appropriate to their
own rank and may appoint themselves or another
individual (often a younger brother or trusted relative-
by-marriage) to the post. Thus a herdlord or clanlord
may appoint battling-captains to command his forces if
he is able to raise enough troops or is assigned them.
Steppelords can appoint commanders up to the rank of
great captain but only the Grand Steppelord of the Two
Thousand Worlds can legitimately appoint lord captains.
However, this authority is often delegated as a token of
trust. Appointing a lord captain without the approval of
the Grand Steppelord, or raising a force that required
command by a de facto lord captain, would be seen as
an act of rebellion.

The K'kree Charge
The terror inspired by a warring band at the
charge is not to be underestimated. Up to 50
K'kree warriors screaming traditional slaying-
cries, the ground shaking with the thunder of
their hooves, lance points levelled and lasers
flashing would be terrifying enough but among
them are armored grav platforms blasting away
with laser cannon or lobbing mortar rounds,
weaving in and out of the charging warriors to
shield them from fire and annihilating pockets of
resistance with pinpoint precision.

Physically, this is enough to reduce hardened
soldiers to panic but the physical dimension is
only a part of it. The most frightening aspect of
a K'kree charge, according to those who have
survived one, is the intent. The K'kree are coming
at the gallop, they will not be stopped and they
will kill everything in their path.

Very large forces are rarely needed. Most foes can be
crushed by an exterminating-force or perhaps several
operating in loose cooperation without the oversight of a
lord captain. If a situation requires a larger unified force,
it qualifies as a major emergency and subject to drastic
measures. This means switching from conventional
overkill to space-based warfare, breaking up the
cohesion of the enemy's forces or just plain destroying
them with the use of orbital weaponry. The K'kree make
no distinction between military and civilian targets;
as far as they are concerned the general population of
an enemy herd or G'naak species is a source of more
enemies and a legitimate target for all weapons.

**Military Hardware**
The K'kree fight few large-scale conventional wars,
mostly engaging with light infantry and a few robotic
weapon carriers. More serious threats are met with
overkill, using artillery, robotic weapons platforms and
orbital bombardment. The armed forces of the K'kree
are built around infantry tactics, with heavier weapons
tasked with isolating parts of an enemy force for assault
and protecting infantry from countermeasures that
would make them ineffective. In short, the K'kree deploy
equipment that enables them to fight the way they want
to rather than weaponry optimized to bring a pragmatic
victory at the price of abandoning traditional methods.

K'kree infantry are armed with personal and light
support weapons, favoring lasers over projectile
weapons. Infantry are supported by vehicles and
artillery, much as in any armed force. However, the
K'kree make extensive use of drones and robotic combat
devices rather than crewed vehicles to carry their heavy
weapons into action. These platforms typically mount air
and missile defence weaponry to offset the vulnerability
of personnel operating in the open to air-bursting
artillery munitions.

Vehicles are large and make easy targets but their
critical systems are heavily protected to offset this.
K'kree vehicle crews are exposed to severe psychological
stress on a constant basis, as combat vehicles combine
isolation from all but a handful of other K'kree with
confinement in a small (by K'kree standards) space.
Where possible, forces are supported from orbit and
make only limited use of vehicular transportation in
the face of the enemy. For groundside logistics, open-
topped or open-sided vehicles are favored, often with
retractable armored sections to protect the occupants
at need.

Ground Combat Tactics
All K'kree infantry dream of taking part in a massed
headlong charge and sweeping their enemies before
them. More commonly, they skirmish in small groups,
much like low-tech light cavalry using horses or similar
riding animals. Groups tend to be loosely organised on
the battlefield but still highly cohesive, as a mini-herd
beset by G'naak must be. This is the environment where
K'kree footsoldiers are at their best; a fluid situation
where aggression and teamwork can overcome almost
any foe.

Space Forces
Some Clanlords and Steppelords have their own
private space forces but most military ships in the
Two Thousand Worlds are built in a small number of
specialist yards, using the best technology available. The
majority of warships are constructed to TL12 standards
and are similar in many ways to vehicles and buildings.

K'kree warships are extremely wasteful of space by
human standards but this is necessary to accommodate
their large bulk and need for open areas. Most warships
are designed to deploy or control robotic subordinate
craft, either as crewed 'herdmasters' controlling a group
of similarly sized robotic craft or acting as a carrier and
tender for large numbers of semi-autonomous robot
fighters. These are piloted remotely from the carrier,
by drone pilots who translate the cooperative instincts
of the herd-protector into a three-dimensional space
combat environment.

**Formations**
K'kree often use a five-part formation in military
operations. It is equally applicable to a large
ground force or warring-band on the march and
is based on the ancient defensive formation used
by herds on Kirur.

The Head can be considered the vanguard of a
herd or force. It contains the best warriors and
most potent direct-fire weapons. The force or
herd leader is normally located at the rear of the
'head', well forward to make decisions on the
march or direct an initial encounter with hostiles.

The Body marches behind the head, separated
by a short distance. The body of a herd contains
most of the non-combatants and a contingent of
guards to protect them. In a military context the
body is made up of the majority of fighting troops.

The Loins is the rearmost of the three main
force components. In a marching herd it would
contain some non-combatants and a force of
warriors acting as a rearguard; in a military force
it contains heavy weapons such as artillery and
logistics assets such as supply vehicles. A small
rear-cover force is always assigned.

The Hands are two flanking/screening forces
moving ahead of the main force and out to the
sides. The Hands conduct reconnaissance and
foraging, and are expected to contact the enemy
and find out their dispositions.

When a force deploys from its marching order
the usual system is for units from the body to
spread out and move up to support the hands,
which acts as a screening force to cover the
deployment. The head deals with any immediate
crisis then holds position to become a powerful
reserve under the command of the force leader.
The loins deploy heavy weapons, bring logistics
assets into a defensive position and sets up a
security element to the rear. Once deployed, the
loins component becomes a pivot and backstop
for maneuvers of the main body. In a force
without encumbering heavy weapons the loins
element is usually small but can sometimes
contain a fair-sized body of troops as a reserve
to be committed wherever necessary – or cover a
retreat if things go badly.

An aggressive enemy can be drawn onto the
deployed body by the screening hands. If the
enemy is disinclined to attack, the hands seek
out weak points for the main body to assault,
with elite warriors of the head held ready to
deliver the finishing blow to a wavering enemy.
Many variations on this basic tactic exist, all of
which have a traditional name and long history
of success.

This approach to space warfare is inefficient in some
ways but K'kree warships are built to be tough and
survivable and can often escape a losing battle by
fleeing behind a screen of expendable robot craft. As
communication lag becomes an issue or if the parent
vessel jumps out, robot craft go over to one of several
pre-set tactical patterns. These are sophisticated but
predictable, which usually makes defeat inevitable.
However, once in autonomous combat mode the robotic
craft are considered already lost and always tasked with
causing as much damage to the enemy as possible with
no regard to survival.

This has led to a deliberate 'throw down' combat
technique whereby K'kree carriers launch their fighters
at the enemy, do as much damage as possible under
direct control and then abandon them to fight on whilst
the carrier withdraws to reload more craft. At need,
the carriers themselves can be expended – losses
are unimportant so long as the threat to the herd is
eliminated and crews will obey an order to fight to the
last if necessary. This willingness is often mistaken for
fanaticism but in truth it is a facet of the K'kree psyche.
Life is worthless without the herd and dying to protect it
is preferable to being cast out for disobedience or seeing
the herd destroyed.

Most K'kree warships are large for their role and tend
to be well-armored at the expense of manoeuvrability
and even firepower. Internal compartmentalization is
generally poor, due to the need for large crewmembers
to move around and maintain physical contact with one
another. Coupled with the difficulty of getting such a large
creature into a vacc suit quickly, this makes K'kree ships
more susceptible to damage than those of other species.

As a result, K'kree naval architects favor standoff
weapons such as missiles and remote-controlled
fighter craft. Not only does this permit an enemy to
be engaged before it can close to decisive range but
a ship that is shooting at missiles and fighters is not
putting holes in the parent vessel's hull. Some observers
have suggested that faster and more lightly armored
vessels would be better suited to this style of combat,
enabling them to stay at long range, but there is no sign
of a move towards such designs. This is partly due to
the difficulties of producing a large vessel with enough
thrust to be an agile combatant and partly because
K'kree ships have always been built this way.

For short-ranged combat K'kree prefer large, powerful
weapons mounted in bays and barbettes rather than
turrets. Turreted weaponry is mounted on most ships

for close defence but as usual overkill is the preferred
option. Besides, bay mounts allow a team of K'kree
to work together. Control of barbettes and turrets is
normally centralised in one or more chambers, again
allowing crew to work in proximity to one another.

**Naval Organization**
The K'kree space forces, like their armies, follow a
feudal pattern. Few leaders below the rank of Steppelord
have significant naval forces of their own, although
many have a few ships for transportation and diplomatic
purposes. Steppelords generally support some vessels
from their own resources and are assigned more
according to their status and local political needs. These
are paid for from central funds and constructed at one
of the major naval yards operated by the Two Thousand
Worlds but are crewed by personnel raised within the
Steppelord's territory.

A Steppelord may send some of his ships to assist
another leader, placing them temporarily under his
command but they remain part of their original lord's
holdings. The permanent reallocation of ships is taken
as an insult or punishment and if it occurs then the ship
itself is transferred but the crew remain part of their
herd. This is not an efficient system but an artefact of
K'kree social organization and traditional values and
changing it would be unthinkable.

The local forces commanded by Steppelords are
augmented by a much larger pool of vessels loyal to
the Grand Steppelord of the Two Thousand Worlds,
either directly or through subordinates. These leaders
represent one of the few changes to K'kree society to
have occurred since the invention of spaceflight. They
have holdings like any other Steppelord but receive
funds from the central treasury. With this extra income

comes a duty to protect the herds of others by detaching
segments of the fleet and either loaning them to other
Steppelords or deploying them to carry out a particular
task under a trusted leader. The curious status of these
leaders, known as lords-of-the-outer-steppe, is such that
there is no embarrassment or dishonor in having their
forces assigned for protection.

The upshot of this system is that every region of space
occupied by K'kree has local forces tied to particular
areas, often on a patchy and inefficient basis, whilst
task forces and fleets loyal to the lords-of-the-outer-
steppe conduct major naval operations either under their
own commanders or in conjunction with local leaders.

Naval forces typically follow an organization similar to a
ground combat formations, with a head, body, loins and
hands. There is more leeway in terms of dispositions,
since naval forces operate in a complex three-
dimensional battlespace but the general organization of
a force will follow the pattern. Ships are not assigned to
squadrons and fleets like those of the Imperium; they
are assigned to leaders who organise them as necessary
using layers of command and organization.

A 'significant vessel' means any ship with respectable
combat capability, including relatively small patrol
and escort ships. Ships in the cruiser class are rarely
assigned to formations smaller than a herd of the outer
steppe, whilst the big line-of-battle ships are assigned at
the clan level. There are exceptions, of course; a single
major or even capital ship may serve as the flagship of
quite a small force if appropriate.

The capability of vessels generally increases alongside
the size of formation they are assigned to. Since most
major K'kree warships carry a complement of robotic
fighters and can thus provide their own close escort,
there are relatively few ships optimized for the escort
role. This leads to the deployment of all-big-ship forces
at times, with smaller vessels operating elsewhere as
scouts or security elements.

A HISTORY OF THE TWO

THOUSAND WORLDS
To the K'kree, the history of their interstellar state –
the Two Thousand Worlds – is the history of all K'kree.
Occasionally a Steppelord has led his people out of the
Two Thousand Worlds and colonized a far-off region but
as far as the official histories go these groups became
irrelevant as soon as they moved beyond easy contact
range. Those that reject the Great Steppelord's authority

and turn their backs on the great herd of the K'kree
are no longer part of its history unless they return as
enemies or come home to beg re-inclusion.

The Distant Past
Creatures that are recognizably 'proto-K'kree' appeared
on Kirur around 10 million years ago. They are thought
to have begun developing intelligence in response to
ecological disasters caused by a supernova event and
by 10 million years before the present were tool-using
cooperative animals. It is not clear when the K'kree
developed full sentience.

The Ancients are known to have seeded humans and
other creatures across Charted Space around 300,000
years ago. By this time, behaviourally modern K'kree
existed on Kirur. They were engaged in a constant fight
for survival against their homeworld's predators, a fight
that might have remained stalemated forever but for
climatic changes that began over 100,000 years ago.
Little is known outside the Two Thousand Worlds about
what tipped the balance but the stalemate was broken
and the K'kree declined in number.

It is thought that destruction of habitats affected other
prey species more than the K'kree, who were able to
plan ahead and move great distances to viable areas. As
other sources of food were predated to extinction, the
carnivores of Kirur targeted the K'kree. Legends speak of
a 'shadowed time of nightmare' from around 100,000 to
30,000 years ago, during which the K'kree fought a war
against extinction.

The first K'kree cities were constructed around 80,000
years ago. These were initially more like defended
laagers where the K'kree could rest and care for their
wounded but over time developed into true cities with
workshops, storehouses and administrative complexes.
Despite the security these new cities offered, the K'kree
still almost became extinct. What saved them was a
combination of desperate effort and scarcity of food for
their enemies. The surviving K'kree were hard targets
and could retire to their laagers, living off stored food,
when predators concentrated in their area.

It may be that confinement imposed by such sieges
was the worst of the 'nightmare' referred to in legend,
especially since herds were cut off from one another and
at times did not know if their neighbors had survived.
K'kree scouts might come upon a broken laager, with
nothing but the bones of their kind bleaching in the
sun. It was in this time that the desire to exterminate all
G'naak became a driving force in the K'kree psyche.

**The Time of Shed Blood**
The war for Kirur teetered one way then the other for a
time but as predator numbers fell the surviving K'kree
were able to push out from their laager-cities, linking
together multiple herds and engaging in sweeps to clear
all predators from a region. By -30,000 what had begun
as a small-scale security operation had expanded into a
crusade to eliminate all meat-eaters on Kirur. It is today
referred to as the 'time of shed blood'.

The K'kree were not the only intelligent species on Kirur
at that time. A race of carnivores had also developed
intelligence and the ability to use tools. It is not clear to
what extent the war between the two species followed
the conventional pattern. It may be that the carnivores
preferred easier prey or had reservations about eating
sentient people. They may have tried to make peace
or even cooperate with the K'kree but were driven into
remote areas nonetheless.

The K'kree almost certainly took the view that an
intelligent species of predator would sooner or later
plunge them back into their time of nightmare. The

answer was obvious; break strongholds one–by–one and
exterminate the threat. The most remote predator cities
proved hard to access and the predators themselves
underwent a rapid technological explosion as they fought
for survival. At some point they began an incredible
endeavor; an evacuation to Kirur's moon.

The evacuation was a slow process, undertaken with
primitive craft but it went on for centuries as cities fell
one–by–one. By the time the last was overrun a large
population were dwelling on Kirur's moon, unknown to
the K'kree whose technology had lagged far behind.
K'kree written records began around -10,000 and initially
contain no references to these predators. It is likely that
the K'kree thought them defeated and gone forever.

The Unification of Kirur
The cities of Kirur gradually expanded and became
permanent homes as well as trade hubs for herds
following a more traditional lifestyle. A habit of
cooperation grew into the rudiments of a world
government by -8175, and around 1,000 years later

K'kree society reached a recognizable version of its
modern form. This was the result of the 'Law of Reason',
a philosophical and ethical system, which to this day
forms the basis of modern K'kree thinking.

Progress continued and by -4305 the K'kree had fully
unified Kirur under a single government. By this time
they were aware of the predators living on their moon
and the introduction of grav vehicles in -4228 made a
renewed war of genocide feasible. The carnivores had
prepared for centuries and the fight was a hard one with
many setbacks. However, by -4167 the last fortress was
destroyed and the entire species exterminated – for real
this time.

Renewed conflict with the predator species led to
the enunciation of the _Axavktrr!xur_ or 'Fundamental
Principles of Survival', which amounted to a declaration
that all carnivorous species that would not or could not
convert to vegetarianism would be eliminated. Whilst
making perfect sense from a K'kree point of view, this
was a declaration of war – to a genocidal degree –
against almost every intelligent species in the cosmos.

**Early Expansion**
The K'kree expanded throughout their own star system,
developing robotic systems for extracting resources
from difficult environments and building outposts to
operate them. The invention of the jump drive in -4142
permitted exploration of nearby star systems, where
the K'kree were not surprised to discover carnivorous
species on worlds they wanted to colonize.

Small bases were built on low-value worlds to facilitate
expansion but the K'kree wanted Kirur-like planets
where they could roam outside without artificial
assistance. In almost all cases they had to fight for
them, although usually against animals that stood no
chance when energy weapons and artillery were brought
to bear. The extermination of carnivores on a whole
world was a lengthy undertaking, undertaken on a
cordon-and-sweep basis. More efficient methods were
available but the K'kree were unwilling to damage the
natural environment; habitat destruction or tailored
plagues were used only as a last resort.

The K'kree encountered a few sentient species but none
that could resist an assault by their armed forces. Those
willing to accept K'kree rule were permitted to live,
albeit under strict supervision. Those that tried to fight
were exterminated.

Contact with the Hivers
The K'kree contacted their first major interstellar
power in -2045, although they did not at the time
realise what was happening. The first worlds of the
Hive Federation they attacked were assumed to be just
like any other G'naak-infested planet, although it soon
became apparent that they were linked by starships and
possessed advanced technology. This in no way deterred
the K'kree – indeed, it may have spurred them to greater
efforts – and they launched a campaign of destruction
and conquest against the Hive Federation.

The war formally began in -2029. At that time the
Hiver fleet was little more than a security force and
unprepared for the onslaught of the K'kree. Losing many
battles, the Hivers were pushed back deep into their
territory and might have faced total defeat.

According to the Hivers, they undertook a masterwork
of Manipulation – with a capital M. The Hivers pride
themselves on their ability to manipulate others, with
specific Manipulations recorded in the same way as
great victories in war by other species. The Hivers claim
they demonstrated to the K'kree that they could, at
will, manipulate K'kree to become G'naak, creating a
taste for meat, and they were willing to do so on a grand
scale. In this version of events the K'kree fled Hiver
space in terror, proving that Hiver manipulation was
more potent than all the battlefleets in space.

The K'kree version is vague and couched in terms that
suggest it would be unwise to ask further. The overall
impression is that a combination of the fighting power of
Hive Federation member races and underhand tactics by
the Hivers themselves necessitated a withdrawal, which
made possible a truce beginning in -2103. A change in
K'kree philosophy permitted the truce to become more
or less permanent.

The Hiver-K'kree war resulted in the overturn of the
Fundamental Principles of Survival, although the Law
of Reason remained intact. In short, not all G'naak had
to be exterminated immediately and if the cost to the
herd of destroying an enemy was too great then it was
not in the interests of the K'kree to make the effort. This
attitude has been paraphrased by outsiders as 'we're
going to destroy all the G'naak sooner or later but those
ones are too much trouble right now'.

**Contact With Humaniti**
Although modern K'kree society can seem extreme,
given open threats of extermination towards all meat-
eating species, it is a more moderate version of their
original philosophy. Co-existence with G'naak has been
possible since -2013, although it is uncomfortable for
all concerned. This was just as well for the first humans
who met the K'kree, in -200.

Before the Long Night, humans from the Vilani
Imperium and the Rule of Man had colonized worlds
as far out as the Gateway and Crucis Margin sectors,
making contact inevitable at some point. The first
known contact was between personnel of the Galastrian
Metals corporation, based out of Tharver in the Gateway
sector. This produced no new trade opportunities and a
great deal of friction, as the K'kree had little interest in
conducting commerce with vermin.

The human states close to the Two Thousand Worlds
were mostly small multi-planet polities, corporations or
single-world governments and posed little threat to the
K'kree. However, once scouts from the emerging Third
Imperium arrived in the region the situation changed.
Formal contact was made in 103 and the K'kree quickly
became aware that this was an empire that might rival
their own.

The spinward frontier of the Two Thousand Worlds
remained troublesome. The small states of Gateway
included several pirate kingdoms whose raiders were
quite willing to prey on K'kree vessels. At the same time,
the Two Thousand Worlds was reaching the maximum
size governable under its system – and the K'kree had
no interest in changing. Thus interaction with humans
was limited to the occasional punitive expedition.

**The Lords of Thunder**
The antics of the G'naak in Gateway and along the
frontiers caused considerable alarm and voices began
to demand a return to the Fundamental Principles of
Survival. This was an unusual level of dissent for the
Two Thousand Worlds, prompted by a feeling that sooner
or later hungry humans would come trailingwards in
force. Better to act now; sterilise their worlds if they
could not be taken and create a zone where no G'naak
could find sustenance, as the K'kree of old had done
when in desperate need.

Eventually dissent became focussed on a leader named
L'lluii!pri'vguurlg, who embodied the Fundamental
Principles and questioned the authority of Steppelords
who would not embrace them. L'lluii!pri'vguurlg formally
declared a return to the Fundamental Principles – on

behalf of the whole K'kree species – in 874, a challenge
that could not be allowed to pass. In 885 he and his
followers were exiled from the Two Thousand Worlds.

L'lluii!pri'vguurlg and his people founded
Xuruk'xaar'keer! , which roughly translates to Anglic
as Lords of Thunder. They set up a powerbase on the
fringes of human space, which is sometimes known
as the Xuruk Empire and more commonly as the Lords
of Thunder. This removed the Lords of Thunder from
the official histories of the Two Thousand Worlds. They
appear there only when they do something that affects
mainstream society but it is notable that their own
histories include everything they know about affairs
within the Two Thousand Worlds. The implications of
that are worrying to human and K'kree alike.

THE TWO THOUSAND

WORLDS TODAY
The Two Thousand Worlds is one of the most powerful
and – in some ways at least – unified states in Charted
Space. In practice, the Steppelords are prone to internal
politics. Some will push the boundaries of tradition
and their orders from the Grand Steppelord of the Two
Thousand Worlds in order to increase their status. Others
will conspire against rivals out of disapproval of the way
they push those boundaries. Any significant threat will
cause those involved to shelve their schemes, however,
partly for the good of the K'kree as a whole and partly
because the Grand Steppelord does not tolerate those
who put their own agenda ahead of his orders.

The majority of K'kree worlds are within the TL7 to
TL11 range and thus capable of playing an active part
in the interstellar economy. However, this technological
capability refers to the cities. On worlds with a
'shirtsleeve' environment there will always be a segment
of the population living a simpler life on a semi-nomadic
basis. These herds make use of advanced technology but
cannot produce it. They wander within large preserves,
more or less following – and thus preserving – the ancient
lifestyle of the K'kree of Kirur. Laager-towns exist within
these preserves, offering comfort when desirable but
allowing the herd to camp in the countryside.

The K'kree name for their state is T't'tkakh Xeng Kiir ,
which is normally translated as 'Two Thousand Worlds'
but can also be rendered as 'the universe' or 'the night
sky'. The latter is a reference to the stars that could
be seen from Kirur's surface at night and the former to
the fact that nothing really matters outside of K'kree
dominions. There is no literal meaning to Two Thousand
Worlds; it is a figure of speech only. Usually it is applied

to the area directly ruled by the Grande Steppelord but
there are also outposts, client states and enclaves that
are not contiguous with but considered to be 'of the Two
Thousand Worlds'.

The Two Thousand Worlds and outlying territories are
linked by a large merchant fleet. Some vessels are
owned and operated by Steppelords whilst others are
private. Numerous organizations exist that can be
considered a parallel to the merchant shipping lines
found in other states but they tend to be the property
of noble families rather than corporate bodies in their
own right.

Some worlds have non-K'kree populations, all of
whom are required to follow a herbivorous diet. Many
indigenous sentient races within the Two Thousand
Worlds were exterminated and those that remain know
their place – and are well aware of what happens if
they defy the authority of the Steppelords. Rebellions
are few and always short and external aid is almost
never available to these species. Indeed, many of them
are entirely unknown to other races outside the Two
Thousand Worlds.

The Lords of Thunder
The Lords of Thunder are the best-known of K'kree
splinter groups, not least because their home region is
close to human space. Upon their exile in 885, they
moved into Luretir!girr sector and conquered a region to
use as a powerbase. Expansion thereafter was slow but
steady, gradually absorbing more worlds and doing away
with their carnivorous inhabitants.

The expansion of the Lords of Thunder eventually
increased in pace. Outside observers believe this was
a result of early-conquest worlds reaching economic
and social maturity and becoming capable of funding
additional expansion. Encroachments into Gateway
have brought the Lords of Thunder to the attention of
Imperial officials, although at present a large buffer
zone still exists.

Although firmly committed to the eventual extermination
of all G'naak, the Lords of Thunder are willing to
undertake peaceful diplomacy and trade. The matter-of-
fact way they refer to eventually wiping out the people
they are trading with can be unsettling but their money
is still welcome in ports across the region. Incidents are
not uncommon however, as the Lords of Thunder are
utterly inflexible in their outlook and intolerant of many
behaviours considered normal elsewhere.

### K'KREE TRAVELLERS

**CHAPTER-SEVEN**

K'kree Traveller creation follows the same format as all
other races, although with a few unique considerations
imposed by their herd-creature nature. The process
of creating a K'kree Traveller generates not just an
individual (the leader of the group) but his whole family
and associated servants. The caste of these K'kree
is considered to be that of the patriarch but they are
nothing without him.

If the patriarch were to die or be killed, his family is
immediately taken under the protection of another. If
an heir exists, he is summoned or formally installed
if already present. The heir might be a son or younger
brother, or possibly a friend of the same social caste. If
no heir is available to take over the family its members
either join another patriarch's family as a group or are
separated to join several. This is a traumatic experience
for all concerned and usually results in a dysfunctional
family for a time until the patriarch can get his house in
order. This is one way a K'kree Traveller can end up with
more family members than he can support or control.

INITIAL TRAVELLER

GENERATION
The following applies to all K'kree Travellers.

**Patriarchy**
K'kree have a unique skill called Patriarchy that
replaces both Diplomacy and Leadership when dealing
with other K'kree. This is in part an understanding
of how to control a small herd of relatives and in
part the ability to play the role of patriarch. Leading
rituals correctly, using the right form of address for
other patriarchs with a subtly different social position,
delivering the traditional condescending epithets
towards ambassadors from lesser species... Patriarchy
is the skill of being the head of a K'kree household
and doing it right. It also allows control over a suitably
sized household.

**Patriarchy**

Skill Level Max. Family Size

Average Max.
Family Size
0 D3+3 5
1 +D3 7
2 +D3 9
3 +D3 11
4 +D3 13
Every +1 +D3 +2

A K'kree can fully control and command a number of
family members and hangers-on determined by his
level in Patriarchy. This increases when Patriarchy does
but some patriarchs are just better at running their
household than others. The Patriarchy table indicates
the maximum family size that can be controlled. For
every additional family member the patriarch suffers
DM-1 to all Patriarchy checks.

Patriarchy checks are normally made in routine-
diplomacy situations, such as when other K'kree are
encountered. Success indicates the patriarch has
performed the correct rituals and established the right
social positioning, allowing interaction to proceed
normally. The Effect of a failed check is applied to all
attempts to interact with the K'kree he has just failed
to impress. This will result in condescension at least; at
worst it can lead to serious offence. The Patriarchy skill
can also be used to get a family organised for a task,
movement or ceremony, or any other situation where the
family head is exercising his routine authority.

Leadership and Diplomacy skills still exist for K'kree,
but are used only when dealing with non-K'kree.

Social Standing
K'kree determine SOC the same way as other species,
and it in turn indicates caste. Certain levels of SOC
align with ranks such as clanlord or Steppelord but do
not mean the K'kree personally holds this rank. SOC
indicates the K'kree is of this social level, either as a
relative of someone who does hold the rank or in service
to them.

There are three degrees within each social rank:

**Servant-of-Rankholder:** This is the default level. Distant
relatives and those bound by ties of loyalty rather than
kin hold this rank.

**Kinsman-of-Rankholder:** This represents close relatives or
those who have served long and well, and are thought of
as almost-kin.

**Rankholder:** The K'kree actually holds this rank.

When a K'kree achieves a new social level, he begins
at servant-of-rankholder. Each term he may make a
Patriarchy check at the difficulty level indicated on the
SOC Rank table to be elevated one degree. Note that
increases in SOC are rare for K'kree, so elevation within
the Traveller's starting social class is normally the only
advancement possible. If a K'kree does rise in social
class, he begins again at servant-of-rankholder level but
gains DM+1 on Patriarchy checks for advancement if he
was a kinsman, or DM+2 if he was a rankholder.

The exception is the lowest end of the nobility spectrum;
patriarch of a small family. A K'kree holding this rank is
automatically the head of his household and therefore
the rankholder. At all other levels, the assumption is
that the rankholder is the head of the big family of
which the K'kree's small family is part. Thus a servant-
to-rankholder in a Merchant caste big-family heads one
of the lowest-status small-families within the group
and can aspire to being elevated to kin-to-rankholder
someday. After that, he might even come to lead the
whole big family, as head of his own household and lord
over several others.

K'KREE TRAITS
K'kree make use of the following traits.

Big and Tough: K'kree are much bigger than humans
and can soak up a lot more damage unless a vulnerable
location such as the head is struck. Whenever a K'kree
is subject to an effect that reduces END, whether
through physical damage or exertion, END reduction
is halved, dropping any fractions. For example, a
K'kree who is hit for seven points of damage reduces
END 3 points. END is also treated as being doubled
for the purposes of determining the duration (but not
effectiveness) of physical activity.

Claustrophobic: K'kree are intensely claustrophobic and
will often refuse to enter fully enclosed spaces. If forced
to do so, or upon discovering they are confined, a K'kree
may panic or collapse. A Difficult (10+) END check is
required to enter a confined space. Small spaces like a
starship stateroom impose DM-2 and very tight spaces
like a crawlway impose DM-4.

A K'kree who fails the check will not enter, no matter
what. If already in the confined space, they will wriggle
out with no regard to whom they squash. If this is not
possible, roll 1D. On a 4+ the K'kree will freeze in
place and refuse to move, or else will begin to thrash
about in a panic.

New claustrophobia checks are made every time the
K'kree encounters something unsettling or is hurt.
Noises up ahead or something as minor as snagging a
piece of clothing on a projection can trigger a psychotic
episode – which in turn can make it very difficult to help
a trapped K'kree.

A K'kree leader may make a Difficult (10+) Patriarchy
check to lead his family or warband into the space,
provided he passes his own END check first.

Gregarious: K'kree need others of their own kind
around them at all times. A K'kree deprived of such
companionship is likely to flee towards the nearest herd
(or wherever he thinks a herd could be found) or become
either violently agitated or all but catatonic. If a K'kree
is cut off from others by a confined space the effect is
intensified and checks for both claustrophobia and lack
of contact must be made. Failing both will lead to a
mental breakdown which may have long-term effects.

A K'kree suddenly deprived of company must make
an Average (8+) END check to cope in the short term,
with a DM of anything up to –6 if the incident is very
violent. For example, a K'kree who sees his family hit by
a speeding truck is likely to flee in panic immediately
and suffer long-term effects when he realises he will be
forever without them. A Effect of –6 or worse indicates
permanent madness that may or may not be treatable.

In the longer term, a K'kree who is alone, whether as
an outcast or having become lost, may be able to cope
if there is some hope of a return to the herd – even as a
casteless hanger-on at the fringes. Each day, a Difficult
(10+) END check is required. Success indicates the
K'kree can act rationally and productively that day
without penalty. A DM equal to any negative Effect is
applied to all tasks on days the K'kree fails the check,
and the K'kree will be nervous, irritable and likely to
rage-quit on any task that seems remotely difficult.
An Effect of –6 or worse results in a collapse into
despair for D3 days, during which the K'kree will just
wander aimlessly, destroy things he has created and
contemplate suicide.

**Speed of Hoof:** If a K'kree performs three minor actions
in a round and all three are used for movement (as
described on page 72 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ),
then it gains a bonus minor action, which can also be
used for movement.

SURVIVING

LONELINESS
There are ways a K'kree can survive the loneliness of
isolation. One is to enter a state of temporary madness
known as 'kin-to-the-grass'. A K'kree in this state ceases
to be rational and will do no more than wander around,
nibbling listlessly at vegetation. In effect, he will revert
to the non-sentient state of his distant ancestors.
Revival from a kin-to-the-grass state is not certain even
if the K'kree is rescued but it is possible that once
surrounded by a friendly herd he will slowly regain his
senses over a period of days, weeks or even months. In
some cases the state is permanent.

In a few rare cases, isolated K'kree are struck with what
can seem to others as divine inspiration. Rather than
becoming kin-to-the-grass they become 'kin-to-the-sky',
a rapturous state in which the K'kree can see and hear
his ancestors – both direct kin and cultural heroes.
Only an already unhinged or desperate K'kree would
deliberately isolate himself and try to become kin-to-the-
sky but there have been those who made the attempt.
Most ended their days in gibbering madness but a few
achieved the holy state with enough of their faculties
remaining to cope with daily life.

A K'kree who is kin-to-the-sky needs no herd around
him because his ancestors walk beside him. They also
convey their wisdom, which may or may not make sense
to anyone but the holy K'kree. Most kin-to-the-sky are
unable to function as more than wandering oracular
prophets speaking in riddles but some emerge with a
vision and give out chillingly precise advice on matters
they could not possibly know anything about.

K'kree who work in an environment where confinement
is inevitable eventually become used to it or seek some
less upsetting line of work. A K'kree who lives and works
aboard a starship can use his highest shipboard skill
(such as Pilot, Astrogation or Engineer) as a DM when
determining if he panics upon being confined. Even the
most hardened K'kree spacer can suffer a panic attack
when boarding his ship and may have to choose between
forcing himself to enter or being left behind.

NON-K'KREE K'KREE
Very occasionally, a K'kree will, for whatever reason,
be brought up outside a traditional K'kree family. This
results in a status called A ux!Rraak G'naak or 'probably
just vermin' among 'real' K'kree. Species is irrelevant
here; what is important is whether the Traveller knows
how to act like a 'proper' K'kree, which is unlikely. Even
then, the outsider is unlikely to be fully accepted and at
best live at the fringes of a herd.

An outsider K'kree of this kind still has the Gregarious
and Claustrophobic traits, which are instinctive rather
than learned. However, the not-K'kree gains a special
skill called Outsider at level 0 in addition to other
background skills. The Outsider skill can be increased
instead of any event that increases a characteristic
during their careers. Thus if an outsider known
affectionately as 'Little Jim Horsey' to his friends gains
INT+1 during his career in the Imperial Bureaucracy, he
may swap this for a level of Outsider.

The Outsider skill is used in checks to overcome
claustrophobia and loneliness but becomes a negative
DM on interactions with 'real' K'kree. Thus Jim Horsey,
with Outsider 3 suffers DM-3 on all checks when trying
to get along with 'real' K'kree.

A K'kree with Outsider 0 or better makes checks to deal
with loneliness less often than an isolated 'real' K'kree.
At skill level 0 the check is made every D3 days. Skill
level 1 raises this to 1D days; level 2 to 2D days level 3
to 3D days and so forth. In addition, if a check is failed,
the K'kree Traveller can try to pull himself together the
next day with a new check.

The Outsider skill even allows a K'kree to tolerate meat-
eaters, although not to consume it himself. At level 1
and above he is not instinctively revulsed by the smell of
meat consumption from another person and a successful
Average (8+) Outsider check allows the K'kree to remain
in the presence of someone eating meat without losing
his temper. Seeing raw meat being prepared or, worse,
animals being killed for food will still be repellent and
those who do not respect the outsider's sensibilities will
cease to be his friends.

Outsider K'kree retain the herd instinct and will
usually find a surrogate herd to join. This might be a
group of Travellers but sometimes manifests in bizarre
ways. The least of these are the acquisition of pets or
robotic companions and sometimes the outsider will be
compelled to collect a particular type of object – which
might be anything from stuffed animals to rare coins.

The Referee should always remember that behaviour of
this sort is contrary to the fundamental nature of the
K'kree. 'Real' K'kree would consider an outsider to be
insane, potentially dangerously so, and there is some
truth in this. No matter what career an outsider K'kree
follows, no matter how successful he is or how high his
Outsider skill gets, he is in denial of his nature. Other
K'kree will hate him even more if he is successful in
denying his heritage and he will always be a troubled
individual. The companionship of a surrogate herd of
mismatched starfarers might be enough to keep him
more or less sane but this individual will never be 'quite
right'. This may drive him to excel in all manner of
fields but can also lead to self-destructive or irrational
behaviour. Anyone wanting to play an outsider K'kree
must be prepared for this challenge.

With these provisos in mind, an outsider K'kree with a
suitable backstory can enter any career a human could,
although there are some occupations that would be
repellent. A merchant or soldier is much the same from
one culture to another but even outsider K'kree would
be unlikely to take a job than requires working in small
spaces. One who spent a lot of time alone in a vacc suit
repairing the exterior of space stations might one day
find himself kin-to-the-sky, which would indeed be an
interesting roleplaying challenge.

CREATING A

K'KREE TRAVELLER
K'kree are created using a similar process to other
Travellers, although unless an outsider is being created
the Traveller will be the head of a household rather than
an individual and gain additional family members.

Use the characteristics and traits for K'kree Travellers
shown below:

Characteristics: STR+6, INT+2, EDU+2
Traits: Big and Tough, Claustrophobic, Gregarious

Note that these characteristics assume a patriarch of
a family is being created. All other male K'kree have
STR+6, but also INT-4 and EDU-4. Female K'kree have
STR+3 and EDU-5.

If the Traveller is an outsider, his SOC is rolled for
normally. It is considered to be 0 in K'kree society –
little different to that of any other non-K'kree. If the
Traveller is to be an outsider, they gain Outsider 0 and
begin Traveller creation as normal for the adopted home
society. An outsider cannot gain wives, family members
and other K'kree as followers.

If traditional K'kree Traveller creation is used instead,
the Traveller's caste is determined by his SOC score
and is unlikely to change unless a Life Event occurs.
The Traveller begins at the level of servant-of-
rankholder in his caste. His family's specialist area is
determined using the Specialist Area table with the
following modifiers:

If Merchant: DM+3
If Noble: DM+5

Specialist Area
1D+Modifers Specialist Area
0–4 Service
5–6 Warrior
7 Mercantile/Economic
8 Technical/Scientific
9 Naval
10+ Leader/Diplomatic

Casteless K'kree do not determine a specialist area, for
obvious reasons. Instead they, along with very traditional
K'kree who live a pastoral life apart from spacefaring
society, use the K'kree career on page 130.

All K'kree males, regardless of caste, spend their first
term as warriors, proving their worth to the herd before
embarking upon their intended career. A K'kree's career is
determined by his caste: Servant, Merchant or Noble. An
additional career, known simply as K'kree, is available to
any casted K'kree. This has a very limited skill selection
and little prospect for advancement. Any K'kree Traveller
who can make a case for it – perhaps time spent with
the traditionalist herds of Kirur itself – can serve terms
in this career. It could also be used to create casteless
Travellers, althought by definition they cannot have wives
and usually meet an untimely end as decoys.

**Background Skills**
All K'kree family patriarchs (or patriarchs-to-be) gain the
following background skills:

Melee Combat 0
Patriarchy 0
Recon 0
Survival 0

**Terms**
Each term, K'kree have similar opportunities to non-
K'kree, paralleling the chance for commission or
promotion. In addition, they may gain family members
or extra skills on the Household Development table.

**Promotion** is based upon SOC and assisted by the
Patriarchy skill. One attempt at promotion can be made
each term until the Traveller reaches the status of
rankholder. Elevation to the next social class requires

an increase in SOC and is very rare. There is no roll for
elevation each term; it is determined only by events.

Household Development
In mainstream K'kree society, some events are almost
certain to take place at key points in a male's life. His
first term will be spent as a warrior serving his clanlord
or – if he is very lucky – his Steppelord. At the end
of this term he will almost certainly be married, after
which his household will develop as he serves more
terms. By the time he is ready to venture to the stars, a
K'kree patriarch may command quite a force of warriors,
technicians and servants, and be followed by his
attentive and adoring wives.

The Traveller gains D3 additional family members each
time he adds a wife. Their nature is determined at the
end of Traveller creation – they might be considered
to be mustering-out benefits! It is possible that family
members may die or otherwise be lost during a career.

Gaining wives is not certain. Each time a possible
acquisition is indicated, a Patriarchy check must be
made. More wives means greater status, so K'kree
males will try hard to gain as many as possible. A K'kree
male who has not yet married will be accompanied by
an entourage of other bachelors, servants and the like

- enough to keep him from going crazy with loneliness
until he meets a suitable wife.

Additional skills are mandated in some terms, gained in
addition to wives and family members. Both are covered
on the Career Progress table.

K'KREE

MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS

None. Members of the traditional herds do not normally leave until
they go under the grass and those who do are rewarded enough by
having been able to live the traditional life for a time.

This career is normally used for the (many
K'kree would say 'extremely fortunate')
herds who live a pastoral lifestyle on
the most habitable of planets and the
homeworld of Kirur itself. They have little
to do with the outside world and do not
much care about wider events but are
extremely important to K'kree society
as they preserve the traditional 'way-
we-were' on behalf of those who must
venture forth in starships and meet alien
creatures. Retirement to a pastoral life
with traditional herds is a reward for those
whose families have given great service,
whilst their sons build a new family and
start carving out their own legends.

Qualification: None. Any K'kree can follow
this career

out basic maintenance and providing the
bulk of combat troops. Elevation to the
Merchant caste is possible but very rare;
most servants are content to be part of a

**1D MISHAP**

1 Injured in an attack by enemies of your clan, you lose D3 points from among STR, DEX and END but do not
leave the career.

2 Your leadership is called into question, almost inciting a revolt among your household. Make a Difficult (10+)
Patriarchy check. If successful, lose 1 level of Patriarchy and dismiss one of your wives in disgrace. If you fail,
reduce SOC by –1 and revert to servant-to-rankholder at the new rank. You do not leave the career unless you
drop into the Merchant caste.

3 One of your wives is killed by enemies. Make an Average (8+) Patriarchy check. If successful, your bloody
vengeance earns you respect and D3 Enemies. If you fail, you are humiliated by your failure and must reduce
SOC by –1 and revert to servant-to-rankholder at the new rank. You do not leave the career unless you drop into
the Merchant caste.

4 Your immediate superior suffers a huge setback. Roll 1D: 1–2 it was your fault and you are blamed. You are
ejected from this career and cannot begin another. On a 3–4 it was not your fault but you were blamed anyway.
Results are as 1–2 and you gain an Enemy too. On 5–6 it was not your fault and you won acclaim for the way
you prevented the situation getting any worse. Gain an Ally from outside your clan.

5 You narrowly survive an accident or conflict that kills some of your family. 1D of your family members are slain
and every third one is a wife. You face criticism for failing to protect your family and lose a number of SOC
points equal to the number of wives slain. You do not leave the career unless you drop into the Merchant caste.

6 You were ejected from the herd. Gain 1 level of Outsider. You are no longer a K'kree; you are nothing. Survive as
best you can, or die. Nobody cares either way.

**2D EVENT**

BENEFITS
Most K'kree mustering-out benefits are similar to those
for other species.

**Weapon:** The Traveller will receive the traditional
weapons of the K'kree warrior; a lance, a short sword
(called a hand-blade) and a small shield. The highly
ornate version presented is perfectly serviceable
but more importantly represents the favor of the
Traveller's superiors. It is considered a compliment
to the superior to carry the presentation weapons
into action and bringing them back with the blood
of enemies upon them is grounds for triumphant
celebrations and further reward.

THE FAMILY
A K'kree Traveller will be the head of a small family as
the basic unit is called and part of (or even the head of)
a larger grouping ranging from a big family ruling over
several small families all the way up to an entire world.
The immediate family of a K'kree patriarch is considered
to have the same SOC as he does, although as kin-
to-rankholder and servant-to-rankholder respective to
their patriarch. The final stage of Traveller creation is to
determine the composition of this family.

The patriarch has complete dominance over his family,
who will do whatever he orders. Conversely, he has a
duty to protect and nurture them. He will almost never
undertake a task alone but usually order it to be carried
out then either supervise or lead depending on the task
at hand.

A patriarch's wives do nothing except look after their
children, at least as far as the patriarch is concerned.
How much politicking and infighting goes on in a
family is not a public matter and it may be that some
patriarchs are given good advice by their wives – but
never in public. Thus the skills of wives are not relevant.
Such is K'kree society. Other cultures have words for
this sort of thing, usually uncomplimentary ones, but the
K'kree consider it is the right and proper order of things
and are not receptive to criticism.

A family will contain D3-1 immature K'kree for every
wife. Not all of these are the children of the wives; some
families have a child or two they are raising for others,
either out of social custom or on the orders of a superior.
The herd takes care of orphans in this way. These
juveniles are also irrelevant in terms skills, not least
since their main role in a crisis is to run away.

In a family group there will be a number of adult K'kree
(in addition to the patriarch and his wives) who carry out
the patriarch's orders. These are non-breeding relatives
and servants of the patriarch, who may someday be
released from service to start their own families or
even inherit leadership of the family – along with any
surviving wives. In the meantime, they serve as ordered.

In general, when a K'kree patriarch orders an action to be
taken, his skill is used no matter who actually carries out
the task. He is the leader and he knows best; to ignore his
orders because a subordinate thinks they are more skilled
would be defiance and defiance is not acceptable!

There are exceptions, however. When a physical task
such as driving a vehicle or fighting is carried out,
the Referee may allow the skill of the K'kree actually
performing the task to be used but more commonly
warriors or workers in a family are simply treated as
extra hands for the patriarch.

A Patriarch will have a number of useful family members
equal to 2D3 + his Patriarchy skill. Their roles can be
selected as follows.

**Warriors:** No more than half the entourage of a noble
K'kree can be warriors. No more than two warriors can
follow a Merchant caste leader and no more than one
can be present in a Servant caste family.
**Specialists:** A family may have as many specialist
administrators, drivers, technicians and general
functionaries as the patriarch thinks fit. If he does not
have a relevant skill but one of his subordinates does,
the family as a whole is assumed to have DM+2 to carry
out the task. If there are more than one K'kree in the
family with the same skill, each additional functionary
adds an additional DM+1. However, if the patriarch has
a relevant skill then it must be used even if his staff are
better able to carry out the task.
**Workers and Servants:** At least one-third of the K'kree
in a family must be servants or workers. These do not
supply skills but carry out many functions necessary to
maintaining their patriarch's status in K'kree society.

FAMILY MEMBERS

IN COMBAT
A family's warriors and patriarch can be treated as a
small-unit fighting force and run independently but this is
time consuming. It is often desirable to treat the patriarch
and his family as a single unit, with extra abilities.

- Each warrior fighting for the patriarch is treated as
    an extra attack at the patriarch's skill level and with
    his weapon.
- Warriors will take a bullet for their lord. When the
    patriarch takes damage, up to 15 points (after
    armor Protection has been taken into account but
    before the Big and Tough trait is applied) can be
    traded for a warrior. The warrior will be seriously
    injured, perhaps dead, and his extra attack is lost.
    Only one warrior can do this per attack.
       - A servant or functionary can be traded for 10
          points of damage, though a K'kree patriarch who
          hides among his servants will eventually face
          censure or ostracism.
       - If a family member is injured in combat in this
          way, the patriarch makes an END check after the
          battle. If failed, the family member has been killed.
          If successful, roll 1D. On 1–4, the family member
          has had two physical characteristics reduced to 0.
          On 5–6, just one physical characteristic has been
          reduced to 0.
       - Wives and children are too precious to be treated
          this way. Most patriarchs – no matter how sexist and
          condescending they may be – would die to defend
          their wives and families.

For example, a minor K'kree noble has five adult males
in his entourage, plus his wives and children. For
colour, he decides that two of the males are his younger
brothers, two are unrelated but sworn to his service and
one is an orphaned young male he has been assigned to
raise by his clanlord. As a noble he is entitled to up to
half of his entourage as warriors and one-third have to
be servants. Rounding these figures sensibly, the noble
decides to have two warriors as bodyguards, two servants
to look after his family and one expert – an administrator
in this case – to handle his finances.

The patriarch has no Admin skill of his own, so when he
orders that an administrative task be accomplished, his
expert's DM+2 is used. The servants are directed by the
patriarch via this functionary and can be assumed to be
competent at combing their lord's mane or passing his
wine. The warriors mostly stand about looking tough and
enjoying their status as their noble brother's protectors.

In combat, the patriarch and his brothers are treated
as a single unit, which makes three attacks with the
patriarch's weapons each round. Attacks are directed
at the patriarch himself but if hit he has the option of
trading one of his bodyguards for 15 points of damage.
This will deprive him of the warrior's firepower in later
rounds (and possibly of his brother on a permanent
basis!) but it is the way of the K'kree. Warriors have a
role to play, as do leaders. A wise leader knows what he
can purchase with the lives of his followers and pays the
price when necessary.

The body form of K'kree imposes considerations upon
equipment intended for their use. Consoles and controls
are at a height suitable for use by a standing K'kree
and controls are often dispersed. This is to ensure the
operator has to move around whilst working; being
entirely still is unnatural to a K'kree.

K'kree devices are generally usable by other species
unless intended to be worn. K'kree hands have a
similar configuration and reach to those of most other
spacefaring races. Their equipment is rarely of a
multifunction nature; a starship control station will
serve one function whereas most other species build
controls that can be swapped from one task to another
at need. Whereas a human might sit down at the
nearest console and reconfigure it for astronavigation
or gunnery, a K'kree would consider this unsettling.
It is the nature of a tool to do a particular job, so if a
different function is required then the K'kree must get a
different tool and move to the correct workstation.

**A03/48956
WARRIOR PANOPLY**
K'kree warriors wear a costume that is part armor and part
statement of allegiance. The frontal torso is protected by a
breastplate worn over a tunic in traditional colours, often with
forearm guards. A helmet is worn by some but not all warriors and
the rear torso is protected by a garment described as a panoply-
cape. The cape attaches to the rear of the tunic but can be
removed. The standard version of the panoply is not really armor
as such but made from sufficiently tough materials as to provide
some protection.

The traditional, now archaic, panoply consisted of cloth and metal
and is still used for ceremonial purposes. A more modern version
is constructed from ballistic cloth and composite rigid materials,
providing good protection from most threats. All nobles are, by
definition, warriors in the sense that they protect the herd and may
wear a more ostentatious version. Alternatively, stylised variants
may be worn, which have vestigial or ceremonial versions of the
standard armor components. For example, the breastplate may be
represented by a small metal gorget or even a medal-like miniature
with no protective value whatsoever.

**VACC SUIT**
K'kree do not fit well into one-piece armor, for psychological as well
as physical reasons. Being fully enclosed is claustrophobic and creates
a feeling of isolation rather than protection. Thus for a K'kree, the
Vacc Suit skill is not just about taking care of a suit and learning to
operate in it; it includes an element of mental conditioning that allows
the K'kree to think of their suit as clothing rather than an oppressive,
all-enclosing encumbrance that threatens to crush the life out of them.

Any K'kree forced to don a vacc suit or similar fully enclosed armor
must make an Average (8+) Vacc Suit check. If the Effect of the check
is negative, it is applied as a DM to all actions taken until the suit is
removed. If at any time a Vacc Suit skill check produces an Effect of
–6 or worse, the K'kree will be overcome with panic and unable to act
until the suit is removed. In extreme cases, he may tear his suit off,
regardless of the consequences.

Standard vacc suits are similar to those made for other species, at
least in terms of function and construction, but military vacc suits are
designed to parallel the panoply of the K'kree warrior or noble. They
look fanciful to outsiders and have various projections that can snag in
a tight space... but K'kree prefer not to go into those spaces anyway.

**BATTLE DRESS**
K'kree suffer the same problems using battle dress as
unpowered combat armor, only more so. The Vacc Suit
check to avoid panic when wearing battle dress is Difficult
(10+). Battle dress is uncommon and generally used only
by special-purpose units. These tend to be small and are
attached to other forces as a spearhead or assault force.

K'kree battle dress tends to be clumsy compared to that of
other species and imposes DM-1 on all actions that require
movement or agility.

**TRADITIONAL**

**WEAPONRY**
The traditional weaponry of the K'kree warrior consists of a lance, a
small shield and a weapon known as a hand-blade that resembles a
curved and deeply bellied machete. The hand-blade is almost useless
for thrusting but delivers a devastating cut optimized for the 'running
pass' style of attack. Nobles sometimes carry a smaller variant of the
hand-blade, which is still a useful weapon but generally considered an
item of dress. A noble's hand-blade is by tradition exempt from weapon
restrictions – a fact that has caused a great deal of friction on non-
K'kree worlds where laws are strict.

The K'kree shield is a little larger than a human buckler but covers only
about half the forearm when held in the hand. It is otherwise treated as
a standard shield.

Both the lance and hand-blade require the Melee (blade) skill for use.
The shield requires Melee (bludgeon) if used as a weapon.

PERSONAL WEAPONS
Although laser weapons are favored by most K'kree troops, some use is made of slugthrowers, especially in regions
where high-tech weaponry is hard to maintain or even obtain. Many designs resemble traditional close combat
weapons, which is in general less efficient but pleases the K'kree sense of aesthetics. Weapon names are also less
pragmatic than those used by other species.

**LANCE-OF-LENGTH**
The lance-of-length resembles a traditional lance and can be
used as one but it incorporates a laser rifle barrel as the core
of the shaft. Power is fed by means of a cord from a small
backpack that will supply sufficient energy for 200 shots.
A lance-of-length that has been plunged into the body of
an enemy will be coated in blood, which will prevent proper
firing, and to counter this a low-powered 'cleaning pulse'
can be triggered with a minor action. The resulting cloud of
vapourised body fluids and small pieces of tissue is known as
a 'flower of battle', giving rise to the term 'raisers-of-flowers'
for those with a reputation for hard fighting.

**SHORT-HAND**
The short-hand is essentially a compact laser pistol intended
for use by nobles and those unable to carry a full-sized battle
weapon. It has belt-mounted power supply good for a 100
shots. To 'strike with the short hand' is a euphemism for both
exerting authority in a graphic manner and getting involved in
a close-range firefight.

The hand-of-length is a rapid-fire laser carbine designed to
be used in one hand by a charging K'kree. Its internal power
supply will deliver 20 bursts when fully charged but the
weapon is normally powered by a small backpack unit with a
capacity of 200 bursts. A short-hand powerpack can also be
used, but each burst from the hand-of-length drains six shots'
worth of power.

**WEAPON-OF-LENGTH**
Incorporating the same highly robust laser system as the
lance-of-length, the weapon-of-length is a conventional laser
rifle. It has a vastly better effective range than the lance
version since it is designed to be held in both hands and
braced against the shoulder. Rifles of this sort are favored
by sharpshooters whereas those preferring to get stuck in use
the lance-of-length. Most fighting-bands contain members
equipped with a mix of both, though specialist bands do exist.

**WEAPON-OF-DESTRUCTION**
The standard heavy squad support weapon in most
K'kree forces is equivalent to a PGMP-12. The K'kree
version is just as bulky as human TL12 plasma weapons
but the mass is distributed such that it can be used by
a K'kree without the need for battle dress, providing
the gunner adopts a braced stance. The weapon-of-
destruction uses a backpack power supply good for 40
shots and is only considered Very Bulky if the user is
trying to fire on the move.

WEAPONS

CARRIERS
K'kree forces make extensive use of grav-powered
weapon platforms, which operate semi-autonomously
under the direction of a handler. Usually a handler
operates a single platform but at need a skilled handler
can control more than one. A number of additional
platforms equal to the handler's Electronics (remote
ops) skill can be run without penalty. Any more imposes
DM-2 on all actions per additional platform due to the
possibility of confused or sub-optimal directions.

Weapons carriers are designated by names generally
derived from something that happened during their
introduction to service. All have a semi-autonomous
movement and fire control system. If not under
active command they will loosely follow their handler,
weaving around in an automatic pseudorandom evasion

pattern. Commands are selected from a menu and/or
designation system, enabling the unit to be directed
to attack the nearest target, the last target to fire on
the handler's band, the heaviest weapon the enemy is
using and so forth.

All weapons carriers have an effective skill that is used
when operating in semi-autonomous mode. The handler
can directly control one of his weapons carriers, using
his Electronics (remote ops) skill instead of the unit's
own programming, although this can only be done
when stationary and carrying out no other actions. The
standard sensor package includes radar, low-light and
thermal sensors, all of which feed to the handler's
heads-up display. Data can then be pushed to other
band members.

The Friend is the most basic of standard K'kree weapons

with a laser rifle along the main axis. The unit is neither agile
nor quick and cannot keep up with a band of charging K'kree
if firing at the same time but does provide accurate light fire
support on the move. Internal fuel cells provide an effectively
infinite number of shots but movement rate is halved while
the weapon is fired. The Friend has only basic visual and

main axis and a rapid-fire stagger laser weapon in an ovoid
turret well forward on the torso. The effect is intentionally
to create the impression of a noble K'kree, cloak flying out
to the sides. The turret has all-round firepower; the heavy
laser requires pivoting the whole unit and can deprive those
behind it of cover when engaging targets to the side. Under
normal circumstances the Guardian is set to weave among and
ahead of an advancing warrior band, although it can also be

is a pair of Weapon-of-Destruction plasma guns carried on stubby arms alongside the main hull. The Slayer normally
fires its weapons alternately, allowing a brief cooling period. Both can be fired simultaneously but there is a chance of
overheating and malfunction every time this is done. The first time both guns are fired together in the same round, roll
1D. On a 6+, the guns will overheat, requiring realignment and repair, which is a workshop job. A cumulative DM+1 is
added to this roll for every consecutive round both plasma guns are fired.

K'kree vehicles must be large enough to accommodate
multiple K'kree, each of whom is of a considerable
size. The smallest feasible enclosed vehicle carries
four K'kree and any less risks panic and madness.
Similarly, it is not possible to assign a single driver to
a vehicle intended to carry passengers or cargo. Thus
most vehicles are either driven by a semi-autonomous
robotic unit similar to that used in weapons carriers or
are owned by a family and driven directly by a family
member. Groups of single-occupant open platforms are
used in some areas but as a rule K'kree walk short (by
the standards of quadruped grazers) distances or use
large transports to move the whole family at once. Even
splitting a family group between two or more enclosed
vehicles in close proximity to one another can be
distressing, so travel is usually aboard a single, open-
sided vehicle.

**Crew and Passengers**
K'kree vehicles must allocate five times as many Spaces
to passengers and crew as an equivalent human-
operated vehicle would have (so, a K'kree will require
a minimum of five Spaces on a vehicle). This includes
supports to allow K'kree to stand in comfort and
emergency restraints used in the event of a crash.

**Open Vehicles**
K'kree vehicles are built with partial sides and rails for
safety, with an open top. A light covering can be drawn
or unfolded over the top for weather protection and is
included as standard on most vehicles.

All K'kree vehicles have the Open trait and reduce their
Speed by one Speed Band.

Combat vehicles often use folding panels that, when
deployed, partially or fully seal the vehicle. This
removes the Open trait and allows the vehicle to travel
one Speed Band faster.

Folding Panels cost Cr500 per point of armor carried
by the vehicle.

Controlled Pintle/Ring Mount
Controlled pintle or ring mounts are unarmored
mountings for light weapons, either operated manually
or from a station within the vehicle. A controlled mount
costs Cr1500.

Controlled Open Mount
Controlled open mounts are essentially a turret
mechanism without enclosing armor. A controlled
mount can be either operated manually or from a station
within the vehicle, and carries a slightly larger weapon
than a small turret – up to 6 Spaces – while consuming
1 Space inside the vehicle. A controlled mount costs
Cr3000 for every Space of installed weaponry.

ARMOR

Always used in groups, skimmers are open-
topped, open-sided vehicles consisting of an oval
platform with a clear windshield and a safety rail
extending around the rest of the vehicle. Most of
those in use are constructed at TL9 and sold in
bulk throughout the Two Thousand Worlds. They
occasionally turn up in other hands, serving as
reconnaissance platforms or weapon carriers.

The standard skimmer has only the most basic
of controls and is designed to be slaved to a lead
vehicle. A simple point-to-point navigation system
is included, enabling an unskilled Traveller to
indicate a destination (either on a map or chosen
from a menu) and have the vehicle carry them
there. So long as the skimmers remain close
together, discomfort is kept to a minimum,
although it is customary to tie the skimmers'
basic communication systems together so the
family can chat or sing hymns to their ancestors
to keep fear at bay.

There is no sensor package but a simple point-
to-point navigation system is included, enabling

several personal skimmers plus a lead model
and will add custom decoration matched to the
status of the user – senior wife, administration
expert and so forth. If so, the skimmers usually
come with a pre-programmed formation and set

This standard transport vehicle, used
throughout K'kree space, is designed to ferry
10 K'kree. It follows the same general design
as the individual skimmer, with a curved
frontal windshield and low safety barrier
topped by rails or a clear screen. Weather
cover is provided by a retractable tent-like
'roof'. Almost all vehicles of this sort are
designed for autonomous select-and-go
operations but can be driven manually. They
are often used for cargo delivery, without
passengers aboard, increasing cargo capacity
to 15 tons. Like the skimmer, the FTV can
be operated as a drone controlled by its own
onboard base station, or the controls can be
directly operated if this is desirable.

MOBILE FIGHTING

PLATFORM
Somewhere between personnel carriers, oversized tanks
and mobile command posts. This medium-sized MFP
operates with a crew of up to 12 K'kree warriors. Its high
level of automation permits a single individual to set up
movement and fire patterns, and all weapons can be fired
semi-autonomously. As a rule, one Merchant-class operator
will be carried for each major weapon system, plus the
commanding Noble.

Basic hull form is oval like many other K'kree vehicles but
with a greater length-to-beam ratio and tapering tail that
makes the MFP seem less like a 'flying saucer' than some
designs. Underside and top armor are fixed but there are
folding panels in the all-round armor, which allow the
crew relief from confinement and the ability to directly
engage enemies with small arms.

The base section of the vehicle is wider than
the armored section, creating a walkway where
crewmembers can stand and operate weapons manually.
At need, weapon crews can retreat through the folding
panels and close them, using the weaponry remotely.
It is possible to run right around the outside of the
MFP, although this requires stepping over the barrel of

the forward-firing plasma gun. This, the MFP's primary
weapon, is located in a limited-traverse mount facing
forward and protected by heavy frontal armor.

Lighter weapons include six laser cannon mounted on
sponsons projecting from the walkway. Two are mounted
on the forward quarters and two aft, on the walkway
alongside the narrow tail. The cannon are on open mounts
and can be fired manually from outside the armor (this is
preferred by most crews) or from the safety of the vehicle's
remote fighting stations. There is another on a platform
where the top of the armored hull begins to round down
into the tail. A sixth light laser cannon, for the use of the
vehicle commander, is located on the command platform
atop the front of the main superstructure. Here, a noble
K'kree can command his vehicle and enjoy the air rushing
past his face – at least until heavy fire drives him inside
the armored section. The vehicle's pilot stands alongside
his master, a position of great favor and no little danger.

The MFP also mounts four anti-missile laser systems.
These are normally controlled by the vehicle's automated
defensive systems but can be fired from a station inside
the armored section at need. One is located on the rear
of the commander's station and one on the aft platform,
with two more on the underside of the midships sponsons
for all-round coverage. These are sometimes used as anti-
personnel weapons when the MFP is close to the ground.

##### HIGH GUARD: K'KREE

**CHAPTER-TEN**

Most starships operating within K'kree space are built
to TL9–11 standards. More advanced craft are available
to those with money and connections but for interstellar
commerce and routine travel a sedate pace is the norm.

The unique characteristics of the K'kree – their size
and need for the company of others – mean that their
vessels are built differently to those used by humans
and other small creatures. A K'kree engineer literally
cannot crawl into a narrow space to find a problem and
if they can physically fit into a tight space, being alone
and confined would make carrying out complex tasks
impossible even if it did not cause a mental breakdown.

Much use is made of remotely-controlled maintenance
units, which can be operated from an engineering
console, and wherever possible an open-plan mode of
construction is used. This means that pipes and wiring
conduits are highly exposed compared to human ships.
Spacecraft crews are still exposed to considerable stress
by the nature of their environment and many K'kree
simply cannot handle the pressure. Some are unable to
even travel as passengers and must remain confined to a
single world or be transported in low berths.

Accommodation is the most obvious area where designs
differ from other species. K'kree need a communal
living area but it must be properly delineated – it
would not do for a mere Merchant-caste family to
wander amongst a Noble's entourage! Thus rather than
staterooms, K'kree vessels use enclosures. These are
not normally fully enclosed, although some have the
capability to be sealed off in an emergency. Enclosures
are rated by their quality, which determines which caste
will deign to travel in them, as well as capacity. As a
general rule, K'kree need at least three to four times as
much living and working space as a human, although a
family or fighting-band can occupy a smaller space on a
communal basis.

DESIGN FEATURES
The lack of internal compartmentalization within K'kree
ships weakens their structure. To reflect this, reduce
Hull points by 25% for any craft or vessel that carries

live crew or passengers. Robotic craft are not affected.
There is no cost saving for this; it is merely the way
K'kree build their ships. This feature should be borne
in mind when designing deck plans; K'kree ships are
frighteningly open-plan by human standards – but then
human ships are claustrophobic nightmare spaces fit
only for G'naak.

Enclosures
At their most basic, enclosures provide sleeping,
hygiene and minimal recreation facilities for a group of
K'kree of the appropriate social caste, as shown on the
Enclosure table. K'kree have little concept of privacy
but need space apart from other families to maintain
their own bonds. An enclosure will be one of two basic
types; minimal or secure. Minimal enclosures have no
protection against depressurization or physical threats,
whereas a secure enclosure will have partial walls
(which may be transparent) and the ability to create a
sealed environment with emergency shutters, drop-down
partitions and local life support equipment.

If an enclosure is not big enough to hold a whole family
or fighting-band then it is not big enough. Groups
cannot be split up, except where adjoining enclosures
permit a group to use both.

For small craft intended only for short hops between
ships, installations and planets, enclosures are not
needed. Instead, the K'kree equivalent of cabin space
is used. Acceleration benches for K'kree cost the same
as for humans (Cr10000 per ton) but each ton only
provides accommodation for one K'kree. In addition,
cabin space is required at the rate of four tons per
K'kree. This includes basic sanitary and hospitality
facilities but most importantly just enough space to turn
around, take a couple of steps and 'be a K'kree rather
than a lump of cargo strapped to a bench'. Cabin space
costs the same as for humans (Cr50000 per ton). At a
minimum, a K'kree small craft must allocate five tons
per passenger at a cost of Cr210000. If comfort and
prestige are desired, this increases considerably.

Short-haul craft only

to carry K'kree, robotic craft are found in most of the
roles carried out by small craft elsewhere. K'kree do not
question the wisdom of placing their lives in the hands
of robotic devices; it is quite normal and has been going
on long enough to be considered traditional.

Robotic craft follow the rules for the Virtual Crew
software package (see page 64 of High Guard ). Note
that no bridge is necessary if the craft is not intended to
be flown manually by crew inside.

K'kree Virtual Crew packages are not created to replace
single crewmembers but are a complete system allowing
the craft to carry out its intended role without any
personnel aboard. For this reason they take up space
within the hull and are considered a component rather
than being purely a software system. A Virtual Crew
package requires a computer with sufficient Bandwidth
to run successfully.

K'kree Virtual Crew packages allow normal functions
of the crew positions they replace to be carried out
without requiring additional software. A basic operations
package replaces pilots, engineers and astrogators and
thus allows the ship to maneuver (a pilot function),
operate its sensors (pilot or astrogator) and control its
power systems (engineer) without requiring additional

**Common Areas**
Common areas are necessary aboard K'kree starships,
bought for the same price as aboard other ships (MCr0.1
per ton). However, a greater proportion of common space
is required for comfort; typically tonnage equal to half
the total accommodation tonnage.

**Shipboard Park**
For real comfort, a starship needs an area capable of
mimicking natural conditions on Kirur. This essentially
means creating a shipboard park, which must consume
at least 20 tons. Parks cost MCr0.25 per ton and
require the attention of crewmembers to keep them
pleasant but the ability to run a few paces on actual
grass is extremely beneficial to crew health and sanity in
the longer term. Nobles and certainly high nobles may
refuse to travel aboard a starship that does not have at
least a small exercise garden.

**Robotic Craft**
Very small robotic craft are normally termed drones but
as size increases these autonomous or semi-autonomous
vessels become something more capable. To the K'kree,
there really is no difference between a fighter crewed
by sentient people and a robotic fighter directed from a
parent ship. Since it is unfeasible to build small fighters

software. This vessel could not fire weapons, however as
this is a gunner function and not covered by the basic
operations package.

K'Kree ships cannot use standard virtual crew or
specialist software in combination with an operations
package. If the ability to operate weapons is desired a
military operations package is requires and a specialized
or advanced package must be used to gain additional
DMs. Non-robotic ships can use standard virtual crew
software to replace some of their crew, in the same
manner as vessels produced by any other species.

**Standard Operations Package:** The Standard Operations
Package is designed to replace up to five crewmembers
aboard a craft carrying out simple tasks such as surface-
to-orbit shuttling, sensor flybys and cargo transfers.
The simplest of these is sometimes termed a 'Standard
Shuttle' package and is quite adequate for routine work
but requires an operator to assume manual control for
complex tasks. More advanced packages are capable of
dealing with problems like wind shear or using optimal
shortest-time courses far more efficiently than a standard
package and provide a smoother docking, which can be
important in craft intended as status symbols.

A Standard Operations Package can replace pilots,
engineers and maintenance personnel. It can compute
a short course, such as a surface-to-highport route, but
if complex astrogation (for example, least-time transfer
from orbit around one world in a system to another) is

required then the course must be externally calculated
and downloaded to the robotic craft. Standard
Operations Packages cannot operate weapons or other
defensive systems.

Full Operations Package: A Full Operations Package
is designed to replace a larger crew and provide a
wider range of capabilities. Full Operations Packages
can replace pilots, astrogators, engineers and
support personnel but not gunners. A full package
can replace up to 10 personnel before requiring
additional Bandwidth and has a maximum capacity
of 20 personnel. Where a standard package can pilot
a shuttle from one port to another and plonk it on a
landing pad, a full package can calculate a course
across a star system then provide orders to cargo-
handling robots on how to obtain optimal cargo transfer
times and at the same time ensure its positioning
relative to other craft follows rules of etiquette so its
owners status is correctly conveyed.

Military Operations Package: Military Operations
Packages permit the replacement of any crewmember,
including gunners and screens operators. Military
packages are optimized for small craft and tailored to
their expected role. Packages may be tailored to their
intended role or a more general package may be used to
save costs. Tailored packages give additional bonuses, at
a cost in Credits and Bandwidth.

**A11/58231 ELECTROMAGNETIC-
ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION
SUITE (TL11)**
An electromagnetic-environment protection suite is the
forerunner to a countermeasures suite. It contains basic
jammers and electromagnetic warfare systems, which
grant DM+1 to electronic warfare tasks. In addition,
the suite contains ejectable decoys which increase
this to DM+2 when deployed. There are enough decoys
aboard for six uses, each of that remains in effect for
D3 rounds before scattering. This capability comes at
the price of a rather bulky and power-hungry system
consuming 6 tons and 3 Power. The suite costs MCr3.

BEARER-OF-CARGOES SHUTTLE

One of the most common small craft in K'kree
space, the Bearer-of-Cargoes is designed to
carry out basic interface work between orbital
installations and starships or planetside facilities.
It is entirely robotic, with no provision for manual
control aboard the craft; like most K'kree vessels
it can be remotely operated from another craft or
an installation.
As a freight-only craft, the Bearer-of-Cargoes
has no provision for passengers and no need
for life support or other amenities. It is built on
a standard 100-ton hull, with a robotic crew
facility and a very basic sensor package to allow
autonomous operation. More commonly the shuttle
relies on sensor data fed to it by parent vessels
or installations. It can make long-haul transits
across a star system only with the assistance of
outside course corrections and is thus normally
encountered on routine interface work.

Small by the standards of K'kree vessels,
the Trader of the Outer Steppe can be

space. Jump performance is very modest,
since much of the Two Thousand Worlds

QUICKENING THUNDER ROBOTIC FIGHTER

Quickening Thunder is a traditional name for
space fighter craft and older designs using the
same name are still in service in some areas.
Built on a rugged 40-ton hull, the Quickening
Thunder would be designated a medium
fighter by most navies but K'kree refer to it as
a 'versatile-combat-craft-of-the-outer-steppe'
without reference to size or role.

Fighters of this type are carried by warships
and deployed to defend installations. Fittings
and control systems are standardised, making
replacement of losses or alteration of a vessel's
fighter complement a simple matter. The
Quickening Thunder exists for the sole purpose
of carrying a fusion gun barbette into action,and
has been constructed in huge numbers;
according to rumor there are thousands sitting
in certain systems awaiting activation.

FAITHFUL SHIELD ROBOTIC ESCORT FIGHTER

The Faithful Shield is a counterpart of the Quickening
Thunder, built on the same rugged 40-ton hull. It also
uses the same power plant and drives, which leaves
space for later upgrade or modification. Whereas
the Quickening Thunder is designed to deliver heavy
firepower against enemy vessels, the Faithful Shield
is intended to keep enemy fighters and missiles
away from the vessels it is protecting. This is usually
a parent starship or installation but escort fighters
are sometimes mixed into an offensive formation to
improve penetration of an enemy fighter screen.

The Faithful Shield escort fighter takes advantage of
the space feed up by using a dual turret instead of a
barbette to fit an electromagnetic warfare suite. This
relies on brute-force jamming and a steady stream
of decoy launches but can be sufficient to protect a
parent vessel from incoming missiles. The twin beam
laser armament is of little use against most starships
but effective against fighters.

###### K'KREE IN TRAVELLER

**CHAPTER-ELEVEN**

Whenever K'kree are encountered, whether as Travellers
or played by the referee the same considerations apply.
To others of his kind, a K'kree who deviates from these
principles is not K'kree at all even if he looks like one.
Tales of G'naak in the guise of K'kree are told to the
young and form part of their cultural heritage and no
matter how rational a K'kree might be there is always an
underlying fear that one who is 'not of the herd', either
socially or mentally, might be more than just a deviant.

**K'kree do not deviate from their nature:** K'kree redefine
the word 'hidebound' with their strict adherence to
tradition and obedience to the social order. Their rituals
of veneration to the ancestors are near-constant and
have to be done just right. Disrespect towards their way
of life and social order cannot be tolerated. And G'naak
are G'naak. No exceptions, no mercy, no tolerance.

**Solo K'kree do not exist:** 'Rogue' or 'maverick' K'kree
can only exist as a result of serious mental illness and
cannot be played as rational people. They are also
likely to be killed or else forcibly taken back into K'kree
society if they encounter other K'kree – being alone
causes madness, madness causes a desire to act alone,
both are wrong, wrong, wrong! An outcast or orphaned
K'kree might appear in an adventure but this is a tragic,
troubled and doomed character best suited to be played
by the Referee or an experienced player who knows
where the story is leading.

**K'kree are big:** The difficulties of carrying out many tasks
when you are the size of a horse cannot be over-stated.
This is why K'kree make so much use of robotic craft,
vehicles and technical-assistance devices that can
actually get into the places they are to work.

**K'kree operate in groups:** Although tasks are generally
carried out by a single K'kree they are not really
performed by an individual so much as by a family or
fighting-band. The head of the group dictates who will
carry out the task and they do the work. Thus a noble
K'kree might describe himself as piloting his ship – and
in his terms he is – but in fact he is giving his pilot
instructions. A single human or Vargr Traveller might
dash to assist her downed comrade but if a K'kree did it
would resemble a stampede of up to a dozen horse-sized
people, most of whom would then stand around offering

praise, encouragement and prayers to the ancestors
rather than actually doing anything to help.

These factors make K'kree both interesting and very
difficult to play. They could be presented as generic
homicidal baddies but there is much more to them
than this. Everything the K'kree do makes sense from
their own perspective, even if an outsider cannot
comprehend what just happened. For example, a
K'kree family might be on the verge of success (or
victory over the Travellers perhaps) and then just...
stop. Orders from their clanlord or some important
piece of tradition that requires rituals and rest before
continuing, might derail an otherwise promising
endeavor. The K'kree would not be disappointed by
this; it is how things are and should be.

K'kree are all connected. Small families are part of
a big family and they are part of a herd and a clan.
The actions of a K'kree family patriarch affect his
whole herd and actions toward him are likely to have
repercussions if they come to the attention of his
clanlord. The curious, loose unity of the K'kree at times
holds back their progress but is also a source of great
strength and can be a powerful factor in diplomacy.

When a noble K'kree arrives in his starship and
announces he intends to conduct trade or negotiations,
there is no doubt – as there might be with other species

- that he is there with the approval and backing of his
clan. There are no K'kree 'rogue traders' or con-men
motivated by self-interest pretending to speak on behalf
of a greater power. However, that does not mean the
K'kree play straight by outsiders. There is no shame
in deceiving a foreigner with a rigged deal or insincere
promise and no reason not to tear up a treaty if it is no
longer beneficial.

This is the reality of dealing with K'kree. All their
agreements are one-sided; they do not care about
outsiders unless they are powerful enough to be a real
threat. K'kree will only make a deal if it benefits them
and they will certainly stick to it if it continues to do
so. Internal politics or shifting conditions elsewhere
can affect a treaty or agreement but the same factors
that make the K'kree implacable enemies make them
dependable treaty partners and steadfast friends to
those fortunate enough to win their approval.

# VARGR

**CHAPTER-TWELVE**

Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted
by the Ancients, a fact the Vargr are extremely proud
of. They are often seen by other races as aggressive
pirates and scavengers but Vargr have a diverse culture
deeply rooted in pack mentality and the desire for
companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant
struggle for leadership results in a culture fuelled by
conflict and change.

Governments in the Vargr Extents (the area of space
dominated by Vargr) continually rise and fall, borders
move and allegiances change. Life here is turbulent and
dangerous – the Imperium considers all worlds in the
Extents to be Amber Zones unless proven otherwise,
with many designated as Red Zones.

There are few human worlds in the Extents and few
Vargr worlds within the Imperium but both races
coexist in these regions of space. Humans and Vargr
have had a chequered history – a number of wars have
been fought with these two races fighting against, as
well as alongside, each other. However, most conflicts
between them occur on the border worlds where Vargr
empires seek to expand their borders and corsair
raiders attack indiscriminately.

It has been nearly 500 years since the last major
conflict occurred between humans and Vargr. Although
relations since then have been relatively peaceful, the
Vargr are an unpredictable race that embraces conflict;
it is perhaps inevitable that these traits will one day
lead to new hostilities.

PHYSIOLOGY
Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser stock;
genetically engineered by the Ancients circa –300,000
from the genus _Canis_ and transplanted from Terra to
Lair/Grnouf in the Provence sector. Although Vargr were
artificially developed, a certain amount of evolution and
natural selection took place as the species adapted to
the conditions on Lair without further manipulation by
the Ancients.

Male Vargr typically are 60 kilograms in mass and
stand 1.6 meters high. Females tend to be smaller and
average 1.5 meters in height and 55 kilograms in mass.

VARGR EXTENTS

THE IMPERIUM

ZHODANICONSULATE
Map showing position of Vargr Extents in relation to Imperium and Consulate.

Vargr bear a close resemblance to their canine
ancestry, as can be seen by their muzzle, tail and fur.
The latter covers their entire body and can be found
in a variety of colours. The most common colour is
grey but it is not uncommon to see Vargr with brown,
black or even red fur. Fur colour is partly determined
by climate with those from colder regions displaying
a greater variety of colours than those from warmer
areas. Parents from different climates will see offspring
having patterned fur with the stronger bloodline being
the most dominant colour. Tail characteristics such as
length and bushiness also vary greatly between Vargr
from different ethnic backgrounds.

Several anatomical modifications were made by the
Ancients to the canine body structure, the most
significant being stance, forepaws and muzzle. Vargr
adopt a digitigrade stance (putting weight on their
toes rather than the soles of their feet) and many
have a slight stoop although most Vargr would call it
a 'relaxed stance'. Vargr hands are similar in size and
functionality to human hands but the internal structure
is quite different and unique to Vargr. Muzzles are
shorter than that of their canine ancestors, largely due
to dietary considerations.

Three hundred thousand years of evolution on Lair
resulted in the Vargr adapting to the 26 hour rotation
of their homeworld and this circadian rhythm is shared
by all Vargr. However, Vargr remain extremely flexible in
their sleeping habits, adopting a polyurnal sleep pattern
where they prefer to sleep several times a day for short
periods rather than one single long sleep period. Vargr
will adapt their sleeping habits to their circumstances
but will typically sleep after meals or through
particularly hot or cold periods in the local climate.

The Vargr gestation period is usually four months. Most
litters have two young but litters with as many as five
pups have been known. Pups are born blind and deaf,
completely reliant on their parents to care for them for
the first four months until their senses develop. Vargr
females are able to conceive soon after giving birth but
will rarely do so until their pups are old enough to take
care of themselves, around the age of six.

Vargr share the same senses as humans but they tend
to be more acute. Olfactory receptors develop very
quickly to compensate for a pup's lack of sight and
sound, resulting in a keen sense of smell that Vargr
use to recognize each other. Vargr hearing is also much
better than a human's, able to detect a greater range
of frequencies over longer distances; humans are more
sensitive to low frequencies and Vargr are able to hear
high frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans.
Vargr eyesight is sharp but less sensitive to colour than
human eyes and less effective in dark conditions.

Lifespan
Vargr living in industrial areas usually live for 65 to
75 years. Pre-industrial Vargr have a shorter lifespan
due to poor living or environmental conditions and lack
of medical advances. The lifespan for Vargr in higher
technological cultures increases with advancements in
anagathics and medical treatment.

Diet
Vargr are a carnivorous species with the bulk of their
diet being fresh, raw meat. Uncooked fruits and fruit-
based drinks are also popular amongst Vargr but lack
the nourishment needed for a healthy lifestyle. Vargr
metabolism is faster and more efficient than the human
digestive system, meaning that Vargr eat more frequently
but are able to fast for longer periods if necessary.

Although Vargr adapted to conditions on Lair and the
indigenous wildlife was edible, it was not as appetising
as the meats that canines had become accustomed
to on Terra. Vargr chefs spent much time and effort to
find herbs, spices and seasoning that make food on
Lair more appealing and gourmets developed these into
sauces and dressings to further enhance Vargr meals.

Selective breeding of livestock was undertaken to improve
local food and make it more appetising. This practice
continues today on many Vargr worlds and comprises
much of the interstellar trade within the Extents.

Subspecies
A little known fact to most outsiders is the number of
Vargr subspecies that exist within the Extents. Most
ethnic minorities were seen as deviations from the
'perfected' Vargr race developed by the Ancients and
became the victims of prejudice and racial abuse that
prompted many to leave Vargr society and settle in
the unpopulated regions of Vargr space. Most of these
subspecies remain unknown to the Imperium and even
Vargr knowledge is limited since the subspecies were
outcast from society so long ago.

Urzaeng: The Urzaeng are one of the few subspecies
known to the Imperium and the only subspecies not
outcast by Vargr society due to their superior physical
prowess. Urzaeng average 1.85 meters in height and
weigh 70 kilograms. They are more powerfully built than
the average human and physically a match for Aslan.
The Urzaeng were originally bred by the Ancients for
heavy labour and combat so their increased physical
prowess comes at a cost to their mental characteristics;
this has resulted in the Urzaeng being a naturally violent
people with contempt for weakness.

**Kokasha:** The Kokasha are all but extinct now and those
that remain live in a refuge in Rukhs Dall (known as
the Trenchans sector in the Imperium). They are the
smallest of the subspecies and were engineered by the
Ancients to have heightened mental faculties at the
expense of physical attributes. Kokasha are typically
1.45 meters high and weigh 50 kilograms. Females are
slightly smaller, averaging 1.4 meters high and weighing
45 kilograms.

**Akumgeda:** Like most other subspecies, the Akumgeda
fled Lair after their people were ostracised by the rest
of the Vargr population. The Akumgeda settled on a
number of worlds in the Ksinanirz sector and although
some of these settlements still exist, many of the packs
reintegrated with their brethren as the Vargr expanded
throughout the Extents.

The Akumgeda appear much like normal Vargr but tend
to have spotted fur. Although unusual, spots are not
unknown and the Akumgeda found it easy to blend in
with 'normal' Vargr. What set the Akumgeda apart was
their strong psionic ability and some postulate that the
Vargr only developed psionic powers after the Akumgeda
reintegrated with their society.

**Nakagun:** This outcast subspecies lives in exile in the
Nakagun sector and are known to possess strange
psionic powers. Males and females are similar in
size averaging 1.5 meters in height and weighing 55
kilograms. Little else is known of this group since they
fled from Lair over a 1,000 years ago.

**Roth Thokken:** This subspecies settled in the Angfutsag
sector and although they look similar to the Nakagun,
they are even more peculiar. Their psionic powers are
said to be even stranger and more powerful. Further to
this, all Roth Thokken are permanently blind from birth.
This superstitious group live in seclusion and are known
to perform bizarre rituals using psionic senses unknown
to anyone outside their group.

SOCIETY
The Vargr are a dynamic people, their governments
and businesses constantly changing with the loyalties
and goals of individual Vargr. Many humans see this as
anarchic but this is not the case at all. Vargr society is
deeply rooted in charisma, loyalty, racial pride and the
need for companionship and approval.

**Genetic Instinct**
In addition to many of the physical features of their
canine ancestors, the Vargr have also inherited some
behavioural traits as well; few Vargr are aware of how
deeply rooted these traits are in their subconscious. Pre-
sentient canines constantly crave approval, much more

so than humans and most other races. This can be seen
in nature where wild dogs or wolves seek approval from
the pack's leader, where the cooperative nature greatly
improves their chance of survival. Likewise, domestic
canines seek approval from their master, which makes
them very loyal and easy to train.

It was these qualities that the Ancients wanted to
exploit, genetically engineering the genus Canis to
become intelligent beings to serve the needs of the
Ancients. Canine traits are so strong in the Vargr that
they have changed little in the evolution of the species
and are evident in the behaviour of all Vargr today.

Packs
The genetic instinct of Vargr is most evident in the pack
culture of their society. Like many species, they seek the
companionship of others for comfort and security, the
gregarious nature of Vargr giving them a drive to connect
with others and a need to belong to other groups. This
arises from both their natural need for approval and
the racial pride that unites all Vargr with a sense of
solidarity and camaraderie.

Vargr packs vary greatly in form and function. Some
common types include the family pack, businesses,
religions, recreational groups, governments, military
units and the infamous corsair bands. Most Vargr
belong to several packs, loyal to each one for different
reasons and proud to have many commitments and
loyal brethren.

Individuality is still important within the pack and each
member strives to become the most dominant. This
contest for leadership is based upon an individual's
charisma and influence but although members of a
pack are competitive, the good of the pack comes first
and members know they can always count on their
peers for assistance, companionship and support in
times of need.

Large organizations usually consist of several packs
divided by roles or specialities. Where several packs
exist in a single organization, a hierarchy exists where
the leader of each answers to the primary pack. This
takes power struggles to new levels as individuals
compete not only for dominance within their own pack
but with other packs in the organization – a leader of
one pack might seek to become the leader of another
or may try to make their pack more dominant within
the organization.

Charisma & Loyalty
At the heart of Vargr psychology is the concept of
charisma, which Vargr define as an individual's prestige
and force of personality that attracts other Vargr.

This, combined with pack mentality, is the foundation
for Vargr society and the driving force behind their
constant change in leadership, whether in a pack of
scavengers or government.

The Vargr desire to constantly increase their charisma
makes them a competitive race, always seeking to
improve their standing amongst the pack. It is this
charisma that gives them their focus and drive. Whilst
many humans see this as a flaw, it is one of the reasons
that Vargr have become such a prominent race.

Charisma is gained or lost by word and deed, and Vargr
are keen to perform special or difficult duties if it means
they will gain standing by doing so. This behaviour means
that Vargr always try their best in the hope of gaining
charisma and the fear of losing it – very few Vargr are lazy
or procrastinate when they have duties to perform.

Vargr always look to the most charismatic person in
the pack for leadership and that individual will only
maintain position by proving they have the ability and
force of personality to lead the pack. All Vargr respect
a leader who has a greater charisma than their own
and likewise have a responsibility to those with a lower
charisma who submit to their authority.

A leader might not have the skills to effectively lead the
pack but charisma gains them the loyalty of everyone in
the group. Contrary to popular belief, a Vargr's loyalty
is very strong and will only waver if the pack leader
fails to meet the needs of their people and thus lose
charisma. Loyalties may change but never quickly and
never without reason. It is this that seems to have gone
unnoticed by outsiders who regard the Vargr's loyalty as
volatile at best and mutinous at worst.

Should a leader be found to lack the skills to lead
their people, members will look to others within the
pack who have the charisma to take control. This may
seem strange and unproductive to other races but this
behaviour always ensures the strongest person is in
charge of a pack.

**Racial Pride**
Vargr see themselves as a unique people, a race chosen
by the Ancients and uplifted to be an intelligent race. In
their eyes, this makes the Vargr special and sets them
apart from the other major races, since only Vargr have
such esteemed origins.

Some Vargr believe in racial superiority, which has led to
two schools of thought on the subject. Those who follow
the so called 'high superiority' school propose that Vargr
were designed to be better than other races, that the
Ancients designed them to be nothing less than perfect.

Proponents of the 'low superiority' school maintain they
were the original sapient race on Terra and the Ancients
moved them to Lair so the Vargr would not interfere with
the genetic engineering of humans from Terran apes.

As with all things in Vargr society, there are numerous
other ideas supported by scientists, politicians and
religious groups. A minority of Vargr even take the view
that their origins make them an inferior race and these
troubled souls feel they have to prove their worth by
performing dangerous and extraordinary actions.

With so many takes on racial pride, it is important to
note that most Vargr lie somewhere between these
extremes and are content in the knowledge that they are
a special and unique race – from humble beginnings
they were chosen by the Ancients and eventually
reached the stars.

Family
The family is a pack of blood relatives and it is in this
environment that pups first learn about pack structure,
quickly learning to recognize charisma and develop
their own personality. Young members of a family
must show the proper respect to the family leader
and establish their own position within the pack by
improving their charisma. This learning curve is crucial
training for a young pup.

In agrarian or pre-industrial societies, the family
pack tends to be larger than those of more advanced
cultures. On a low technology world, a larger family
means a greater number of hunters, essential to the
pack's survival. However, if a pack grows too large
it becomes less effective, especially if the pups and
elderly outnumber more able-bodied members as it
places an additional burden on the hunters, threatening
the survival of the pack. Larger packs are also more
noticeable, making it difficult to hunt wildlife.

Vargr families become smaller as technology increases
and the economy moves towards industry. Industrial
based societies require large workforces so parents spend
much of their time working and less raising families.
Raising pups in the family environment is essential for
their development, so most Vargr females on these worlds
will only give birth to one litter in their lifetime.

In higher technology societies where much of the
workforce is automated, the demands on family
members are reduced and they are better able to raise
their pups in a more traditional manner. Female Vargr
on these worlds will therefore give birth to several litters
and the average family size is more akin to that of pre-
industrial societies.

**Beliefs**
Religion is as diverse and varied as every other aspect of
Vargr society. Many religions stem from the Vargr's pride
in their origins and the Ancients are venerated as gods
by many groups. What humans would consider orthodox
religions also exist in great numbers but they are not as
common as belief in the Ancients.

Many who do devote themselves to a religion will
continue in their chosen career but some will also
change profession to better follow their faith; this is
especially true of loners who are more likely to seek the
companionship of fellow believers. Religious leaders
often have a background as emissaries but this is not
always the case.

**Church of the Chosen Ones:** This religion was established
in the year 895 of the Imperial calendar and for a short
period it was one of the largest and most influential
religious movements in Vargr society. Although the
religion is not as popular as it once was most Vargr have
heard of the Church of the Chosen Ones.

The religion postulates that not only did the Ancients
create the Vargr by genetically engineering Terran
canines but that the Ancients continued to return
to Lair to make improvements until they created the
superior race that Vargr are today. To followers of the
Church of the Chosen Ones, this also explains the
existence of the Vargr subspecies; they were mistakes
abandoned by the Ancients.

Congregations tend to live in their own communes and
each commune has its own particular traditions, dress
codes and practices, such as wearing only white clothes,
wearing an embroidered sash or adorning themselves
with a particular marking or tattoo.

The popularity of this religion has declined in recent
years and there are now thought to be around 20
branches remaining in the Extents, although each
branch consists of multiple congregations. Infrequent
surges of popularity boost the number of followers
but not in sufficient quantity to rival its popularity in
the early days. Many scientists have discredited the
claims made by the Church but this has not swayed the
remaining fanatics from their beliefs.

**Faarzgaen:** This is a religion of fanatics who believe
in a single god, Faarzgaen, who continually guides all
who worship him and determines how they should live
and act; if a follower of Faarzgaen is hungry then he
wants them to eat, if they are tired then he wants them
to sleep and if they have the urge to take a life then
Faarzgaen wants them to kill someone.

Followers of this faith believe that Faarzgaen is the one
true god and his religion thus the only true faith. Anyone
who does not follow Faarzgaen is a heretic. Worshippers
of Faarzgaen spread their religion by forcing it upon
others using fear and violence.

This fanatical behaviour has lead worshippers of
Faarzgaen to believe that they are the only ones fit
to rule the universe and have become a powerful
organization feared by many Vargr. On some worlds the
religion has become a ruling power, oppressing their
subjects until they submit to the one true faith.

The religion and the few states they control are run
by seven overlords known as Kafaazgaen. To become
a Kafaazgaen a priest must commit a number of
violent acts, including the assassination of a serving
Kafaazgaen, in order to take that position.

INFIGHTING
Infighting is unique to Vargr and is more than just
combat; it forms part of their struggle for power and
charisma within their pack. There are times when
dominance cannot be decided by charisma alone
and in these situations the Vargr will succumb to the
more primitive means of tooth and claw. Infighting is
frequently used to settle disputes and insults.

Infighting is similar to a duel but participants are fighting
for charisma and loyalty, not honor and pride. This may
seem a small distinction to humans but to Vargr and
indeed the Aslan (who duel for honor), the difference is
considerable. Infighting is not so much about injuring or
killing the opponent but getting them to submit and thus
proving the victor is the most dominant.

Whenever two Vargr are battling for dominance within
a pack and loyalty is divided or a Vargr questions the
abilities or leadership of another, one challenges the
other to fight. Such infighting is not necessarily for the
role of pack leader but simply for one Vargr to raise their
position above another and slowly increase charisma
and status within the pack. A pack member might also
challenge someone of lower charisma to prove they
remain superior to their subordinates.

Individuals who constantly challenge their comrades will
usually lose charisma and in some cases are cast out
from the pack. Exploiting one's prowess in combat as an
easy way of gaining charisma is seen as un-Vargr and not
tolerated. Infighting has its rightful place but it is not an
alternative to charisma; it is just one of many aspects of
the Vargr struggle for dominance.

DRESS, ART &

ARCHITECTURE
Due to Vargr eyesight being less sensitive to colour,
their clothes and decorations are often made up of
bright colours that appear garish to humans. Clothes
tend to be tight fitting and practical but cloaks and
capes are not uncommon. Most Vargr prefer to forego
footwear but this varies between locations and cultures;
shoes and boots tend to be used for practical reasons,
such as with armor or in regions with rough terrain
and cold climates.

Art follows a similar trend, with a preference toward
bright colours using a variety of styles and techniques.
Paintings and sculptures often depict charismatic
leaders and renowned Vargr packs. Corsair bands are
also a common subject of paintings, stories and poetry.

As one would expect from such a diverse race, Vargr
architecture varies widely not just between locations and
cultures but within the same settlements. Designs are
typically asymmetrical and have a lot of ornamentation.
The garish colours of one building often clash with
neighboring structures, making Vargr cities appear
chaotic and disorganised.

The gregarious nature of Vargr manifests in their
architecture, resulting in wide communal areas and
open plan offices. This can be seen on a greater scale
with most settlements having large open areas for
markets and recreational uses.

An important feature of most buildings is that they
are rarely designed with a particular use in mind. The
continuous changes in Vargr society mean buildings
constantly change in ownership and function. For this
reason, it is important that a building can be easily
adapted to the needs of its occupants; a building might
be a government office one day, a junk dealership the
next and a month later it could be a fine restaurant.

Tattoos and Markings
A popular tradition amongst Vargr, especially in military
and corsair packs, is tattooing their bodies or painting
armor to show past deeds. Pack members will use
a variety of symbols painted in different colours to
represent deeds such as victories, kills and leadership
achievements. Rank and pack insignia are also common
tattoos. Like so many aspects of Vargr culture, tattoos
are constantly changing as new victories are won and
achievements gained.

Tattoos are generally applied to the face where the fur
is short. Some Vargr have been known to dye their fur
or shave patches but most will simply paint symbols
on their armor, clothes and weapons. In this context,
symbols painted on items are often referred to as
tattoos, as there is no distinction between the two.

Although this tradition is followed by many Vargr, it is
by no means practiced by all groups. Some individuals
abstain from the custom, preferring deeds to speak
for themselves rather than displaying them in such an
obvious manner.

The meaning of symbols and colours varies from one
pack to the next and in some groups the location of
the design is also relevant. In most packs, the meaning
is derived from only one characteristic of colour,
location or symbol; the remaining aspects are simply an
expression of the individual.

EMISSARIES
The number and variety of Vargr governments makes
diplomacy very difficult. Disputes arise over a
variety of matters and when two or more charismatic
leaders (of packs or of governments) are involved,
the situation can quickly resort to violence without
intervention of intermediaries.

A specialized group of mediators, known as emissaries,
has arisen to meet the needs of disputing parties.
Emissaries are highly skilled diplomats, much sought
after for their experience in negotiation and diplomacy.
These individuals are greatly respected and well paid
for their services. They are used as much in corporate
dealings as they are for political negotiations.

Other races on the borders of Vargr territories are often
subject to raids by independent corsair bands. This
has led to misunderstandings and political disputes
since few outsiders understand the Vargr's apparent
lack of respect for authority. In these situations
emissaries are frequently called to mediate on behalf
of Vargr governments. Emissaries are usually successful
in creating the peace or at least avoiding further
hostilities. In the cases of raids and unprovoked attacks,
reparations are usually given to the victim as a gesture
of good will.

BUSINESS
Vargr do not have anything approaching the
megacorporations found in other races, as the
hierarchy and remote authority necessary to run a large
corporation is something that simply does not work with

their mindset. Vargr workers who are unsatisfied with
their jobs or feel undervalued or underpaid also have a
tendency to simply look for new leadership within the
company or find a new job more suited to their needs.

The few larger corporations that are successful have
become so by splitting their organization into smaller
subsidiary companies, thus reducing remote authority
and keeping the feel of a smaller company, at least as
far as workers are concerned. These businesses are most
successful when working on the subsector level and most
operate in the shipping and interstellar trade markets.

As one would expect with the Vargr, businesses come
and go with astonishing frequency, much more so than
any other race. This might have a negative impact on
trade but the environment prevents capital from being
tied up in unprofitable businesses. The nature of Vargr
business has made a number of professions both
lucrative and essential to the Vargr economy.

Junk Dealer: The junk dealer, also known as second-
hand equipment merchant, is one of the most common
professions in Vargr society. Anyone can set themselves
up as a junk dealer with minimal collateral and there
is never a shortage of second-hand goods. As Vargr
businesses rise and fall, leftover goods and unwanted
equipment is always available for those who know where
to look.

Some businesses will search for goods but without
knowledge and connections this can be a time
consuming task, especially if rare or specific items are
required. The majority of second-hand equipment is
purchased quickly and cheaply by junk dealers who
then sell it on to corporations or scroungers, making a
significant profit in the process.

Many junk dealers are independent traders with small
to medium size establishments but larger second
hand dealerships also exist with vast warehouses and
numerous dealers on the payroll.

Scrounger: Scroungers are specialist brokers, working
both independently or for corporations. Companies with
a good scrounger on the payroll will save a lot more
money than it costs to hire their services.

Bargains can be found throughout the Vargr Extents but
the right skills and knowledge are required to locate
them. Scroungers are experts in this field and can find
just about anything a company or individual might need,
from raw materials to high-tech goods. They will often
purchase goods from junk dealers but also cut out the
middleman if the opportunity arises.

**Contingency Expert:** A contingency expert fulfils a
similar role to the scrounger. Businesses rely on each
other to provide goods and services; in the fluctuating
world of Vargr business it is essential to ensure that
if one supplier stops trading, a replacement can be
found quickly and efficiently to reduce the loss of
sales and productivity.

**Economy**
The many governments and states of Vargr society
mean that there is no global economy in the Extents.
Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the
local economy of each government and world fluctuates
wildly. Prices can vary from place-to-place by as much
as a third.

Vargr will usually haggle and negotiate to get a higher
salary or a better price for whatever goods or services
they are purchasing. Busy areas of trade such as
spaceports and marketplaces are a cacophony of
raised voices with bartering, intense negotiations and
angry consumers.

Due to the fragile nature of Vargr economics, bank
lending and finance options are virtually unheard of.
Investment opportunities are also uncommon for the
same reasons. Businesses are so unstable that lenders
and investors must not only be convinced of a return
but will demand some sort of collateral to protect
their investment.

THE MILITARY
The Vargr military conforms to no standard conventions.
Local governments have their own forces, each varying
in organization, technology and strength. Larger states
might control all the military of their member worlds
or rely on local forces. For most worlds, the military
comprises of three divisions: army, navy and marines.

Each military division consists of a number of packs,
with each pack forming a unit. Tactics tend to operate
on a unit level depending on the abilities of the current
leader and change with leadership within the pack.
Units are often grouped into a variety of regiments,
battalions, platoons and squads but, being Vargr, this is
not always the case. Larger military organizations tend
to have a more formal hierarchy but again, this varies
between governments.

Ranks vary from one group to another. Many divisions
have their own arbitrary ranks issued on a whim, whilst
others have a more formal hierarchy in place. The usual
infighting occurs within the military as it does in other
Vargr packs and individuals are promoted on force of

personality rather than skills in leadership or battle.
The result of this is that officers are often promoted to
commanding positions but lack the skills needed for
military leadership and tactics.

In addition to the power struggles within a pack, there
is also a jockeying for position between different units.
Some packs seek to become more dominant than others
in their division and leaders jockey for command of more
prestigious units, often bringing members of their own
pack with them.

Once in a commanding position, leaders must live up
to the expectations that earned them the promotion.
Leaders who fail to command their force to success are
soon replaced by more charismatic individuals.

The result of the Vargr mentality means their military
is somewhat volatile. This instability not only affects
organization and leadership but can have a great impact
on morale as well. It is not uncommon for charismatic
individuals to gain popularity in resisting higher
authorities for a number of reasons, causing disputes and
strikes to demand better conditions, equipment and pay.

Mutinies have also been known to occur but such
extreme shifts in loyalty are infrequent. These acts
have been known to turn the tide of battle as units and
entire battalions have deserted or even changed sides
during a conflict; such is the nature of Vargr. However,
this behaviour is discouraged and considered treason by
many governments; punishments can be quite severe.

Humans find this concept of leadership difficult to
understand but from the Vargr perspective it makes
perfect sense; if a leader proves they are not capable
of command it is important to replace them with a
charismatic leader who can, especially in combat.

CORSAIR BANDS
When most people think of Vargr, the first thing that
comes to mind is the corsair bands that operate
throughout the Extents and along Imperial borders.
Indeed, this imagery comes foremost to many Vargr as
well but whereas humans see pirates raiding free traders
and merchant ships, the Vargr are more likely to see
glamour and prestige.

Although the life of a corsair is appealing to Vargr,
these space pirates constitute less than 10% of Vargr
society. Unfortunately, all Vargr have been tarred with
the same brush despite the fact that corsairs are hated
and feared by many Vargr who have chosen a more
honest way of life.

Corsair raiders do not abide by any laws, nor do they
recognize boundaries. This is made possible by the
fractured governments and lack of centralised policing
within the Vargr Extents. Without coordinated law
enforcement, corsairs are free to prey on the trade
routes with little opposition. When they do encounter
resistance they can avoid legal issues by simply crossing
a border.

Outside of Vargr space, corsair bands face a much
tougher prospect as most other races have dedicated
law enforcement and military patrols to prevent acts
of piracy. Imperial law ensures criminals cannot
escape justice by simply crossing the border into other
territories and this means only the largest and most
experienced bands prey on ships beyond the Extents.

A number of larger corsair bands have become so
powerful and organised that they rival the might of some
governments. It is not uncommon for groups of renown
to be hired as mercenaries to bolster the defences of
smaller worlds or work alongside military forces. Many of
these large corsair bands also have their own bases.

Smaller bands also exist, right down to single-ship
crews. These independent raiders focus their efforts on
weaker vessels ignored by larger corsair bands. These
targets are also safer for small raider packs as there is
little threat of reprisal by larger bands who also operate
in the region.

These larger corsair bands operate much like military
groups but with one significant advantage; a corsair
band will usually have a strong leader who is both
charismatic and skilled, whereas military leaders obtain
the position by popularity but often lack the skills
and tactical knowledge that come with experience.
This results in the usual Vargr struggle for dominance
amongst military units, whilst corsair leaders have
proven themselves time and again making their pack
more stable and outsiders have difficulty understanding
how a group of pirates can have a more solid hierarchy
than other Vargr packs.

VARGR IN THE

IMPERIUM
There are numerous Vargr scattered throughout Imperial
space. Settlements with a significant Vargr population
usually have a Vargr quarter where most live and socialise
and such areas tend to be loud and colourful with an
atmosphere much like any other Vargr community.

Vargr in the Imperium behave much as they do in the
Extents. They still lack respect for authority but will
follow a charismatic human leader just as they would
a Vargr. However, the usual jockeying for charisma and
power is not so prevalent as such behaviour tends not
to be so beneficial in human culture and rarely results
in promotion.

Vargr also discover that laws are enforced more strongly
in the Imperium and although the Vargr disrespect
for the law remains they become more mindful of it,
learning what they can get away with and what they get
arrested for. This is often a case of trial an error and
most Vargr who travel to Imperial space will be charged
with at least one misdemeanour before taking a more
active view of the law.

LANGUAGE AND

NAMING
The diversity of Vargr society extends to their language.
There are hundreds of different languages and dialects
spoken throughout the Extents. Governments tend
to favor a particular language but this is not always
the case and in some regions a common language is
adopted to aid in trade and negotiations.

Vargr usually choose their own name when they come of
age. Some choose a name significant to them such as
an important event or achievement in their life, whilst
others are chosen arbitrarily and do not necessarily have
any meaning.

Non-Verbal Communication
Like other races, body language plays in important role
in Vargr communication. However, Vargr have a limited
range of facial expressions so they use posture, bearing,
ears and tails to convey unspoken meaning.

Much of a Vargr's body language is subconscious and
can often give a clear indication as to their emotional
state. This can obviously make Vargr quite vulnerable,
so they will often use additional gestures to distract
others from seeing such strong emotional signals.

### VARGR TRAVELLERS

**CHAPTER-THIRTEEN**

Vargr Travellers follow the same procedures and
concepts as human Travellers, as detailed in the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_. Although Vargr are covered on
page 51 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , it is assumed
that Travellers created that way were born and raised
within the Imperium or, at least, human-based society.
The Traveller creation rules presented here are suitable
for Vargr born and raised within the Extents. Unless
otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and
career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

INITIAL TRAVELLER

GENERATION
Use the characteristics and traits for Vargr Travellers
shown below:

**Characteristics:** STR-2, DEX +1, END-1
**Traits:** Bite, Heightened Senses (see page 51 of the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ ).

Vargr from the Extents do not have a SOC characteristic

- instead, they use Charisma (CHA). A Vargr will start
with CHA 1D+2.

STARTING AGE
Vargr characters begin their careers at 18 years of age.
Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career
to gain new skills, experience and, most importantly,
Charisma. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years.

Titles
Vargr do not have titles of nobility as humans of high
SOC do. Like most aspects of Vargr society, there is
no consistent system for titles and different packs
and cultures will use their own arbitrary methods of
assigning titles, if at all. Travellers with CHA 10+ have
enough dominance within their pack to select their own
title or assign one to subordinates.

Careers
Vargr careers, in general, are used in the same way as
described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, there
are exceptions, which are noted here.

Those Vargr born and raised in the Imperium will
take one of the careers detailed in the Traveller Core
Rulebook , as if they were human.

QUALIFICATION
Once a career has been selected, the Traveller must
attempt to qualify for that career. Due to the nature of
Vargr society, qualifying for a career is usually based on
CHA instead of a characteristic more relevant to the type
of career. CHA is therefore used for all careers except
Loner, Psion and Scientist.

Vargr Travellers are expected to change their career often
as they gain CHA, seek new goals or a pack leader fails
to live up to expectations. For this reason, there are no
penalties when moving from one career to another.

If a Traveller fails to qualify, they can take the Drifter
career (detailed on page 26 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_ ) or Loner career for the term, or they can
submit to the Draft. Enlisting in the Draft works
exactly the same as detailed on page 17 of the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ but Travellers roll on the Vargr
Draft table instead.

1–3 Army
4 Marines
5 Navy
6 Law Enforcement

SKILLS
Skills are determined as normal but all Vargr Travellers
automatically receive Melee (infighting) 0. This
represents the natural infighting ability of all Vargr.

PSIONICS
Vargr Travellers have the same psionic potential as
humans and the same rules apply, using the Psion
career on page 200. The primary factor holding back the
wide ranging use of psionics amongst Vargr is the lack of
organised research and training facilities. As a result of
this, Vargr psions are uncommon in the Extents.

Vargr attitudes towards psionics vary – many worlds are
indifferent but some governments have outlawed the
use of psionics, some encourage it and to other cultures
such abilities are blasphemous.

MISHAPS TABLE

EVENTS TABLE

VARGR LIFE EVENTS
The life events of a Vargr Traveller are similar to those of a human, with the addition of pack events. The pack is an
important part of a Vargr's life and events that affect the pack will often impact on the character.

**Life Events**

2D Event
2 Sickness or Injury: You are injured or sick. Roll on the Injury table.
3 Birth or Death: Someone close to you dies, such as a friend or pack member. Alternatively, someone
close to you gives birth (or is born!). You are involved in some fashion (father or mother, pack member
or similar).
4 Ending of Relationship: A romantic relationship involving you ends. Roll 1D. On a 1–2 your mate is killed.
On a 3–4 your mate leaves you. On a 5–6 you leave your mate.
5 New Relationship: You become romantically involved with an existing Ally, Contact, another Traveller or
pack member.
6 Pack Event: Roll on the Pack Event table. Travellers not currently in a pack roll CHA 7+ to join a pack or
gain a new Rival instead.
7 New Contact: You gain a new Contact.
8 Pack Event: Roll on the Pack Event table. Travellers not currently in a pack roll CHA 7+ to join a pack or
gain a new Ally instead.
9 Travel: You move to another world. You gain DM+2 to your next Qualification roll.
10 Good Fortune: Something good happens to you; you come into money unexpectedly, have a lifelong dream
come true or another stroke of good fortune. Gain a Benefit roll in your current career or gain CHA +1.
11 Crime: You commit a crime or are accused of a crime. Lose CHA –1.
12 Unusual Event: Something weird. Roll 1D:

**1. Psionics:** You have an encounter with a psionic phenomenon, such as a human psionic institute,
    Zhodani agent or alien entity. You may immediately test your Psionic Strength and, if you qualify, take
    the Psion career in your next term.
**2. Aliens** : You spent a long time amongst an alien race. Gain Language or Science 1 and a Contact from
    that race.
**3. Alien artefact:** You come into possession of a curious piece of alien technology or an archaeological
    relic.
**4. Amnesia:** There is a hole in your mind.
**5. Contact with government:** Your pack became well known and had dealings with a government leader.
    Gain CHA +1.
**6. Ancient technology:** You have an item believed to be left behind by the Ancients when they first
    brought the Vargr to Lair.

**Pack Events**
These events affect the Traveller's pack and
their position.

1D Event
1 Failure: Your failure causes a serious problem for your pack such as the loss of a well-paid job or the death
of a pack member. Lose CHA –1. If you are the leader, your pack will look to new leadership until you can
redeem yourself.
2 Leave Pack: A change of situation, disagreement or lack of leadership forces you to leave your pack and
your job. Roll CHA 6+ to find another job in your current field or you are ejected from your career.
3 Join Pack: You join a new pack. This can be a change of job or employer within your career or you become
involved with another group such as a religion or recreational group.
4 Power Struggle: The leader of your pack does not live up to the reputation their charisma suggested and
you look to other members to replace them. Roll 1D. On a roll of 1–3 the current leader keeps their
position; gain a Rival. On a roll of 4–6 a new leader takes charge of the pack; gain an Ally.
5 Success: You are successful at a particularly difficult task and exceed all expectations. Gain CHA +1.
6 Leadership Challenge: The leader of your pack fails in their role and the pack looks for a new leader. Roll
Leadership or CHA 10+ to become the pack's new leader. If you fail, another member is chosen and you
gain a Rival.

MUSTERING OUT
Benefits are granted at the end of career service, as
detailed on page 45 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.
Vargr have access to two new mustering out benefits.

**Corsair:** You receive a Ruguelka corsair with 25% of
the mortgage paid off on it. This corsair is identical to
the one on page 236 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the corsair will have no mortgage
and it will be all yours!

**Trader:** You receive a Koerae trader with 25% of the
mortgage paid off on it. This trader is identical to the
one on page 228 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the trader will have no mortgage
and it will be all yours!

**Gaining and Losing Charisma**
A Vargr's CHA can change many times during the course of an adventure, as long as they are responsible for the
success or failure of any given task; if a Traveller is using their initiative and making choices, the outcome of
those decisions can raise or lower their CHA.

For example, a pilot who misjumps due to a damaged jump drive would not be responsible for the failure,
whereas a pilot who destroys a superior vessel due to clever thinking and good piloting would be responsible for
the success and therefore have a chance to increase their CHA.

**Charisma Gain:** Providing the Traveller is responsible for a noteworthy success where they have shown initiative
or completed a task against difficult odds, roll 2D and add their CHA DM. If the total equals or exceeds their
current CHA, they gain CHA +1.

**Charisma Loss:** If the Traveller is responsible for a significant failure, roll 2D and add their CHA DM. If the total is
less than their current CHA, they lose CHA –1.

When making these checks, it is important that the Traveller has earned the gain or deserved the loss either
through their actions or decisions. Referees may also alter the task difficulty of these checks as appropriate to
the significance of the outcome. For example, a Traveller who saves the pack by spotting an ambush and taking
out the enemy might have an Average CHA check. A Traveller who causes their ship to collide with a mountain
through complete inattention might face a Formidable CHA check.

Travellers making CHA checks of this kind can opt to use Leadership instead if the Referee deems it appropriate
to the situation.

The pack mentality of the Vargr means they require leadership in order to function effectively, so anytime a pack
leader loses CHA or if the leader is injured or killed, the pack will look for new leadership. The new leader will
usually be the most charismatic member of the pack but individuals might join the struggle for power. If the new
leadership is contested, everyone vying for the position makes an opposed CHA or Leadership check and the
Traveller with the highest check wins the battle for leadership and instantly gains CHA +1.

A pack leader who is stripped of their position loses CHA –1. This reduction is in addition to the CHA loss caused
by the failure itself.

**CHA and SOC**
When travelling to other worlds, it will be likely
that Travellers with SOC will need to make CHA
checks and vice versa.

Whenever this is required, simply increase the
difficulty of the check by one level and use the
characteristic possessed by the Traveller. So, a
Traveller with the SOC characteristics called upon
to make an Average (8+) CHA check, will actually
make a Difficult (10+) SOC check.

Vargr equipment is, for the most part, similar in form
and function to human items. The main differences are
found in clothing and armor where the physiological
differences of the Vargr influence the design. Although
clothing and armor from other races can be modified
to fit Vargr, they prefer specifically made items that are
naturally more comfortable.

A large amount of Vargr equipment is second hand. There
is no status attached to buying new or second hand; the
abundance of second hand goods from failed companies
is simply part of Vargr life that creates a buyer's market.
Junk dealers usually trade out of a warehouse, bulk
selling to corporations, but most have an open door policy
allowing anyone to browse their stock and purchase goods
as required. For those looking to bulk buy second hand
merchandise, finding an experienced scrounger can save
the buyer a lot of money.

There is less of a second hand market for personal and
domestic items such as clothes and house wares since
these items are less likely to become redundant when
companies fail. However, this market is still big by
human standards and second hand shops that cater to
the domestic market are a common sight in any Vargr
settlement, ranging from small independent retailers to
large megastores.

PURCHASING

EQUIPMENT
Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the
local economy of each government and world fluctuates
wildly. When purchasing equipment and services,
Referees should alter the costs by up to ±15% by
adding 2D-7 x 3 percent to the list price.

Travellers wishing to purchase second hand items
can go direct to a junk dealer or hire the services of
a scrounger. Buying direct from a second hand store
or junk dealer will reduce the list cost by up to 40%,
which is determined by subtracting 5D+10 percent
from the modified list price; it is indeed entirely
possible that brand new goods on one Vargr world are
cheaper than buying the same items second hand on a
different world.

A scrounger will typically find required items with a further
2D percent price reduction but will take a commission of
1D percent of the total cost of goods purchased.

**BASE GARMENTS**
It is not necessary to attach armor to a base garment
but many Vargr do so in order to have a basic level of
protection over the whole body or make it easy to get in
and out of the whole suit. Base garments are made of
flexible materials.

The standard base garment is a coverall, usually
decorated in patterns of the user's choice. Camouflage
is rare; garish designs that scream 'here I am!' are the
norm. These attract as much fire as attention but are
part of the Vargr way of life. Jacket-style base garments
are also available, although they usually come with
shoulder and arm pieces.

ARMOR
Personal armor is common in the Vargr Extents and
not only worn by corsairs or members of the military.
The high risk of attack by pirates means many traders
and Travellers also don protection when passing through
dangerous regions and undefended space routes.

Vargr tend to use separate pieces of armor bought,
stolen or scavenged to suit their needs and comfort.
Many Vargr, especially corsairs, have a mismatch of
armor in a variety of materials, colours and styles.
Even when Vargr armor is purchased as a complete set,
it is likely to comprise many individual and disparate
pieces providing protection to different parts of the
body. Second-hand armor is likely to be completely
mismatched as a result of junk dealers piecing together
various components to make a set or the original owner
simply acquiring different pieces over time.

Vargr individuals wearing helmets are less able to exert
influence and charisma due to a significant amount of
expressions and body language being concealed under
the armor. For this reason, helmets are less common
than for other races, although they are required as part
of sealed suits.

Armor is as much an expression of a Vargr's personality
and achievements as it is for protection and is usually
customised by each individual with ornamentation and
personalised symbols. This is especially true of corsairs
and military personnel.

Armor Components
A number of standard components are used by Vargr as
building blocks for personalised armor or warrior sets
as they are collectively known.

TORSO ARMOR
Torso armor is generally rigid or semi-rigid. Those
who put together their own armor sets often make
use of standard pieces such as mesh, cloth or flak
jackets, obtained as per the Central Supply Catalogue
or Traveller Core Rulebook. A number of more
characteristically Vargr items are also available.

Shoulder Guards (Kforzonga): Traditional shoulder
guards provide minimal protection, restricted to the
bones and arteries running along the top of the torso.
They protect well against downward blows and might
stop a bullet. Some take the form of epaulettes, others
are shaped shoulder plates that extend over the very
top of the arm. Standard shoulder guards are of semi-
rigid ballistic materials while heavy guards are made of
metal/ceramic composites.

**Chest Guard (Dhinourraksa):** The traditional chest guard
is favored by those who need to move fast or engage
in complex tasks – it is popular with pilots and vehicle
crewmembers. It takes the form of an upper-torso and
shoulder guard, sometimes with a loose fringe covering
part of the abdomen.

**Breastplate (Dhinou):** A breastplate covers the whole
frontal torso with lightweight metal/ceramic armor but
offers no protection from the rear. There is a subtext
to someone wearing a Dhinou in combat; they trust
those behind them and are not inclined to turn their
unprotected backs to the enemy.

**Vest (Dhoukha):** The standard Vargr full-torso protection
consists of a back-and-breastplate unit. Each face
is usually a single unit shaped to deflect bullets and

blows. A heavy version, with thicker armor over the
vital organs and enhanced shoulder protection, as well
as a short 'skirt' of linked plates to protect the upper
legs, is available for those wanting additional protection.

Cloaks: Some torso protection (typically shoulder
guards but sometimes other items) incorporate a
cloak that is usually a waist-length decorative item.
However, a floor-length detachable cloak of fireproof
material can be added instead. This will absorb 20
points of fire or energy damage if the wearer wraps it
around themselves. After 20 points are taken the cloak
disintegrates and must be replaced.

Shoulder Guards +2 6 — 2 Cr50 None

Breastplate +4 8 — 4 Cr250 None
Vest +6 7 — 6 Cr500 None
Heavy Vest +8 9 — 8 Cr750 None
Fireproof Cape +20 (ablative)
against fire and
energy only

8 — 1 Cr250 None

**LIMB ARMOR**
Limb armor is usually light, to facilitate fast and agile
movement in combat. There are exceptions, however,
notably among Vargr who favor a head-on close combat
approach or those worried about floor-level threats. The
ability to crash right through a set of spiked foot traps
or even anti-personnel mines is useful when leading a
charge on foot – despite Vargr not feeling comfortable
with rigid footwear, they will tolerate it in combat if it
keeps their feet on the end of their legs.

**Bracers (Negdhazuk):** The commonest form of arm
protection is a set of lightweight polymer vambraces
covering the lower arm, with an elbow cup and a
flexible but lightly armored gauntlet. A heavier version
is available, offering greater protection at the cost of
additional weight. This variant is equivalent to the arm
guards found in riot armor.

**Arm Guards (Dzuesgogne):** A heavier full-arm guard is
available, consisting of metal/ceramic upper and lower
arm protectors linked by lighter flexible sections, with

an elbow cup and heavy gauntlets. Links to attach to
shoulder guards or a breastplate are normally included
when bought new. Arm guards are a bit clumsy and
impose DM-1 to all DEX-based checks when not fighting
or shooting.

Arm Shield: An arm shield, sometimes called an assault
shield, is a lightweight oval of polymer designed to
crumble and ablate rather than pass impact to the
user. An arm shield clips to an attachment on bracers
or arm guards and provides additional protection from
incoming fire for a short time. It provides Protection +6,
reduced by one for each damage dice rolled against the
user that comes up a 5 or 6. Eventually the shield will
be shot away or its remains can be discarded by the
user. The shield is big enough to cover the whole of the
wearer's front but makes it impossible to carry out tasks
requiring both hands.

Fighting Boots (Ogzkua): Fighting boots are the standard
light leg protection used by many Vargr. They cover the
foot and ankle, with rigid sections of hard polymer over
softer material.

LIMB ARMOR PROTECTION TL RAD KG COST REQUIRED SKILL
Bracers +1 7 — 1.5 Cr50 None
Heavy Bracers +2 8 — 2.5 Cr100 None
Arm Guards +3 8 — 4 Cr200 None

Fighting Boot +1 6 — 1.5 Cr100 None
Charging Boot +2 7 — 2 Cr150 None
Stomping Boot +3 8 — 4 Cr250 None

**Charging Boot (Dzouegon):** Charging boots are designed
to protect the whole lower leg and have additional
protection for the foot and ankle. Although heavier,
they are not significantly more encumbering than
fighting boots.

**Stomping Boot (Gvoderrsku):** Stomping boots are
designed for heavy assault work through obstacles or
anti-personnel minefields. A very heavy armored boot
covers the lower leg, with a flexible section above the
knee augmented by light plates on the front of the
thigh. Stomping boots reduce movement speed by one
meter and impose DM-1 on checks requiring delicate
placement of the feet.

**ARMOR SETS**
Although the exact design and composition of Vargr
armor tends to vary considerably, it is possible to buy a
complete set of armor that fits a general specification.
Parts may or may not match one another, depending
on their origin, and prices can also vary depending
upon the quality of the equipment, its age and who it
belonged to in the past. A beat-up piece of armor can
sometimes have quite a history to it and be worn with
pride by its owner.

**Fighter Set (Kforzhazuk):** The lightest fighter set is
favored by warriors who need to move fast but want
some protection. It consists of a set of shoulder guards
and light bracers, used by those who expect hand-to-
hand combat.

**Fighter Set (Kforzgong):** A variant on the fighter set, this
kit consists of a set of charging boots and light bracers,
is favored by scouts or those expecting to encounter
ground-level hazards.

**Leader-Fighter Set (Vhezkforz):** Consisting of a set of
shoulder guards fitted to a light ballistic cloth jacket,
with an additional fireproof cloak for gravitas and
protection, the fighter-leader set is favored by many
Vargr officers. Bracers or boots may be easily added.

Warrior Set (Zuurku-Azuk): The lightest of the warrior
sets, this loadout consists of an armored vest and
bracers. It is used, for the most part, by pilots and
vehicle crew.

Warrior Set (Zurrku-Ekdho): Consisting of a heavy vest
and bracers, this warrior set is favored by those who
move in and out of vehicles on a frequent basis and by
urban combat specialists.

Warrior Set (Zurrku-Oengga): Adding a set of fighting
boots and an arm shield to the Zurrku-Ekdho, this set
is favored by lightly equipped assault troops or whose
who prefer highly mobile hand-to hand combat.

Warrior-Leader Set (Vhezk-Zurrku): A heavy vest and
bracers attached to a suitably ostentatious lightly
armored jacket, this loadout is favored by those who
hope to lead others in the thickest of the fight

Assault Set (Kungedz-Udhvarr): Although intended for
the assault role, the Kungedz-Udhvarr is very light and
has no chest protection. It consists of separate pieces:
shoulder guards, charging boots, a light bracer on the
primary hand and a heavy arm guard on the secondary,
with an attached arm shield.

Assault Set (Kungedz-Dhagu): A breastplate attached to a
heavy ballistic cloth coverall, with bracers and charging
boots, this is a standard loadout for combat troops
expecting to fight in a linear environment, such as a
starship or spaceport.

Heavy Assault Set (Kungedz-Verz): A heavy armored
vest, stomping boots and arm guards all permanently
attached to a fireproof heavy ballistic coverall, this
assault set is used by many Vargr combat troops who
cannot get away with swapping components to create
something a bit more dashing.

All standard options listed on page 96 of the _Traveller

Catalogue_ can be used with Vargr armor. Modifications
of Vargr origin are listed here and although other races
can acquire them, some will grant only Vargr Travellers
their full benefits.

**Audio Filter:** Usually fitted into helmets, the filter also
comes as a pair of earpieces. These devices filter all
incoming audio to prevent very loud and high frequency
sounds from damaging or disorienting the wearer. A
Traveller wearing an audio filter gains DM+4 to their
END check against sonic-based attacks.

MODIFICATION TL KG COST

AUGMENTS
Vargr opinion on the use of augments varies
considerably throughout the Extents. Those of a
religious nature tend to frown on Vargr augmentation,
firm in the belief that the Vargr have already attained
perfection or that it is blasphemous to alter the physical
form given to them by the Ancients.

However, there are still many cultures that see the
benefits of genetic and surgical alteration. The most
notable applications are the physical and combat skill
augments used by corsairs and the military. Intelligence
and related augments see little use in Vargr society.

All augments listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook can be
used by Vargr characters but availability depends on the
type of augment required at the Referee's discretion.

Aural Filter: This works much like the audio filter
option fitted to armor to prevent loud and high
frequency sounds from harming the Traveller. A
Traveller with an aural filter gains a DM+6 to END
checks against sonic weaponry.

MODIFICATION TL KG COST
Aural Filter 12 — Cr15000

Tail Enhancement: The bones and muscles of the tail are
enhanced to increase its strength and dexterity, allowing
it to make an unarmed attack for 1D damage. Attacking
with the tail still uses a significant action but the rarity
of this augment will surprise most opponents (especially
non-Vargr), making them unable to dodge or parry the
blow in the first round.

MODIFICATION TL KG COST
Tail Enhancement 10 — Cr3000

Urzaeng Modification: This augment evolved in the
Urzaeng region by Vargr with a desire to fit in and
become more like their Urzaeng brethren, although
other Vargr are attracted by this augment simply to be
more of a physical match for Urzaeng in combat. Many
worlds have outlawed this modification for a variety of
reasons, usually on religious grounds.

The procedure for Urzaeng modification is long (D3
months) and painful, requiring a combination of
genetic manipulation and surgery. Travellers with
this augment gain the following modifications: STR
+1, END +1 and INT –1. The Traveller's body also
increases in size, gaining 2D+6 centimeters in height
and 1D+4 kg in weight.

MODIFICATION TL KG COST
Urzaeng Modification 13 — Cr75000

ROBOTS AND DRONES
Robots and drones are not as popular among the Vargr as with most other races. This is mainly because of the
importance of charisma in Vargr society; a robot has no place within a pack as it has no charisma. For this reason,
someone in charge of robots does not gain the same charisma and respect as someone who commands other Vargr.
Combat robots are also rare as sending machines to fight instead of Vargr shows weakness of not just the leader but
the entire pack.

However, robots are used in some commercial arenas such as factories, construction, hostile environments and as
drivers or pilots for non-essential work. Robots are also used in an advisory capacity but Vargr will only consult such
robots in private to avoid losing the respect of their subordinates.

As a science, Vargr robotics is not particularly advanced due to the social implications of using robots or simply
being involved in the robotics industry. As such, Vargr robots tend to be overpriced, badly engineered and with low
intelligence. The poor quality of Vargr robotics has led to thriving criminal enterprises that steal robots from other
races, particularly the Imperium.

A11/58231 TASKBOT
This general purpose robot is one of the most advanced
robots of Vargr design. A broad skill set is included with
this robot allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks. The
taskbot is humanoid in appearance with a head design based

WEAPONS
The Vargr have a wide variety of weapons and the most common are described here. Vargr versions of human
weapons also exist, differing in form but not function; Vargr characters are free to use any of the standard weapons
listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

A11/58231 CLAW FIST
A spiked fist weapon that fits over the hand, is designed to
look like claws and is a good example of the types of weapon
favored by corsairs for both practical and aesthetic purposes.
It is a very effective close combat weapon but the claw fist
must be strapped firmly to the hand and takes D3 rounds to
attach or remove. The wearer also suffers DM-2 to any task
that requires the use of their hand (not including combat).
The claw fist can be used with the Melee (infighting) or Melee
(unarmed) skill.

Weapon TL Range Damage Kg Cost Traits
Claw Fist 3 Melee 4D 3 Cr250 AP 5

New Weapon Trait: Sonic (–X)
During the pre-stellar era on Lair, opposing Vargr
factions began experimenting with sonic weaponry
to both stun and disorient the enemy on the
battlefield using ultra high frequency sounds.

Anyone hit by a Sonic must make an END check
with a DM equal to the Sonic score; if successful,
the target is unaffected. However, if the target
fails, for the next 1D rounds they will suffer a DM
equal to the Effect of the END check to all actions.

Sonic weapons can only work where there is
atmosphere and are more effective on the acute
hearing of the Vargr – the effect lasts for an
additional two rounds when effecting a Vargr.

**A11/58231 SONIC PISTOL**

The sonic pistol emits focussed, directed sound waves at its
targets. Although extremely painful, the effects are ultimately
non-lethal and the sonic pistol has found its way into the
arsenal of law enforcement on some worlds.

**SONIC RIFLE**
More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle can easily affect
two or more targets in close proximity and unleashes far more
powerful sound waves. In assaults, the rifle is often used to
supress enemies while other units move in to engage them in
close combat.

TRAITS

Most Vargr vehicles are much like their human counterparts in ability and function but the aesthetics of the Vargr
lead to much more decorative and elaborate features, with a variety of fins, spines and bright colours that look garish
and tasteless to humans. Many vehicles also comprise a mismatch of components scavenged from various sources.
Markings are often painted on vehicles to indicate race wins or, in the case of military vehicles, kills or pack insignia.

**VEHICLES OF THE VARGR**

**CHAPTER-FIFTEEN**

Vargr might not share the same taste in
design as humans but both share a love
of speed and grav racing. Unlike human
grav racers, Vargr designs incorporate a
passenger or co-pilot seat; such is their
need for companionship they like to share
the racing experience with their brethren.
The racer can be driven alone but the co-
pilot usually serves as navigator so as to
have more participation in the race.

The Loper is a large but reasonably priced
vehicle suitable for both Travellers and
explorers, that is both sturdy and reliable. It is
large enough to carry a small Vargr pack, with
cargo, to and from their destination in hostile
environments and relative safety.

##### HIGH GUARD: VARGR

**CHAPTER-SIXTEEN**

There are several customs and important facts to
consider when travelling onboard Vargr ships and within
the Vargr Extents.

Passage Types
Passage on Vargr ships has the same three categories
as on human vessels: low, basic, middle and high
passage. Travellers can be 'bumped' from a berth by
another passenger with higher CHA, regardless of the
class of ticket they have. This often has a chain effect of
bumped passengers consequently bumping others else
with lower CHA.

The Low Lottery: This custom is practiced by some Vargr
captains but not by others. To determine if a ship's
captain runs a lottery, roll 1D; on a 1–4 they not, a roll
of 5–6 they do.

The Traveller's Aid Society: There is no Vargr institution
comparable to the TAS that covers the Vargr Extents in
its entirety but smaller organizations do exist that offer
similar services on a smaller scale. They vary in size,
standards and services on offer.

Borders: Vargr do not recognize borders and territories.
Established borders are an abstract concept to most
Vargr, especially corsair raiders who will think nothing
of crossing borders to raid a ship, whether it is a border
between Vargr governments or alien worlds.

Piracy: Piracy, hijacking, raiding and similar crimes are
more frequent in Vargr space than in the Imperium. Roll
on the Corsair Encounters table once per trip using the
Encounter Modifiers table (modifiers are cumulative
and applied to the 'tens' dice only) to determine
what vessels are encountered. If a corsair band is
encountered, use the Encounter Distance table on page
79 of the Traveller Core Rulebook to determine the
range of the vessels.

94–96 Two Corsairs and two Scouts
101–103 Two Corsairs and 1D Scouts
104–106 1D Corsairs and 1D Scouts

CREWS
The Vargr pack mentality onboard a spacecraft is more
significant than any other environment. The long periods
of time spent in a confined space rely on pack dynamics
for Vargr to function effectively as a crew. Although the
typical infighting and power struggles are as prominent
here as anywhere else, the camaraderie of the crew is
essential to its success – mutinies are rare unless the
leader constantly fails in his duties.

The hierarchies and dynamics of the pack are also more
varied onboard starships. As with all packs, there is
always a leader but an individual's CHA rises and falls
depend on how important their role is perceived by
the rest of the crew. Priorities can change according to
events; for example, medics might not be considered
particularly important until the crew become dependent
on them for survival.

Large crews are often made up of several packs divided
by roles such as flight crew, engineers and gunners.
Marines and other fighting crewmen are also grouped
into their own packs. Corsair crews differ slightly in that
the captain usually leads the boarding unit in addition
to commanding the ship.

AAKUM HEAVY FIGHTER

The Aakum is the most common fighter
craft used by Vargr military organizations
and it appears in many corsair bands. It
is fast enough and tough enough to battle
other fighters, while carrying enough
firepower to assault larger vessels with
some effectiveness.

AETIN SCOUT

Using a 100-ton hull, the Aetin scout is
primarily used by the navy and corsair
bands for reconnaissance and ground
support duties but also lone prospectors
and explorers. Much like its Imperial
counterpart, the Aetin scout is a common
sight in the Extents and therefore easy to
maintain and repair.

The Aetin scout only requires a crew of
one pilot but a gunner is carried as well
if weapons are mounted in the standard
double turret. Two additional crew or
personnel can be carried with double
occupancy if required.

This interstellar trading vessel is built on a

Vargr Extents. Like most Vargr ships, the
Koerae is armored to provide protection

keep the Koerae safe in pitched battle, the
thin armor is deemed enough to buy time
to escape an attacker.

normal crew consists of a pilot, navigator,
engineer and medic, although some multi-

AKALVO YACHT

The Akalvo is a luxury pleasure craft – but
most certainly built for Vargr. Built for
speed as much as comfort, the interior is
a riot of colour and trimmings, pitched
perfectly to awe lesser Vargr. To the eyes of
other races, however, it appears the height
of vulgarity. Akalvo yachts are sold directly

RUGUELKA CORSAIR

Using a small but potent 400-ton hull, the
Ruguelka is the raiding vessel of choice
for most corsair bands. It is a common
sight in Vargr space and one feared by
many Travellers. Extremely fast, it is hard
to escape from once an intercept course
has been set and it can carry a substantial
boarding party.

AEROUNKHU PACKET

This merchant vessel is designed to
transport both passengers and cargo, and
is well armed to defend against would-be
raiders. The Aerounkhu is primarily used
as a passenger liner with the cargo space
allocated to luggage storage and supplies.

The Aerounkhu typically has a standard crew
of eight, with many of the crew also serving
as gunners in the event of corsair attack.

LEKLUN CORVETTE

Using an 800-ton hull, the Leklun is
commonly used by Vargr military forces
for patrols and fighting corsair raiders.
Some variants sacrifice the fighters for a
G/Carrier, allowing a larger complement of
troops to be deployed in a single action.
While the smallest of true warships, the
Leklun is nonetheless potent enough
against raider vessels and when combined
into squadrons, the corvette can cause
problems for larger ships.

# THE ZHODANI

**CHAPTER-SEVENTEEN**

The Six Major Races are considered to be the Aslan,
Droyne, Hivers, K'kree, Vargr and Humaniti (merging
the Vilani, Solomani and Zhodani branches of the
human race into one). However, the Solomani and Vilani
branches would prefer to forget their Zhodani brethren
exist, as they have built their empire upon the science of
the mind. In a universe where science has finally given
all the ability to seek their maximum potential – to know
what pursuit can allow a person to unlock all he can be

- the Vilani and Solomani would prefer to not know.

The Zhodani found themselves on a world they did not
come from and experienced repeated disasters to forge
an interstellar empire. Along the way they have explored
a path 5,000 parsecs coreward from their homeworld,
drawn by an Ancient artefact to seek what lies at the
end. Because of the fear the Vilani and Solomani have
of psionics, the Zhodani and the Imperium have fought
four wars and a fifth seems imminent.

BIRTH OF

THE ZHODANI
Humans evolved on Terra – it therefore came as a great
shock for explorers from Earth to travel to the stars only
to find other humans not only there already but ruling
vast empires such as the First Imperium. It took many
centuries to establish that all the races of Humaniti
originated on Terra and were spread to worlds across
charted space some 300,000 years before by the
mysterious Ancients.

Of all these far-flung races of Humaniti, only three
developed jump drive technology on their own: the Vilani
of the First Imperium, the Solomani of Earth and the
Zhodani. By Imperial standards, the Zhodani are the
most alien.

The Zhodani have the longest unbroken stretch of
interstellar civilization of any branch of Humaniti. Unlike
the Solomani and Vilani, they did not experience a
Long Night. However, they suffered their own tragedies,
having faced near-extermination in their pre-history,
overcoming that to achieve space flight, thrown back
to another dark age, only to rise again with a unique
civilization based around the power of the mind.

Even before they reached into space, the Zhodani
developed the science of psionics and integrated it into
their society. The result was a culture in which people
act, and also think, in a different way – and one that
possessed radically different values than those of the
Solomani and Vilani-dominated Third Imperium.

PHYSIOLOGY
While human in all respects, the Zhodani differ slightly
in appearance from those of Solomani or Vilani ancestry.
They tend to be tall and lithe, averaging close to two
meters in height and massing roughly 90 kilograms.
Complexions are predominantly swarthy and hair colour
usually black or brown. Blond hair is uncommon but a
mutation that occurred on Zhdant in the last 10,000
years made prematurely grey hair twice as common as
red hair.

Zhodani have 28 relatively large teeth in contrast to
the 32 possessed by Solomani and Vilani. This is not
especially noticeable but does mean a brief dental
examination can identify Zhodani (unless they have been
surgically disguised for operations within the Imperium).

All physiological characteristics of Zhodani are the result
of two factors; the original gene pool of humans who first
inhabited Zhdant and minor mutations or developments
that took place during the 300,000 years they lived on
their new homeworld. Their height and physical build are
both consequences of Zhdant's 0.85 g surface gravity.

An evolutionary adaptation allows Zhodani to digest
certain proteins native to Zhdant, which are indigestible
by off-world humans; eating them may result in
digestive problems, allergic reactions or food poisoning.
Restaurants in regions frequented by non-Zhodani
humans (such as starports on the Zhodani-Imperial
border) have menus that mark which foods are or are
not appropriate for non-Zhodani. Likewise, caterers
at official diplomatic receptions will be aware of the
problem. Travellers eating elsewhere in the Consulate
should exercise caution.

SOCIETY
The fact that psionics make up a major part of everyday
life within the Consulate has had a profound influence
on the mental and emotional makeup of its people.
While they are human, their way of looking at life is
quite different from most non-psionic human cultures.
It has been said that psionics have made the Zhodani
Consulate government the most effective, powerful
and absolute tyranny in human history – and also the
happiest and most stable state to live in. Both of these
statements may be true.

In contrast to the patchwork quilt of planetary societies
making up the Third Imperium (whose techno-feudalism
is an overlay that affects interstellar politics but rarely
daily life), the worlds of the Consulate possess a
homogenous society that, despite minor variations for
local conditions, is essentially the same from planet-to-
planet across its expanse.

Zhodani society is divided into three hereditary groups.

Nobles perform all elective governmental functions. They
are the only inhabitants of the Consulate allowed to vote
and be elected to office. Not all Nobles work in government

- some have senior military positions, manage large
hereditary estates or engage in artistic pursuits. Nearly 6%
of the Zhodani population are Nobles.

Intendants are the psi-trained middle class. They include
most bureaucrats, business and project managers,
merchant captains and officers, teachers, psychologists
and doctors, police and journalists (although some
Nobles may also be found in these positions). Many
serve as psionic troops (technically 'commissioned
specialists') or military officers. Intendants also act as
personal aides to individual Nobles. They make up about
15% of the population.

Proles are the commoners of Zhodani society and
the largest social class. Proles include farmers and
factory workers, supervisory and junior managers, small
business owners and shopkeepers, enlisted soldiers
and starship crews, scientists and technicians, and
common labourers. Just over 79% of the Zhodani
population are Proles.

There is a huge gulf between the lower-class Proles
and higher-class Intendants and Nobles. That divide
lies in psionics: possession and use of psionic abilities
define the upper classes. Nobles and Intendants
receive training in psionics from childhood. Only a high
degree of talent allows movement from the Prole to
Intendant class; when a Prole child is tested and found
to have high psionic strength, they are adopted into
an Intendant family and raised as an Intendant. Note
that children of Intendants and Nobles who have a low
degree of talent still receive psionic training and inherit
their parents' social status. Similarly, Intendants and
Nobles who suffer a permanent loss of talent (such as
from an accident) do not lose their standing.

The Zhodani have been sexually egalitarian since
their dark ages, largely because of the emphasis
on mental rather than physical strength. Marriage
between different classes is illegal; liaisons do occur
but (especially between Prole and Noble) are socially
disapproved of.

SPIRITUALISM AND

PHILOSOPHY
The Zhodani do not have religion for they do not
acknowledge, let alone worship, any sort of supreme
being, nor do they believe in an afterlife in any
conventional sense. Instead, they have what some
Imperial academics have termed a vaguely Buddhist/
vaguely 'green' philosophy. Tavrziansh (Morality's Path)
is taught in schools as fact and endorsed by the state
as a component of 'proper thought'. It is governed
by a small organization, academic and secular, the
Fevranzhtavrchedl' (Guardians of the Book), which every
50 years or so releases a slightly modified version of the
Fevranzhtavr (the Book of Morality).

Morality's Path holds that life is a matter of duty. Duty
arose with life; even the humblest creatures have and
perform their duty, in an unconscious 'state of grace'.
Nevertheless, even unintelligent life can fail in its
duty. A plague of rodents, philosophically, indicates
the rodents have forgotten their place and corrective
measures would be justified.

With intelligence comes the ability to understand
one's duty to all life and most especially to one's
own people. Duty to race takes priority over all other
duties but it is most praiseworthy to keep one's duties
from coming into conflict. Zhodani can contemplate
war, even genocide, to protect their people but they
follow Morality's Path better if they protect other life,
especially intelligent life, as well.

Duty is also the watchword of the individual. Everyone
understands that they have a duty to the race; Proles do
their duty in one way, Intendants and Nobles in another.
Part of this duty is to recognize the duties of others and
work to harmonise yours with theirs.

Death, to the Zhodani, is not a complete ending. The
evil (that is, failure of duty) of the individual spirit will
be lost. The good of the spirit will merge for a time with
the universal energy field, the Tavrian, and then return
to another Zhodani. The more dutiful the spirit, the more
personality (and possibly even memory) will remain; this
resembles reincarnation. An undutiful spirit diminishes
in proportion to its failures. However, actual demotion
on the 'chain of being' is rare. It would be a very bad
Noble who returned as a Prole and a very bad Prole who
returned as, for instance, an Imperial or rodent.

Dutiful spirits advance. Merit in Morality's Path, is tied
with psionic power, at least as far as Zhodani spirits are
concerned (Morality's Path recognizes spirits and duty

of other races but has little to say about them). When
a Prole displays psionic power, it means they showed
great devotion to duty in their previous cycles and now
receives greater duties as a reward. Interestingly, this
is also a sign of past devotion in the family of such a
Prole. Witnessing and participating in the elevation of
a spirit is a sign that the parents themselves are also
worthy; by performing their duty to their talented child,
they confirm their worthiness. In some later cycle, their
spirits will rise as well.

The spread of psionic training in the Consulate, and
gradual increase in the proportion of Nobles and
Intendants, proves the Consulate as a whole is behaving
well and that the Zhodani as a whole are performing
their duty to all life.

Imperial scholars and political scientists feel certain
that Morality's Path and its brief holy book, the Book
of Morality, were not organic developments of Zhodani
belief. Later versions of the book do not reflect
development of philosophy but rather a more skilled
presentation of the underlying message: 'Conform, be
good and you might be a Noble someday.'

CUSTOMS
Zhodani society's acceptance and use of psionics
strongly influences the way they think. It differs from
that of the average Imperial citizen in many respects.

Extensive psionic ability among the ruling classes
has permitted the Zhodani to weed out criminal
personalities and potential subversives early in life and
re-educate them as useful members of society. Thus,
there has been practically no serious crime or dissent
for thousands of years. One of the foremost values
(which Imperial humans notice most quickly) is the
fundamental honesty that pervades everything. Walls
protect from the elements rather than from intruders.
Locks are rare and most are safety devices to protect
children rather than anti-theft precautions. Laws deal
more with appropriate action than actual crime.

At first glance, the idea of negotiation, or bargaining, in
a psionic society appears impossible. Looking deeper
shows the practice is alive and well. Bargaining occurs
when market pressures produce varying prices for goods
and each side in the encounter tries to obtain the most
advantageous price for the transaction.

Negotiators with psionics might be able to read the mind
of their opponent, determine the worst acceptable offer
and then offer that. Obviously, a psionic negotiator has
a tremendous advantage but this model is simplistic. A

Zhodani does not approach a negotiation with thoughts
of 'what can I get out of this deal' but rather 'what do
I believe my work is truly worth' or 'what do I believe I
deserve for my labour and skill'. Anyone reading those
thoughts may still disagree and negotiate but there is no
dishonesty in the process.

In any case, Zhodani view the use of psionics in such a
situation as unfair, much like reading a teacher's mind
for answers to test questions.

Regard for social superiors is a natural part of Zhodani
society, ingrained into everyone. Of course, for true
respect to persist, Nobles must earn it. Many do so in
a roundabout way – their Intendants make sure they
receive credit for a great many worthy activities. It is in
the best interest of an Intendant to make their superior
Noble look good because that Noble is responsible for
their promotion and advancement.

Zhodani are largely conformists. Everyone knows the
relatively narrow band of activities that all members of
society understand and approve of, and everyone strives
to act within that range. This extends to many areas of
culture. Even the range of acceptable dress (while wide)
is rarely exceeded. Interests rarely involve strange or
unsuitable subjects. Too much deviation from the norm
is considered an aberration and subject to re-education.

While Nobles have more freedom of thought than Proles,
they are still subject to human failings. Eccentric
Nobles, while rare, can and do still appear. Noble
children are subject to careful psionic supervision when
they are babies and pre-adolescents, so by the time
they are proficient enough to possess mind-shields
(usually as early adolescents) and have earned the right
to mental privacy, they have been thoroughly integrated
into Zhodani cultural mores.

Zhodani feel uncomfortable outside the Consulate,
where 'liars and thieves are allowed to wander' and
fundamental values of Zhodani society are not enforced.
Moreover, as Zhodani lack racial diversity, the average
Zhodani has had little experience with other types of
Humaniti, who appear strange or unusual to their eyes.
These two impressions tend to mingle, resulting in an
instinctive distrust of anyone with non-Zhodani features.

PROLES
The aspirations of the Proles are generally limited to
economic and personal goals – to succeed at whatever
they do and thus win financial security and personal
satisfaction. While many individuals are content to
do their jobs and enjoy happy lives, Proles with more

ambition may seek to excel within a discipline, be it
as an artist, athlete, scientist, explorer or whatever.
Alternatively, they may seek economic success,
perhaps using earnings to open a small business or
working hard to impress superiors to win promotion and
higher salaries.

However, this ambition has a definite ceiling: Proles
working within an organization can attain junior
management, supervisory or non-commissioned officer
(NCO) positions that involve supervising other Proles
but they will never rise to policy-making, executive,
command or commissioned officer posts.

As such, the social ambition of Proles is sublimated into
ambition for their children – hopes that they (or their
grandchildren) will have great enough psionic power to
warrant training and elevation into the Intendant class.

INTENDANTS
As with Proles, an Intendant's childhood education
will result from natural aptitudes being identified
and trained for a suitable and necessary career.
Additionally, psionic training is an important part of an
Intendant's education.

After their studies (which may include education at
a local or off-world university or college), records will
be sent to those Nobles or public- and private-sector
organizations that express a need for new Intendants
with that career path. Usually, an Intendant will have
already made such contacts during their studies and
there will be a job waiting. Often, there will be a
number of choices, some of which may require travel
and interviews. Because the Intendant's education is
geared toward the career, there is rarely any difficulty
finding a position.

Each Noble has one Intendant specifically assigned to
them; this direct relationship provides the Noble with
a capable secretary and assistant. Such positions are
avidly sought after by ambitious Intendants since much
of the fame and power of a strong Noble rubs off on
their personal Intendant.

Other Intendants take positions within corporations or
institutes, the military, professions that require psionics
(including psychologists, sociologists and teachers) or
as secondary personal assistants with specific duties or
assignments for Nobles. The remainder of the Intendant
population works for the generalised bureaucracy that
allows the Consulate government to function.

Intendant ambition centres on elevation to the Noble
class. One method is through participation in the
Thequzdievl, the Psionic Games (see page 254), which
brings psionically powerful individuals to the Noble
class; perhaps 10% of Intendants are elevated to the
Nobility in this way. Another is as a reward for faithful
service; another 10% of Intendants achieve this, usually
near the end of their careers. Some Intendants strive for
such rewards, while others are reasonably happy with
their existing place in society.

NOBLES
Nobles have more freedom to shape their own destiny
than Intendants. From childhood, their education has
a focus on psionic training and fostering proper social
attitudes, with a more generalised 'classical' education
on leadership, psychology and personnel management.

From the Noble's perspective, the most important skill
is to be a good manager, to know which Intendants are
doing a good job and which are simply time-servers,
and how to motivate them. Since Intendants are also
psionically trained (and thus, in many cases, their minds
cannot be casually read), motivating them requires more
skill than dealing with Proles whose thoughts are an
open book.

There are several ranks of Nobility in Zhodani society.
These do not come with hereditary government positions
(which are elective) but correlate with the influence (and
often wealth and estates) of a family. A member of the
higher ranks of the Nobility will be expected to live up to
his title; if they do so, they can benefit from its prestige
and the social connections that come with it to rise far
more rapidly through the military or be elected more
easily to higher office.

LAW
The character of crime in the Consulate is markedly
different from that of other societies. Responsibility
for law enforcement is maintained by the Tavrchedl'
(the Thought Police), who are as much concerned with
mental health as actual deeds.

Three broad categories of crime are recognized among
the Zhodani: inadvertent, incited and insane offenses.
The concept of premeditated crime for personal gain is
considered insane.

**Inadvertent crime** is an unintentional violation or
infraction of the law, usually resulting from inattention
or distraction. Examples include accidental violations
of traffic or other regulations, failure to return borrowed
materials to a lender or forgetting an appointment with

a Noble. For minor cases, the punishment is a small
fine, to compensate society and encourage the offender
to be more thoughtful in the future. If significant
damage or injury resulted, recompense to society can be
substantial and extreme cases may be taken as evidence
of wilful negligence requiring re-education, although
such are rare.

Incited crime is an infraction of a law brought about
by another. Often it results from an overreaction by an
individual to an inadvertent crime or misfortune. For
example, if someone responds violently to a perceived
insult or injustice, this in an incited crime; Zhodani
recognize that people can perform wrong actions out of
anger or despair. This mitigates wrongdoing, if the crime
is not unduly disproportionate to the situation but does
not excuse it. The solution is re-education – often, the
incited individual is seen as weak-willed or vulnerable
because of a character flaw or subconscious fault. Re-
education uses psychological and psionic techniques to
remedy this flaw, retraining the individual to recognize
similar provocations and avoid or properly handle them.
Sometimes, the investigation of an incited crime will
turn up an actual injustice: which will also be dealt with
in as fair a manner as possible.

Those who have been outside the Consulate and have
trouble behaving and thinking in a proper way when they
return sometimes fall into this category.

Insane crime covers most major crimes against property or
individuals, including theft, rape, premeditated assault,
treason and murder. Zhodani believe that any individual
who commits such a crime must be insane and sentences
for insane crimes call for re-education until the insanity
is cured. Sometimes the offender's personality must
be rebuilt and, in rare instances, an execution will be
ordered if the individual appears incurable.

Note that someone caught thinking about performing
a crime may be arrested and judged guilty if mental
examination shows there was serious intent to commit
the actual deed.

JUSTICE
Technically, all Nobles are empowered to sit in judgment
of any accused criminal. In practice, Nobles not trained
in telepathy are expected to defer judgment until a
telepath can be found.

Cases are presided over by a Noble consul from the
community council of the area where the crime was
committed. If there are multiple Nobles on a council

with telepathic abilities, the case will go to whichever
Noble is not otherwise occupied. Some councils rotate
judicial duties among themselves; others have a few
Nobles that specialize in them. If a region, facility
or ship is under military control, a Noble officer will
handle the case.

Procedures are informal, the Noble listens to the
case and considers the facts presented. In a dispute
between two parties, the Noble will hear both sides and
additional facts are gathered by reading the minds of
those involved. If necessary, the Noble may dispatch
Thought Police investigators to locate evidence,
suspects or additional witnesses. A judgment is made
and the decision recorded, usually sent telepathically to
an Intendant clerk in the local records center.

Crimes committed by Nobles and Intendants are
treated as special cases, since a Noble of higher rank
than the accused must judge them. Inadvertent crimes
are handled with a warning or admonition; repeated
errors might also result in the Noble or Intendant being
dismissed from their present job or losing hope of
further promotion.

Nobles are believed, under the law, to be incapable
of incited crimes. Insane crimes reflect a breakdown
in a Noble's personality (portrayed to Proles as the
result of overwork and demands of responsibility).
Minor violations may be let off with a warning and
usually a short or lengthy enforced vacation from work:
major crimes call for re-education. For the good of all,
a convicted Noble is usually transferred to another
location or world after re-education. Intendants are also
re-educated but usually revert to Proles and have mental
blocks placed in their minds to make them forget how to
use their psionic talents.

**Re-education**
The cure for any aberrant behaviour is re-education.
Psionics has made this extremely efficient and studies
confirmed which educational techniques worked and how
efficiently, allowing academics to plan lessons with and
create examinations that confirm success. Psychologists
and mental health professionals study the mind and
develop mood and behaviour-altering techniques with
levels of effectiveness unheard of elsewhere.

The result is excellent diagnosis and careful treatment
in re-education centres. While duration of treatment
will vary depending on the patient and complexity of
the issues, when treatment is completed the individual
re-joins society without stigma or blot. Re-education is
viewed by Zhodani like a period of recovery from illness.

Proles
It is important to remember that Proles are not citizens.
They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Consulate, as
manifested through the local government council in the
region they reside or, in the case of individuals working
directly for a consular agency (such as the military), that
organization's hierarchy.

Proles are not serfs owned by a Noble family but are
considered dependents of the Consulate as a whole. If a
Prole wishes to change job and move to another town or
planet, and can afford to pay for moving and transport,
they still require permission of the local council. In
practice, all this means is letting the council office know
they are moving and explaining why to an Intendant
bureaucrat. If they have a good reason to do so, such as
an opportunity for a new, better-paying job or a region
whose schools better suit the aptitudes of their children,
the request will be routinely approved. If the decision
seems frivolous, or not in the Prole's own best interest,
the council may not grant it and the Thought Police will
inquire into their mental health – why are they unhappy
enough to want to change their job and move to a
different location?

This is an important fact to remember; all of a Prole's
major decisions are subject to the scrutiny of the
Thought Police and upper classes (or superior officers,
if the Prole is in the military). If their actions seem ill
considered or unhealthy, the government may intervene
for the Prole's own good.

Intendants and Nobles
Privacy of thought is highly respected by Intendants and
Nobles as their greatest freedom; Proles have no such
rights. Nobles have an almost complete right of privacy
and Intendants nearly as much; in either case, it can
only be breached if there is suspicion (in the case of an
Intendant) or clear proof (for a Noble) that the individual
is guilty of aberrant thought.

In other ways, Intendants have less freedom than Proles
do. Membership of this class carries a precondition
of service: Intendants are expected to be engaged in
socially acceptable work under the close supervision
of the Nobility. Soon after reaching adulthood an
Intendant will select a career path and generally remain
in that career until either retirement (with pension) or
successful promotion to the Nobility. Retired Intendants
have somewhat more freedom and usually end up
raising a family, taking up travel or becoming involved in
hobbies or personal business pursuits.

Nobles are, to a large degree, as free as any Imperial
citizen. They have the right to vote or hold office and
are free to travel and do as they wish, provided they
obey Consular laws. Those who choose to enter military
service or join a government agency will, of course, be
expected to obey their superior officers.

ART
Artists have an important role in Zhodani society.
Zhodani fine arts are much the same as those in the
Imperium: painting, music, sculpture, theatre and literary
endeavors all thrive. The Zhodani have one significant
difference in the practice of their art, however.

An artist with telepathy soon learns what provokes a
response. For example, a Zhodani artist learns exactly
what mural to put in a dental waiting room to calm
nervous patients. They know what effects specific
colours have on viewers and can achieve exact (and
sometimes subliminal) results through their artwork.

Because of the conformist nature of Zhodani society,
most Zhodani art seems limited and unimaginative
by Imperial standards. Zhodani artists are not placed
under any legal restrictions or censorship, however. They
simply know what is acceptable to society as a whole
and remain within those limits voluntarily. Zhodani
artists do not feel compelled to stretch the limits of their
expression, as do many Imperial artists, and argue that
their creativity is not stunted by the restrictions they
work under.

DRESS
The most distinctive elements of Zhodani dress are the
turbans and cloaks worn by the Nobility, along with the
stylish beards male Nobles favor and the headbands
worn by Intendants. However, there is much more to
Zhodani dress than this.

In work roles, Zhodani wear practical clothing to fit their
station and responsibilities. At other times, Zhodani
prefer comfortable, loose clothing (often trousers
and tunics), generally made of lighter fabrics. During
appropriate holidays, Proles can wear quite outlandish
colours and clothes but the Nobility tend to be more
restrained. Noble fashion is intended to provoke a
response of respect and deference, and no Noble would
ever go out in public in anything less.

ROBOTICS
Almost every industrialised race uses robots in their
factories but the vast majority are nothing more than
reprogrammable machine tools that remain fixed in

place. Zhodani use industrial robots but also mobile
robots to a much greater degree than other major races
outside of the Hivers.

The fact that robots do not have minds that can be
communicated with through ordinary telepathy means
that Zhodani do not try to anthropomorphise robots
to the same degree as the Imperium. An Intendant or
Noble need only to try to touch a robot's mind to know
it is not 'alive' or see inside the machine's body with
ESP to reveal its workings. Nor, in closely monitored
Zhodani society, are the fears and prejudices other
races have about a 'robot revolt' or 'android doubles'
likely to occur – at least, not without swift treatment by
the Thought Police.

Lacking biases that limit the use of mobile robots in
the Imperium, it is not surprising that Zhodani make a
greater use of them. However, the Zhodani preference
for psionics has slowed the development of advanced
Artificial Intelligence; instead, Zhodani robots are
designed to receive orders from both computer inputs
and psionically. As a result, they do require no great
intellect. The role of robots in Zhodani society is simple;
machines do repetitious or dangerous jobs, freeing
Zhodani for safer or more rewarding pursuits.

THE MILITARY
Although they do not consider themselves a warrior
people, the Zhodani do have a lengthy military tradition.
There are three major services: the Navy, Army and
Consular Guard.

In the Zhodani military, Intendants and Nobles cannot
hold enlisted rank. The lowest rank held by either is
that of commissioned specialist, roughly equivalent
to the lowest officer grades in the Imperial military.
Commissioned specialists are officers by virtue of their
psionic training, however, and although they hold officer-
equivalent rank, they are not in the chain of command
and do not give orders (an equivalent in the Imperial
military is that of doctor, who holds a commission
and officer-equivalent rank but is not in the chain of
command). In addition, some positions require both a
specific psionic talent and command responsibilities,
such as the commander of a commando groupment.

Technicians, drivers, gunners, non-commissioned officers
(NCOs) and so on are Proles. The Zhodani have also long
used mobile robots as part of their armed forces.

NAVAL

ORGANISATION
The Consulate Navy carries out two principle duties:
exploration and maintenance of the status quo.
Exploration is driven by several long-range missions in the
direction of the galactic core and the Navy also engages
in scientific research and short-range survey operations
closer to home, coordinating private and corporate
research operations to cover gaps in its activities.

To maintain the status quo, the Consulate has
developed a defensive perspective that accepts the
need for pre-emptive strikes to shape the thinking of
neighboring states or remove a prospective threat.

The Consular Navy is tasked with obtaining space
superiority during war, besieging enemy worlds and
protecting interstellar trade routes within the Zhodani
Consulate. It is mainly equipped at TL12–14 but a
small number of TL15 ships have been produced
since the Fourth Frontier War. The Consular Navy is
organised into eight provincial fleets, one per province,
and in peacetime is nominally managed by provincial
councils. Zhodani squadrons tend to follow a similar
organization to that of the Imperium, with frontier
systems defended by squadrons of battleships and
cruisers and battle rider squadrons held back in reserve
fleets within the Consulate.

The biggest difference between the Consular and
Imperial Navy is that a good percentage of the former's
ships are occupied with exploration duties, which in the
Imperium would be the province of the Scout Service.
Some Zhodani ships are dedicated exploration vessels
packed with scientific instruments, while others serve as
escorts or embark on armed reconnaissance missions.
Many are tasked with supporting the core expeditions
but exploration also continues in other directions, albeit
at a much slower pace.

This 'warrior-explorer ethic' has a strong effect on
Zhodani naval culture. Many Zhodani officers possess
advanced degrees in sophontology or other scientific
fields, as well as engineering and naval tactics, and
senior officers will have spent a term or so serving on an
exploration mission; as such, they are expected to be
diplomats as well as soldiers.

ARMY AND GUARD

ORGANISATION
The Zhodani Army comprises the planetary-armed
fighting forces of individual worlds and subsectors within
the Consulate, dealing with planetary surface actions,
battles and campaigns. Where necessary, they may serve
as ship's troops aboard naval vessels. The army, like the
navy, has its own command structure, which parallels
governmental council structure. Consular Guard units,
however, are under direct authority of the Qlomdlabr, the
supreme council of the Consulate.

Leader-of-five Zhof Ievrepl is a native of Sriezdazh,
a high-population, mid-tech world in the Ziafrplians
sector. Like many members of the Prole class he aspired
to a career of honorable service to the Consulate and
joined the Zhodani Consulate Combined Interstellar
Forces. The selection process indicated that physically
he had an aptitude for low-gravity operations whilst
mentally he was inclined towards steadiness and
tenacity. These were ideal characteristics for a marine,
so after basic training Zhof reported aboard Mobile
Training Facility _Enjosiebr_.

By the time _Enjosiebr_ arrived at Cronor in the Spinward
Marches, Zhof was a qualified Consular Marine. Unlike
most members of his contingent, he did not transfer
to a navy ship or base but was instead selected for the
honor of remaining aboard as part of the Advanced
Training Cadre during the next voyage of _Enjosiebr_. At
the end of this voyage, Zhof joined the troops-aboard
contingent of the heavy cruiser _Setlflal_ with the rank of
Follower and, as expected, quickly advanced to lead his
squad when his Leader-of-five was promoted.

Zhof is qualified in all aspects of troops-aboard
operations, including low-gravity combat, explosives
and breaching equipment. His personal specialism
is close combat and he holds the position of Third
Instructor of Hand Weapons to his shipboard
contingent. Whilst this is not a particularly noteworthy
position it is a portent of things to come and Zhof
hopes one day to become an instructor to the family of
a noble, perhaps by way of serving as a member of the
Close Guard surrounding a senior officer. The ship's
Mentor-of-Aspirations team has noted this ambition
and pronounced it both worthy and attainable.

PRIMARY WEAPON
The primary weapon of most Consular Marines is the
Personal Energy Weapon Riebchi, generally referred to
as the 'Consular carbine' by non-Zhodani observers. A
standard direct-feed laser device, the Riebchi varies
mainly in its inclusion of a rechargeable battery pack
under the collimator tube. This permits 6–7 shots from
the weapon if its backpack power supply is disconnected.
The battery pack can be disconnected and used as an
emergency power source for a damaged combat armor
suit's life support or other light equipment.

SECONDARY

WEAPON
Zhof Ievrepl is equipped for close combat with a
Standardised Medium Blade Weapon Vranz, typically
known as the 'Vranz pattern boarding sword' outside the
Consulate. The Vranz is a straight-bladed cut-and-thrust
weapon which, despite its appearance, is primarily
used for thrusting actions, which give a better chance
of penetrating armor. As an instructor for this weapon,
Zhof has the honor of wearing a stylised image of it
among his insignia.

COMBAT ARMOR
Zhof wears standard Consulate-issue non-power-
assisted combat armor. Lighter than its Imperial
equivalent, Zhodani armor uses articulated plates
over a resilient flexible base with multiple-redundant
life support and wound-management systems. The suit
provides slightly better protection against radiation and
electromagnetic threats than Imperial armor, and is
designed to permit maximum agility at the expense of
some physical protection.

HELMET
Zhof's helmet uses the standard Consulate 'big eyes'
design – as many Imperials call it – which incorporates
multispectral emitters/sensors and user displays in the
lower part of the 'eyes'. Although the design of the eyes is
considered by some to create weak points in the helmet
front, the difference from a single faceplate design is
so small as to be negligible. The helmet also contains
communications receptors and an independently powered
communications unit. This gives a downed trooper a last
chance to call for help even after suit failure, or pass
along information, enemy coordinates, or a final inspiring
message to his comrades.

OPERATIONS PACK
Consulate combat armor can be used without a
backpack, using a small distributed power storage
array, but normally one of several operations packs
are carried. In addition to power for the suit and
any weapons carried, a standard operations pack
contains tools, a breaching charge, a thrust pistol
for open-space operations and additional equipment
as assigned. This usually includes one or more hand
grenades, an electronic intrusion kit and similar
mission-specific items.

SECURITY AND

INTELLIGENCE
The Tozjabr (literally, 'the eye and the hand') is the
Consulate's primary intelligence and covert operations
agency. The institution is relatively young, having been
established during the period of tension that led to the
First Frontier War. Prior to establishment of the Tozjabr,
intelligence gathering activities and special operations
had been handled by various military branches and
diplomatic offices, assisted by the Thought Police.

Faced with confrontation with a polity the size of the
Third Imperium, the Qlomdlabr realised that treating
covert operations as an adjunct to other operations

was no longer practical. With the need for a dedicated
covert operations and foreign intelligence organization
identified, the Qlomdlabr established the Tozjabr as
a civilian body independent of all other agencies,
including the Thought Police.

The Zhodani character makes finding suitable
candidates for undercover agents and giving them
proper training a difficult proposition, even with
telepathy. The stress of making decisions and
compromises alien to Zhodani culture can be
considerable. Extensive counselling is given to
operatives before retirement but a small number of
Tozjabr agents are unable to readjust to life in the
Consulate and have required re-education or, in a few
cases, turned to crime or defected to foreign powers.

**ZHODANI TRAVELLERS**

**CHAPTER-EIGHTEEN**

Zhodani Travellers follow the same procedures and
concepts as human Travellers, as detailed in the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, several changes take
into account the cultural differences between Zhodani
characters and other humans. Unless otherwise stated
in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules
described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

INITIAL TRAVELLER

GENERATION
Use the characteristics and traits for Zhodani Travellers
shown below:

**Characteristics:** Zhodani roll 2D for the PSI
characteristic at the start of Traveller generation. Note
that there is no reduction in PSI by terms of service (as
indicated in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ) for Zhodani, as
they are tested before they enter a career.

Optionally, the Referee may allow PSI to be rolled
using 1D+6 in order to create a greater proportion of
Intendants and Nobles.

**Characteristic Adjustments:** In the Consulate, all children
are tested for psionic potential, while children of Nobles
and Intendants receive better educations than Proles.

- If a Traveller rolls PSI 9+ and SOC 9-, raise their
    SOC to 10.
- EDU cannot be higher than SOC, and should be
    lowered to the SOC value if it is greater.
- If a Traveller rolls EDU 7- and SOC 10+, increase
    EDU to 8.

These adjustments apply only at the start of Traveller
generation. They do not apply if a Traveller's SOC
changes because of career events or if PSI changes due
to aging effects.

STARTING AGE
Zhodani characters begin their careers at 18 years of
age. Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a
career to gain new skills and experience. Each career
term lasts for four Imperial years.

**Social Classification**
Zhodani society has three broad social classes and SOC
determines to which a Traveller belongs.

Noble: SOC 11+
Intendant: SOC 10
Prole: SOC 9-

Noble Titles
Zhodani Intendants and Nobles are identified by a suffix
to their names. A new name suffix replaces the previous
one when an individual rises in SOC.

SOC Title Suffix Translation
10 -iepr Intendant
11 -atl Aspirant
12 -stebr Wellborn
13 -tlas Highborn
14 -tlasche' Noble Born
15 -iashav Princely Lord

While these do not directly correlate to Imperial
noble titles, Zhodani Travellers visiting the Imperium
are generally accorded status and honors based on
their SOC.

Psionic Training
Nobles and Intendants (not Proles) undergo
standardised psionic training at an early age. As part
of training, the Traveller attempts to learn the common
psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making
a PSI check. The Traveller may attempt to learn the
talents in any order but suffers a cumulative DM-1 per
check attempted. If a Traveller learns a talent, they gain
that talent at level 0.

Psionic Training
Talent Learning DM
Awareness +1
Clairvoyance +3
Telekinesis +2
Telepathy +4
Teleportation +0
Zhodani* –3

- New psionic talent detailed on page 277.

If a Prole gains PSI 9+ during a career, they are
elevated to Intendant (increasing their SOC to 10) and
immediately undergo this same training.

The Psionic Games
Any Intendant may apply once during their lifetime
to compete in the Thequzdievl, the Psionic
Games, by making a PSI check. If successful,
the Intendant devotes that term of service to
competition in the Psionic Games instead of a
career. The term still counts as a term in the
Traveller's current career, except no survival or
advancement checks are made, nor are skills
gained from career skill tables.

Preliminary Competitions: For each psionic talent
the Traveller is skilled in, make an Average (8+)
check. Record the number of successes and
failures.

Final Competition: Roll PSI 12+ to win the final
competition, with DM+1 for each successful
preliminary competition and DM-1 for each failed
preliminary competition.

Awards: After the final competition, the Traveller
receives PSI +1 if more preliminary competitions
were successful than failed. A winner of the final
competition receives PSI +2 and becomes a Noble,
raising SOC to 11.

CAREERS
Zhodani careers, in general, are used in the same way as
described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, there
are exceptions, which are noted here.

While Zhodani share most careers with other human
cultures, there are some differences. The Agent career
has no corporate specialty, as corporations within the
Consulate do not conduct trade wars or espionage
against each other. There is no specific career for
Nobles, although the Government career shares some
similarities. There is no Scout career, as that is specific
to the Imperium. There is no Rogue career, as that
represents behaviour considered unhealthy by Zhodani
society. Finally, the pervasiveness of a psionic society
requires changes across all careers.

Zhodani Travellers have no penalty for changing career,
as Zhodani society recognizes that a new perspective on
life is mentally healthy and often desirable.

The Draft
Zhodani use the following Draft table if they fail to
qualify for a career.

Draft
1D Career (speciality)
–3 Army (any)
4–5 Merchant (corporate)
6 Navy (any)

Skills
Skills are determined as normal but there is an
additional skill table for all careers except Prole.
Travellers may only roll on the Psionic Skills table if they
have Soc 10+.

Psionic Skills: Intendants and Nobles may develop
talents over time as if they were normal skills. If they
receive a talent they were not trained in or failed to gain
during their initial psionic training, they may attempt
again to gain that talent (all previous DMs apply,
including the cumulative DM-1 per previous check). If a
Traveller rolls the Talent skill choice, they may increase
any psionic talent already possessed.

Rare Skills: The Deception, Gambling and Streetwise
skills are generally not permitted to Zhodani Travellers.
Deception and Streetwise can be gained by those in the
Agent (tozjabr) career, as they deal with non-Zhodani
who engage in unhealthy activities. However, Gambling
is unknown in Zhodani society.

Commission and Advancement
Zhodani society favors the careers of Intendants and,
especially, Nobles. The following rules apply to all
Zhodani Travellers.

- Nobles and Intendants automatically succeed with
    Advancement (Commission if appropriate) in their
    first term of service, unless they are draftees.
- Drafted Nobles and Intendants receive automatic
    Advancement (Commission if appropriate) in their
    second term of service.
- Nobles gain DM+1 to all Advancement rolls.
- Proles and Intendants in the Government career may
    not advance higher than Rank 3 (Executive).

interacts with you in a unique fashion, you have been allowed to keep it but both the item
and you remain objects of occasional study by Consulate scientists and researchers.

RE-EDUCATION

EVENTS
For Proles, re-education is an important part of proper
mental health. Intendants and Nobles are only sent to
re-education in more serious circumstances. There is no
social stigma for re-education; it is viewed as being as
necessary as surgery is for physical health. Time spent
in re-education does not count as time in a career for
Benefit rolls, Advancement or gaining skills; it does
count for aging.

Re-education Events
1D Event
1 Re-education requires two terms. You must enter
a new career and reduce END by –1. If SOC
11+, reduce SOC by –1, to a minimum of 11.
2 Re-education requires one term. You must enter
a new career and reduce END by –1. If SOC
11+, reduce SOC by –1, to a minimum of 11.
3 Re-education requires one term but you can
continue this career.
4 Re-education requires less than a year and your
career is not affected.
5 Fine of Cr1000 x 1D; you do not require re-
education.
6 Exonerated! Receive an additional Benefit roll in
your current career.

**Anagathics:** Use the number of terms since you started
taking anagathics as a negative DM to rolls on the Re-
education Events table.

MUSTERING OUT
Benefits are granted at the end of career service, as
detailed on page 45 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.
Zhodani have access to new mustering out benefits.

**Courier:** You receive a Yetsasl courier with 25% of the
mortgage paid off on it. This courier is identical to the
one on page 296 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the courier will have no mortgage and
it will be all yours!

**Nenj:** The Nenjchinzhe'driante (the Consular Legion of
Merit) is a post-career recognition of valuable service
to all Zhodani. Membership in the Consular Legion of

Merit is egalitarian – Nobles, Intendants and Proles are
all eligible for the award. Those who have won enrolment
are entitled to wear the distinctive gold sash of honor
that marks them as recognized elite of the Consulate.

Although it is largely honorary, members do receive
concrete benefits. Zhodani citizens almost invariably
grant members a 10% discount on just about
everything, from meals to equipment purchases to
starship passages. Sums of more than MCr1 are rarely
so discounted but bank loans in these amounts are
made without interest. Membership is for life and is not
transferable but companions of a member may share in
the benefits when they do the buying.

Scout: You receive a Ninz scout with 25% of the mortgage
paid off on it. This scout is identical to the one on page
294 but you must roll 1D times on the Outdated Ships
Table on page 165 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. If you
roll this benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage
has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the
scout will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!

SOC: SOC may never be increased if it would raise
a Prole character's SOC above 9. An unusable SOC
increase is taken as a bonus Ship Share.

Trader: You receive a Zdebr trader with 25% of the
mortgage paid off on it. This trader is identical to the
one on page 298 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the trader will have no mortgage
and it will be all yours!

Pensions
Zhodani Travellers can only receive pension payments
within the Consulate. Nobles receive double the
amount received.

Aging Crisis
If PSI is reduced to 0 through aging, it does not
constitute an aging crisis but the Traveller loses all
psionic abilities and can never regain them. Reduction
of PSI through aging does not affect SOC.

Anagathics: Within the Zhodani Consulate, use of
anagathics is viewed as a symptom of mental illness.
Use the number of terms since the Traveller started
taking anagathics as a negative DM to rolls on the
Re-education Events table. Additionally, the cost of
anagathics in the Consulate is considerably higher than
in Imperial space. They will cost Cr200000 x 2D for
each term the Traveller uses the drugs.

## ZHODANI PSIONICS

**CHAPTER-NINETEEN**

The Zhodani have devoted millennia of study to psionic
talents and the finest minds of the Consulate have
examined the common psionic talents and discovered
others. While these other talents are rare, they provide
Zhodani Travellers with interesting ways to expand their
psionic abilities.

ZHODANI
Zhodani Travellers have access to the Zhodani talent and
its abilities.

**Awareness of Others**
The psion may perform any Awareness ability but only
upon others and then only if the target is not wearing, or
within, a psionic shield.

**Check:** As ability
**Reach:** As ability
**PSI Cost:** As ability +2

**Blocking**
Psions with this talent are capable of broadcasting
psionic 'static' over some considerable distance,
which effectively blocks the use of telepathic abilities,
rendering weak telepaths powerless. While a psion
maintains blocking, all psions within range (not
including himself) suffer a penalty to Telepathy skill
checks equal to half the blocking psion's current PSI
(rounding down).

A psion entering an area being blocked in this way may
make a PSI check to realise they are being blocked. The
referee may make this check in secret.

**Check:** Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)
**Reach:** Long
**PSI Cost:** 4

**Control**
The psion is able to control a machine's functions,
overriding fixed settings, programming routines and
so forth. Machines can be switched on or off and their

functions changed, as long as the device is capable
of performing the instruction the psion gives to it.
The Effect of the Zhodani check indicates the degree
of success; lower Effects reflect a partial control over
function, whilst higher effects reflect total control. Only
one instruction at a time can be given to a machine.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D x 10 minutes,
PSI)
Reach: Medium
PSI Cost: 3

Empathic Healing
The psion may transfer wounds from others to himself.
The PSI cost is equal to the points of damage being
transferred. The physical effects of the damage take
immediate effect.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)
Reach: Personal
PSI Cost: Amount of damage transferred

Interact
The psion can sense the flow of data within a machine.
This allows the psion to react more quickly and smoothly
to changes in the data flow, lowering the difficulty of all
Computer checks the psion attempts, making them one
level easier.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)
Reach: Close
PSI Cost: 1

Interrogate
The psion can 'communicate' psychically with a
machine, determining its physical state of repair,
properties, age, programming and so forth. The
psion effectively reads the psychometric aura that
accompanies every device in much the same way an
organic aura can be read. The Effect of the Zhodani
check determines the depth and extent of the
information but does not provide any measure of control.

Examples of information available with Interrogate:

- Effect 0: Who made the machine, when and where.
- Effect 1: Amount of power available in batteries.
- Effect 1: State of repair/damage.
- Effect 2: Access to stored data.
- Effect 2: Specific functions.
- Effect 3: Specific hidden instructions or
    programming.
- Effect 4: Hidden functions.

**Check:** Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)
**Reach:** Close
**PSI Cost:** 2

**Mimic**
A psion with this ability has a mental shield, much like
any skilled telepath. However, other psions attempting
to probe or use other psionic abilities against the mimic
must make opposed PSI checks to succeed. If this
check is failed, a telepath perceives an unshielded
mind having a personality fabricated by the mimic.
Clairvoyants will see and/or hear images appropriate
to the mimic's fabricated personality, instead of the
mimic's true personality.

Psychic Transfer
The psion may transfer some or all of his PSI to another.
This PSI is recovered normally.

Psychic Transfer, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds,
Average (+0).
Costs: 1+Range (Telepathy), +1 per Psionic Strength
point being transferred.

Check: Routine (6+) Zhodani check (1D seconds, PSI)
Reach: Medium
PSI Cost: Amount of PSI transferred +1

Teleprojection
The psion can perform any Teleportation abilities but
only on others and then only if the target is not wearing,
or within, a psionic shield. The teleported individual
suffers the effects of relative motion or altitude as
detailed on page 202 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Check: As ability
Reach: As ability
PSI Cost: As ability +2

Zhodani equipment across Tech Levels is functionally
equivalent to that available in the Imperium. Most
equipment is designed at up to TL14 (with an average
of TL13); some TL15 items are manufactured on
Zhdant and other advanced worlds but these are
generally restricted to a few elite government agencies
or military units.

Zhodani can use equipment and facilities designed for
other human races with little difficulty. One exception
comes from Zhodani height; as they average two
meters tall, low doors and ceilings can occasionally
be awkward, and clothes or armor designed for other
humans may require re-tailoring (add +5% to cost) in
order to fit properly. Aside from trousers possibly too
long in the leg, other races using Zhodani equipment
may have a different; equipment intended strictly for
use by Nobles or Intendants (such as Guard combat
armor or a personal vehicle) may only have psi-
sensitive switches, safeties or triggers.

Firearms, other than semi-automatic slug weapons and
shotguns, are generally unavailable for sale on Zhodani
worlds, regardless of local Law Level, as no local
market exists.

PSIONICS AND

TECHNOLOGY
As a psionic culture, the Zhodani look to technology to
enhance or improve their talents and abilities. While
not all research has been successful, there have been
two noteworthy developments. The psi-sensitive switch
has been available in Zhodani space for millennia and
such switches are built into all technological devices
within the Consulate. The psionic interface, on the
other hand, is a very recent development and remains
uncommon. Because of their nature, Imperial law
makes items with either modification illegal to produce
or import into the Imperium.

**Psi-sensitive Switch:** Technological devices produced in
Zhodani territory contain integral psi-sensitive controls
(in addition to regular controls), which allow operation
from a distance of up to 50 meters by mentally

CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE

X

###### ZHODANI

'flicking'; telekinetic psions can double this distance.
These switches are elementary on-off devices used to
respond to a command by shifting from one state to the
other and can be tripped by anyone psionically trained
who has learned the technique. Most Zhodani starships
are equipped with such switches, allowing Nobles
and Intendants to operate equipment without being in
physical contact with it. The cost of such a switch built
into a device is negligible.

Modification TL Kg Cost
Psi-sensitive Switch 7 — —

Psionic Interface: Any weapon or technological device can
be outfitted with a psionic interface. This allows a Traveller
using the device or weapon to use their PSI modifier
instead of their DEX modifier; this requires physical
contact. A Traveller without psionic ability gains no benefit
from the interface. Adding a psionic interface increases
the cost of the device by 20%.

Modification TL Kg Cost
Psionic Interface 14 — +20%

Symbiosis Shielding: Devices can be shielded from the
psionic control many Zhodani are capable of. Each level
of shielding applies DM-1 to any Zhodani check made
to assert control over the device and increases its cost
by +10%.

Modification TL Kg Cost
Symbiosis Shielding 13 — +10% per DM-1

ARMOR
Most armor is restricted to military units, or used by
Thought Police personnel, and is unavailable for sale on
Zhodani worlds. Protective gear for hostile environments
is widely available, although most likely owned by
corporations, Intendants or Nobles, rather than Proles.

Trooper model combat armor is identical in function
to the TL12 combat armor found on page 98 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook.

A11/58231

A11/58231

**TELEPORTATION SUIT**
This device can be worn as a form-hugging body-suit
integrated or into a suit of armor. It rapidly cools or warms
the body after teleportation, minimising damage from sudden
energy gains or losses. The suit allows a Traveller to jump up
to 600 meters up or down in a single teleport or up to 10
kilometers in a single hour when using successive jumps.

Guards combat armor is based on the earlier officer model
(including the Computer/3) but has been further improved
to enhance the psionic activity of the wearer. It combines a
teleportation suit with special wiring patterns that provide
psionic shielding for non-telepaths. Its glove palms can be
removed to expose bare hands for psionic activity requiring
physical contact.

Nobles in the Army and Guards wear this style of combat
armor; based on the combat armor of the Guards, it
offers improved protection without impairing movement.
Noble combat armor is most distinguished by its broad
cloak, made from deep black smart fabric. The armor also
incorporates vislight chameleon technology, blending it into
background scenery and making it extremely difficult to
detect with the naked eye or optical instruments, granting
the wearer DM+4 to Stealth checks. The workmanship on
Noble combat armor is of very high quality, with special

available Intellect/1 and Expert (electronics (comms)) 2

AUGMENTS
While augments are available in the Consulate, they are
culturally frowned upon. Augments are seen as a sign
of discomfort with how someone views themselves, a
symptom of mental illness. However, recognizing that
some augments have value (particularly to compensate
for injuries), they are allowed – but all augments for
Proles have psi-sensitive switches built into them, so they
can be shut off by Intendants or Nobles if necessary.
All augmentations listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_
and _Central Supply Catalogue_ up to TL14 are available
in Zhodani space; however, requesting augmentations
other than to replace lost limbs or injured functions will
almost certainly result in re-education.
MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Most medicines in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ or _Central
Supply Catalogue_ up to TL14 are available in the
Consulate. The possession or use of anagathics within
the Consulate is viewed as a symptom of mental illness,
even for Nobles and items like inhibitor drugs are very
restricted, although the Thought Police quietly makes
use of them. They are not available on the open market.
However, psi-drugs are widely available in the Consulate.

ROBOTS
The Zhodani do not, as a rule, build humanoid or autonomous robots. The standard Zhodani mobile robot configuration
is a legless torso containing computer, power plant and grav system. A number of arms, usually two, are attached,
often with built-in tools or weapons. The robot is usually topped with a rotating head turret containing sensors and
communication systems.

**A11/58231 TRASHBOT**

This trashbot is commonly used by the Zhodani government
and nobility. Wandering around a commercial or civic area, it
continually picks up waste and stores it in a receptacle carried
with it. When full, the robot dumps it at a local disposal
location, then returns to trash patrol. The janitorial toolkit
includes a collection of tools for sweeping, dusting, polishing
and vacuuming, as well as static charge dissipaters and
assorted mechanical cleaning aids. This toolkit also allows the
robot to instantly shred most materials fed into it. This ability
makes the robot ideal for information security applications and
it can be found in many Zhodani government offices.

**A11/58231 MAINTENANCE BOT (TL12)**

The maintenance bot has a cylindrical body with two arms
each ending in complex tool-hands, and a small wedge-
shaped head turret, and relies on its grav system for mobility.
Manufactured by Chiadle, it is the most common general-
purpose repair and maintenance robot used in Zhodani space.
It can be seen at starports and aboard merchant or naval
vessels, often negating the need for a dedicated maintenance
crewman. It comes in various versions, mostly differing in the
kind of tool systems used.

This warbot is light enough to be carried as equipment by a
Zhodani commando team – massing a total of 9kg, a skilled
teleporter can even carry one with him when he teleports. A
favorite tactic of Zhodani commandos is to teleport deep into
enemy territory, leave several light warbots behind and then
teleport back to safety while the warbots wreak havoc on an
unsuspecting enemy encampment, thoroughly demoralising
the enemy.

ZHODANI WARBOTS
The Zhodani traditionally use mobile robots as part
of their armed forces. These robots are not sapient
and form a cheap substitute for ordinary soldiers.
Imperial propaganda paints the Zhodani use of 'death
machines' as one more example of their soulless
culture. The Zhodani have a different view; war is
necessary but not glamorous and their soldiers' lives
are too valuable to waste.

Warbots are normal parts of many Zhodani units
and attached to others for special operations on a
mission-by-mission basis. They are used in various
ways, ranging from mass assault to mobile fire support

platforms to providing security perimeters or post-
battle pursuit. They are vital for clearing built-up areas,
where casualties may be unacceptably high for troops.
In such missions, they are normally sent to locations
where clairvoyance-using psionic detachments have
pinpointed enemy resistance. Against lower-tech forces,
use is often made of their flight capabilities for surprise
vertical envelopments.

Warbots are programmed to recognize and ignore friendly
troops and are programmed with terrain maps, battle
plans and threat criteria. They are all installed with
transponders for battlefield 'friend or foe' recognition.

**MEDIUM WARBOT**
This design is a popular warbot model, with customised
versions in use throughout the Consulate. The warbot is solid
and reliable, with good intelligence (as far as Zhodani robots
go). The model shown here is a basic configuration but many
other variations are available, depending on the operating
environment or type of mission the warbot will be called upon
to perform, carrying a variety of weapons, equipment and
additional armor. Warbots intended for boarding actions often
swap the laser rifle for a flamethrower.

**HEAVY WARBOT**
This warbot is designed to hold its own in a full frontal
assault involving armored troops with fusion and plasma
weapons. Although hugely expensive, it stands up well in
the most demanding battlefield situations. Besides the
obvious offensive uses, it works well as a defensive warbot
or forward scout, with its excellent sensors. The oblong
half-dome chassis body presents a small frontal profile,
thus minimising available targeting area, while the small
rotating head contains the sensory and firing apparatus
for the fusion weapon, allowing the main chassis body to
remain behind cover while firing.

The Imperious is a good example of Zhodani
light vehicle design philosophy: weaponry over
armor. Sensors are less powerful than those in
equivalent Imperial craft, presumably because
the Zhodani place more stock in psionics as a
supplement to sensors, rather than vice versa.

The Princely Lord Attack Speeder made
its debut during the Fourth Frontier War.
Despite its size, the speeder is a good
example of the Zhodani military design
philosophy of fast and deadly. However, the
Princely Lord also has exceptionally good
armor. This vehicle and its nearly identical
cousin, the Silent Grasp, were responsible
for more fear and panic among the Imperial
populace in the Tloql sector than any other
Zhodani fighting vehicle during the Fourth
Frontier War.

The Silent Grasp Attack Speeder is visually
similar to the Princely Lord but faster and has
less armor. In addition, the Silent Grasp mounts
twin fusion guns instead of an aerospace defence
laser – a shorter ranged but more deadly weapon.
The Silent Grasp looks so much like a Princely
Lord that the two are often confused by civilians
and military observers alike. Only with careful
observation using dedicated sensors or close
visual contact can the two craft be distinguished.

The Qiknavra (named after the smaller
of Zhdant's continents) is one of the
Consulate's latest grav tank designs. The
craft is intended to be a small, relatively
inexpensive, yet highly survivable vehicle
on the battlefield. To date, the Imperium
has been unable to determine the precise
capabilities of the Qiknavra and, given
its apparent ease of construction, its
appearance has reignited fears of a new
Frontier War.

**HIGH GUARD: ZHODANI**

**CHAPTER-TWENTY TWO**

Because the principles of physics and jump drive
technology are constant throughout the universe,
Zhodani starships are similar to the starships in use
by other humans. The one major difference between
Zhodani ships and those of other cultures is an
abundance of psionic switches. Simple psionically
sensitive switches are components of iris valves,
automatic doors and many convenience items such
as lights, temperature or environment controls and
entertainment or communication devices.

CIVILIAN STARSHIPS
It is customary for commercial shipping within the
Consulate to travel unarmed; many commercial designs
do away with weapons entirely. Ships intended for
service in border regions, beyond the frontiers or in
private hands, are more frequently armed. For this
reason, crews for civilian designs almost never include
dedicated gunners, even if the ship is armed.

MILITARY STARSHIPS
Zhodani military starships are designed to be more
general purpose in function than comparable Imperial
vessels. While most Zhodani warships encountered
on the frontiers are older TL13 designs, newer TL14
designs have been more common since the Fourth
Frontier War.

Zhodani military starships often carry an additional crew
member, a Counsellor, particularly on long voyages.
While this person is generally a Thought Police member
serving a term in the navy, they are responsible for the
mental health of the crew and report to the captain of
the ship, not the Thought Police hierarchy.

PILOT, ASTROGATOR, ENGINEER

NINZ-CLASS SCOUT

A standard civilian exploratory vessel used
by both commercial concerns and the
Consulate Navy for frontier exploration and
reconnaissance. An old and reliable design,
this scout is oriented more towards survey
and scientific missions and less to courier-
type duties than its Imperial counterpart
is. Ninz-class scouts see extensive use for
supplemental surveys off the main axis of
exploration within the Core Expeditions.
Ships in naval service are named after
former naval officers.

YETSASL-CLASS COURIER

The Yetsasl-class is named after a racing
beast on Zhdant and individual ships
often after similar creatures on other
worlds. The courier design gives priority
to transport of important personnel, such
as government officials on diplomatic
missions. The Yetsasl's role often
takes it outside the Consulate and it
is the Zhodani vessel most commonly
encountered in the Imperium. Yetsasls are
a separate design from Ninz scouts, unlike
the Imperial practice of using the same
hull for both scouts and couriers; a Yetsasl
is larger than a Ninz and contains more
extensive staterooms and fittings.

ZDEBR-CLASS TRADER

Individuals and small trading companies
are the most prolific operators Zdebr-class
traders and these ships are a common sight
in frontier regions of the Consulate. They
are more general-purpose vessels than
the 400-ton subsidized merchant used in
the Imperium, being closer in concept to
an oversized free trader. Atypically for a
Zhodani commercial vessel the Zdebr is
armed, albeit lightly. Zdebr-class ships are
named after historically famous seaports
and caravan routes on old Zhdant.

SHIANJO-CLASS LINER

A passenger liner used in the core regions
of the Consulate and along most of its main
trade routes, the Shianjo ('Good Journey')
has a reputation for its stylish interior
design and high jump range. Nobles and
Intendants typically occupy staterooms,
while Proles travel in low passage unless
they are servants or retainers. Commercial
vessels are normally unarmed in peaceful
Consulate space but in wartime this
makes them easy targets for privateers and
commerce raiders, forcing the Zhodani
navy to provide escorts.
