The Purcell class Express Boat Tender is a [[TL–11]] specialized tender.

## Description 

Constructed using a type 1000 hull, it is fitted with H model drives, producing jump-1 capability and 1-G acceleration. Fuel tankage is 150 tons; jump requires 100 tons of fuel, but in insystem operation, the ship uses this tankage to refuel express boats instead. The standard bridge is complemented by a Model/3 computer and fire control for three turrets, plus communicator relay facilities. The ship has ten staterooms and twenty low berths.

The crew consists of six: a captain/pilot, navigator/medic, communications specialist, and three engineers. Three gunners may be added to the crew where necessary.

Additional slots for the crew are taken up by replacement xboat pilots awaiting missions. There is a sixty-ton cargo bay used for repair parts and replacement equipment. Three weapons turrets arm the ship sufficiently to take care of most situations. The major part of the ship (600 tons) is taken up by a cavernous ship bay. This area can accommodate four express boats or two scout/couriers with little or no problem.

The express boat tender costs MCr274.77 to construct, assuming no architect's fees (the design is standard and any costs have been amortized by the government) and a 10% discount for production in volume. Weapons costs have not been included in this price.

### Basic Ship Characteristics

Following the [[Imperial Navy]] and [[IISS]] [[Universal Ship Profile]] and data, additional information is presented in the format shown here. The [[small craft]] factor indicates the number of squadrons (...of ten [[subcraft]]) carried on the [[ship]]. [[Tonnage]] on the [[universal ship profile]] is shown in [[kilotons]] (...thousands of [[tons]]) where necessary.

### Ship Interior Details

The most striking interior detail for the express boat tender is the ship bay. It measures 40 meters by 28.5 meters by 12 meters; this twelve meter dimension can be expanded to 24 meters through the simple expedient of leaving the ship bay doors open. Any ship or group of ships that can meet this dimensional requirement, up to a total of 600 tons, can be carried by the tender through [[jump space]]. Solid frame brackets within the bay are used to secure any ships or cargo to prevent damage while under acceleration. The entire ship bay, with the door closed, can be pressurized to allow access to the exteriors of any ships or boats carried within while avoiding the interfering bulk of [[vacc suits]].

The forward end of the ship bay connects via a large port to the cargo bay of the ship. This cargo bay (of 60 tons capacity) carries consumables for the tender and to replace food and consumables when resupplying [[X-Boat]]s

[[Low berth]]s for medical cases and spare pilots are situated adjacent to the cargo bay. Also on the cargo level are an [[electronics repair shop]] and a [[machine shop]]. 

The fuel level contains tankage for the ship and for the refuelling of [[express boats]]. An [[external fuel probe]] allows fast refuelling of [[express boats]] without taking them into the [[ship bay]] or requiring crew to don [[vacc suits]]. A [[fuel lab]] on the tankage level monitors fuel quality. The lowest level of the ship is the drive deck with all [[jump drives]], [[maneuver drives]], and the main [[power plant]]. An [[air lock]] allows access to the exterior from this end of the ship. 

Note the two [[lift shafts]] which run the length of the ship. The duplication allows faster access when one shaft is already in use, and provides damage control in the event of combat or disaster. 

The [[bridge]] deck, located extreme forward, contains crew quarters and the controls for the ship. The bridge itself includes a bay window providing visual scanning of the ship bay doors and an overhead view. Surrounding the bridge are individual crew [[staterooms]] (capable of double occupancy when necessary). A communal [[fresher]] facility (location 12) allows more room in each stateroom, and decreases total costs for the ship. 

## History & Background

The express boat system would not work without the express boat tender. These [[tenders]], stationed in each [[system]] that express boats stop at, serve two purposes. First, they tend express boats, recovering them when they arrive, refueling them and repairing minor problems, and then sending them on their way. Second, they serve as a relay station between the planetary surface based message center and the express boat itself. Messages are forwarded to the tender for transmittal to the xboat just before it leaves for the next [[star system]]. 

Express boat tenders are encountered anywhere that xboats may be expected. High population, high technology systems will probably have several tenders operating in order to handle the flow of information. Express boat tenders are jump capable, and each may carry up to four xboats in its cavernous [[ship bay]]. As a result, the tenders can be found in fringe or off-route systems ferrying extra xboats to areas that need them. They also undertake recovery missions to pick up damaged xboats or boats which have [[misjumped]] to off-route systems. 

### Variant Models

A common variant of the X-boat tender is the dedicated version, which has no Jump drive and remains on-station in a single system. Major communications hubs usually have several dedicated tenders plus a handful of Jump-capable ones which can be reassigned as traffic volume dictates.

Three known model variations exist for the express boat tender.

**Bulk Ore Carrier**: Several examples of the ship were constructed with the large ship bay fitted to carry bulk ore from asteroid belts to surface refinery plants. The model has a limited use, because the system must have both a producing asteroid belt and a refinery plant established on an airless world.

**Fuel Tanker**: The Imperial Navy has acquired approximately one hundred and forty-four ships with the central bay converted to carry starship fuel. The total capacity of 750 tons of fuel makes the ship an ideal nursemaid to fighters patrolling frontier systems.

**Corsair**: The third variant of the tender is altogether unofficial. Express boat tenders are a prime target for hijackers. The tenders make excellent corsairs, especially if up-gunned. Typically, a tender will be surprised and hijacked by a band of thugs, often feigning shipwreck in order to attract the ship's attention. If they are lucky, the tender will have with it a scout/courier or a couple of xboats, which are then used to make the tender look more realistic when it plies the space lanes. The large ship bay allows most smaller ships to be enveloped and then boarded at the pirate's leisure.

When encountered as a corsair the triple turrets have weapons installed, and the crew may number 20 (with double occupancy) or more (with additional quarters installed). The ship bay permits cargo storage, concealment of smaller raiding craft, or an uploading area for small captured vessels.
