# Starlink Merchant Factors, Incorporated

Starlink is a small (by interstellar standards) corporation which operates in the interstellar trade and commerce sector. It has brokerages in several major starports, especially along the Imperial-Aslan Hierate trade routes. These are large and well staffed, with a legal team as well as negotiators and commerce experts. Offices are always situated in a prominent position, with expensive but understated décor and an extremely professional demeanour.

Most of Starlink’s business is simple buying and selling of cargo from passing starships, including the provision of brokerage services to third parties. The firm is a little unusual for one of its size, in that it is quite willing to broker very small, low-profit deals for Free Traders and other single-ship operators. This has gained it a reputation as ‘the Free Trader’s friend’. It is unlikely that the firm makes enough on most of these deals to do more than offset its costs, but there are other benefits to a close relationship with Free Traders.

One such benefit is a steady flow of low-level commercial information. Free Traders pick up a lot of rumours in the ports they frequent, and see a side of the interstellar commerce marketplace that a broker in a three-piece suit does not. Most of this information is useless on its own, but when fed into Starlink’s extensive commercial intelligence analysis network it provides data on the flow of trade that might not be available elsewhere. Major-port brokers know what is bought and sold there, but often have no idea where it ends up or who the final buyer might be. Starlink makes it a priority to know, and uses this information wisely.

In addition to its normal shipping and brokerage activity, Starlink often charters merchant vessels to carry a cargo for it, or offers a profit-sharing deal whereby it subsidises a trade run carried out by an independent vessel. Knowledge of the end-market enables Starlink to put just the right shipload of goods into a backwater port with a solid expectation of a reasonable profit. The vessel transporting the cargo gets part of the proceeds and will usually come out ahead, and of course the transporting vessel bears little of the financial risk inherent in speculative trade.

This practice generates a modest but fairly steady income for Starlink, and has endeared the firm to many of the local Free Trader captains. There is, however, another side to this activity. Starlink quietly dominates the offworld trade of several minor worlds. Its ability to flood the local market with exactly what it needs tends to make the same ports less viable as trading destinations for independent ships that are not affiliated with Starlink. Those that are not providing Starlink with commercial (and sometimes other) information are frozen out of this lucrative market and can find their own speculative trade undermined. The result is that an increasing proportion of local trade ships are essentially in the pocket of Starlink Merchant Factors Incorporated. Why the firm might want this remains an open question.
