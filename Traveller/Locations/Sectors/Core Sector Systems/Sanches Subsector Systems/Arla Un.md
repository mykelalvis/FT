Arla Un orbits a bright blue-white subgiant star called Kir Aikhalingas. The Arla Un 'day' is 263.8 standard days long. The bright side of the planet heats up to a white-hot 365o Celsius and its dark side can drop to as low as 125o below zero. Arla Un appears to have been subjected to multiple large impacts that have stripped away much of its lithosphere and crust, leaving the metal-rich mantle exposed. The planet has a trace atmosphere and an oceanic slurry of water, tar and sulphuric acid that moves along longitudinal cracks, canyons and through deep veins under its surface. A high degree of volcanic and tectonic activity results in an ever-changing geography with crumbling hills and mountains, and new fissures carved into its extensive lava plains with each passing year.

Arla Un posed a technical challenge to the conservative Vilani that they chose to pass up. It was deemed better to go after the 'low-hanging fruit' than to brave the dangers of a half-molten planet. The system was left uninhabited until the Rule of Man and even then, only survey outposts were established on the world. Only in the year 565 did permanent settlements begin to appear on Arla Un. There are three types of inhabited structures on the planet: subterranean, surface and gravitic. Underground cities have been emplaced in relatively stable pockets, far away from volcanism and underground acid oceans. Its surface 'cities' are actually wheeled or tracked platforms that slowly rove around the planet, while the gravitic habitations float close to its surface to avoid direct exposure to the powerful rays of Kir Aikhalingas. Surface and gravitic cities use a combination of imagery and data collected by rad-shielded satellites and heat-shielded rovers and drones to guarantee their safe transit around the world. With new crevices, river valleys and reservoirs developing all the time, they must take care to ensure that there are no surprises in front of them. The constant movement of living on a mobile platform is unusual but for the most part, they function as typical cities complete with all the trappings of a modern, high-tech civilization. Arla Un has two Class B downports  emplaced in mobile cities, one on tracks and the other on a gravitic platform. The largest of the cities is a massive linked caravan of tracked platforms, which provides housing for over 200,000 people.

The highport is an industrial facility, mostly concerned with shipping Arla Un's metals and minerals off planet and importing the many goods and services that its citizens need. There is a residential and hospitality district but for the most part, the highport is quite utilitarian. The majority of permanent residences are on (or just above) the planet itself. The world is governed by the Arla Un Mining Consortium, a federal union of representatives from its mobile and subterranean cities, which manages the exploitation of the planet's natural resources and acts as a mediator with large, off-world mining concerns. Megacorporate and sector-wide corporate mining and resource-extraction firms  have attempted to invest in Arla Un by purchasing local companies but none have broken ranks thus far. The Arla Unians are solemnly proud of the way they have tamed the hostile environment of their homeworld and have an almost nationalistic fervour when it comes to their independence.

#### Bright-Side Crawler

As much as they might try to avoid it, there are times when a mission to the bright side of Arla Un is necessary. The bright-side crawler is just the vehicle for the job. The crawler is designed to withstand the intense heat of Arla Un's beaming blue-white subgiant star and can transport a crew of six (one driver and five passengers) across the bright face in safety. Arla Un's mercurial landscape requires caution, so the crawler is outfitted with top-notch sensory and navigation systems. Its satellite uplink provides constant and secure communications with the world's roving cities and starports.
