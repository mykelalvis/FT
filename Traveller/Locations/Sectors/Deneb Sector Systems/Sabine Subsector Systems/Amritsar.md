### AMRITSAR

Amritsar has an uncomfortably dense atmosphere, which has the effect of making its taint more serious.  The starport is built on high ground where atmospheric pressure is a little lower but the thick, warm air is still uncomfortable and most people prefer to remain inside air-conditioned buildings.

Amritsar is primarily notable for its ruins, generally assumed to date from the Ancients period, and have been the subject of several publicly available books and vid documentaries. Occasionally a new wild theory emerges and the datanet is flooded with 'shocking revelations Ancients scientists don't want you to know'  but these rarely amount to more than a sales pitch for a questionably researched publication or rather basic attempt to increase advertising revenue.
