# SPINWARD MARCHES

#TODO [[The Spinward Marches]] needs to be migrated here and all references renamed.

To the average citizen of the Imperial core worlds, the Spinward Marches is just a name, one of the distant provinces perhaps, or one of those troublesome backward border regions. Certainly, nothing good ever seems to come out of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. The Civil War was launched from there; major conflicts with foreign states are two-a-Credit... and, in any case, [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] are on the other side of the [[Great Rift]], very far away and of no real consequence.

There is an element of truth in this. [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] are isolated not only by distance but by the barrier of the [[Great Rift]], which cannot be crossed without considerable effort. As a result, the only way into, and out of, [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] is through the narrow Imperial-held strip between the [[Great Rift]] and [[Vargr Extents]], aptly named the [[Corridor sector]].

On top of that, the Spinward Marches is the Imperial border with the [[Zhodani Consulate]] and several smaller human, [[Vargr]] and other states. As a result, it was bound to have an interesting history. Most events in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] affect only the local area but, occasionally, something spills out, usually something bad â€“ that is just how the universe works.

To a great extent, astrography dictates many of the characteristics of the sector. The single most important feature is the [[Spinward Main]], which wends its way right across the sector, branching at several points. The [[Spinward Main]] is often considered to begin at [[Mora]]; in fact the chain of stars runs onward into the [[Star Lane Subsector]] of [[Deneb]] for a couple of parsecs.

From [[Mora Subsector|Mora]], an arm of the Main runs coreward into [[Rhylanor Subsector|Rhylanor]] but the Main proper is far longer. One of the major arms run coreward into [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]] and [[Regina]], then across spinward all the way to [[Querion Subsector|Querion]]. The central arm runs through the [[Sword Worlds]] to [[Darrians]], while the rimward arm splits into three major branches. One leads to [[Glisten Subsector|Glisten]] and two run into the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]].

The most important implication of this huge astrographical feature is that it is possible to reach any subsector of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] with a jump-1 ship, albeit slowly. A jump-2 ship can reach almost any world in the sector by following the Main then jumping across onto a smaller main. Only a handful of worlds cannot be reached in this way.

There are a few areas of very sparse systems in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], which tend to channel and restrict shipping.  One is in [[Aramis Subsector|Aramis]] but lies close to the border so has little effect on internal shipping. Rather more important is the sparse area in the [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] and [[Lanth subsector]]s. Not only is this a region of low stellar density, which restricts easy navigation, but it is associated with a number of curious phenomena; the incidence of misjumps and ship disappearances in what is known as the [[Abyss Rift]] is significantly higher than in other areas. The region of sparse systems extends out to spinward from [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] but, as there is no Imperial territory in this direction, it is of little consequence.

The other region of low stellar density lies to spinward-coreward of Collace, in [[District 268]], and is known as the [[Collace Rift]]. Arms of the [[Spinward Main]] run around the edges of this rift, which contains the barely-surveyed world designated [[875-496]] and the interdicted [[Droyne]] worlds of [[Andor]] and [[Candory]].

Politically, there are few barriers to navigation in most of the sector. The [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] is not friendly to the [[Imperium]], which necessitates a detour around Sword Worlder space for most ships headed to the [[Darrian Confederation]]. Difficulty of access also means that Imperial holdings in the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]] are more or less cut off from the rest of the [[Imperium]].

Obviously, crossing the border into the [[Zhodani Consulate]] presents significant problems, as Imperial ships are not always welcomed there, and the same applies to the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]]. Ships coming into the [[Imperium]] from these states are sometimes considered suspect by the [[Imperial Navy]] and the worlds they visit.

However, the Imperial border is not a hard barrier. It is simple enough to leave Imperial space, visit worlds outside the [[Imperium]], and later return, and no special permissions are needed. While the [[Imperium]] has laws that govern trade between member worlds, these do not apply to systems outside the [[Imperium]] and those systems have their own regulations. Thus, although crossing the border is easy, the way ships are treated by local authorities when they make planetfall can be a disincentive to cross-border trading.

Above all, it is important to note that each world, whether part of the [[Imperium]] or not, is different and self-governing. The [[Imperium]] is a framework that establishes common concepts and laws, and otherwise leaves worlds to their own devices, so there are large cultural differences between many of the worlds of the [[Imperium]]. Beyond its borders this is even more pronounced, although only the most isolated worlds are not affected in some way by the values and ideas that exist elsewhere in the universe.

It is important to understand the [[Historical Perspective of the Spinward Marches|history of the Marches]].

## The Marches Today

The Spinward Marches of today, in the year [[IY1105]] since the founding of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]], are the product of great and small events, the distant and more recent past continuing to influence the present with many initiatives and movements afoot. Some are overt, some hidden and some a combination of both. The consequences of some of these actions cannot be predicted even by their instigators. Whatever else may be true, [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] of [[IY1105]] are an interesting place.

### States and Peoples of the Marches

The majority of worlds and people in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] are part of the [[Imperium]] and are dealt with here.  Note however that the [[Imperium]] is not a monolithic organization; it has many power blocs and interest groups, some are aligned with external factions. Others are pursuing their own ends, which may not coincide with the best interests of the [[Imperium]] as a whole.

#### Minor Races

Members of minor races can be encountered across [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], serving aboard starships, working in ports or settling into jobs far from their homeworld. Although the vast majority of citizens are humans or Vargr, there is nothing unusual about seeing an alien (or group of aliens) going about their business.

Some minor races have their homes in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and most do not have starship technology so tend to be encountered only rarely away from home. Minor races are full members of the [[Imperium]] if they are members at all, as there is no discrimination based on species.  However, the homeworlds of most minor races are relatively undeveloped, so their economic importance is small. Minor race homeworlds are represented in the [[Imperium]] by nobles like any other, unless interdicted for their own protection or the safety of others.

## The Imperium in the Marches

The majority of worlds in the Spinward Marches are members of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] and Imperial corporations, officials from various services such as the Bureaucracy and members of the armed forces are common. [[Imperial Navy|Navy]] patrols are also a common occurrence, especially in systems on a major trade route.

Beyond the Imperial border, corporations are still active, although less so, and the Navy makes sweeps into neutral space. The [[Scout Service]] is also very active outside the [[Imperium]]. Local corporations and businesses, whether based in the [[Imperium]] or just outside it, often operate across the border without much regard to whether a world is part of the [[Imperium]] or not. Local regulations vary considerably and matter more than the allegiance of the world.

In this respect the border is a 'soft' one, in that although worlds on the border conduct customs checks like any other, they have no obligation to treat trans-border shipping differently to that coming from within the [[Imperium]]. As always, local conditions vary and some worlds choose to impose taxes on cross-border goods that would not be permitted under free-trade laws within the [[Imperium]]. This is a local matter and of no interest to Imperial authorities, so long as internal trade is not affected.

### Nobility

There is no Archduke, as there is no domain structure for [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] to be part of. If there were, it would be the [[Domain of Deneb]] and probably administered by one of the sector dukes from more developed regions closer to the Imperial core, who would accordingly be granted the title of Archduke.

The Marches have the usual system of Imperial nobility in place, with individual worlds represented by barons or marquises and larger groupings administered by an Imperial count answering to the subsector duke. The position of Sector Duke, the most senior of the subsector dukes, which grants additional powers and responsibilities over the entire sector, is not officially assigned in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

However, the importance of [[Mora]] as a trade center and the 'Gateway to [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]' grants it, and the associated subsector, unmatched importance and so the role of Sector Duke is carried out semi-officially by [[Duchess Delphine]] of [[Mora Subsector|Mora]]. This practice has been in place for centuries by Delphine's ancestors and is commonly accepted as the way things should be.  Only those politically opposed to Delphine herself even question her primacy. She makes a point of not using the title of Sector Duke, although many of her supporters unofficially apply it.

Although [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] remains something of an undeveloped backwater, it is also a frontier region and one that has historically been troubled by threats major and minor. As a result, many nobles maintain larger household forces (huscarles) than is common practice elsewhere in the [[Imperium]]. These forces are still not, for the most part, enormous and mostly consist of a patrol vessel or two and/or a battalion-sized light infantry force.

Some nobles, notably [[Duke Norris]] of [[Regina Subsector|Regina]], maintain considerable forces. Duke Norris has a distinguished background in the Imperial Navy and remains dedicated to protecting the frontier from whatever threats emerge.  Some would call him paranoid but his personal forces have more than once been the first-response formations in a crisis and have a good record. Among them is a unit also known as the 4518th Lift Infantry (Duke Norris' Own Huscarles), raised by the duke as part of his personal forces but spends most of its time on loan to the Imperial Army.

Other nobles also loan part of their personal forces to the Imperial Army or ships to the Colonial Fleet, in the same way that many world governments do, although this practice is rare even in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

Among the other notable members of the nobility in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] is [[Leonard Fratelli Bolden-Tukera]], Marquis of [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]]. Although 'merely' a marquis associated with a single world, his association with the powerful Tukera family gives him great power. The Tukera family are the founders of [[Tukera|Tukera Lines]], one of the Imperial megacorporations, and remain principal shareholders.

Although Tukera, like most megacorporations, has only a limited interest in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], this translates to a large number of ships passing through the bigger ports and a very large amount of money changing hands. Thus far, Tukera's interests are to not push far into the sector but there are rumors of investment in starports, which surely implies an expansion of the firm's operations.

### Military

The Spinward Marches is defended by the [[Spinward Marches Sector Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Navy]] under the command of [[Sector Admiral Santanocheev]], who is based at [[Mora]]. Unusually, there is no depot system in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. Instead, the Sector Fleet's major battle squadrons are usually deployed far forward at bases in the [[Regina Subsector|Regina]], [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]], [[Lanth Subsector|Lanth]] and [[Lunion Subsector|Lunion]] subsectors, with a strategic reserve in [[Trin's Veil Subsector|Trin]] and [[Mora Subsector|Mora]].

Cruiser forces are similarly deployed for the most part, although a significant number are based further back to counter raids like those of the [[Third Frontier War]].  Support vessels, such as tankers, are mainly deployed in the rearward bases along with a fair proportion of the sector fleet's destroyer strength.

Light vessels such as escorts are largely deployed with the major battle squadrons, the remainder dispersed throughout the sector for patrol and security work. In this capacity, they back up the larger numbers of light vessels available to subsector commands.

Two semi-independent commands exist. One is the [[Darrian Squadron]], a small force deployed to the [[Darrian Confederation]] as a gesture of solidarity. The other is rather larger and includes an entire BatRon (Battleship squadRon), albeit of older capital ships and several cruisers, and is based in the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]]. Its responsibility is to maintain the interdiction of the [[Droyne]] worlds at [[Andor]] and [[Candory]], and launch the occasional sweep spinward or rimward of Imperial territory.

This somewhat dispersed deployment has been criticized but there are justifications, one being maintenance of a fierce face to deter aggression. There is also a perceived need to meet any incursion far forward to prevent a repeat of the [[Third Frontier War]], in which the Navy was censured for its perceived lack of activity. There are those who fear these deployments are motivated too much by politics rather than military reality but their protests, despite being repeatedly made at the court of [[Duchess Delphine]], have not been heeded.

Every subsector that contains Imperial worlds has a subsector fleet assigned to it, numbered rather than named. For example, the [[Imperial 193rd Fleet]] is based at [[Frenzie]] and responsible for the defence and security of the [[Vilis subsector]].

The strength of the subsector fleets varies considerably.  Most are built around a core consisting of a cruiser or carrier as flagship, a squadron or two of destroyers and a varying number of escorts and patrol ships. Technically, the subsector fleet also contains system squadrons of worlds that possess them, along with the security and defence squadrons assigned to naval bases. However, since these are not normally capable of leaving their home system, they usually devolve to local control.

The subsector fleets are assigned a mix of vessels supposedly adequate to meet patrol, security and defensive needs within their area of operations but, in practice, there are always too few vessels, and subsector admirals continually ask for reinforcements or assistance from Sector Command. Numbers are also made up by Colonial Fleet vessels, which include Scout Service ships and a few minor combatants on loan from nobles or world governments.

In time of war, some subsector commands could expect to receive cruisers or battleships transferred from Sector Command or deployed as reinforcements in important subsectors. 'Fortress' worlds with their own powerful forces provide for their own defence but the rest of the subsector would be vulnerable until the Sector Fleet could drive invaders out.

A significant marine force is maintained at naval bases for deployment at need. These forces are under Navy command and operate in conjunction with naval assets.  [[Imperial Army]] formations, on the other hand, have an independent command structure.

Like the Navy, the [[Imperial Army]] maintains local headquarters in each subsector with a sector headquarters at Mora. Major [[Imperial Army|Army]] forces, including aerospace and orbital defence formations, are deployed to critical worlds along the frontier, while the remainder are based further back. Detachments are deployed throughout the sector on missions as varied as internal security, counterinsurgency and peacekeeping roles.

There is always conflict going on somewhere, or else a need for Army personnel to assist in disaster-relief operations. For the most part, however, these are minor operations and the Army as a whole is on a peacetime footing.

### Shipping and Communications

Information and goods both move in much the same manner, carried along major trade routes between larger ports then spreading out to worlds along 'feeder' routes, usually aboard smaller ships as distance from the major routes increases. This is adequate for routine cargo but priority items and important messages are often sent aboard small, fast courier ships that cannot make a profit from standard-rate bulk shipping but charge a higher fee for fast or secure service.

Most large organizations, corporations, Imperial services, and armed forces, tend to maintain their own courier network. As a rule, information moves along the x-boat routes at a theoretical maximum speed of jump-4 and, on average, somewhat slower. Dedicated high-jump couriers deliver critical information faster, although at an appropriately high price â€“ jump-6 couriers are not cheap.

![[BtC-5138.jpg]]

Non-urgent and civilian communications across [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] are carried in several ways. The express boat ([[x-boat]]) network carries routine messages in electronic format between x-boat stations, from where the information spreads like ripples on a pond. [[Scout Service]] vessels and commercial couriers carry mail dumps, duplicates of all electronic media to arrive in the past few weeks, to nearby worlds on a regular basis. This means that any given message arrives several times, ensuring that a problem with a ship or data packet simply means a delay rather than loss of data.

Worlds that receive few vessels can be weeks or even months behind the times. The story of a world that does not know the Fourth Frontier War has ended yet is apocryphal but backwater systems do not get updates very often.

Physical mail and freight can be even less common on some worlds. Many small merchant vessels supplement their income as 'mail ships', which simply means having a dedicated cargo area made available for small packages intended for destination worlds. If there are none, the mail space is used for other purposes. Many worlds are part of postal unions that have a dedicated mail ship (or several) plying between them, ensuring electronic mail arrives in a timely fashion and physical items reach their destination sooner or later.

Ships are sometimes chartered to take cargo to a specific destination, or a collection of incidentals will be placed in a standard container and shipped at normal freighting rates whenever a vessel is headed in the right direction. This occasionally results in a vessel delivering a 1-ton shipping container that holds only a few small items. It is of no concern to the vessel operator whether the container is full or not; the fee for carrying it is the same.

The other way that goods move around is through speculative trading on the part of shipowners. Rather than take a cargo in return for a flat fee, a ship operator may decide to buy goods at one port and sell them at another, hoping for a profit. Shipping empty hold space is expensive, so even goods that do not cover these costs are better than carrying nothing.

Exploratory trade is a special case of speculative trade.  In this case, a speculative cargo is taken into an area in order to investigate its trade potential. New markets opened in this way can be very lucrative but risks are high; there is no guarantee of selling the cargo at all.  Exploratory trade is the province of specialist trade scouts and the occasional free trader captain gripped by entrepreneurial spirit.

### Megacorporations

Megacorporations are active in the Spinward Marches; indeed, it was [[Ling Standard Products|LSP]] that first set up a trade base at [[Mora]] and paved the way for expansion into the sector.  Corporate freighters belonging to [[Delgado]] and [[Tukera]] run into [[Mora]] and then up the [[Spinward Main]], although on the whole smaller ships are used for runs deeper into [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

Exceptions include the major lines through to [[Lunion Subsector|Lunion]], [[Trin's Veil Subsector|Trin]] and [[Glisten Subsector|Glisten]], and coreward towards [[Rhylanor Subsector|Rhylanor]] and [[Regina Subsector|Regina]]. These runs are plied by big megacorporate freighters and liners as well as smaller ships.

The financial corporations are active wherever there is a need for investment and those with mining interests (notably [[Ling Standard Products|LSP]] and [[Sternmetal Horizons]]) have facilities on several mainworlds, outsystem planets and planetoid belts. Similarly, trade and commerce exist everywhere, although many areas of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] are not worth megacorporate interest; they simply do not offer enough return.

[[Instellarms]] has major facilities in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], offering weaponry to governmental, corporate and mercenary clients. Its regional headquarters is at Mora but many major worlds have an office or other facilities.

As a rule, the megacorporations can be encountered wherever it is worth their while to operate. Low-tech and low-population worlds are not good prospects and nor are hard-to-reach places. Thus, the big firms are mainly restricted to major worlds with good communications links to the rest of the [[Imperium]]. This creates a niche for smaller corporations and minor firms, including freelance outfits, to make a profit in the gaps between the major players' fields of interest.

### Other Imperial Installations

Other than military bases, [[scout service]] way stations, and research institutes, the [[Imperium]] has a number of installations within [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. Most are located at highports and major cities, such as embassies, administrative centres and recruiting offices for various forces and services. The [[Ministry of Justice]] also maintains a number of facilities ranging from training centres to [[prisons]].

> [!info] Bases Behind the Claw
> The most common bases in the Imperium are detailed on page 227 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , but several others can be found in the Spinward Marches and Deneb, and are marked in the subsector descriptions later in this book.
>
> Depot (D): Used by the Imperium's sector fleets, a depot is a massive naval base, often consuming an entire star system. It can support a sizeable fraction of a sector fleet's ships at once, offering building, repairing, rearming and experimental facilities. As well as servicing ships, depots also have command and control facilities, academies, and mothballed ships.
>
> Corsair Base (C): Popularised by Vargr, corsair bases do not have the full range of facilities of naval bases but provide enough to refuel and maintain corsair ships. A corsair base is often the main staging point from which raids are conducted.
>
> Military Base (M): These are planetary facilities for the support, maintenance, repair and refit of ground vehicles and troops.
>
> Way Station (W): A large Imperial Interstellar Scout Service installation dedicated to the x-boat communication network and servicing scout ships.
>
> Zhodani Base (Z): Zhodani bases are a combination of naval bases and the equivalent of x-boat stations (serviced by jump-4 couriers).
