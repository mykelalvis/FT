Lanth has two contrasting regions. Most of the subsector is very sparse but the coreward and trailing edges are dominated by the Spinward Main, which branches at [[Tureded]]. Traffic bound for [[Rhylanor Subsector|Rhylanor]] and beyond heads coreward-trailing while the primary arm of the Main loops away to spinward, giving access to [[Regina Subsector|Regina]], [[Jewell Subsector|Jewell]], [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] and, ultimately, [[Querion Subsector|Querion]].

As a consequence of its strategic position, [[Tureded]] sees a great deal of traffic coming through its small port, more than the minor installation can really deal with. An upgrade is long overdue and has been delayed by the independent nature of the locals, who are not keen on an influx of offworlders even if they arrive with buckets of cash. It is likely that the port will be expanded soon whatever the locals think of the idea, causing friction between the existing population and those who come to work at the expanded facility.

Traffic on the [[Spinward Main]] is considerable but the rest of the subsector is inaccessible to ships capable of less than jump-3 or 4 capability; although the x-boat route and naval patrols can cross the subsector quickly, commercial traffic has to take the long way round. The sparse area in the spinward and rimward ends of the subsector is known as the [[Abyss Rift]] and seems to deserve its somewhat dramatic name.

Curious jump-related phenomena have been reported in this region for centuries, often by reliable witnesses.  [[Scout Service]] [[x-boat]] pilots plying the Trans-Abyss Rift route have filed reports ranging from radio signals received (impossible) to 'something on the hull, trying to get in' (positively crazed) while in jumpspace, begging the question of whether someone who has spent a week alone in jumpspace is a reliable witness or not.

Despite the bad reputation of the region, the main naval bases for the subsector fleet (the 18th) and those elements of the Sector Fleet deployed to the Lanth subsector are located in the [[Abyss Rift]] or along its edge at [[Ivendo]], [[D'Ganzio]], [[Lanth]] and [[Ghandi]].

All worlds in Lanth are Imperial members. Five ([[Wypoc]], [[Quopist]], [[Rech]], [[Rhise]], and [[Sonthert]]) are [[Amber Zone]]d at present for various reasons. There are also three [[Red Zone]]s of which two ([[Ylaven]], and [[Victoria]]) lie within the [[Abyss Rift]]. A certain segment of the population takes this as additional proof that the rift is a very bad place where awful things happen.

The fourth [[Red Zone]], [[Djinni]], is an uninhabited but apparently habitable world on the [[Spinward Main]] and the [[Red Zone]] makes access to [[Yori]] in [[Regina Subsector|Regina]] problematical for jump-1 ships. Vessels approaching the world are warned off and directed to the system's gas giants to skim fuel. Those that cannot do this are permitted to refuel from a small tanker kept on standby for the purpose, although they are charged over the odds for the privilege. As usual, the Imperial authorities are not forthcoming about why they go to such trouble to keep visitors away from [[Djinni]].
