# PRETORIA
Pretoria was settled by the [[Imperium]] around 300, although there may have been enclaves already on-planet from earlier, unofficial colonization efforts.
Other than having a thin atmosphere, Pretoria was more or less ideal for colonization and rapidly became a major population and economic center. Its position on the jump-2 link between the subsector's two clusters ensured a great deal of through-traffic at the starport, with corresponding economic benefits. As a center for communications it was inevitable that Pretoria would develop into a major political player and its selection as the subsector capital was a foregone conclusion.

Today, Pretoria exerts considerable influence over a number of worlds in the [[Spinward Marches]]. Dubbed the [[Aramis Trace]], these worlds are connected to Pretoria by way of the x-boat route through [[Marz]]. Although not officially part of the [[Duchy of Pretoria]], the governments of these worlds often find it convenient to seek mediation and advice from the duke and will sometimes informally request naval assistance.  Technically, this is a breach of many protocols and could have serious repercussions but the Dukes of Pretoria have traditionally looked out for the worlds of the [[Aramis Trace]] – albeit out of self-interest – and the niceties of protocol are sidelined in favor of getting the job done.

Pretoria has a large and very busy starport but its shipyards are currently closed down. The facilities were ordered to cease production after a series of terrorist attacks and whilst the problem appears to have been resolved, permission has not been granted to resume production. It is widely thought that political rivals may have had a hand in this as the longer the yards are closed the more difficult and expensive it may be to restart production. Indeed, it may be that Pretoria has built its last starship.

Most, if not all, of the terrorism directed at Pretoria was the work of the [[Rachele Society]]. The security services have made many arrests, and attacks have dwindled to virtually nothing, but it is still thought that the Rachele Society may have active cells on Pretoria.
The starport is subject to heavy security as it has been a target in the past but there is a limit to how secure the facility can be made without crippling trade. Tukera Lines has its own facility – more or less equivalent to a Class A starport but lacking shipbuilding capabilities

- in the system and other megacorporations have their

own smaller ports that are off-limits to most traffic.

REDI Redi lies at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, resulting in a low average temperature. This did not make it unsuitable for colonization but Redi never received large-scale population migration or investment, and was left behind during the early development of the subsector. Today, it is regarded as one of the 'missed-
the-boat' worlds that is unlikely ever to be anything but a backwater.

Redi's significance, if that is the right term, is as a probable Ancients site. There is at least one major ruin, with smaller locations suspected to exist in other areas. The Imperial authorities do not normally release information on possible Ancients sites, so it is entirely likely that several artefact caches or ruins have been located and explored by officially sanctioned researchers. The known ruin is disappointing; it consists only of a few structures without machinery or artefacts.
Occasionally, a band of hopeful amateurs finds a way into one of the remaining sealed structures but always return empty-handed.

It is not known what purpose the Ancients had on Redi, if indeed the structures are theirs. Some scientists have suggested that the design of the structures is different and the age is wrong for them to be the work of the Ancients, however Ancients sites do vary considerably and there is no evidence that these structures were built by anyone else.

URNAS Urnas is an uninviting desert world but its location as a jump-1 link in the local cluster, and the presence

of good mineral deposits, attracted early investment.
Urnas had the potential to grow into a major industrial center but its society fragmented soon after the initial colonization and has remained divided ever since.

Urnas is balkanised, with two major states and numerous smaller ones. By far the majority of the population belong to either Sulan, a theocracy of over 1.1 billion inhabitants or Kasame Upu Uluriri. The latter is a technocracy with around 0.7 billion citizens and is slightly ahead in terms of both technological capability and strategy for implementing those technologies.

These two powerful states have been at odds for centuries. Direct conflict is rare, although both seem quite willing to engage in threats of all-out destruction on a routine basis. Typically, the conflict takes the form of minor incidents followed by a great deal of posturing, troop movements and dire warnings. When open warfare has broken out it has been vicious, resulting in the destruction of the starport and major damage to several population centres. Proxy wars among the smaller states are also frequent. As a result, Urnas is Amber Zoned and much of its industrial output goes to weaponry rather than goods for export.

The system's planetoid belt and some of its other planets are inhabited, mainly by mining colonies operated by Sternmetal Horizons and Ling-Standard Products. The two major nations of Urnas also maintain outposts elsewhere in the system. These are generally left alone by tacit agreement – neither power wants to fight a war in space which would inevitably result in the loss of outsystem facilities no matter who won.
