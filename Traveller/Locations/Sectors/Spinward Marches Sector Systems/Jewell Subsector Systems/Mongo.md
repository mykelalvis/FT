The MagnetoDynamics corporation have a strong presence here, providing the technology to extract rare minerals from the vast oceans that cover much of the world. The importance of the produce, coupled with the strategic location of Mongo, made it necessary for the Imperium to build a number of naval and scout bases in the system. .

# DETAILS 

The Mongo system has three gas giants occupying the inner orbits. The planet Mongo is the fourth planet from the sun and an ice world occupies the outer orbit.

Mongo 0404 A368685 A 2 I Ri NI G Mongo is the smallest planet in the Jewell Cluster. The MagnetoDynamics Corporation have a strong presence here, providing the technology to extract rare minerals from the vast oceans that cover much of the world.

Mongo was originally settled in 618 by a number of Vargr refugees from the Second Frontier War. After the war, the [[Imperium]] claimed ownership of Mongo in 620 but allowed the Vargr to remain. A few small human settlements were established but the population was dominated by the Vargr for several centuries.

Shortly before the Third Frontier War, the [[Imperium]] started using new technology to extract minerals from the vast oceans that covered much of the planet. More humans settled here to build and maintain the new facilities. Unfortunately, before production could reach its peak, the Third Frontier War began and in 980 the [[Zhodani]] occupied Mongo to use it as a staging point for their attacks into on the Jewell system.

The [[Imperium]] re-established control of Mongo in 984, two years before the end of the war. To fortify their position, the [[Imperium]] began the construction of several naval and scout bases. However, much of the previous infrastructure of Mongo had been destroyed and the mineral extraction facilities were either destroyed or badly damaged.

In 989 several corporations, backed with funding from Jewell, rebuilt the mineral processing facilities. The most prominent corporation is MagnetoDynamics who have perfected an efficient water filtration system to extract the mineral deposits from the oceans. The population soon grew and within a few years, Mongo had a rich economy and established itself as a key world in the Jewell Cluster.

# ATTITUDES

Mongo has a population of five million, consisting mainly of Human and Vargr. The colonists' ancestors had to endure much before Mongo became the prosperous world that it is today and this heritage is important to them. The people of Mongo are friendly and amenable to most but tend be hostile toward the Zhodani.

# LAWS

All offworld traders must register their business and cargo with the port authorities before they are given permission to land. The government on Mongo has banned all non-medical drugs and all weapons except for personal fire arms and melee weapons.

## MagnetoDynamics Platforms

Referred to as MDP 1, MDP 2, and MDP3 (short for 'MagnetoDynamics Platform'), these three platforms travel the oceans to extract the mineral deposits. Refer to the MDP 1 encounter for details.
