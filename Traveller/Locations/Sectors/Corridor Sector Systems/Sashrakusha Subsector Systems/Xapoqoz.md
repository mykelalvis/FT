Xapoqoz is a poor world.

*   It lacks the population and means to expand its economy at this point in time.
*   Life here is poor, but most people make by and live as happily as they can.
*   This world is a "Twilight Zone World", a planet that is tidally-locked to its star. It has a hot side that permanently faces the star, a cold side that permanently faces away, and a narrow twilight zone in-between.
*   This is a "low technology" world with technology competencies well below technology standards for Charted Space.
*   It is a member of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] in the [[Sashrakusha Subsector]] of [[Corridor Sector]] in the [[Domain of Vland]].
*   It is the homeworld of the [[Xapoqi]].
*   A little over 90% of the population is composed of baseline humans and other non-human sophonts.
*   Slightly under 10% of the population is composed of native [[Xapoqi]].
*   It is considered to lie within the [[Lancian Cultural Region]], though its population aren't especially [[Lancian]] in outlook.

### System Data

The worlds of the system have been surveyed. They consist of:

*   The mainworld.
*   x3 secondary rocky worlds.
*   x1 gas giant.

Only the primary star retains a planetary system. The only significant body orbiting the close binary secondary and tertiary stars is a small airless planetoid (UWP YS00000-0).

### Mainworld Data

#### Mainworld Size (S)

#### Mainworld Atmosphere (A)

Xapoqoz has a pressure of 0.43 to 0.70 atmospheres. The Thin Atmosphere does not require survival gear although it may be hard on sophonts not accustomed to it.

*   It experiences high temperatures.

#### Mainworld Hydrosphere (H)

Xapoqoz has 25-35% of its surface covered by liquid water. It has a few small seas. Wilderness refueling is possible. Water for the inhabitants will be recycled.

#### Mainworld Geography and Topography

No centrally held map of the world exists within AAB Library Data records.

*   The dark side of the world is crusted in frost and fractured ice.


History & Background (Dossier)
----


Xapoqoz is the homeworld of the [[Xapoqi]], a spiny, pillar-like, extremely long-lived, and somewhat sedentary non-human minor race.

It is in many ways an unimportant world that contributes virtually nothing to interstellar prosperity. Indeed, deploying a single navy ship in the system on patrol for a week costs far more than the planetary economy is ever likely to generate. The system is generally bypassed by trade vessels other than the few headed to Tucker "Tucker (world)") in Kivu Subsector. The bizarre natives are the only real point of interest.

### World Starport (St)

Xapoqoz has a **Class E Starport**, a frontier quality installation with few expected amenities. There is unrefined fuel for starships and a limited variety of ship provisions. There is no shipyard of any kind, but there may be parts and technical support for doing minor services and repair. Ports of this classification generally consist of a downport.

### World Population (P)

Xapoqoz has a population of 40,000,000 sophonts (tens of millions).

*   Around 93% of the population (roughly 37 million individuals) are humans or other sophonts.
*   About 7% of the population (approximately 3 million individuals) are native [[Xapoqi]].


#### Urbanization

There are around 37 million Humans on Xapoqoz, mostly dwelling in or close to the twilight zone. Settlements are typically robust and compartmentalised, with cities formed from interconnected villages. This is inefficient in economic terms but enhances survivability in event of a disaster.

The remainder of the population, around three million or so according to the best estimates, are [[Xapoqi]].

#### World Languages

The following languages are most commonly heard:

*   Native Languages, both human and [[Xapoqi]], are typically spoken.
    *   Anglic and Vilani , the two official languages of the Imperium, are only rarely heard.

### World Technology Level (T)

Xapoqoz possesses a Technology Level of TL–2.

*   Common _Communication_ technologies for this TL include: Runners or beast relay, the printing press, long distance signaling such as the heliograph and semaphore.
*   Common _Power Generation_ technologies for this TL include: Water wheels and wind power.
*   Common _Transportation_ technologies for this TL include:
    *   _Land:_ Riding beasts and creature-drawn wheeled vehicles.
    *   _Water:_ Sailing vessels.
    *   _Air:_ Typically not available unless a bodily ability or ride-able flying beasts available.

### World Government (G)

Xapoqoz is governed by a _Participatory Democracy_ where eligible voters determine laws and policy. What determines an eligible voter varies. There may be smaller councils or regional bodies to write the policies voted on. Leadership of the government and all members of the bureaucracy are determined by voting population.

### World Law (L)

Xapoqoz has a moderate law level with laws covering many areas of government and interaction. These laws are simple enough that most people can act as their own advocate, though for serious issues a professional is recommended. Law enforcement officials will be present, but not in great numbers. Light assault weapons, and anything more destructive, are typically regulated or prohibited.

### Imperial High (Landed) Nobility (N)

Xapoqoz, as a member world of the Third Imperium has a member of the Imperial Nobility overseeing the world.

*   It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.

### Trade Data

*   Importance: -2 (very unimportant)

### World Economy

*   Resources: 9 (moderate)
*   Labor: 6 (millions)
*   Infrastructure: 3 (very limited)
*   Efficiency: -4 (very poor)

### World Culture

*   Heterogenity: 5 (harmonious)
*   Acceptance: 5 (very aloof)
*   Strangeness: 3 (somewhat typical)
*   Symbols: 1 (extremely concrete)

#### World Timeline

Major events that have affected this world and the wider region that it lies within:

*   \-9235: the Vilani discover jump drive technology. Over the centuries pioneers and settlers gradually spread across Charted Space.
*   \-4045 to \-2204: the Ziru Sirka claims and settles worlds across the region.
*   \-2404 to \-2215: the Interstellar Wars.
*   \-2204 to \-1776: the Rule of Man administers the worlds of the region.
*   \-1776 to 0: the Long Night. There is widespread regression within the area and some worlds become barren.
*   The Year 0: the Third Imperium is founded.
*   300\-420: the Imperial First Survey charts the system.
*   604\-622: the Civil War.
*   624: the Express Boat Network is established.
*   995\-1065: the Imperial Second Survey charts the system.
*   1065: the Second Survey is published. Information about the system becomes widely available.
