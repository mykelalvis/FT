# LUNE CLASS FREELANCER

![[Lune-011.jpg|200]]

> The River Lune runs through the city of Lancaster.

It’s been said that starships are the lifeblood of the Traveller Universe. This small book details the Lune Class Freelancer, one of the many thousands of vessels in use throughout known space.

The Lune is intended to be used either as a player’s vessel, as part of an encounter or as part of an adventure in itself. Although set in the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]], with little effort it should fit in any other setting.

## The Ship

The Lune is a multirole ship designed with small groups in mind such as freelancers, agents and adventurers. With decent armour, weapons and engines, she can fulfil a number of roles. Its Jump 3 engines are ideal for long distant runs across sparse sectors of space.

The streamlined hull means she can land planet side and fuel from oceans or by skimming gas giants. A launch and air/raft are carried also, ideal for runabouts, shuttling from planet to surface etc. Although not hugely effective as a cargo carrier, it has room for 26 tons of cargo (20 in the cargo bay and 6 in the launch) and could be employed as a protected cargo vessel or courier for small loads requiring extra protection.

The ship is decorated throughout in starship chic, which is to say that everything is brushed steel or aluminum with stenciled letters and recessed lights and doors. Rubber strips run down the center of each corridor to provide traction leaving 5cm along each edge for the LED lighting. LEDs are used in emergencies to show the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit.

# Notable Ships of the Class

## 8 Ball

![[Lune-016.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-016.jpg|8 Ball]]

A casino ship that travels the trade lanes of the Spinward Marches specializing in smaller stations and colonies that don’t have any other similar establishment.. This is a standard Lune, but with the cargo bays converted to casino use.

### Dagger

![[Lune-017.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-017.jpg|Dagger]]

A ship with both cargo holds converted to barracks space and equipment space to carry 10 troops for behind the lines insertion by the mercenary unit Khan’s Wrath. Dagger is a [[#Lune-G Class Gunship]] variant.

### Narishha

![[Lune-018.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-018.jpg|Narishha]]

Set up as [[#Dagger]] but used by the 1st squad of the Archduke Norris’ Own Marine Commando Unit.

### The Shark
![[Lune-019.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-019.jpg|The Shark]]

Originally the Lune Koi when it was captured by pirates and then converted to the current layout they changed the IFF signal to Lune Shark. The lower cargo hold now has a breaching Airlock which attaches to another ship a then cuts its way in. The Shark is a standard Lune, but with the addition of a breaching airlock on the lower deck.

### Gold Lune

![[Lune-021.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-021.jpg|Gold Lune]]

Run in its original configuration by the Villani Merchant Prince Jo’Lase as his personal ship, even though he owns a fleet of vessels. He is very fond of the ship as it was the one that made him his first MegaCredit. Gold Lune is an M variant Lune.

### Kaanruu

![[Lune-022.jpg|100]]
[[Lune-022.jpg|Kaanruu]]

A vessel commissioned for the scout service and still in use by them to this day. The lower cargo hold is smaller with 3 labs for geology, chemistry and biology and some extra supply space taken out of the middle cargo hold. This is a custom variant of the standard Lune.


![[Lune-075.jpg]]
# Crew & Passengers

Designed for a crew of 6 (captain/pilot, co-pilot/navigator, medic and 3 engineers/gunners) most ships run with multirole crews, with each member performing more than one role. Normally the Lune would not carry passengers, though if passengers are carried the crew could double bunk, allowing up to 3 Mid Passage passengers to be carried dependent on the level of the ship’s crew.

# A Tour of the ship

![[Lune-079.jpg|200]]
[[Lune-079.jpg|Ship Layout]]

### Deck One Bridge/Upper Engineering

This deck contains the sensor arrays, bridge, main airlocks, magazines, med bay, ships lockers and workshop and upper engineering.

The bridge is of typical size for the 3 crew positions here, Pilot, Navigator/Sensors and Comms/Weapons. The Bridge has an emergency hatch in the ceiling and Iris Valve to the living quarter’s corridor in the floor. In an emergency it is possible to reach the sensors through a panel in the console in front of the pilot’s chair. The crawl space is tight but allows someone to gain physical access to the sensors for repairs or on the spot recalibrations.

Leaving the bridge via the iris valve we enter a corridor leading past the computer room on the right and the Ship’s locker on the left. Also access to the dorsal turret is in the ceiling though its operation is usually controlled from the bridge. Continuing past these rooms we go through another iris valve onto a cross corridor the full width of the ship with access to the magazines and main airlocks at either end. Before each airlock, is a small area for the donning of vacc suits and the storage of equipment regularly used off ship. If we continue straight ahead though, we come to the workshop on the left and sick bay on the right. The workshop is a fully kitted out room for the repair, maintenance and modification of gear and ship board machinery/equipment. The med bay is well equipped and stocked with facilities for routine treatment and emergency surgery. The med bay could easily handle a couple of outpatients at a time.

Moving through the Iris valve at the end we come onto another corridor that spans the ship and with access to corridors going back towards the mid-section and above to the subcraft hangar. Going through the Iris valve directly in front of us we enter the upper engineering room, which is very spacious with a generous work console for the engineer of the ship. Access to the actual machinery is through either of the Iris valves in the room. The engineering room contains the fuel processors and the power plant and jump drives.

![[Lune-081.jpg]]
### Deck Two Living area/Cargo & Subcraft Hangar

Starting in the common room at the front, which is spacious and comfortable which helps to alleviate the stress from long periods of travel in Jump space where very little is needed to be done on board. Attached to this room is a small galley and another room usually fitted as a ship’s office and a small fresher for the common room. It also doubles as a private space for the crew or another recreation area, there’s a small console on the table allowing access to the ships computer.

Heading through the iris valve out into the living quarters corridor we have the doors to 6 staterooms for the crew, each of which contains a bunk, locker, table (with console, chair and additional space for stowing gear. Iris valves in the ceiling and floor allow access to the deck below and above. Heading out of this corridor puts us in the central area of the ship with access out to the wing mounted turrets and maneuver drive pods and the main cargo hold. Each turret has a manual fire control station; normally the turrets would be controlled from the bridge. Access to the fuel tanks which make up the majority of the wings can be made from this central corridor. At the very rear of the deck is the machinery connecting the engineering sections on deck one and two.

The cargo bay itself is over two decks and if required the floor of the bay on this deck can be removed to connect both bays into one larger bay. The central area is separated from the subcraft hanger by more iris valves. The subcraft itself, is usually a 20 ton launch which fits snugly in the hangar. There are three iris valves that allow access to the launch, one aft, one portside and one starboard of the launch. Unusually the launch docks aft end first, this is so the internal cargo bay of the launch is near the cargo bay of the ship, allowing cargo to be transferred to and from the ship and launch easily.

### Deck Three Air/Raft Bay & Lower Engineering

This deck is very simple; we have the air/raft bay in the bow with a corridor that bisects more fuel tanks until it reaches the lower cargo hold in the centre. At the stern is the lower engineering room containing the rest of the jump drive and power plant machinery. Unlike the engineering section on deck one, there is no control station here, just access to the drives should anything need maintenance or repair.

Throughout the ship there are floor mounted access hatches to the landing gear, they also double as escape hatches.

# Example Ship/Crew:

#### Lune Star

The Lune Star is one of the earliest of this class built. It left the shipyard back in [[IY1091]] and was purchased by Jannick von Grin who wasn’t a big fan of the traditional Nobles Yacht, he was once quoted as saying that “A Yacht is like painting a target on your back, every pirate knows what they are looking for”. He had the space usually used as an upper cargo hold made into a suite of rooms for himself and his wife as well as a couple of entertainment rooms. He then used the ship both as a regular and safari vessel (with the lower hold being his trophy room).

After an encounter which cored the ship destroying the cargo holds as well as extensive areas in the living quarters the ship was refurbished back to the original deck plans and Jannick Junior,  now head of the family, used the vessel as a trade vessel for many years until he mysteriously handed the deeds over to a lower ranked officer Derrick Montgomery.

### Captain Derrick ‘ Dagger ’ Montgomery
![[Lune-109.jpg|200]]
[[Lune-109.jpg|Captain Montgomery]]

```
Male, Merchant, Age 34
Str 6, Dex 10, End 8, Int 8, Edu 8, Soc 4
Pilot (space craft) 1, Comms 1, Broker 1, Melee (blade) 2,
Vacc Suit 1, Streetwise 1, Leadership 1, Admin 1
```

Derrick was having an unimpressive career in the merchant navy until one day he stumbled upon one of his superior officers in possession of smuggled goods. He never once tried to expose or blackmail the officer and the officer treated him well and made sure he got promotions when they came up. He mustered out with an older Lune class ship, the officer’s inheritance, and has since been peddling the space lanes in his own time, making some money here and there.

He has a reputation for being quick with a knife, but actually it’s where he stores the film/data of the officer with his smuggled goods, and he hates fighting. A closet coward, he fears the day when the crew find out he isn’t all he is cracked up to be. However he is a good leader, very charismatic and easy to get along with.

### Simone Johnson – Navigator/Sensors

```
Female, Merchant, Age 36
Str 5, Dex 6, End 9, Int 9, Edu 6, Soc 2
Pilot (small craft) 1, Sensors 2, Broker 1, Gun Combat (slug pistol) 1,
Vacc Suit 1, Astrogation 1, Computers 2, Medic 1
```

Simone is the epitome of an African queen, not that she would know where or what Africa was or is. She has worked her way up through the streets into the merchant navy and served on the same ship as Derrick when he mustered out. They struck up a friendship and she mustered out at the same time and joined his crew. She is very protective of Derrick and senses his reluctance for combat and fighting; she doesn’t think any less of him but tries to make sure that nothing will expose his weakness. She is an excellent Navigator and pretty good on the sensors too, often spotting possible trouble long before they can spot the Lune giving them time to run and hide or make for the nearest port.

![[Lune-111.jpg]]
### Joshua Killingtree – Weapons/Comms

```
Male, Navy, Age 36
Str 5, Dex 6, End 9, Int 9, Edu 6, Soc 2
Comms 1, Zero-G 1, Gunnery (turret) 1, Streetwise 1, Gun Combat (laser pistol) 1,
Flyer (grav) 1, Pilot (small craft) 1
```

Joshua is getting bored, since joining the crew a couple of years ago; he hasn’t fired the ships guns in anger at all. He feels wasted on the ship, although his comms skills have improved a lot over the years it’s not what he wants to do. He has taken to buying soft drugs and taking them to alleviate the boredom; he isn’t too bothered if the rest of the crew find out, since he feels like the spare wheel on board anyway.

![[Lune-113.jpg]]
### William, Bill and Billy Grennbourough – Engineers

```
William
Male, Drifter, Age 22
Str 8, Dex 8, End 6, Int 7, Edu 6, Soc 1
Engineer (M-drive) 1, Engineer (Jump Drive) 1, Vacc Suit 1, Gunner (turret) 1,
Streetwise 1, Drive 1, Melee (unarmed) 1

Bill
Male, Drifter, Age 26
Str 10, Dex 7, End 7, Int 7, Edu 5, Soc 2
Engineer (life support) 1, Engineer (power) 1, Vacc Suit 1, Streetwise 1, Drive 1,
Melee (unarmed) 1, Medic 1, Mechanic 1

Billy
Male, Drifter, Age 30
Str 11, Dex 6, End 9, Int 7, Edu 6, Soc 4
Engineer (electronics) 1, Vacc Suit 1, Streetwise 1, Computer 1,
Melee (unarmed) 1, Mechanic 1, Flyer (grav) 1
```

These 3 brothers signed on when Derrick first got the ship after he found them in a portside bar about to be arrested for vagrancy. He gave them a job and a home and since then they have been very grateful for the opportunity. They are fiercely loyal to Derrick, and have no problem with the fact that he seems to prefer talking, running or hiding to combat, because it makes their lives easier, no repairs from combat, just maintenance. They are all good with their hands, but each has made it their job to be the best at one of the ships systems, so William does the Drives, Bill does the Life support and general maintenance, and Billy has taken on the electronics. All three of them are handy with their fists and have innumerable contacts throughout the sectors ports and stations.

# Ship's Boat

## Gillow Class Launch

The Gillow is a typical launch and is carried as standard by the Lune Class Freelancer. Its typical role is ship to surface transfer of small amounts of cargo and passengers, though in an emergency it can be used as a life boat. The craft is piloted by a single crewman and has room for 11 passengers. In the aft section is room for 6 tons of cargo, although if the couches are removed a further 5 ½ tons can be carried. For improved atmospheric handling it has aerofins which retract into the hull when entering a hangar.

# Lune Variants

There is a number of Lune variants, the following are two of the most common variants built.

## Lune-M Class Merchant

The M version removes the sub craft hangar, missile rack, workshop and medbay. This stripped down version can carry an extra 30 tons of cargo, making it a little more favourable for couriers and merchants. Much like the standard version, some remove the air/raft also, for some extra space. The smaller cargo bay on deck one is often used to store mail.

## Lune-G Class Gunship

Dropping the cargo hold completely and altering the weapons load for more heavy guns, this an up gunned assault/gunship variant, popular with military and paramilitary forces. Instead of a workshop the G fits an armory and a small amount of cargo space, usually for extra equipment and supplies.

The main cargo hold has been stripped out and barracks space for 10 personnel has been installed instead. These can act as extra gunners and crew, but there primary purpose is to man the [[#Fire Gillow Class Assault Launch]] launch the Lune-G carries.

# New Equipment

## Workshop

This has a wide selection of tools and equipment for the repair, fabrication and modification of equipment and ships systems. Ideal for small maintenance jobs, it can fabricate small ship parts, although larger items would still have to be replaced or perhaps patched up. Usually contains a work bench, tools, test area and some larger tools, the exact contents are up the referee.

TL8 4 Tons 2 Mcr.

## Med Bay

A fully fitted medical facility for emergency and routine treatment. This has room for one patient, though it handle some outpatients as well. It contains a single bed, diagnostics system, medical supplies and a desk with a console. Basic surgery can be done also. Ideally the Med Bay should be staffed by a ship’s doctor, though some of the systems can do medical diagnoses and aid the less trained crew. Like the workshop, the exact contents are up to the referee and use of a Med bay could allow a bonus DM to any medical task.

TL8 4 Tons 1 Mcr.
