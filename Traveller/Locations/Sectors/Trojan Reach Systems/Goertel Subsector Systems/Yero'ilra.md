The Yero'ilra system (Trojan Reach 1124 D500897- 7) is known colloquially as “Aolr ieakhaó suirisao” (pronounced yōlər yakóu swír·ə·sou) which roughly translates as the “iron spine.” The Aslan vassal clans who own the land in this system nicknamed it centuries ago with more than a touch of vanity. They believed their metal-rich planets to be the backbone of the Glorious Empire. While it is true that the system sits astride the dwindling Empire (which at one time extended further rimward) and its ore stocks are impressive, the Empire’s ruling Tokoueáwe clan are only beginning to see Yero'ilra’s value after depleting resources elsewhere.

Iséyurliyfe, Yero'ilra’s stable main sequence star, might have been just cool enough to host one or more hospitable planets were it not for the disruptive presence of the “twin brothers,” a pair of red dwarves that effectively orbit just outside the habitable zone. Stellar emanations from the more unstable of the two dwarves has system-wide repercussions. More about that later.

Yero'ilra itself is the largest rocky planet in the system with a diameter of 8,452km. The planet features a surprising 0.85G due to its immense iron core. In addition to massive lodes of iron, gold, silver, platinum, tungsten, and lanthanum, Yero'ilra is rich in rare earth metals and has large deposits of radioactives sprinkled sporadically beneath its surface. These radioactives, coupled with the planet’s powerful magnetic field and frequent exposure to stellar flares, make it absolutely essential to use heavily shielded vehicles and vacc suits when one is outdoors.

The quality of life on Yero'ilra, as it is on any vacuum world, is highly dependent on technology. The system is nominally rated as TL 7 which is accurate for the vast majority of society; however, the ruling vassal clans live at a much higher technology level, courtesy of trade with their rimward neighbors.

Lush artificial habitats and hunting grounds are maintained by the nobility with no access granted to the majority of the population. Lesser ahriy, the families of second sons, outcasts, and slaves live mostly in conditions of urban blight and abject squalor. Little attempt has been made to make their lives tolerable in the slightest, resulting in a great deal of discontent.

The ruling clans have a zero-tolerance approach when dealing with subversive elements and have equipped their military to address it. Fully twenty percent of the army’s budget goes toward non-lethal weaponry and anti-riot vehicles. In addition, all branches of the military have very active counter-insurgency branches that must constantly address dissension in the ranks, civic unrest, and slave rebellions.

Life for most on Yero'ilra is unpleasant, which as far as the ruling clans are concerned, is just fine. The reigning philosophy is that a disgruntled populace is a motivated one. In a working capitalist society, this might well be the case, but where there is virtually no social mobility, the tenets of such beliefs are ill-founded at best.

Besides its ores and minerals, Yero'ilra’s chief exports are slaves and mercenaries. As the most populated Empire system near The Bight, Yero'ilran slavers have made their presence known in neighboring human systems, raiding them frequently. Many of the captured slaves are put to work in Yero'ilran mines, but thousands are sold on other worlds of the Empire. In addition, Yero'ilran mercenaries are regarded throughout the Trojan Reach for their discipline and savagery. Thousands have recently been employed by the human system of Acis in their ongoing war with Tyr.

Unlike most citizens of Yero'ilra, the ruling clans, led by the Yetrai, live in great opulence, their material comforts and habitats paid for with the system’s mineral riches. Envious of the natural foliage and plentiful hunting grounds of other worlds in the Glorious Empire, the nobility has attempted to replicate such environments in posh, reclusive, and well-defended subterranean estates.

Both the orbital and down starports on Yero'ilra reflect the myopic and utilitarian approach exhibited elsewhere.

The “orbital” port is actually a converted planetoid located in the planet’s L4 Lagrange point. In addition to being over a million kilometers from its host planet, it is very small considering the traffic and population it purports to serve. Given the abundant stellar radiation it must absorb, the natural shielding of a dense planetoid was probably a good idea, but its remote location and lack of development is evident. Less than half of its usable volume has been bored out and it has not been outfitted with artificial gravity. The spin applied to the planetoid gives it a meager 0.4G. While a few of the trappings of a real orbital port are present, including docking bays for traders and a rudimentary startown, it has mostly been relegated as a base for the clans’ system defense boat squadrons. In addition to the SDB base at its orbital starport, Yero'ilra’s moon, Oei, is the site of an SDB maintenance base and personnel barracks.

The downport, for what it lacks in services and amenities, is expansive and busy. Visitors chafe at the fuel and hospitality shortages, but its astrographic location in the Empire make it a busy port regardless. While the vassal clans who run the planet have abjectly failed to develop the downport, offworlders have taken it upon themselves to make it the hub that it is. Investors from Syoakh and Hliyh have built ramshackle trade, transport, and lodging facilities. As one might expect, the lack of coordinated planning has resulted in a civil engineer’s nightmare, replete with rampant traffic, pollution, and crime. Yet somehow it manages to work and serves as a bustling free trade zone.

In addition to the downport, Yero'ilra has eight major cities, seven of which are in the southern hemisphere. Ayekhe, in the northern hemisphere, is the capital of Yero'ilra and the seat of the Yetrai clan. Transit between cities is primarily by rail. Of all Yero'ilra’s accomplishments, the highly efficient train line might very well be its crowning achievement. It provides high- speed access to all the planet’s major cities and most of its major mines and industrial complexes.

Yero'ilra’s day is 18.29 hours long and its year is 492. standard days. Its steep axial tilt of 44.5° is due to two factors: several large asteroid impacts endured over the eons and the gravitational pull of nearby double- star, Oúolaoeis-Oúoyukhai (a.k.a., the “twin brothers”). The two stars are popularly anthropomorphized by Yero'ilrans with Oúolaoeis cast in the role of “angry brother,” and Oúoyukhai as “sleepy brother.”

Oúolaoeis has a highly temperamental disposition, with its frequent stellar flare tantrums hurling copious amounts of electromagnetic radiation into the system.

The dangers posed by the “angry twin” make it virtually impossible for starships to safely skim for fuel at the gas giant, Ahiuryu. Travellers must bear the inconvenience of performing wilderness refueling at Ftaoheilaraw, located two orbits further into the outer zones. Skimming is completely unregulated in Yero'ilra system with all SDBs devoted to protecting the mainworld.

In addition to hindering access to Ahiuryu, Oúolaoeis makes it difficult to mine the metal-rich world of Htirlaosea. Sandwiched between the two dwarf stars and stretched into a flattened sphere by their gravitational fields, the planet bears the brunt of Oúolaoeis’ furious outbursts. Yero'ilrans have attempted several mining expeditions to the planet but have ultimately failed to plunder its riches, with a commensurate loss of life and equipment. The planet is currently mined by robots, but Yero'ilra is notoriously short on the technical personnel needed to properly crew and execute this enterprise.

The clans have established outposts on Yesaea (in the inner system) and Khtao Uiyo (a gas giant moon in the outer system), both of which were purported to have ample resources in early geological surveys; however, neither has shown the promise of Htirlaosea.

The future of Yero'ilra is very much in doubt. While the Yetrai currently hold sway over a dozen or so lesser clans, they have been challenged to several ritual battles and wars of assassins. So far, they have held off all challengers. The Yetrai are covetous of their inheritance. Despite its lack of rolling veldt and lush landscapes, Yero'ilra is a shining ingot of great value to the Glorious Empire. In diplomatic circles the Tokoueáwe clan goes out of its way to publicly denigrate the value of Yero'ilra, but in private the powerful offworld clans of the Empire envy the possessors of this resource-rich system. It’s only a matter of time before they assert their will on the vassal clans and attempt to wrest control from them.

In addition to its myriad political and social problems, Yero'ilra is suffering from an acute labor shortage. Actively raiding vulnerable neighboring systems for slaves ameliorates this problem to some degree but it fails to address Yero'ilra’s bigger problems. Like the Glorious Empire at large, the system has suffered from a dearth of technical talent. The Yetrai hope to address this problem with a new initiative to obtain slaves with engineering and scientific training.
