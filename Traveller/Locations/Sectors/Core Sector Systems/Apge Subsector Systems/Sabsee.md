# Sabsee

In addition to the FGMP-16, which is described in the Central Supply Catalogue , Research Station Beta on Sabsee has created a number of other interesting armor and weapons technologies.

#### Ion Rifle

At higher Tech Levels, ion technology has been miniaturised to the level that it can be used for personal weapons. At TL14, a hit from an ion rifle can disrupt electronic equipment on vehicles or powered armor for 1D rounds. Powered armor with Protection +20 or higher is immune and the weapon does not affect vehicle with Armor 4+. At TL15, the ion rifle is considerably more expensive but can penetrate personal armor with any Protection and can momentarily disrupt vehicles with Armor 8 or less.

Ion Rifle 15 800 Special 5 Cr24000 100 Cr8000 Zero-G

#### Ion Shield

As with any weapons system, the stakes are ratcheted ever upward by new technological innovations. Powered armor may be equipped with an Ion Shield that negates the effects of personal ion weapons.

#### Personal Energy Shield

There are times when armor is needed but the appearance of having armor is not. Nobles visiting hostile territory, military officers inspecting undisciplined militia, diplomats making first contact and others may require defensive armor without looking as if they are geared up for combat. The personal energy shield creates an invisible gravitic field around the wearer, which repels ballistic and all energy attacks except lasers. The shield is powered by a small, unobtrusive battery that may be worn at the belt or beneath the clothing in order to conceal its presence. A standard battery provides six hours of protection.

A skilled wearer can overload the battery to get more Protection by making a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check to recalibrate the device. Success with an Effect of 0-3 provides Protection +18 but reduces the battery life by one half. Effect of 4–5 provides Protection +24 with one half the battery life. An Effect of 6+ provides Protection +24 with no reduction in battery life. The Traveller must reattempt the calibration with each recharge of the battery.

#### Stun Rifle

A non-lethal weapon, designed to inflict a massive shock to the target or targets, incapacitating them. The stun rifle employs similar technology to that of the stunner (see page 116 of the Central Supply Catalogue ), inflicting more damage and providing a blast option. When set to blast, the stun rifle receives the Blast trait. Blast shots inflict reduced damage of 3D and consume two charges from the magazine.
