[[Riverland]] [[Riverland]] 0302 C566A99–9 0302 C566A99–9 Z Hi GZ Hi G So called for the extensive river network that weaves through the main continent, [[Riverland]] is an overpopulated world of bureaucrats who administer Zhodani interests in Jewell. [[Riverland]] also has a large number of re-education centres to service the needs of its people in this subsector. 

This system has seven planets including one gas giant. Riverland is the second planet from the sun.

Riverland 0302 C566A99–9 Z Hi G The planet was named for the extensive river network that weaves through the main continent. It was colonized in 347 when the [[Zhodani]] were establishing themselves in the Jewell subsector.

During the Frontier Wars, many civilians relocated here from the border worlds of Chwistyoch and Clan for fear of Imperial attacks on those systems. With each influx of refugees, additional administration and facilities were required to meet the needs of the population and also to ensure their happiness.

Real estate became such a premium during the Third Frontier War that a number of experimental underwater cities were built. These proved successful and helped to ease the overcrowding problem on the mainland. A natural progression from these cities, was the construction of underwater processing facilities used to extract minerals from the oceans. Mineral ore is fast becoming one of the leading exports on Riverland.

As one would expect on a world with underwater cities and mining facilities, marine transport is very common on Riverland. There are a variety of boats and submarines for transporting people and goods to between locations. An underwater monorail has also been constructed in pressure tubes that connect the major underwater settlements.

Riverland is now an overpopulated world of bureaucrats who administer [[Zhodani]] interests in the Jewell subsector. It is also home to a large number of re-education centres to service the needs of the [[Zhodani]] people in Jewell.

# ATTITUDES

Riverland has the highest re-education rate of all [[Zhodani]] worlds in Jewell, which is hardly surprising considering the population now numbers nearly 30 billion. The authorities have to carefully monitor all settlements to prevent overcrowding, which is the cause of most unhappiness.

This world is already overcrowded so anyone who comes here is usually making the situation worse. As a result, most if the inhabitants of Riverland are unfriendly and often rude to offworlders but some people are a little more tolerant with visiting traders.

# LAWS

All travellers wishing to land on Riverland must request permission to do so and permission is often denied, especially to non-[[Zhodani]] visitors unless they have goods that can be traded. All weapons, drugs, and information are illegal here.

## Undertown
To help ease the overcrowding in Kashev, parts of the city were developed underground, which has become known as Undertown. Undertown is inhabited exclusively by proles.

## Netzba
Netzba is the largest underwater city and water processing plant on Riverland. It is located 60km west of Kashev and is becoming a popular destination for offworld merchants. The water processing plant is a high security area and although it is a legitimate facility, it is also the cover for a research facility built on top of the Tripwire device.
