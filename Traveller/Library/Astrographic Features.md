# Astrographic Features

Charted Space contains no major astrographic features such as black holes and only one rather unimpressive nebula. It does, however, have a few anomalies and interesting features. Stars tend to occur in groups (termed clusters) or long snaky chains (known as Mains). Trade and commerce tends to move along the mains as they allow vessels to navigate between systems with ease. Crossing to another main requires a ship with a longer range or some means to refuel in deep space.

Many clusters and segments of a main have their own cultural, astrographic or economic identity. These are sometimes named,for example the [[Bowman Arm]] in the [[Spinward Marches]] is a segment of the [[Spinward Main]] centring on the [[Bowman]] system.

The empty space between clusters or mains is sometimes referred to as a rift. These small rifts are usually no more than 1â€“4 parsecs wide and are hardly worthy of the name. Even the Great and Lesser Rifts of Charted Space are nothing compared to the vast gulf between spiral arms of the galaxy. However, they are a significant navigational obstacle to vessels using Jump drive.

A few odd features have been reported, though some may be nothing more than wild spacers' tales. They include a rosette system of five equidistant worlds orbiting a common star. This could not have occurred naturally. Nor could the rumored ringworld located in the Vargr Extents. There are also a number of broken planets and shattered moons that seem to indicate a war of titanic proportions in the distant past.
