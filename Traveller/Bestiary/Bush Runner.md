## BUSH RUNNERS

_(Suffitifer andrewsii, et al)_

![[JTAS-01-055.jpg]]

Adult bush runners weigh approximately 50kg and are between 1. and 1.5 meters in length. Physically, they resemble a cross between the [[Terra|Terran]] kangaroo (Macropus and others) and the [[Etan]] fruit-lizard (Fructoraptor). The skeleton is calciferous, internal and differs from the typical [[Terra|Terran]] vertebrate only in minor details.

Bush runners are bipedal, using a muscular pair of hind legs for locomotion, a smaller pair of forearms for food acquisition and a long tail as a balancing organ whilst running; a third leg when assuming an upright posture and a weapon when threatened.

The head is a typical arrangement of brain surrounded by a bony cranium, upon which are laterally paired sensory organs (eyes, nose and ears), as well as a ventrally located mouth. The teeth are arranged in common fashion for omnivores (dental formula 2·1·2·2) and faced on their grinding surfaces with a silicate material rather than the enamel of [[Terra|Terran]] organisms.

Respiration is the usual O<sup>2</sup> /CO<sup>2</sup> exchange accomplished by paired lungs located in the upper body cavity. The circulatory system is closed, the heart four-chambered and blood gases are transported by a copper-based hemoglobin, which makes the blood blue in colour.

Bush runners are omnivorous and eat fruits, nuts, grubs and such small animals as they can catch. They are usually found on the edges of forested regions, semi-forested savannahs and areas such as bogs where fruit-bearing plants grow in profusion.

They congregate in family groups of two parents and 6-12 juveniles in various stages of development. There are two sexes, which pair for life, producing between two and three young per season. Depending on the length of the local year, bush runners will have from 1 to 3 litters per mating season.

Bush runner meat is quite succulent and a deep blue in colour. Large quantities in a short period of time can be poisonous, however, so the meat is usually used as a colourful garnish for certain gourmet dishes. Adult bush runners of both sexes produce a musk from glands located in the tail during mating season; this musk contains a compound called suffitoleum, used in the manufacture of expensive perfumes. The compound has resisted all attempts at synthesis and the musk of animals raised in captivity does not contain it. Therefore, on most planets that have bush runners, the animals are allowed to roam free and hunted under strict licensing arrangements for the two to five grams of suffitoleum that can be recovered from each adult.
