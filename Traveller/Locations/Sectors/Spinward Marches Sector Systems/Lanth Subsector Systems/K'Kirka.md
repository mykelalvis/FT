# K'KIRKA

KKirka is, to most starfarers, little more than a stopover on the [[Spinward Main]]. Marketing materials proclaim it as the 'last good port before [[Regina]]', which is highly inaccurate but refers to the cluster of [[Amber Zone|Amber]] and [[Red Zone]]s that must be traversed before reaching more salubrious surroundings. The port itself is nothing special, although its traders play on the 'difficult run ahead'
theme to sell overpriced starship spares and luxury items imported from further along the [[Spinward Main]].

K'Kirka is primarily a mining colony, featuring a small population working largely automated mine sites scattered around the globe, with the port acting as economic hub. The world has two unusually dense moons and an extensive collection of captured asteroidal debris, all of which moves in an incredibly complex but somehow stable pattern. It is virtually impossible for this to have occurred naturally; the current, most popular, theory is that the system was set up this way as some sort of astrophysics experiment conducted on a huge scale, probably by the Ancients.
