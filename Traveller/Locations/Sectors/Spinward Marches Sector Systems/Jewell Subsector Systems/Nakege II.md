Nakege II 0505 C333313 ALo NI Nakege II is a small world that remained unpopulated until 988 when Spinward Salvage LIC claimed it along with Nakege. The corporation settled a small colony and built a modest starport. A number of sizable salvage yards were also built to store the wrecks transported from Nakege.

Although most people on Nakege II work for the corporation, there are also those who provide the infrastructure to support the small population. These people include merchants, farmers and other tradesmen. The population of 4,000 people consists of a number of races. Approximately 60% human, 25% Vargr and the remaining 15% is made up of Aslan and minor races.

# ATTITUDES

Since the majority of the population work for Spinward Salvage, Nakege II is more like a place of work than a typical planet. During business hours, most people tend to be focussed on their job and can seem a little unfriendly.

However, once the workforce has finished for the day they head to the bars to unwind and enjoy their free time. When encountered in this environment they are a friendly and tolerant society.

# LAWS

Visitors must land at the starport or other designated landing sites. Personal arms are allowed but all other weapons are banned. Highly addictive drugs, combat drugs, agent programs and intrusion programs are also illegal on Nakege II.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Locus City
: By most standards Locus would be a small town but here on Nakege it is the capital, housing the entire population of 4,000. The city has a number of bars in both the residential and commercial districts, with the latter area also including government buildings and a variety of shops. Locus is situated just east of the starport.

Salvage Yards: There are three salvage yards situated to the north, south and west of the starport. These tend to be reasonably well

organised, with each one specialising in a particular type of salvage such as ground based vehicles, small craft or spacecraft. Each yard has a small reception building where customers can pay or request the use of cranes and transport vehicles (for a small fee, of course).

Headquarters: The headquarters is situated in Locus City and is used to run and administer the corporation here on Nakege. Although the governmental aspect of the corporation is run separately, there is a strong relation between the two and frequent communication ensures that both the corporation and the planet are run smoothly.

Construction Yard: There is only one construction yard on the planet and it is located between the starport and the western salvage yard. It has basic facilities to construct and modify vehicles and small craft. Spinward Salvage charge standard fees for the use of their facilities and they are available to anyone with the credits.

The construction yard also has several spacecraft for sale that have been salvaged and reconditioned. Some of these can be seen around the yard, whilst the larger or non-atmospheric vessels are in orbit around the planet near the HighPort.
