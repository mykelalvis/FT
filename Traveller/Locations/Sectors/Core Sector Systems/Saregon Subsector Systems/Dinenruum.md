Dinenruum is a Trojan planet, perched in the L4 Lagrange point of the system's orange subgiant primary and the larger of its two red dwarf companions. The rarity of this phenomenon makes Dinenruum a natural wonder of Charted Space.

A few decades ago, the planet was the site of a large and growing colony and ground had just been broken on Research Station Delta when catastrophe struck. The tertiary red dwarf star in the system has an eccentric orbit that brings it close to the other two stars every few centuries. It erupted with a two-day long series of stellar flares that lashed the colony with radiation. Hundreds of thousands were killed instantly and many thousands more died a slow and horrific death from absorbing such a high dose of radiation. The research station, a more modern structure with proper radiation shielding, was nearly complete but soon abandoned without the infrastructure to support it.

The remaining population are mostly transient corporate workers on Dinenruum to extract mineral resources. The system's two planetoid belts are reasonably rich and have a decently sized belter community. The University of Ashga is attempting to raise funds to restore the research station so that local studies of the rare Trojan planet may resume.
