Nasemin is a water world. A large, close moon, a high axial tilt, and an energetic sun combine to produce giant tides and extreme weather effects. The world's stormy seas are the home of a very large and nasty predator which is the source of an anti-inflammation drug which has so far defied economical synthesis. Nasemin's population is primarily occupied with chasing down these predators (called byssals) and excising the gland in which the drug is concentrated. Each yields about 5 kilograms of raw drug. The byssal (a 40,000 kilogram swimming carnivore/killer) regenerates the gland in about a year and can be harvested many times.

The byssal hunters operate in small crews aboard specially constructed submersibles. Much skill is involved in searching for the predator in the ocean depths; the actual capture process is short but dangerous.
