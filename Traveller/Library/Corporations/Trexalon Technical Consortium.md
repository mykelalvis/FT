# TREXALON TECHNICAL CONSORTIUM

The TTC is based out of [[Trexalon]] in [[District 268]] and is made up of several industrial and business concerns which share a general antiâ€“Imperial outlook. At present this takes the form of hostile economic activity rather than any sort of overt action, though there are rumors that the TTC is considering more robust measures to keep [[Imperium|Imperial]] interests out of [[District 268]].
