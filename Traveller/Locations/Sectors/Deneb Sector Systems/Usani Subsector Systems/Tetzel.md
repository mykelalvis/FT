### TETZEL

Tetzel is a dry world with a thin, tainted atmosphere and unattractive to settlers. Although a high-quality starport was built in orbit to facilitate local trade, Tetzel itself was never the subject of an organised colonization and development program. A handful of people moved in and set-up homesteads on the better land, and today these steaders receive a small subsidy from the duchy administration that allows them to import and maintain TL11 equipment. The subsidy is all that prevents the world from being abandoned, which the subsector duke does not consider desirable.

Tetzel's atmospheric taint takes the form of mildly radioactive dust particles, posing a long-term health hazard to anyone breathing the world's air unfiltered.  The origins of this taint are unclear but thought to be connected with the Ancients site discovered near the world's north pole. Like much about Tetzel, this site is disappointing, consisting only of a few abandoned structures of great age. There appears to be a lower level beneath this but its tunnels and chambers have collapsed. It is conjectured that this was externally induced by some means other than the obvious bombardment but no clues to the technology used have emerged.

Clambreys breathe oxygen but can function in very low pressure environments without undue difficulty. Low oxygen content is also not much of a problem for them; smoke or atmospheric taints do not seem to interfere with respiration. If there is no oxygen at all, such as a space vessel with a Clambrey attached to the hull, it will go into a coma-like state and hibernate for weeks or even months. Waking from this state takes time, during which the Clambrey remains still. Occasionally, a Clambrey wakes up on the hull of a starship in port at a new world, drops off and goes in search of something to eat. Since all Clambreys carry eggs, this can create a problem even if the creature is hunted down and killed.

Clambreys appear to be hermaphroditic and can carry fertilised eggs in a dormant state for months or years.  Eggs are deposited when sufficient food is available, and finding a suitable place to nurture the young is one of the Clambrey's driving instincts. As a result, they tend to range widely and investigate whatever they find. This leads to an unfortunate tendency to wedge themselves into odd spaces on starship hulls or wander into unattended cargo bays. Clambreys are not territorial unless they have eggs laid in the vicinity and even then they are not hard to drive off. This makes it quite difficult to tell if a Clambrey has laid eggs; most Travellers will assume it has and go looking for them.
