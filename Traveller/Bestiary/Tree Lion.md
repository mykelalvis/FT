## Tree Lion

_(Platapedalsi arborus)_

![[JTAS-01-098.jpg]]

Tree Lions (also called drop spiders or shovel spiders) are trapbuilding carnivores native to [[Jesedipere]] in the [[Aramis subsector]] of the [[Spinward Marches]]. Scattered to a number of worlds early in the human colonization of the region, Tree Lions can be found in subtropical forest regions on several worlds in the [[Aramis Subsector|Aramis]] and [[Rhylanor subsector]]s.

A typical Tree Lion specimen appears as a small, bilaterally symmetrical, 10-legged arachnid-like creature with a tough, leathery hide covered with bristle-like hairs. The foremost pair of legs have developed into two chitinous, shovel-like apparatus. The remaining legs are equipped with grippers adapted for hanging and climbing. All Tree Lions lead an arboreal existence, descending from their home trees only to build and maintain their unusual traps. A single home tree may support two to three Tree Lion nests, depending on the size of the tree. A typical nest will contain a male/ female pair and several young, which are hatched from egg-sacs.

A Tree Lion will build its trap in the soil directly beneath its nest, utilising its specially adapted forelegs to scoop out a shallow, conical pit about a meter in diameter. It will then spend several hours spinning a fine network of thick silken strands cross the interior of the pit. Each strand is coated with an adhesive substance that exudes an odour of decaying meat. Small animals investigating the smell become trapped and as they struggle, alert the Tree Lion via two 'shroud lines' leading from the edge of the pit to the nest. Once alerted, the Tree Lion descends and administers a paralysing bite. Prey is then wrapped in silk and carried to the nest.

Tree Lions do not normally pose a hazard to Travellers, as their venom is relatively mild, but they can prove irritating and distracting. Traps can be spotted with an opposed Recon check against the Tree Lion's Stealth skill and a Traveller falling into a trap can free themselves with a successful Athletics (dexterity or strength) check.
