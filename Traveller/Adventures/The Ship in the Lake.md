## THE SHIP IN THE LAKE

Location : [[Hazel]] (C645747-5), [[Trin's Veil subsector]], [[The Spinward Marches]]

The world of [[Hazel]] was long ago surveyed for mineral deposits and found to be unviable as an extraction site. It was passed over for investment during the [[Spinward Marches]]' early growth phase and has remained a backwater ever since. Recently, the mining megacorporation [[Sternmetal Horizons]] has become suspicious that early reports were falsified and has attempted to obtain new survey data of its own. These efforts have been hampered by local guerrilla activity.

An expedition to a promising site was lost when their vessel was sunk by rebel forces, so the megacorporation wants a freelance team to quietly retrieve the survey data they were carrying. This means diving in a wreck of a local passenger steamer in a region where the government has lost control to guerrillas. [[Sternmetal Horizons]] has been warned to stay away from Hazel and, for political reasons, wishes to be seen to comply – at least, until it is sure something there is worth the legal wrangles.

[[Hazel]]

### THE REBELLION

The rebels have been at arms for a decade now. They have gained control of a modest area around the north end of Lake Okayama but have little support beyond it. The government, for its part, lacks the means to strike back at the rebels in an effective manner. This is largely due to logistical problems – the 10 million or so people of Hazel are spread out in small cities, with little infrastructure connecting them, and the government lacks the means to conduct an effective campaign far beyond the confines of the cities. Rivers and lakes are generally used for troop movements – such as can be attempted – aboard converted civilian craft and basic gunboats.

Both rebels and government forces have access to locally produced TL5 firearms, which typically means bolt-action or semi-automatic rifles and bulky machineguns. The thin atmosphere makes conventional air power a problem and neither side has access to much in the way of grav transport. The war is thus fought between foot patrols landed by riverine craft, with the occasional raid in greater strength by one side or the other. A weary stalemate has descended, with neither side willing to enter into serious negotiations.

### MINERAL RIGHTS ON HAZEL

The early survey reports were indeed falsified. Hazel's mineral deposits are patchy, and not particularly good, but there are a few areas with easily accessible resource fields, information on which has been suppressed. The reason for this was apparently to create a reserve for major industrial corporations on [[Trin]], who intended to open up the world when they saw the need. The expansion of interstellar trade made this unnecessary but maintaining the reserve status of Hazel became a habit.

Trin's major industrial concerns naturally have the ear of the ruling elite, which includes the subsector duke. Outside concerns are discouraged from investigating Hazel's possible mineral wealth by various means; smaller companies are generally swatted away by difficulties in the marketplace or with legal obstructions dropped in their path. Larger corporations are subject to more subtle influence, which has worked well enough until now, but Sternmetal Horizons is not a firm to be discouraged by a few layers of red tape and vague hints that a favorable contract might go elsewhere if they keep digging.

Having lost one survey team already, [[Sternmetal Horizons|Sternmetal]] is unwilling to risk any more of its personnel on a low-key mission but there is insufficient evidence to merit sending a major security force capable of keeping local guerrillas at bay. The middle road, for now, is to use deniable independent assets to find out if there is any point to committing greater resources. A band of Travellers fits the bill admirably.

A corporation that commits the sort of resources necessary for a major extraction project – or even a small 'proving' site – on the strength of orbital surveys alone will sooner or later lose a great deal of money.

> This means that at some point there needs to be a groundside presence, with samples taken and analysis performed. A survey team can be directed to promising sites by orbital data but it is their work that will influence the final decision to commit. The next stage is usually a 'wildcat' extraction operation, bringing up minerals on a small scale to demonstrate viability of the deposits. Even with the best surveys available, no more than six out of ten wildcat sites prove viable but this is still better odds than using orbital data alone.

### THE SITUATION

[[Sternmetal Horizons]] has the political and economic clout to overcome obstacles if it chooses to do so, however there are expenses to be met and political issues to be dealt with if it goes ahead with exploitation of Hazel. Proof that it is worth the time, trouble and money will be required, and it seems likely that proof is lying on the bed of Lake Okayama. [[Sternmetal Horizons|Sternmetal]] does not want to antagonise the government of Hazel but would prefer to keep its options open regarding the rebels – it may be simplest to bribe the de facto controllers of the region rather than fight them or have a war going on around the extraction operation. Negotiations are likely to be much trickier if Sternmetal-backed mercenaries have been exchanging fire with rebel patrols. A band of Travellers, on the other hand, can be written off as a bunch of trigger-happy yahoos trying to make a quick Credit in the middle of a war zone.

Thus [[Sternmetal Horizons]] approaches the Travellers. The deal is a success-only contract, with a payment of Cr200000 if the Travellers can locate the survey data obtained by a Sternmetal prospecting party lost seven years ago during a guerrilla attack on a Lake Okayama steamer. The steamer's rough location and course is known but the details of the sinking are not. What Sternmetal has been able to discover is that it was attacked by rebel gunboats whilst attempting to rescue offworld tourists and local civilians from the city of Cocta at the north end of Lake Okayama. Cocta remains in rebel hands and should be considered too dangerous to visit, although other communities on the lake's shore may be neutral in the conflict.

It is known that the survey team boarded the steamer, which began to cross the lake when it was fired upon and badly holed. According to reports, the rebels ceased fire when it became apparent the steamer was not a government vessel but a non-combatant, although other sources say it was pounded into scrap. It seems that the steamer made some progress down the lake before suffering rapid structural failure and sinking with great loss of life. The survey team went down with the ship.

If the Travellers can enter the sunken wreck and bring up the survey team's records and instruments, they will receive full payment. An additional Cr10000 is payable for the bodies of the five-strong survey team if they can be recovered and preserved in some way. The precise location of the wreck is worth Cr100000 but no other outcomes are considered a success. Sternmetal's representative does not say but the firm wants proof that the rebels killed their team, just in case it proves useful in future negotiations.

### OUTFITTING AND TRANSPORT

Sternmetal Horizons will arrange for the Travellers to be conveyed to [[Hazel]] aboard a scheduled passenger ship and for suitable cover stories to allay suspicions. They will have to get from the starport to the lake using their own resources, although that should not be difficult. It is quite common for tourists to rent boats or hovercraft to see the sights, although there are restrictions regarding destinations.

Once clear of the starport, the Travellers will receive a package drop containing any equipment they chose not to carry through starport customs. Hazel has Law Level 7, so the Travellers will not be permitted to bring in guns through the starport. Diving equipment would not provoke suspicion if the Travellers seem like the types who enjoy underwater exploration, or it could be dropped outside the city. The drop will be made by a free trader crew who have been paid well to kick a bunch of crates on one-use grav landing units out of their airlock and then depart the system. No backup will be available after this point.

In addition to their own weaponry and equipment, Sternmetal Horizons will provide personal armament for any Traveller who wants it. This amounts to basic body armor such as a flak jacket, a handgun and a larger weapon such as an assault rifle, combat shotgun or submachinegun, with a modest amount of ammunition. Equipment will be 'clean', with no connection to crime, and can be kept. It is a deliberate hodgepodge to avoid suspicion that this is a corporate operation. Note that the weaponry on offer is of a personal-combat nature and superior to what the locals have. Gauss guns, plasma weapons and the like are not available from Sternmetal Horizons and the firm does not really want the Travellers deploying them on its behalf, even deniably.

Once preparations are made, it is a simple matter to reach Hazel and disembark at the starport. Traffic is down since the tourism boom of 15- 20 years ago but there are still a few families keen to enjoy a holiday amid the scenery of this apparently peaceful world. A few professionals seeking employment are also passing through the port.

Customs checks are not vigorous unless the Travellers do or say something suspicious. It would be possible to smuggle small illegal items through customs if the Travellers have prepared well, although their patron would discourage it since the Travellers will be receiving all they need after they clear the starport area.

### BEYOND THE PORT

Few tourists go north to New Okayama these days, since it is on the fringe of the disputed zone. The world government downplays the severity of the rebellion but allows tourists to go north only under the protection of armed guides, whose main function is to warn offworlders that they will be arrested if they proceed further north than the fringe of the conflict zone, and call for backup if they are ignored. There are several reasons why restrictions are in place, starting with a genuine desire to keep visitors safe – dead tourists are not good for business! The government also wants to keep foreign journalists out of the war zone and prevent the rebels gaining offworld contacts that might bring in weapons or establish sympathy among populations of nearby worlds.

If the Travellers claim to be heading somewhere other than northwards they will be allowed to proceed unhindered, although transportation might be a problem. If they want to go north they will be assigned a guide (possibly more than one) who offers good, respectful advice and genuinely tries to ensure the Travellers have a good time. This might make it difficult to collect equipment but that is a problem the Travellers will have to solve using bribery, deception or, perhaps, more drastic means.

Heading north by river or overland by road or rail is not much of a problem, although to avoid suspicion the Travellers may have to stop off at the odd small town and act like tourists. Once they reach the southern end of Lake Okayama, however, things start to change. The people they encounter seem more troubled and there is less fun to be had for tourists. Guides will become increasingly insistent that the Travellers proceed no further but can be talked into 'just another couple of days' before turning back south. The Travellers can get away with this long enough to obtain a boat of some kind and start messing about at the southern end of Lake Okayama.

Guides – if they are still present – will become suspicious if the Travellers go farther north. Whether their intentions are to contact the rebels or they are just entitled offworld jerks, the guides are adamant that they must stop and will warn the Travellers that they will be reported and arrested, or even fired upon by the government's forces, if they continue. If the Travellers have ditched their guides, local officials will be even more suspicious of them and a response will become inevitable unless the Travellers avoid the main towns.

### OPERATING AROUND THE LAKE

There are numerous boats to be hired, borrowed or stolen around the lake but the Referee should remember this is a conflict zone. Intruders intent on theft may meet a violent response... or be greeted warmly by someone who thinks they are offworld sympathisers come to help the rebel cause. Travellers might even be contacted by representatives of the rebellion, who present a catalogue of mistreatment and injustice and ask for help. There are opportunities for the Travellers to become involved in the rebellion on one side or the other, and also the possibility of getting shot by one or both sides.

Every D3 days the Travellers are in the vicinity of Lake Okayama, there is a 1 in 6 chance of an encounter with forces of one side or the other. Both rebels and government troops are nervous and trigger-happy when in disputed countryside but a careful and diplomatic approach might enable the Travellers to blag their way through both sides. Government forces will be deeply suspicious of an armed party, however, and rebels might covet the Travellers' weapons sufficiently to attack them.

An option for exploring the lake is to seek out one of the many derelict pleasure steamers rusting at their moorings in small towns around the lake. Some have been co-opted as gunboats – big, ungainly craft with a couple of machineguns or a light artillery piece strapped to the deck – but most just lie in fading splendour. With a few days' work one of these craft could be returned to working order, providing a mobile base to explore the lake. Of course, there is a possibility that one side or the other will stumble upon the Travellers or that someone will betray them.

### FINDING THE WRECK

The sunken steamer lies in about 50 meters of water near the northern end of the lake. It is a testament to the determination of her crew that she got so far despite being riddled with holes but when she went down it happened fast. Finding the wreck could take a while.

Each search the Travellers attempt takes D3 days. The wreck will be located on a roll of 12+ on 2D, with the following DMs:

- If the Travellers have obtained reliable information about the last hours of the steamer's career and calculated a search area: DM+2.
- If the Travellers have basic underwater sensors such as a portable sonar unit or remotely-operated vehicle with cameras: DM+2.
- If the Travellers have good underwater sensors: DM+4.
- For each search already made: DM+1.

Once the wreck is found, instruments and records must be retrieved. This could be done using a remote vehicle or by diving on the wreck. It is a tricky and hazardous business involving entering the wreck and searching the surrounding lake bed. There are many bodies as well as jagged sections of hull and debris to be avoided, and the possibility exists that rebel watercraft might approach whilst a Traveller is underwater.

### INTERVENTION

If a patrol is encountered during the search or the retrieval, it will consist of 2D personnel armed with rifles or a smaller number in a boat armed with a machinegun. Whether the patrol investigates or simply opens fire depends on circumstances; it is possible that a boatload of armed rebels might just drive past with a cheery wave and a few friendly insults if the Travellers look like they belong in the area.

Although the Travellers were offered weapons for the mission, Sternmetal Horizons would prefer they carried out the retrieval without violence. This is entirely possible using a combination of stealth and deception, although many Travellers may resort to gunplay at the slightest provocation. Once this happens, additional units will be pulled into the area, possibly resulting in an escalating clash between government and rebel forces.

Escalation will take the form of more patrols or single gunboats hurrying to the area. A more coherent response will materialise eventually but neither side is very organised nor expecting more than the usual desultory skirmishing.

### MISSION COMPLETION

The Travellers will need to get back to the starport and offworld with the retrieved survey results. They will be arrested if they try to bring their weaponry back through customs and might face questioning if they are known to have been in the vicinity of a major clash triggered by persons unknown... or they try to bring preserved bodies through the port.

It is entirely possible for the Travellers to get in and out again without much more than a few ripples on the surface of Lake Okayama. On the other hand, there is the potential for starting the largest maritime battle Hazel has ever witnessed. Everything depends on the actions of the Travellers.

Once the data is in the hands of Sternmetal Horizons, the mission is complete and payment will be made. Sternmetal may choose to begin prospecting in the target region and may want the Travellers to return to Hazel, especially if they are familiar with one or both sides in the conflict. Whether Sternmetal chooses to help the government crush the rebels or cuts a deal with both sides depends upon circumstances, however the Travellers have an opportunity to influence the decision if they choose.

It is possible that gunboats will continue to clash on Lake Okayama for years to come and patrols may be sniping at one another in the forests nearby for another generation. Subsequent events are, as always, at the discretion of the Referee.
