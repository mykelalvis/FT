# Sigguushda Yards

Sigguushda is a small shipbuilding consortium with yards on several worlds. Most are capable only of undertaking repairs to smaller vessels or constructing sub-100-ton craft. However, Sigguushda does have yards that can build starships of up to 400 tons. Typically, these turn out a steady stream of Subsidised Merchants and Free Traders for the local commercial market, but one of Sigguushda’s yards has a license to build the controversial 400-ton Corsair.

Although named a Corsair, these ships were not designed as pirate vessels but instead as inexpensive multi-role warships for planetary navies and mercenary units. This is the market sector Sigguushda hoped to exploit by producing these vessels, but since some Corsairs (not necessarily built in Sigguushda’s shipyards) have ended up in the wrong hands the firm has acquired a bad reputation as a supplier of vessels to pirates.

In an effort to redress this, Sigguushda has in recent years offered discounts on conversions to existing ships intended to harden them against pirate attack or turn them into anti-piracy vessels. Common modifications include uprated computer security and enhanced weapons fits, and more radical alterations such as the addition of launch cradles for fighters. Carrying a fighter in a converted section of cargo bay is clumsy and makes for slow recovery operations, but Sigguushda has created a launch system that at least gets the fighter out and ready for combat as quickly as possible.

In theory, this move should have helped establish Sigguushda as part of the ‘piracy solution’, but in fact the recent upsurge in the number of merchant fighter carriers and Q-ships (merchants with concealed weapons) has not made any real difference. Most such vessels are operated in an amateurish manner and are easily avoided by all but the dumbest and short-lived of pirates. More successful has been the provision of Corsair class vessels to certain trade alliances and government-sponsored security organisations. These vessels can carry a reasonable amount of cargo or ground troops, enabling them to work as hardened transports or assault vessels for raids on known pirate havens.

Sigguushda is still trying to clean up its reputation, and as a result is sympathetic towards any potential client wanting to enhance security or protect its trade vessels. It has begun operating a security consulting service and offers training in defensive and security operations for starship personnel. There is nothing unique about this, and Sigguushda is nowhere near the best supplier of such training, but the firm is trying hard to make up for something that was not really its fault in the first place, and takes its newfound role as ‘the secure shipbuilder’ very seriously.
