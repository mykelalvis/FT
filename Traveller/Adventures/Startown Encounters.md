# Startown Encounters

Startown Encounters is a short supplement for 2D6 science fiction games such as Cepheus Engine, Cepheus Deluxe, and The Original Science Fiction Roleplaying Game, although it’s usable with other systems with a little work. The Referee, as always, is the final judge as to whether the supplement is useful and is encouraged to adjust any of the following material to suit.


The following are short encounters or adventure hooks that take place in and around Startown, the community that typically grows near, and often adjacent to, the starport. The entries are suitable for use on the fly during a game, or the Referee can use one or more of them as part of hir preparation.

- A group of local kids have gotten hold of an advanced holographic system and are using it to play pranks on unsuspecting passers-by.
- As soon as the party has cleared the starport gates, they’re asked to report to Startown security and speak with the Captain of Security. When the captain arrives, (s)he accuses the PCs of drug smuggling.

- When one of the adventurers visits a cantina fresher, they discover a body slumped inside with a fatal laser burn. Two law enforcers appear out of nowhere and arrest the PC for murder.

- The party is caught in the middle when a huge gang rumble starts.
- The team witnesses a somber funeral procession for a local figure. A few minutes after passing by, a huge explosion occurs in the direction the procession went.
- A group of servant robots, apparently malfunctioning, is moving down the street toward the PCs, creating destruction and mayhem in their wake.
- The PCs are on hand as several disheveled youths walk slowly through an open-air produce market. As they leave, several of them withdraw various fruits and vegetables from where they were hidden on their person.
- As the team passes by an apartment building, they hear a loud argument between a man and a woman from within. Suddenly, there is a loud crash and the woman’s scream.
- While the PCs are in a Startown bar, a large man enters, fixes his gaze on one of them, and accuses hir of having an affair with his wife.
- After making an equipment purchase, the PC is accosted by a small, slight man who demands his (whatever it was the PC bought) back. Refusal results in a telepathic Assault.
- As the team is making its way down the Startown strip, an out-of- control cargo vehicle careens toward them. As they stop the vehicle (or it crashes), several of the crates fall to the ground and burst open, revealing a massive amount of contraband. The local police are almost upon them.
- A group of scavengers have gotten hold of a grungy but potentially valuable item, which they refuse to sell at any price.

- A power surge accidentally activates a decommissioned security robot that subsequently goes on a rampage.
- As the crowds pass into Startown through the starport gates, a regal-looking woman accompanied by several aides and guards coolly looks over the mass of people from the sidelines. As the PCs pass by, she suddenly steps forward, points to one of them, and loudly declares, “This one!”
