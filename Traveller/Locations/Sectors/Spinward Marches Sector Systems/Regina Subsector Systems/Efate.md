### Point of Interest: Ancients Site\edit&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Point of Interest: Ancients Site")\]

An Ancients site was discovered on Efate in 354, though it had been robbed of all useful artifacts. Today the site is used as a historic monument maintained by the IISS. The site consists of a partially restored grid of walls spaced about two meters apart and extremely massive fortifications at random intervals.

History & Background (Dossier)\edit&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: History & Background (Dossier)")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Efate_ is a high-population, high-technology, heavily industrialized planet with a cold but otherwise garden world environment.

In addition to Efate Startown, other major settlements on Efate include Anlisha, Makish, Kheker, Arden, Irir, and Gasharr.

The system also contains a Naval Base that is the home of the 213th Fleet "213th Fleet (SM)").

The starship manufacturer General Shipyards has a subsidiary yard on **Efate**;

### Historical Data\edit&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Historical Data")\]

In the run-up to the Fifth Frontier War Efate was subject to bitter anti-Imperial guerrilla activity, supported by the Zhodani.

On 204-1107, as part of the opening of the war, Efate faced a Zhodani siege, followed by heavy planetary fighting.

The Siege of Efate proved one of the crucial campaigns of the entire war.

### Other Data\edit&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Other Data")\]

Efate has been settled almost as long as Regina "Regina (world)") and has always been its rival for the position as most important system in the Regina Cluster. It passed Regina in population long ago and its technology is also better (space technology is up to Imperial standards), but political considerations still keep it in second place. In the last decade, civil disturbances have contributed to this; the Imperium has been forced to introduce martial law and the system is currently governed by the Imperial Navy.

### Name\edit&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Name")\]

Note that the name "Efate" is one that is common to both Anglic and Gvegh "Gvegh (language)"). It is not known from which language the name derives.
