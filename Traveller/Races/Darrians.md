# The Rise and Fall of the Darrians

During the time that the [[Zhodani]] were transplanted by the [[Ancients]],  another transplanted group of humans was becoming active in the region. Like the [[Zhodani]], the Darrians were settled on a habitable world by the [[Ancients]], for reasons unknown, and then abandoned when the [[Ancients]] departed. [[Darrian]] was a very habitable world and there was less impetus to develop technology than elsewhere. The Darrians developed slowly and peacefully.

Many centuries later, in -1520, while the [[Second Imperium|Rule of Man]] was declining into the [[Long Night]], a fleet of ships belonging to a [[Terra|Terran]] corporation arrived at [[Darrians]], seeking a new home. They befriended the Darrians rather than competing with them, and by -1400 a synthesis of the two cultures emerged. This had the best features of both groups; the energy and inquisitiveness of the [[Terra|Terran]]s, fused with the intellectual nature of the Darrians to create a technologically advanced yet ethical society.

They were capable of interbreeding and within 400 years there was only one Darrian race and culture. Moreover, it possessed TL16 technology â€“ higher than the [[Imperium]] itself. However, this was the Darrians' undoing. They began to experiment on Tanis, Darrian's sun, in -1000 and in -924 the star destabilized.

It is thought that the event known as _Mahgiz_ ('Chaos', in the Darrian language), was caused by an experimental probe sent into the star, causing a series of massive solar flares to erupt. These were accompanied by a huge electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which radiated out from the star at lightspeed.

The pulse did no physical damage but destroyed electronics. At a stroke, factories, hospitals, businesses and starships lost their electronics systems. Vehicles crashed, automated systems went out of control and communications disappeared. The pulse was followed by a wavefront of stellar gas moving more slowly and, three weeks after the EMP, Darrian was devastated by fire from space, which killed over 80% of the population and effectively destroyed civilization on the planet.

Although the gas dissipated in the Darrian system, the EMP struck other systems as it radiated outwards. With some warning, it was possible to preserve electronic systems from the worst effect but the heart had been torn out of the Darrian civilization. Without the technology and industry of the homeworld, there was no way to replace or maintain technological items, such as the starships possessed by the Darrian colonies.

In -905, the Darrians began taking measures to ensure long-term survival. Starships were placed in storage and each colony looked inward, preparing to survive the difficult times ahead. By -860, the Darrians had ceased all space travel.

Over the next six centuries the world of Mire gradually climbed back up to TL10 and began constructing starships. Its cache of surviving vessels were refurbished and the Darrians returned to the stars. In -275 they began exploring nearby space. What they found was both surprising and ominous.

Creating Darrian Travellers Over the centuries, the Darrians adapted to their homeworld, gradually acquiring a distinctive appearance. Although recognizably human and capable of interbreeding with other humans, the Darrians developed what some refer to as an 'elfin' appearance. They are tall and slender as a result of the lower gravity on their homeworld and tend to be more dextrous, if a little weaker, than other humans. Their skin has a golden colour and hair is white or silver-grey as a result of living under a different sun for millennia.

Characteristics Darrian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, DEX+1, END-1, INT+1, EDU+1.

Traits Darrian Travellers all possess the following traits:
Heat Resistant (-1): Darrians have slightly reflective skin and their bodies retain water more efficiently than other humans. They suffer one point less damage from extremes of temperature in their environment.

Heightened Senses: Darrians have better hearing and sense of smell than other humans. All Darrians receive DM+1 to any Recon or Survival checks they have to make.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Darrians: Agent, Entertainer, Merchant, Navy, Scholar. More Darrian careers will be added to Traveller in the future.
