# DETAILS

Affinity, like most worlds in the Anther Cluster, sees a great deal of interstellar traffic. This collection of worlds is at the nexus of four [[#The Sylean Main|Sylean Main]] branches. The Chant Branch to rimward is dominated by the industrial world Skeen; the Old Confederacy Branch to spinward leads into the region that once hosted the Interstellar Confederacy; and the  [[Capital]] branch – actually a pair of branches – leads coreward towards the Imperial  [[Capital]] and onward to the Sylean and Wayward worlds.

Making their way down the main concourse and into the startown – the sprawling business district that surrounds the starport – they find themselves at Restoration Plaza, where they are drawn to Eneri's Cantina, conveniently located on the periphery of the park. Eneri's is a busy place almost any time of day but flourishes during the evenings, just as the visible disc of Affinity has begun to darken a mere 15, kilometers away.

## The Wild Seas of Affinity

Affinity is a large, high-gravity waterworld with a great deal of tectonic and volcanic activity, all of which occurs beneath the ocean surface on undersea mountain ranges. Eruptions are frequent along the seams of its tectonic plates, spewing volcanic effluvia into the ocean. The Affinity rotational period is 36.7 hours long.

Affinity has two moons: Rapport, which orbits in a prograde direction, quite closely at about 85, kilometers, just outside the Roche limit with an orbital period of only 50 hours; and Chum, a much smaller captured satellite with a retrograde orbit about 200, kilometers from Affinity. The interaction of these planetary bodies produces highly unpredictable tidal conditions on Affinity. While there are no permanent land masses above the surface, at any given time the world has dozens of transitory islands, low, flat protuberances that rise above the surface when the tides have ebbed.

The 30<sup>o</sup> axial tilt of Affinity produces a strong Coriolis effect which, when interacting with its dense atmosphere, causes a great deal of stormy weather and some truly massive rogue waves. Affinity is rich in resources but there are good reasons that the world has no permanent habitations on its surface. There are none on any of the transitory islands but there are two undersea cities, Kayu and Uan, both nestled against the broad escarpments of two neighboring seamounts where they avoid the worst of Affinity's tidal effects and storms.

Affinity has abundant native life, none of it exceedingly intelligent. The oceans are rich in fish, algaes, seaweeds and other life forms, although they are not easily digestible by humans. Oils are extracted from some of Affinity's largest sea creatures and used for organic lamps, salves, ointments and other products. Aquaculture on Affinity focuses on plant life that can be synthesised into useful materials and textiles rather than foodstuffs.

> [!info]- Referee's Note ^bacteria
> One characteristic the two animals have in common is the presence of a cooperative parasite that lives in their gut microbiomes. This unnamed bacterial species plays a key role in the behaviours of hundreds of Affinity's species, emitting radioisotopes that cross the blood-brain barrier and assist the host species with decision-making processes. The bacteria simultaneously releases alkylating agents that prevent these isotopes from adversely affecting cellular growth. Scientists have yet to discover that the bacteria is sensitive to Affinity's magnetic field and uses this ability to help its host navigate the world's ocean currents and weather fluctuations. Migrations of affected animals appear to be chaotic but are in fact guided by these microscopic 'hitchhikers' that keep them out of harm's way.

> This bacterial species is being researched by [[Tolvar Remedies]], which hopes to genetically engineer them for applications in the human microbiome.

## Affinity Highport

![[CA2-50_1476395974.jpg|200]]
[[CA2-50_1476395974.jpg|Link]]
The Anther Cluster is one of the most travelled regions of [[#The Sylean Main]] and Affinity handles a considerable amount of the throughput. Like many of the starports in the cluster, [[#Affinity Highport]] is an average-sized facility, designed to support a large amount of interstellar traffic but not really fit to be a hub. Most of the star systems in the cluster have low or medium populations and their starports are representative of their host worlds in size and scope. The exception to the rule is Anther, which has an immense starport that far surpasses those of all other worlds in the cluster.

[[#Affinity Highport]] management and staff comprise 8,500–9,000 people but its hospitality facilities can accommodate another 15,000 guests. The shipyard manufactures sublight spacecraft, focusing on launches and pinnaces for merchant starships. The starport does not retain a large system defence fleet, relying instead upon squadrons of the Imperial 2nd Fleet, which frequently patrol the system.

The highport has a dispersed structure configuration, with a central tri-level disc and two lengthy spires extending from its dorsal and ventral center points. Each of the three decks is approximately six meters high, with enough room for utilities, sewage and two-storey buildings.

### Eneri's Cantina

Eneri's features a bi-level layout with a single bar on the lower level and copious seating in booths, tables and barstools. The bar's proprietor, [[Zashe]] Pamzirma, loves music and has a band playing on the soundstage most of the time, usually a smooth jazz trio during the day with a lively quartet or larger band playing more boisterous tunes in the evenings.

Eneri's is a pan-sophont-friendly venue with beverages provided to please a broad variety of alien palates. In addition, the lift and stairwells are reasonably spacious and outfitted with grav assist so as not to favor only sophonts with legs. There is also a lift near the front entrance for those who would prefer to forgo stairs altogether.

Like many bars, Eneri's has its foibles. One of its barstools is said to belong to the 'ol' Captain', although no one seems to remember exactly who the ol' Captain actually was. Nevertheless, his stool is always vacant and regulars all know not to sit there. Newcomers who break this unwritten rule are quickly informed that they must vacate the stool or face the captain's wrath. On the upper level, there is a section strictly reserved for gamblers. There is nearly always at least one or two games of chance being played in this part of the bar. The Referee should feel free to add more personalities, nooks, crannies, oddities and quirks to the bar as desired. Eneri's has a lot of character and customizing it to the Travellers' needs and interests is recommended.

Zashe has an eidetic memory and remembers the favorite drinks of all her regular customers. After Travellers have been to Eneri's two or three times, they can expect to have their preferred drinks served to them moments after they sit at a table or sidle up to the bar. Zashe has a small staff of servers, and sometimes hires temporary help when there is a big event going on, but mostly relies upon her adopted son, [[Calago]], and a [[#BDVSR Bartender Robot|robot bartender/bouncer]] named 'Bug' to run the place.

![[CA2-50_1476395985.jpg]]

#### BDVSR Bartender Robot

![[CA2-50_1476395987.jpg]]
"Bug" is a four-armed bipedal robot optimized for autonomous operation. Bug normally operates with an external beverage dispenser, such as a full bar or beverage cart, but has an autobar installed within its torso with dispenser nozzles and a 10-litre capacity integral refrigerated container that holds up to 20 different beverages at a variety of temperatures, allowing it to dispense everything from hot coffee to iced smoothies. Spare capacity of another eight litres allows for custom installation of additional dispensers or other custom features. A vacuum/blower feature and internally stored mops and brushes allow the robot to keep its beverage-dispensation area clean.

With four arms, the BDVSR can dispense multiple drinks simultaneously but its two stronger arms serve the additional purpose of maintaining 'venue security', namely removing unruly patrons. Normally the model performs this task with the utmost courtesy but Bug's patience has seemingly worn out. Troublemakers are brusquely and summarily removed from the premises. Bug is a decent conversationalist but lacks deep insight into human behaviour.

Bug has been in service for many decades and has a few quirks. While it does not have a more sophisticated brain than other members of its class, it has collected a library of canned responses that it uses in conversation. Most of the time, these responses help to create the illusion of typical banter but once in a while it responds with an off-kilter or awkward statement that might leave Travellers scratching their heads.
