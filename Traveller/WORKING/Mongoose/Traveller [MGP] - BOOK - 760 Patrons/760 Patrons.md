# 760 Patrons

Contacts, Mentors, Benefactors and Financiers

## INTRODUCTION

Traveller opens up the galaxy – multiple galaxies – to the readers, players and Referees out there who are looking to explore them. In this vast universe they can find planets, stars, nebulae, aliens and ancient civilizations to fill the empty void that is space. It is an enormous stage to set and there is no shortage of uniqueness and oddity that can appear seemingly out of nowhere. Many of these unexpected encounters will come in the form of social interactions; from a brisk handshake given by a colleague to the barrel of a gauss pistol pressed into a character's ribs.

_Traveller: 760 Patrons_ arms its readers with a mind-boggling number of potential personalities and archetypes, which Traveller fans can put to good use in their own games. Players can quickly roll a good ally or enemy for their characters, Referees can randomly determine who happens to be waiting in a bar or maybe even come up with a complete adventure using just the interaction threads written in this book. Essentially, this book is a titanic collection of encounters waiting to happen. Many of these encounters will result in work or missions for the characters – although not always in the way they expect.

Unlike the Patrons found in the Traveller Core Rulebook, these are not adventure hooks set in stone with pre-arranged prices and potentials. In an effort to make this book free-formed and usable several times over, we have ensured that each Patron is described in a generic way with several routes that the interaction could take. We did not want to include firm credit amounts or job offer types with the Patrons because of the generic role that this book is supposed to provide. Some games will show that a rescue mission is worth far more than Cr10,000, where others might think that is a fortune for a simple find-and-grab. This way it is between the Referee and his players to determine what each Patron will be about, how much the interaction will cost or pay and the scope of the events involved; with some directional assistance from this book.

Making use of Traveller: 760 Patrons is remarkably easy. It is designed specifically to serve as a source for quick and simple encounters and interactions. The various chapters of this book are separated into different social categories based on very general stereotypes of characters. These social categories help Referees and players decide from which category they should be rolling their patron encounters. A few quick decisions and some random dice rolls will then determine the basic patron they will have a chance to interact with. A Referee can take 15 minutes before a gaming session and roll up a random Patron encounter for each of his players' characters to possibly interact with and then drop them into the gaming session as the opportunities arise – it is just that easy!

### SOCIAL GROUPINGS

The chapters in this book are divided into groupings based on the generally perceived social peers within their current career path. This does not mean that a Scout character should never be allowed to roll upon the Drifter patron table or that a mercenary Striker cannot roll an interaction with a patron from the Army selections. The book is designed in a general format to help organize these patron characters and aid users in figuring out their designated tables in fast ways.

The social groupings are as follows; containing the patron tables for the listed career path types.

- [[#Military Patrons]] – [[#Navy]], [[#Marines]] or [[#Army]] characters
- [[#Spacer Patrons]] – [[#Scout]], [[#Merchant]] or [[#Agent]] characters
- [[#Upper-Class Patrons]] – [[#Nobility]] or [[#Scholar]] characters
- [[#Middle-Class Patrons]] – [[#Entertainer]] or [[#Citizen]] characters
- [[#Lower-Class Patrons]] – [[#Rogue]] or [[#Drifter]] characters
- [[#Mercenary Patrons]] – [[#Cadre]], [[#Commando]], [[#Guerrilla]], [[#Security]],  [[#Striker]] or [[#Warmonger]] characters
- [[#Wild Card]] Patrons – Unusual or otherwise unique characters

Characters will not always fit into the social grouping that they are supposed to. Not all [[#Agent]]s spend much time in space, some [[#Nobility]] are bigger scum than most crime lords and there are lots of military characters that deal with the same people that [[#Mercenary Patrons|Mercenary]] types do. It is up to the Referee to decide the best social groupings and sub-tables to use when rolling up a patron encounter in this book.

### ANTAGONISTS OR PROTAGONISTS?

Each individual section of this book is divided into two types of patron encounters that characters can interact with – antagonists and protagonists. Antagonists are patron encounters that begin with the interaction stacked against the wishes and needs of the character; they are often enemies or obstacles that will have to be overcome. Protagonists are patron encounters that begin with the interaction aimed at helping or working with the character; they are generally allies or outsiders that will act in the benefit of the character. Whether a patron encounter is rolled as an antagonist or protagonist will set the initial reason and mood for the encounter. It is up to the decisions, skill checks and roleplaying efforts of the characters interacting with it to decide the final outcome of the encounter.

Whenever rolling a patron encounter in Traveller: 760 Patrons, the Referee should roll a d6. If the result is an Odd number the patron should be rolled using that career path's Antagonist Patron Table. If the result is an Even number the patron is instead rolled using the Protagonist Patron Table.

### REQUIRED SKILLS OR EQUIPMENT?

Although most of the patron encounters created using the rules in this book are generic in nature when compared to the complexity of the Traveller universes, there are a few specific requirements that might be necessary for characters to interact with them. For example, an Alternate Pilot antagonist cannot be available unless there is a ship berthed somewhere nearby on which he is crew. Alternatively, a patron encounter with a Hacker will need the character(s) to have
the `Computer` skill to interact with it at all. These requirements are listed under the heading for each individual patron encounter.

Rolling a Random Patron Encounter
Most patron encounters rolled using the tables in this book will be based off of a character's career path or current employment. There might come a reason why a player or Referee will want to generate a completely random patron encounter for his gaming sessions; the following table allows for that.

INTRODUCTION

## Military Patrons

In Traveller, service in the military is commonplace and far reaching, carving out a spider's web of social connections, alliances and emneties as far as there has been space travel to. No matter what branch of governed military someone is serving with, they have access to a number of interesting and particular individuals.

### Navy

Characters in the Navy career path are given access to meeting a variety of people from all over the galaxy. Other naval personnel, civilians while on leave and alien species are all common examples of who a Navy character might have reason to interact with. Although following orders and pursuing what their governing agency requires might stifle their options some, their far-reaching travels more than make up for it in most cases.

#### Flotilla Commander

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

The commanding Officer of a local space flotilla (a small armed starbase) is in the area and is not being subtle about his visit.  He has an armed guard detail with him but he seems more like a politician than a military commander.

#### Stowaway

Required Skills: Investigate Required Equipment: Ship

Someone has tucked themselves away on your ship trying to get a free ride to wherever you are going. Discovering them might be a chore but not knowing who is roaming your vessel and what they are capable of is a danger to everyone on board.

#### Gunner

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

One of the ship's gunnery Officers has been showing some signs of stress lately. This should not be a surprise, as anyone in charge of turning a few thousand megawatts of power into lances of coherent fusion designed to vaporize hundreds of lives in milliseconds has a lot on their minds.

| The gunner is ... |                                                                                                                                 |

In charge of the starship docking facility on the local planet, this friendly-faced bureaucrat makes sure that all of the ships in his care get refuelled and re-armed properly before sending them back out into the void.

| 1                                | ...really down on his luck and needs someone to help him around the facility.                                                                        |

| 6                                | ...looking to sell shares of his facility to upstanding, military types. They are Cr1,000 each but will assuredly be worth millions over a lifetime. |

#### Rumormonger

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

This person has nothing better to do with his time than talk about what other people are doing. No matter who is doing what, he will find a way to put a bad spin on it and tell absolutely everyone about it.

#### Smuggler

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Running goods through blockades, under the noses of the authority and hopefully without paying taxes and tariffs, a smuggler is always a good friend to have. He has access to goods that the characters might not otherwise be able to obtain, especially if they need something illegal.

#### Ship's Medic

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Having to look at every wounded member of the crew, from engineering burns to gauss round lacerations everyday can push a ship's medic a little too far. He has been doing his job for just a little too long and has become a little cynical because of it.

| The ship's medic is ... |                                                                                                                                               |

#### Breaching Marine

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Considered some of the toughest, roughest and most cliquish soldiers on board any starship, this hulk of a man lives his life hard, fast and by his own rules. He has to be mean to survive in his job, so it makes sense that he rarely gets along with anyone but other breaching marines.

| The breaching marine is ... |                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1 – 2                       | ...angry about his performance in his last mission and is looking to take it out on anyone who crosses him.                                          |
| 3                           | ...really drunk after a successful insertion; this makes him belligerent, loud and pugnacious to the extreme.                                        |
| 4                           | ...trying to get psyched up for what looks like a very dangerous mission in the morning, which means he cannot be bothered with manners or niceties. |
| 5 – 6                       | ...blaming anyone and everyone for his squadmate's recent death; from the bay door operator to the engineering chief and everyone in-between.        |

#### Chief Petty Officer

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

In charge of many minor ship functions and lesser detail crews, the chief petty Officer is a lot like the middle management of any company. His real power lies in not being important enough for heaped responsibilities but still can order a select few subordinates around.

| The chief petty Officer is ... |                                                                                                                       |

| 4 – 5                          | ...too buried in paperwork to do his rounds with his men, making it hard for him to do his job without a little help. |
| 6                              | ...looking to train someone loyal and capable to be his replacement; he is hoping to get a bridge promotion soon.     |

#### Mess Crewman

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

This man bears one of the most thankless and time-consuming jobs on a multi-personnel starship. He works long hours in the kitchens attached to the mess hall and hears hundreds of complaints about his cooking at every meal.

| The mess crewman is ... |                                                                                                                                 |

| 3 – 4                   | ...disgruntled about a character's reaction to his new exotic dinner dish; which he thought of as his personal best work.       |
| 5 – 6                   | ...an old naval washout, ending up in the kitchens as a dumping ground as much as a punishment for his lackluster performances. |

#### Visiting Scout

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A member of the local scout faction has stopped by; bringing with him tales of uncharted frontier areas and the mapping he has done to help expand his government's borders. His job is exciting and dangerous and the enthusiasm he has about it makes it seem like a grandiose endeavor.

| The visiting scout is ... |                                                                                                                                                 |

| 5                         | ...on assignment and cannot stay too long. He does impart a little knowledge about the area of space he has been in before he goes, however.    |
| 6                         | ...also a spy for his government. He is not just looking through the frontier for dangers but also through the forces sent to travel it.        |

#### Alternate Pilot

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Every ship keeps a staff of pilots and co-pilots on hand in case of emergency situations or long navigational shifts and this man is the one they call when those stand-ins cannot make it. He always wanted to be a starship pilot but only scraped by in training. This earned him a spot in the alternate lists and a rather large chip on his shoulder.

| The alternate pilot is ... |                                                                                                |

#### Requisition Clerk

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

The man in charge of sitting behind the commissary desk and doling out what people can and cannot have is always a good person to be on the right side of. He keeps a close eye on what there are extras of and what might be able to walk away cheaper than normal – perhaps even free.

| The requisition Officer is ... |                                                                                                                                                             |

| 3 – 4                          | ...not sure if his storeroom is safe enough to prevent late-night burglaries and either wants someone to keep it secure or give him his cut of the profits. |
| 5 – 6                          | ...offering the characters a chance at possibly buying some equipment at wholesale, so long as they do not tell anyone he did it.                           |

#### Staff Ensign

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

One of the lower ranking crewmembers of his ship, a staff ensign is responsible for a variety of duties. Without anyone to delegate these jobs to, the ensign normally ends up doing them all himself. Always looking for the best ways to get a promotion, the staff ensign can be very clever.

| The staff ensign is ... |                                                                                                                                                      |

| 3                       | ...in trouble for his underwhelming performance lately and will take it out on anyone who looks like they do a good job in theirs.                   |
| 4                       | ...waiting for his chance to create a higher ranked opening in the staff structure for him to hopefully fill.                                        |
| 5 – 6                   | ...exhausted from years of his role in the military and hates that he cannot seem to get a promotion. This makes him dangerous and mentally erratic. |

#### Petty Officer

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Middle management at its best within the ship's infrastructure, the petty Officer takes the position truly to heart. He dislikes those who have been lucky enough to be promoted above him but he also has no respect for the men still ranked below him. Until he can shed the bureaucratic red tape of his position, he will never be pleasant.

| The petty Officer is ... |                                                                                                               |   |

#### PT Staff Member

Required Skills: Athletics Required Equipment: None

A physical trainer in the naval gymnasium or fitness center, this fit and attractive member of the PT staff wants nothing else but to work out and stay healthy.

#### Shuttle Pilot

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A professional courier of passengers and cargo over short distances, a shuttle pilot does not have to worry about fighter formations and going on patrols. He simply straps in and jets off, normally from a spaceport to a ship or vice versa. Occasionally he might even need to do ship-to-ship flights but not nearly as often.

| The shuttle pilot is ... |                                                                                                                                   |

#### Engine Mechanic

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Trapped under the greasy engines of a shuttle, fighter or troop transport all day long can make anyone irritable and abrasive. This exhausted and overworked technician never seems to clear his work schedules; adding to his temper and unwillingness to help anyone outside of his work day.

| 5 – 6                      | ...ready to retire but knows that he cannot yet unless he gets injured while on the job. Picking fights with the characters might just do it for him. |

#### Ship Janitor

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

#### Supply Officer

Required Skills: Admin Required Equipment: None

The man behind the clipboards and red tape, the supply Officer is the one in charge of ordering all of the goods and equipment for his assignments. When there are not enough bullets, the fuel cells are empty and all there is to eat are freeze-packed Salisbury steaks, it is because of his decisions and business choices.

| The supply Officer is ... |                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### Visiting Officer

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A naval Officer from another ship or mission assignment is visiting the area, making it somewhat difficult to avoid him and his entourage. Every ship has its own dynamic and this Officer thinks that his is far more important to express than anything stemming from where he is visiting.

The crew member responsible for making the ship travel safely, the primary pilot or co-pilot is often one of the most liked people on a starship.

#### Hand-to-Hand Trainer

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

The reason why breaching marines know how to kill a man eight ways with their bare hands and the cause for more bruises and sprains within the crew than the worst amount of enemy contact, the local hand-to-hand trainer is as much a sadist as he is a teacher of how to hurt people.

| The hand-to-hand trainer is ... |                                                                                                                |

The starship captain of a naval vessel needs to be charismatic, strong-willed and tenacious. This person is an example of all of these qualities added together with a liberal amount of pluck and wit. He knows that he has sometimes hundreds of lives in his hands when he makes his decisions, so he makes sure that they count.

| The ship's captain is ... |                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Lieutenant

High on the rankings under the captain in the bridge of the ship, the lieutenant is the one man prepared to take the captain's place should something happen to him physically, politically or career-wise. He is devoted to the ship and to the crew but most of all his own promotion likelihood.

#### Master Chief

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Most of the lower crew members, engineers, technicians and non-combatant Officers look to the master chief for instruction and orders. He is the lynch pin of the grittier aspects of a naval ship and few men or women on a ship or base can boast to have their fingers in so many projects, plans and duties.

| The master chief is ... |                                                                                                                                                                            |

Always seeking ways to cut budgets from the military and give it to the executive branches of the government, this suit-and-tie agent is the combination of a lawyer and a politician.

| 3 – 4                         | ...a corrupt and horrible person that is only making life so hard for the naval personnel in order to get offered bribes. |
| 5                             | ...on the secret payroll of the lieutenant, who needs the captain removed from his position in order to be promoted.      |
| 6                             | ... cold and calculating and will gladly use sex, extortion and blackmail to get their way.                               |

#### Fleet Admiral

Required Skills: Admin Required Equipment: None

In charge of not just one ship but an entire fleet of vessels, the fleet admiral is the topmost role the navy can offer someone that wants to remain active in 'the field'. It is not a position given lightly and one that carries with it a great responsibility and tremendous power.

| The fleet admiral is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                    | ...aware of several plots on his life due to recent choices in fleet organization. He needs new bodyguards and private security that he thinks will not be swayed by disgruntled or displaced captains. |
| 3 – 4                    | ...preparing a massive naval attack upon a formerly neutral target but he wants trusted agents to reconnaissance the area first.                                                                        |
| 5 – 6                    | ...old and somewhat tired of his role in the navy, many even think he is going senile. He secretly seeks out the advice of outsiders to help him make fleet plans and preparations.                     |

#### Suspect in Custody

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Having been arrested or captured for any of a variety of different crimes, this person is currently being held pending trial or judgment. He does not want to be incarcerated or worse and will do just about anything to try and get away if at all possible. He will plead, beg, threaten and perhaps even attack if given the opportunity.

| The suspect in custody is ... |                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                         | ...a non-violent criminal who had been caught stealing small goods; he is a liar and a cheat but will do just about anything to escape. |
| 3 – 4                         | ...disturbingly silent about his crimes and no one seems to know exactly what he is capable of.                                         |
| 5                             | ...actually innocent or so he says and can be very convincing at times.                                                                 |
| 6                             | ...an infamous serial killer renowned for his sadistic and sick methods.                                                                |

### Marines

Characters in the Marines career path are attached to starships and starbases, serving as their soldiers and security. This puts them in contact with a great deal of military personnel but also scores of civilians and potential threats. Naval personnel on the ship, civilians while planetside and 'potential hostiles' are all common examples of who a Marine character might have reason to interact with. They are trained to be some of the toughest and least yielding of the military branches but the lives of everyone on board are theoretically in their hands - leaving less time for social graces.

#### Chief of Security

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

In charge of keeping the security staff, marines and freelance investigators all in line with the ship's regular duties, the chief of security has a rather stressful job. He knows that he cannot do his job without his staff and keeping them happy with him ensures that he does not always have to be looking over his shoulder.

| The chief of security is ... |                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                        | ...worried that he might have a dirty agent on his payroll and wants help to find him.                                                                      |
| 3 – 4                        | ...throwing a retirement party for one of his agents and needs the characters to keep the peace for the few hours that most of security will be indisposed. |
| 5                            | ...sure that there is a new threat to ship security on board and he wants the characters' help finding it.                                                  |
| 6                            | ...celebrating his 10th anniversary on the security force.                                                                                                  |

#### Striker Patron

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

This mercenary thinks of himself as a ruthless war machine of training and experience and he is probably right. Guns-for-hire like this are usually very good at their job, which often makes them cocky, arrogant and rude. They do not commonly get along with 'regular' military types for just that reason.

| The striker is ... |                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2              | ...trying to prove to the local operational authority that he is worth hiring for his combat skills – which means he is going to pick a fight. |
| 3 – 4              | ...between tickets at the moment and hard up for cash to repair and re-arm his gear.                                                           |
| 5 – 6              | ...actually on a ticket assignment against the characters' government or organization.                                                         |

#### Deployment Pilot

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

The man or woman responsible for bringing squads of marines to where they need to be when called upon, the deployment pilot is a soldier's guardian angel. Flying a slow and thickly armored lander through flak fire, anti-ship defense and enemy fighter support, just one of this man's actions could snuff out an entire team's lives in an instant.

| The deployment pilot is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                       | ...actually very worried about his next drop because of the planetary defense and needs some reassurance of his skills.                                                                 |
| 3 – 4                       | ...a real daredevil, always looking to show his friends in the engagement teams that he is just as crazy as they are.                                                                   |
| 5                           | ...depressed because of extremely high casualties from a team he brought into the combat zone.                                                                                          |
| 6                           | ...getting himself ready to fly the new prototype ship-to-ship assault craft and wants some advice from his friends in the marines about what to do when he is on board the enemy ship. |

#### Combat Medic

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

One of the worst assignments for a medically-trained member of the military is to be attached to a unit of marines or infantry, which is exactly what the combat medic exists to do. He has been numbed to the guts and gore that battlefield wounds tend to be and it has made him despise anyone who goes out and wields such destructive weaponry against other sentient lifeforms.

| The combat medic is ... |                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                       | ...one more casualty away from a nervous breakdown, taking it out on the nearest soldier carrying a weapon.            |
| 2 – 3                   | ...bitter and incensed with feelings of distaste for those in the field of 'taking lives'.                             |
| 4 – 5                   | ...experimenting with new and dangerous techniques to help stop major wounds from being too painful but no less fatal. |
| 6                       | ...an emotional hermit; a totally cold person that seems unable to care about anything at all.                         |

#### Salvager

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Sometimes called 'junkers', 'space janitors' or 'scrappers', a salvager is a member of a professional salvage team that goes out to find derelict crafts and wreckage. Once found, they either tow them in for repairs or cut them up for parts. The navy and other transit-based organizations often pay salvagers extra to clear debris from space lanes, feeding them the proper information to do so.

| The salvager is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 – 2               | ...in the middle of preparing what he calls a 'goldmine of a lead' on an old banking shuttle lost in this area of space.                                                             |
| 3 – 4               | ...in need of some muscle to help him relocate a few squatters that took root on his most recent lucrative claim after he got gravity and life-support working for the salvage crew. |
| 5                   | ...not sure but he thinks he may have found something very important and classified on his last job.                                                                                 |
| 6                   | ...looking to sell some alien bits and bobs that he picked up, including a few things he knows the characters will be interested in.                                                 |

#### Establishment Manager

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

No matter where marines tend to go to spend their free time – restaurants, bars, stores, hotels and so on – they attract attention. The managers of these establishments tend to hate it when marine-types come to their places of business, as the loud, lewd and frivolous behaviors that come from soldiers on leave is rarely beneficial to regular business.

| The establishment manager is ... |                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                                | ...in charge of a local bar and dance club and still has not repaired all of the damage from the last military leave that came through the area.                           |
| 2                                | ...the night clerk at a round-the-clock eatery and normally only sees marines after they have been kicked out of somewhere else for being disorderly.                      |
| 3                                | ...the woman who runs a professional (and legal) brothel, she likes to see military money but dislikes having to deal with military egos.                                  |
| 4                                | ...the operations manager at an all-you-can-eat buffet styled restaurant and he despises seeing a squad of marines come through his door with their immense appetites.     |
| 5                                | ...the brother of a woman who was killed by imprecise weapons fire and now will not let uniformed soldiers into his store.                                                 |
| 6                                | ...so spiteful of not getting into the military and being forced into food service management that he is willing to sabotage the characters' food with foreign substances. |

| The navy ensign is ... |                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                  | ...a relative of someone the character knows from basic training, giving them something to talk about over meals in the mess hall.           |
| 3 – 4                  | ...young for his position in the crew and cannot help but come off as a fan of the marine – which could be good for the ego if nothing else. |
| 5 – 6                  | ...a longstanding member of the crew and carries a great deal of clout with the other navy types.                                            |

#### Star Raider

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Also called space pirates, star raiders are criminal pilots and assault experts that steal their living by hijacking other ships. They are not all bloodthirsty and violent but they cannot hope to be successful in their chosen career if they do not carry through with any threats they choose to make. This makes them all dangerous to a certain degree.

| The star raider is ... |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                  | ...working in the area to find out what kind of defense there are for potential targets, which includes the existence of the marines garrisoned to protect the ship. |
| 3 – 4                  | ...a ruthless and savage killer of civilians and non-combatants, making a name for himself as a murderer and butcher.                                                |
| 5                      | ...running from his own people, having stolen the activation codes for a dozen mass-effect weapons they recently purchased from terrorists.                          |
| 6                      | ...a religious fanatic that believes that space is only for 'the angels', so he attacks and destroys any craft that he can.                                          |

#### Force Commander

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A middle-ranking marine that has seen some combat missions and some legislative duties, a good force commander empathizes with other marines. He knows that they want to see action but perhaps not a meat grinder of a war zone. He knows they need R&R from time to time but he would never let them go soft in the meantime.

| The force commander is ... |                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                      | ...deciding which one of his marine units he will be sending to a hostile-zone landing party, knowing that the one that he chooses might not make it back alive. |
| 3 – 4                      | ...willing to promote the character to squad leader for an important secret mission but no one can know about it until after it is completed.                    |
| 5 – 6                      | ...researching good locations for the barrack's next leave excursion and needs good ideas to put on the list of possibilities for the accountants to look over.  |

#### Navy Ensign

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

The men and women serving on a naval ship are numerous and generally outnumber the marines garrisoned upon them, so most squads stationed on naval assignments make friends amongst the crew quickly. Otherwise they end up spending their time alone and secluded in the marine barracks with only their guns to comfort them.

MILITARY PATRONS

#### Xenobiologist

This specialist scientist is an expert on previously unknown lifeforms and planetary genetic evolution but he cannot seem to do his job at peak efficiency when the marines and ground soldiers keep blasting and killing every foreign lifeform they stumble across!

#### Bay Worker

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

Most members of a ship's crew are expected to pull their weight when it comes to basic labor and such but a common cargo bay worker sees the lion's share of it. Hauling crates, equipment, vehicles and the like are an everyday duty for the bay worker and it makes them tough, strong and sometimes ignored by the top brass. It also means that they get to hear and see a lot of things that the upper echelons take for granted.

| The bay worker is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1                     | ...not a smart man when it comes to book learning but he has good street sense and is pretty sure he saw a few naval ensigns make off with a crate marked 'medical' before it went through security.   |
| 2 – 3                 | ...baffled by the amount of additional munitions that came in with the last shipment. A little checking shows it to be a misprint on the manifest and he needs some advice on how to get rid of it.    |
| 4 – 5                 | ...an ex-marine who was honorably discharged due to a bad leg wound; he loves to hear what the old squads are up to.                                                                                   |
| 6                     | ...trying to figure out how best to tell someone that he thinks he saw something he should not have while working after hours. It could get a lot of people in trouble and might endanger him as well. |

#### Wounded Crewman

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

One of the ship's loyal crew was injured recently and has been removed from the active duty roster. He might be shipped planetside for further evaluations if his condition is worse than the doctor thinks and it has put him in a foul mood, taking his unpleasantness out on others.

| The wounded crewman is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                      | ...bitter that he was hurt outside of a combat situation and hates anyone who can survive the thick of battle unscathed.                                                                                                         |
| 3 – 4                      | ...the unlucky ensign that caught a stray round from one of the characters' weapons.                                                                                                                                             |
| 5                          | ...sure that his injury was somehow the direct fault of one of the characters and is planning an elaborate revenge.                                                                                                              |

#### Brig Jailor

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship/Starbase

Not always a military role, the Officer in charge of making sure the brig cells on a ship or starbase are ready to house drunks, criminals and the occasional refugee. When the cells are filled, it is the jailor's job to make sure that they stay safe and more importantly – where they are!

| The brig jailor is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                  | ...trying to get his brig ready for a dangerous new guest that his ship is ferrying between prison planets and he is afraid he may not have enough security.                                                                  |
| 3 – 4                  | ...throwing a bi-weekly card game in his brig because there are never any criminals to house there and his job has been rather boring lately.                                                                                 |
| 5 – 6                  | ...concerned that one of his part-time jailors is selling contraband to the inmates and running messages for them, probably for a small profit. He is not sure if he should put a stop to it or try to make some money on it! |

#### Media Leak

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A military character's life is hard enough as it is; performing all of the cold duties and orders they are given without pause. When the ever-watching and ever-judging eye of the media is lurking around, nothing they do seems to be right at all. This person is a reporter or informant for the greater force of the public media and they are not backing down in light of a good story.

| The media leak is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                 | ...truly neutral in his dealings but still prefers looking into potential conspiracies and cover ups for ratings.                                                                                              |
| 3                     | ...somewhat of a media star and the characters have to keep him safe or else their agency will look very bad in public opinion.                                                                                |
| 4 – 5                 | ...a gore hound, constantly looking for the most grisly shots and pictures they can get, putting them directly in the way of missions, investigations and maneuvers.                                           |
| 6                     | ...being paid on the side by an anti-governmental organization and they will edit anything they record to make the military look bad – showing the characters in situations that did not happen as they imply. |

#### Heavy Platform Gunner

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

There are fewer people in the military who love their jobs as much as the platform gunnery teams. One to three men aiming, loading and firing heavy anti-personnel weaponry from a semi-mobile station, a platform gunner rarely gets called upon for duty unless extreme violence is necessary.

| The heavy platform gunner is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                            | ...an old basic training buddy of the characters. He went into gunnery when they went into their own specializations, if any.                                                                                                                |
| 3 – 4                            | ...looking for a stand in on his team for his next mission due to the regular guy getting sick at the last minute.                                                                                                                           |
| 5                                | ...heading down to the practice range for his weekly accuracy and rate-of-fire update.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6                                | ...holding onto an extra heavy weapons rig that the requisition guys did not want back after the last mission. He might be inclined to sell it to a character pretty cheap if they ask nicely and promise to let him show them how it works. |

#### MedBay Nurse

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: MedBay

Unlike a combat medic or ship's doctor, larger vessels and facilities can have entire staffs of medical professionals on hand to deal with casualties and the everyday risks of life in the current age. While the doctors and higher-end staff are well paid, nurses tend to make middle-of-the-road wages for long hours, thankless duties and huge amounts of stress.

| The MedBay nurse is ... |                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1                       | ...on a much-needed break and he will not abide anyone getting in the way of his two hours of respite.                                                    |
| 2 – 3                   | ...studying to become a full-fledged MedBay doctor. This means sleepless nights of studying and a rather constant irritation in his voice and mannerisms. |
| 4 – 5                   | ...not what he seems; he enjoys the needles, scalpels and rasps of his profession way too much for anyone to feel safe with him at their bedside.         |
| 6                       | ...wanted for questioning in a potential malpractice situation.                                                                                           |

#### Armory Technician

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

When the military loans out its supplies from the armory, it is rarely returned in exactly the same condition. There is often a team of a few skilled individuals whose sole job is to knock the dents out and fill the holes in the equipment that can be re-used. They keep the guns and armor working for the soldiers, which makes them prized staff of any military armory.

| The armory technician is ... |                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                        | ...just getting off from a long shift of filling armor damage with poly-poxy and he needs a stiff drink and a long shower to get the chemical smell off of him. |
| 3 – 4                        | ...delivering a patched suit of battle dress to the marine force commander and could use an extra set of hands to help him.                                     |
| 5 – 6                        | ...a part-time black marketer of gear that 'could not be repaired' and is looking to make a few sales.                                                          |

#### Brig Escapee

Required Skills: Investigate Required Equipment: Ship/Starbase

It does not happen very often but occasionally someone manages to overpower their guards or hack the locks in the brig, escaping into the rest of the ship or starbase. He will hide as best he can but if he has to fight off capture – he will.

| The brig escapee is ... |                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                   | ...in a state of detoxification from the illegal substances that got him arrested in the first place.           |
| 3                       | ...a dangerous ex-military guerrilla that will make it very hard to catch him alive.                            |
| 4                       | ...a former friend of one of the characters and he will use that to his advantage.                              |
| 5                       | ...now wanted for nearly killing two brig jailors.                                                              |
| 6                       | ...a professional killer who needed to get caught by the authorities in order to get closer to his real target. |

#### Rookie Star Marine

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Although it takes months of being in the service to get accepted into the ranks of the Star Marines, it is a prestigious and monumentally important promotion in any soldier's career. When they are green they sometimes forget what the uniform carries with it and this rookie still thinks of himself as just another marine – which makes him much easier to approach than a standard Star Marine.

| The rookie Star Marine is ... |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2                         | ...a little nervous to go on his first drop in the corps.                                                                                                                    |
| 3 – 4                         | ...new to the area and trying to make a few friends outside of his unit but knows that he has to keep his contacts within the military or his squad will think he is 'soft'. |
| 5 – 6                         | ...just getting back from his first mission and wants to hit the Officers' bar and tell his old friends what happened.                                                       |

#### Naval Security Agent

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

A cross between military police Officer and ship security, naval security agents are investigators and enforcers of military law on board their ships. They are given a remarkable amount of power by the staff of a ship and often that power can go to their head. This means that some naval security agents believe themselves to be the law's only real voice on their ship, making them somewhat above the law.

| The naval security agent is ... |                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 – 2                           | ...investigating a string of thefts and vandalisms throughout the ship.                                                                                      |
| 3 – 4                           | ...convinced that one of the characters is the prime suspect in a major crime that took place and now he is looking into their activities much more closely. |
| 5 – 6                           | ...as crooked as most of his arrests. He wants bribes and favors or he will drum up charges to arrest the characters.                                        |

#### Student of Warfare

Required Skills: Advocate Required Equipment: None

The academy sends students and instructors alike to where they will be plying their skills when they graduate, placing them on military compounds, bases and starships. Although no marine wants a 'tagalong' with them around the clock, they know that they could be dealing with the next junior Officer or flight deck administrator, so they have to try and do their best to teach them what they can.

#### Squadmate

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

A member of one of the squads that the characters performed duties with, this person remembers the characters well enough to seek them out and want to spend some time with them.

#### Armory Mechanic

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Starbase

Like the armory technician, who fixes easily-replaced equipment that comes back from a mission, the armory mechanic is in charge of making sure that military vehicles are in working order when they return from a requisition. Unlike a few thousand credits lost when a gun breaks or a suit of armor is irreparable, this mechanic has to tell his supply Officers that he cannot fix a multi-million credit APC or Gravcopter.

| The armory mechanic is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Ombudsman

Required Skills: Advocate Required Equipment: None

This professional legal advisor and mediator is often the closest thing that any military personnel ever get to an attorney or courtly judge in their careers. The ombudsman helps get the laws moving and the process of repairing damages and such taken care of. Although it is not the most gratifying job in the world, it is an important one.

| The ombudsman is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                 |

MILITARY PATRONS

#### P.O.W

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

After a military function of most varieties there are prisoners of war taken; these prisoners must be ferried from the point of their capture to the government's desired holding facility.

#### Combat Evaluation Expert

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

The supporting government of the military occasionally wants to ensure that its soldiers are doing what they can in combat situations to preserve ammunition, keep collateral damage low and uphold the tenets of the government's ideals. This classroom-trained 'expert' is sent into missions and garrisons with units in order to judge their performances – and perhaps cost them their funding levels.

| The combat evaluation expert is ... |                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Widow(er)

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

The spouse and family of a fallen comrade or ally is never an easy thing to deal with but most units and agencies within the military do their best to take care of them. Losing a loved one is never easy but knowing that the fallen's squadmates will always be there like a second family is comforting for many years to come.

| The widow(er) is ... |                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Naval Breaching Troop

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Ship

The few naval soldiers on a ship that are trained to perform boarding actions and breaching runs, which are normally left to the marines and hired mercenaries, are judgmental and hard-edged when it comes to the others who do their job. This trooper believes that he and his naval comrades do not need marines and such on board their ships and are not afraid to say so.

| The naval breaching troop is ... |                                                                                                                                |

#### Surveillance Officer

Required Skills: Admin Required Equipment: Ship/Starbase

Normally hidden away in his monitor-laden office deep within his assignment, this wide-eyed Officer is a partner to the chief of security and his agents. He spends his shifts watching over trouble areas through a myriad of security cameras and sensor sweeps and calls in suspicious or criminal behaviors. Few know more about the goings on in the vessel, a fact that can make some surveillance Officers seem a little creepy.

| The surveillance Officer is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Diplomatic Ambassador

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Although it may seem like a great honor to have this diplomatic ambassador from another government, species or culture around, it can also be a huge burden. Having to watch what they say and do around this person can be taxing but important, as any situation could easily lead to a horrible misunderstanding or political nightmare.

| The diplomatic ambassador is ... |                                                                                                                                                              |

#### Military Attorney

Required Skills: Advocate Required Equipment: None

It is far more common for military units to get embroiled in legal issues than one might think and public servants like this governmentally-sponsored lawyer make these instances low key and easily forgotten. They are the best friend to any soldier or Officer in legal trouble and are frequently the target of many raised glasses and toasts in military bars around the galaxy.

| The military attorney is ... |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Local Guide

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

Some people just do not want to be found and this person is one of them. He lives all alone for a reason and the sudden appearance of intrusive explorers or wayward wanderers will not do anything for his attitude.

This alien has its home territory marked out for all others to see - all others of his own species, that is.

#### Populace Leader

Required Skills: Admin Required Equipment: None

There is always a form of open leader to the populations of the galaxy. Whether it is a religious spokesman or a veteran warrior that guides the people through action, the populace will be led by some strong-willed soul.

#### Psionist-in-Exile

Required Skills: Investigate Required Equipment: None

The ability to read thoughts or affect the world around him with his mind did not help this psionist; instead it turned him into a pariah and got him labelled as a freak. He was sent to the middle of nowhere and told never to return.

| The psionist-in-exile is ... |                                                                                                          |

### Merchant

Characters in the Merchants career path are the lifeblood of galactic commerce. They travel on massive corporate barges, cargo haulers or even private passenger liners to seek out the opportunities that their job brings. Just as any salesman will say that there is something out there for everyone; there is a someone waiting out there to buy everything.

#### Petty Thief

This lesser miscreant does not necessarily need to steal to survive but he does so to pick up minor items that he cannot otherwise afford – or simply does not want to spend his credits on. He is a thorn in the side of most merchants and shopkeepers but nothing worth shedding blood over.

#### Loan Shark

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: Debt

Always willing to help out someone in a monetary bind in return for terrible interest rates, unfair payback schedules and threats of bodily harm, this criminal financier looks for those with monetary troubles.

#### Disgruntled Customer

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

This is a former customer of one of the characters who feels he was somehow mislead, taken advantage of or any of a dozen other reasons, which he sees as justification for his unpleasant behavior. Whatever the case, he feels it is totally justifiable of him to be rude and mean to the merchant.

| The disgruntled customer is ... |                                                                                                                              |

## Upper-Class Patrons

Just as it tends to be in real world civilizations, social structures in Traveller are dynamic and interestingly important to how the culture interacts. This chapter focuses upon the types of lifestyles that were given good opportunities, excellent access to resources and an otherwise higher quality of living. The people born to the upper class do not commonly have to deal with the same conflicts as common folk but they have their own brand of allegiances and nemeses.

### Nobility

Characters in the Nobility career path are raised with money, resources, contacts and attentions that most others never have access to. They are powerful members of their society and frequently found in the local limelight, even if they do not deserve it. This brings a multitude of unique persons in contact with them throughout their lives.

## Middle-Class Patrons

There is a vast majority amongst the civilizations found in the Traveller universe that make up the middle-class. By definition they assume the main portion of the average population, which makes them sometimes seem less exciting than the other social groupings but that simply is not so. There are dozens of interesting people that the average person can interact with; this chapter covers many of them.

### Entertainer

Characters in the Entertainer career path are devoted to a life of making other people feel certain emotions. Some entertainers make people laugh, others make them cry and still others make a living out of scaring their audience half to death. It can be a lucrative business venture but it takes talent and individuality; two things that are sometimes scarce in the universe.

#### Famous Politician

## Lower-Class Patrons

Where the lights do not shine brightly, the credits are scarce and the world is just a little bit lax on the letter of the law the lower class is king. Generally this social caste of character lives in the Traveller universe by the skin of their teeth and the cut of their jib. Only through their skills and the grace of those who they meet can they hope to survive.

### Rogue

Characters in the Rogue career path are criminals, miscreants and no-gooders who live on the credits that others earn. They are survivalists to the extreme but not in the common sense of the word. They spend their time with others of their ilk and stray from anyone with a badge or a legally-carried gun.

#### Hero-in-Training

Required Skills: Any Combat Required Equipment: None

No criminal wants to see an easy crime go sour because of a citizen that thinks he is a hero but this gun-toting do-gooder is going to do just that. Whatever the reason, he is going to pull that pistol and try to stop the characters.

#### Open-Van Salesman

Required Skills: Streetwise Required Equipment: None

#### Dishonorable Thief

## Mercenary Patrons

The Traveller universe is host to a different type of soldier, hired and legalised armed forces, that come in the greater label of 'mercenaries'.  They are far more numerous than some might think and many governments use them for the missions – or tickets – that they do not wish to fund on their own. It is on these ticketed assignments that mercenaries run into a surprising host of encounters.

> [!NOTE] The Mercenary Career Paths
> The following six mercenary career paths are found in the Traveller: Mercenary sourcebook. These patron lists are designed for their use, which would require owning or having access to that book as well. They can be used by anyone however, if the Referee allows it and could be substituted for other careers as well.

### Cadre

Characters in the Cadre career path are sent to faraway worlds and compounds to teach combat and military-esque skills to a variety of students. If they can pay for it, the cadre instructors will come and show them what they need to know. No matter who or what it might be.

of tyrannical governments and rarely get good press after their tickets are over. The people? The people either love them or fear them.

### Striker

Characters in the Striker career path are the infantry-for-hire in the mercenary ranks. They are called in for rapid assaults and lightning

meet a lot of new faces and sometimes get called upon to put a bullet in them.

#### Family Man

Required Skills: None Required Equipment: None

This enemy soldier is one of the hardest ones to deal with in a combat situation, as he is obviously the patriarch of a local family and does not truly want to be fighting this war except to protect them.

| The family man is ... |                                                                                                       |

#### Professional Soldier

Required Skills: Any Combat Required Equipment: None

This person belongs to no unit or no team; not even a club that discusses tactics. He is a cold-hearted wartime freelancer that does not use tickets or contracts to fight wars – he simply asks a price and then kills enough enemies to make it worth his time.

| The professional soldier is ... |                                                                                                                                                |

| 1 – 2                           | ...an ex-warmonger, particularly a soldier-of-fortune that lost the thrill of the battle to the glitter of gold and the clack of credit chips. |

| 5 – 6                           | ...working for a small fortune at the moment but could switch sides in an instant if he was offered more from the other side.                  |

#### Primary Commander

Required Skills: Admin Required Equipment: None

#### Enemy Commander

Required Skills: Stealth, Any Combat Required Equipment: None

| 3 – 4                      | ...brave enough to show up on the front lines but only in a mobile armored command tank.                                                                                      |
| 5 – 6                      | ...trying to get the characters' unit to come forward for a negotiation of surrender, which may or may not be a trick to get them all in one place for a trap.                |

#### Prime Striker Agent

Required Skills: Admin, Broker Required Equipment: None

Coming through all of the proper channels to the unit commander, this generous ticket agent believes he has the perfect opportunity for the characters to undertake. He has a proposal that simply cannot be ignored.

| 1 – 2                          | ...bringing an easy assault against a lower-tech fortress to the table but it would require the characters using matching lower tech – to avoid frightening the locals. |
| 3 – 4                          | ...in need of a morally flexible unit to eliminate a royal family in a neighboring nation. It pays very well – almost too well – to be as easy as it sounds.            |
| 5 – 6                          | ...ready to add any number of financial and compensation adjustments to the ticket if they agree to fly halfway around the galaxy to fight several foes for the client. |

### Warmonger

Characters in the Warmonger career path are the profiteers of wartime commerce. They make their fortunes on guns, armor, vehicles and spare parts. Bandages and bullets alike make them powerful and people from far and wide will come and see a warmonger when they are in town.

## Wild Card

In the vast universe that comprises the Traveller game system, there will be times and events that just do not warrant a simple explanation. Within the scope of these weird events, Referees will need to draw upon a different bank of social interactions and plot possibilities. This chapter gathers a number of them in one place.

It should be noted that the wild card Patrons are not to be used commonly or without first looking at them deeply. They are potentially game altering and unique, to put it lightly.

Characters in all career paths are likely to eventually come to an impasse with fate and they will get dealt an odd hand in an unlikely situation. These are the wild card events – and they live up to their name through the sheer strangeness and randomness of their existence and appearances.
