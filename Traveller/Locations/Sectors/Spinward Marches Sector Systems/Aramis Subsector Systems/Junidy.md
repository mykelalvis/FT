# JUNIDY

Junidy lies right on the coreward edge of the Imperium.  It is part of a cluster of worlds accessible with some difficulty by jump-2 ships coming coreward, or trailing via the [[Pretoria subsector]] of Deneb. Access from spinward, that is from the Regina subsector, is restricted by three or more parsecs of rift across all routes.

As a result, Junidy and its surrounding worlds are cut off from mainstream Imperial culture and receive many visitors from the [[Vargr Extents]]. Most are traders or Travellers, although corsairs do sometimes try to pass through the region. The most blatant are either forced to sneak through the frontier zone using wilderness refuelling (obtaining fuel from gas giants or by cracking water for hydrogen) or operate on the frontier, making a strike before disappearing over the border.

However, many corsairs masquerade as legitimate trade ships and these are often able to bluff their way through patrols and routine inspections along the way, getting into a trade route and preying on targets there.

Some organised corsair bands use a combination of these methods, slipping actual pirate ships in covertly. These heavily armed vessels are not far from being true warships and could never pass as merchants under an inspection.  Once within the Imperium, the raiders rendezvous with support vessels pretending to be legitimate merchants.  After a raid, the warships move to the next target area, conceal themselves and wait for a new opportunity while loot is sent back aboard the trade ships.

A particularly clever version of this trick has been used on at least two occasions by the Kforuzeng, thought to be the most powerful Vargr corsair band in Gvurrdon.  The Kforuzeng have been known to stash ships on remote asteroids until the heat from the last set of raids has died down, then slip a crew through aboard a merchant vessel. This crew boards the stashed vessel, makes a series of raids and then proceeds homeward after hiding their ship again.

Junidy, and similar worlds, are on the front line of this activity and system defence commanders routinely complain that they receive very little help from the Imperial Navy and yet come in for criticism every time a Vargr corsair vessel that they 'allowed' through makes a successful attack. Patrols from the Imperial Navy base at Riacon in Pretoria occasionally cross into the Marches to help, creating a command-jurisdiction issue routinely ignored in the name of getting the job done.

Scout vessels from the way station also augment local patrols, usually by re-tasking survey ships with excellent sensor arrays to watch for intruders sneaking through the system. This is a stop-gap solution implemented decades ago and has been left in place for lack of anything better, on the grounds that it works fairly well.

The way station is a large installation mostly concerned with maintaining the communications link into Pretoria and servicing Scout Service vessels. There is also an extensive training facility, which deals for the most part with Contact & Liaison work and specialises in the study of Vargr subcultures. The base is often used as a jumping-off point for long-range missions into the Vargr Extents and the relatively unexplored space beyond. A range of support vessels and scout cruisers are based there, although some have been known to depart on missions of several years' duration and are rarely seen in port.

Junidy itself is a small world with a very thin atmosphere, home to a population numbering around 30 billion of whom about half belong to the minor race nicknamed 'Dandelions' or 'Dandies'. Their correct name is [[Llellewyoly]], as near as humans can pronounce it. The Dandies are adapted to the extremes of temperature experienced by Junidy in the course of its day and display traits of both plant and animal.


The human population has a TL9 civilization that is, for the most part, separate from that of the native Dandies. Conflict between the two groups has flared up on several occasions and even quiet periods are not without tensions and the occasional incident.
