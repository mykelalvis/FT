# HAZEL

Hazel is located one parsec from [[Trin]], one of the most important worlds in the [[Spinward Marches]]. If it had possessed good mineral resources it might have become a supporting industrial center and enjoyed rapid early growth but, lacking them, Hazel was relegated to always being a backwater. The world is not really on the way to anywhere and does not receive much passing trade but for a time it did enjoy slight popularity as a tourist destination.

Hazel's atmosphere is listed as being tainted but the 'taint' actually takes the form of local bacteria that cannot survive for long away from their parent world's ecosphere. Although these bacteria can cause a range of unpleasant respiratory infections, a simple inoculation is available, which renders the recipient immune for a period of several weeks. Thus Hazel is safe to visit for anyone who has taken the correct medication or built up an immunity over several years.

Although the starport and its associated startown are rather bland, most of Hazel's small cities are picturesque and tend to lie in areas of considerable natural beauty. Tourism provided much-needed revenue and in particular a water-based tourism industry arose. The cities of Cocta and New Okayama, lying on opposite ends of Lake Okayama, were particularly popular. Cruise ships (inevitably called 'steamers', even though they used more advanced engines) plied back and forth along the lake carrying holidaymakers who spent their Credits in the cities or aboard steamers.

The boom was short-lived. The tourism economy was already waning when a large-scale rebellion broke out, making the region north of the starport/capital dangerous to visit. Attacks on offworld tourists, intended to harm the world's only industry and force the government to the negotiating table, all-but-killed the trade and drove the local economy into deep recession. Today, the steamers mostly rust at their moorings, although a few still operate in the safer regions to the south of the starport and one or two are used as gunboats by the rebels.
