Doing business in the Imperium can be highly profitable. With a few aberrations, its history has been one long steady climb to wealth and prosperity. Built upon the twin pillars of free trade and self-defense, with little in the way of laws or regulations to guide the actions of individual worlds or the companies that do business on them, the environment is ideal for competition. The few regulatory agencies that do exist are there primarily to ensure that corporations do not violate Imperial law or sovereignty.

Most corporations of the Imperium are restricted to a single world or small number of worlds within a few parsecs of each other. Very successful corporations can dominate the market in a large expanse of a sector or sometimes the entire sector. Only a precious few corporations can be said to be pan-Imperial. These are known as the megacorporations.

Megacorporations are truly massive in scope, with offices, factories, research-and-development facilities and administration centres spread throughout Imperial space and often beyond its borders. Most are run like any other company, including corporate officers, boards of directors and multiple levels of management. The main difference is that these companies cover such a broad area that top executives are only responsible for strategic decisions and long-term planning with the bulk of day-to-day decisions made by regional managers who are empowered at the level of a chief executive officer at smaller corporations. The distance between branch offices and the time required for communication necessitates this level of autonomy.

Megacorporate operations are so diverse and widespread that subsidiaries may find themselves inadvertently competing with each other. Sometimes this is even desirable if doing so adversely affects a competitor in another market. Megacorporations are exorbitantly wealthy, with capital and assets distributed throughout Imperial space. Most are simply too large to be traded on a single exchange; therefore, their stock is divided into regional financial centres with overall value published on an intermittent basis, limited by the speed of interstellar communications. Data is carried in encrypted storage blocks on the x-boat network but most of the megacorporations maintain [[Intell-class Courier|courier]] fleets to carry more sensitive data.

The oldest megacorporations are the three dominant Vilani bureaux: Makhidkarun, Sharurshid and Naasirka. In the Ziru Sirka era, the bureaux were responsible for the governance of vast regions of space. Naasirka governed its spinward sectors, Sharurshid the trailing sectors and Makhidkarun dominated the coreward region of the empire. The central region and various tributaries were run by a mix of the three along with smaller contenders. After the fall of the Ziru Sirka, the bureaux were gradually transformed into bona fide megacorporations, each with a massive sphere of influence and accumulated wealth.
