Despite the excellent record of the x-boat network, many megacorporate officers do not trust the scouts to carry their most sensitive information. The Intell-class courier is designed to carry encrypted data, small prototypes and other essential capital between star systems quickly and efficiently. The design substitutes a secure vault in lieu of a cargo hold.

Megacorporate offices are spread out across Imperial space and this ship can bridge the gap quickly with its jump-5 capability. State-of-the-art virtual crew software enables the ship to operate as a drone, with no crew at all if desired. A small bridge and staterooms are provided to accommodate a skeleton crew in case corporate officers are not comfortable with an AI carrying sensitive data and cargo across multiple sectors. Eight low berths are included to ship key personnel from one megacorporate office to another or to provide a rotating 1- to 2-person crew.

The class is named for important Imperial financial centres and famous corporate events and transactions. [[Intell]] is the largest city on [[Capital]] and its primary business and financial centre.
