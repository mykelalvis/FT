# Kfuergeanghaghzoe Uknodantueks Naekhfaenoungvozghou

Kfuergeanghaghzoe Uknodantueks Naekhfaenoungvozghou is a Vargr business group, whose name is not surprisingly shortened to Kfur-Naek for most purposes. A literal translation into Galanglic is virtually impossible, but the idiom and general meaning can be presented as something like ‘Charismatic Alliance of Heroic Starship Leaders’.

Kfur-Naek is a business group in the Vargr sense, in that whilst it does have a head office and all manner of paperwork, its real nature is as an alliance of starship captains or leaders of small groups of ships. There tends to be an assumption that whenever four or more Vargr get together aboard a starship piracy inevitably breaks out, but this is more of a racial stereotype than anything else. Kfur-Naek’s captains are not pirates and would be very offended at anyone who suggested they were.

That is not to say that Kfur-Naek’s business practices are particularly ethical. Most captains take the attitude that their ships can defy the law of gravity, so lesser laws can be ignored by those with the capability and the daring. This flouting of laws is mostly confined to

playing fast and loose with traffic control directives and similar minor nuisance type infractions that will not result in repercussions that will affect business, but the overall attitude to laws is that they only matter if those who made them can provide effective enforcement.

Kfur-Naek ships are quite happy to undertake smuggling. Indeed, most captains make no distinction between smuggling and normal commerce, other than a recognition of the need to bypass patrols and defeat inspections. They will honour a deal made in good faith and will get even with those who do not. They are flamboyant and daring, preferring speculative trade to mundane freighting, and will deliberately go in harm’s way to make a profit. Kfur-Naek ships can be spotted in ports with heavy piracy or making runs through dangerous star systems. They will even land at known pirate havens to undertake honest trade, essentially thumbing their muzzles at pirates and anyone else who interferes in their business.

Kfur-Naek does have a significant turnover in vessels as a result of its risk-taking, and its ships will occasionally gain a new captain when someone fails to live up to the buccaneering standards of the group or loses the faith of his crew. Nevertheless, their aggressive and daring business practices generally make good profits and tend to attract new recruits who want to be part of this heroic trading siblinghood. Kfur-Naek will happily accept non- Vargr so long as they meet its standards.

Members of the group will help outsiders who are in need, and never forget who owes a favour or a debt to whom. This works both ways – help a Kfur-Naek member and he will owe you, but if he saves you from pirates he will someday call it in and he will expect the debt to be paid. Kfur-Naek ships will race to the aid of someone under pirate attack while everyone else is jumping out, precisely because it is dangerous and because they are better than everyone else. They never tire of reminding anyone within earshot of it, too.
