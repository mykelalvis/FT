The Third Imperium has fought four Frontier Wars against the Zhodani Consulate and its allies. Worlds have changed hands, borders have been readjusted, but never has the Imperium been seriously threatened... until now. As Zhodani battle fleets emerge from jumpspace at Regina, Efate, and Jewell, something is different this time.

The Imperials are divided, arguing over who should be Sector Duke even as raiders tear through the Lunion and Glisten subsectors. Lanth is under ground attack. Extolay is burning. The Imperial response is fragmented and ineffective. Reinforcements are months away and the Sector Admiral is frittering away what forces he has.

Jump into a trench at the Fall of Lanth or join the intrigue at the ducal court at Mora. Run weapons to Ine Givar insurgents or chase Sword Worlds raiders across Lunion. Hold back the Zhodani tide at the First Battle of Regina or lead the breakthrough of the 40th Fleet as it lunges at Macene.

These are the great events that will shape the future, and it may be that the outcome rests on the actions of your Travellers.

The Fifth Frontier War is the first sourcebook in this massive campaign that can span years of play and will powerfully alter the future of the Charted Space universe.

The Fifth Frontier War presents an overview of one of the most important events in the Charted Space Universe; a titanic clash between the Third Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. This volume can stand alone as a guide to running a campaign during the Fifth Frontier War but it will be joined by additional sourcebooks and campaign adventures to create an entire Traveller product line. Travellers will be able to experience the great events of the war from the perspective of the Zhodani, the Imperials and people not connected to either major faction. The course of the war might be dictated by the actions of the Travellers.

Veteran Travellers will note that the storyline deviates from previously published sources, notably The Spinward Marches Campaign. Some elements of the timeline in that volume have been retained but it was necessary to redefine the situation, the forces involved and so forth. This was for several reasons, notably the fact that the Charted Space universe has developed since the publication of these books. The plans and motivations of the forces involved might not be what we thought they were four decades ago.

Alteration to the timeline was also necessary to accommodate some of the adventures which will follow this volume and to create new story possibilities. The course of the war as put forward in The Spinward Marches Campaign was a story that had already been told, background to an early post-war campaign. We are now presenting a set of new stories, allowing the Travellers to experience what it is to be a Vargr corsair or a courtier at Mora against the backdrop of a major war. The Travellers will be able to influence the course of the conflict and that is not possible if they already know what day the Zhodani fleet arrives at a given star system.

The outcome of the conflict is by no means certain. At time of writing, not even the author knows who the winner will be. Let those who think they know the history of Charted Space take note – we are working closely with Far Future Enterprises on this campaign and there is room for a different canon outcome if events dictate it. Previous publications on the subject might best be considered projections or simulations of a possible conflict in the region, whereas what is happening now is the real thing. There are some surprises in store.

# INTRODUCTION

Only the Traveller Core Rulebook is needed to run this campaign but the Referee will find other materials useful. Notably, the Imperial Navy sourcebook, the Naval Campaigns Handbook and Mercenary will be highly useful, along with Behind the Claw. The latter provides additional background information on the region. The nature of the campaign is entirely up to the Travellers and the Referee; there is a major interstellar war going on but that is not necessarily a reason why robbing the Bank of Mora is out of the question. There is plenty of room for 'normal' adventuring, searching for Ancients relics, crime, intrigue and interstellar trade... it is just that things are more turbulent and more dangerous.

REFEREE'S NOTES Fifth Frontier War books have a different look and feel to other Traveller materials. This is more than stylistic; there are additional rules not found in the mainstream line. That does not mean they cannot be used there, of course. These rules were included to allow Travellers a choice of how to resolve incidents, particularly large-scale ones involving many people or fleets of starships. Anything can be gamed out using the standard rules but if the Referee deems it more suitable two other methods are available.

The Fifth Frontier War introduces the option for narrative resolution of some situations. This requires a good rapport between the Travellers and the Referee but can result in greater immersion and the feeling of making a difference in the universe. If the Travellers create a plausible narrative given the situation, the Referee can use it rather than rolling dice but always has power of veto over self-serving or silly ideas.

We also introduce mechanics for tracking the Power and Influence of a given individual and their relations with the Travellers. This is by way of the Affinity/Enmity value, rated from -6 to +6. Power and Influence are rated 0 to 6. Someone with Power 1 and Influence 5 might have little in the way of immediately useable resources but can persuade others to do their bidding; someone with Power 4 and Affinity/Enmity -4 will likely be sending powerful forces to hunt the Travellers, or maybe making trouble in the courts for them.

### NOMENCLATURE

Throughout the Fifth Frontier War books it is the practice to abbreviate the names of the Frontier Wars using their number. Thus the First Frontier War is 1FW, the Second is 2FW and so forth. This eliminates any confusion between the 4FW and 5FW and creates an easy shorthand.

The Zhodani Consulate and its allies are popularly known as the Outworld Coalition
(OC). When this term is used it applies to polities and groups which are at that time formally recognised allies of the Zhodani. Thus a Sword Worlder unit might be referred to as an OC force, as might a group of Vargr ships serving as mercenaries. Opportunistic pirates or insurgent movements not formally allied to the Zhodani would not be referred to as OC forces. In situations where the forces present are overwhelmingly Zhodani and contain few or no allied elements, these would be referred to as Coalition or Zhodani forces. The latter reference does not preclude the presence of relatively small allied elements.

The term Imperial similarly is used for forces that are under the direct command of the Third Imperium or operating on its behalf. This can include mercenary forces on contract to the Imperium or vessels contributed by a privately owned merchant line if they are in the Imperial chain of command. Allied, co-belligerent or loosely cooperating forces are not considered to be 'Imperial' in this sense unless they are a small minority within an Imperial formation.

Imperial-allied or Imperial-aligned forces are included in the Imperial designation to indicate their allegiance but if operating as the main force in their area they are identified as aligned or allied. For example, the primary Imperial ally is the Darrian Confederation. A joint Imperial- Darrian force might be referred to as Imperial for brevity but a primarily Darrian task force would be identified as such.

The Third Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate are both human-dominated states and thus both have their origins on Terra. The events leading up to the Fifth Frontier War were set in motion in the distant past, when the mysterious Ancients transplanted humans from Terra to many other worlds, among these Zhdant and Vland. The people who developed there after the fall of the Ancients became known as the Zhodani and Vilani respectively.

The Zhodani are notable for their widespread use of psionics. Indeed, psionic capability is linked to social status in Zhodani society. It is theorised by outsiders that the Zhodani gained insights into the psionic sciences by way of early contact with a population of Chirpers. Others have suggested the Ancients themselves taught their most favoured human servants the secrets of the mind and denied them to 'lesser' human groups such as those who became the Vilani.

Whatever the truth may be, the people of Zhdant developed psionic powers alongside technology and by -6731 had founded an interstellar state they called Driantia Zhdantia. This translates into Galanglic as
'Zhodani Consulate', the term used by most outsiders. The development of the jump drive in -5415 allowed a rapid expansion into local space.

The Zhodani might have pushed further into what is now Imperial space had they not been so fascinated by what lay coreward. In its long history the Consulate has launched eight Core Expeditions, each pushing further towards the galactic core. This is no small matter, requiring the construction of forward bases and sometimes wars to remove societies that might be an obstacle and the reason for this endeavour remains a mystery outside the highest echelons of Zhodani society. The latest of these expeditions began in 1048 and is projected to end around 1150.

The Zhodani were not the first humans on the cosmic stage. The people of Vland, today known as the Vilani, discovered the jump drive in -9135 and were surprised to find fellow humans living on nearby worlds. Integrating these less advanced societies allowed the Vilani to quickly create an interstellar state which became known as the Ziru Sirka, or Grand Empire of

Stars. It began as a loose confederation based mainly on trade but from around -5400 to -4015 a series of conflicts known collectively as the Consolidation Wars reshaped the polity into an empire.

The end of the Consolidation Wars can be considered the beginnings of Vilani decline, although it would be many centuries before this became apparent. With the frontiers apparently secured, attention turned inward. The occasional threat emerged and was crushed without difficulty. That changed from
-2422, when early Terran exploration encountered the fringes of the decaying Ziru Sirka. Several centuries of conflict ensued, collectively known as the Interstellar Wars and culminated with the conquest of the Vilani Imperium by the Terrans.

In the meantime, the Ziru Sirka had made contact with the Zhodani Consulate. The Vilani Imperium was not expanding in any meaningful sense at the time, although some groups did leave Vilani space seeking a home to spinward. They settled in what is now the Spinward Marches and nearby systems, and for the most part were ignored by Zhodani whose attention was to coreward as usual.

The conquest of the Vilani Imperium by the Terrans resulted in the Second Imperium, or Rule of Man, but a combination of war and the deep decline of the Ziru Sirka made collapse inevitable. By -1776 the Second Imperium had more or less dissolved and many worlds collapsed back to pre-spaceflight technology. The ensuing Long Night, in which there was little interstellar activity in Imperial space, did not affect the Zhodani. They went about their business unconcerned with events in the collapsed empire.

# HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Some enclaves retained starflight and held together through the difficult next few centuries. Among these were a region around Terra and one centred on Sylea. It was there that the Third Imperium was founded, in what is now Year 0. Sylean gunboats forged a trading pact that grew ever larger, taking on the trappings of empire and claiming legitimacy from the previous two. Links were forged with Terra and her allies, now styling themselves the Old Earth Union. By the time the Third Imperium contacted the Zhodani Consulate, in 562, the Old Earth Union had been peacefully absorbed into the Imperium. Relations with the Zhodani were not so friendly.

#### THE EARLY FRONTIER WARS

The expanding Imperials knew the Zhodani Consulate was there but had little information other than tales told by long-distance traders. The Zhodani, for their part, were busy elsewhere and had all the territory they needed. The Imperial colonisation of Deneb and the Spinward Marches was noticed but little was done beyond information-gathering. It appears that Zhodani strategic thinking of the time was very long-term; this was a new iteration of an empire that had collapsed twice and probably posed little threat.

As the Imperial border advanced, it became apparent this new Imperium was bold and expansionistic, and might become a problem before it inevitably succumbed to internal pressures. The Consulate began a programme of passive interference with Imperial expansion, offering generous trade deals to worlds that might resist Imperial annexation and stirring up resistance. These measures had little effect and nor did the rather more direct approach of inciting Vargr corsair groups to harass Imperial shipping in Deneb. The frontier was toughened a little but the Imperials pushed on regardless, eventually reaching the very borders of the Zhodani Consulate.

Tension was inevitable and soon a segment of the Zhodani armed forces was pushing for a campaign of containment. It is not clear when the decision to attack the Imperium was made, nor exactly what the criteria for triggering might have been, but in 589, just a couple of decades after formal contact, Zhodani forces entered newly-Imperial territory with the intent of driving the border back. The forces committed were limited but entirely sufficient to overrun a frontier without highly developed worlds or much of a fleet assigned to it. Unfortunately for the Consulate, the Imperium anticipated conflict and had already transferred significant forces to reserve positions in the Spinward Marches and Deneb.

The resulting clash was far more violent than the Zhodani had expected. Their plan to send the Imperials fleeing all the way back to Deneb then dictate a treaty from there became a vicious scramble for hotly contested star systems. What should have been an overwhelming force was only modestly more powerful than what the Imperials brought to the field. Losses mounted rapidly, and in 604 a ceasefire was agreed.

The Imperial hero of the day was Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, who fought the Zhodani to a standstill despite receiving almost no meaningful reinforcements. He was heavily critical of the Emperor over this matter, with some justification. However, historians have noted that Plankwell started the war with more fighting power than two standard sector fleets under his hand. His critics point out that he had enough left after the war to launch a drive on Capital and fight a successful campaign in what became the Imperial Civil War.

The Civil War raged from 604 to 622, although Plankwell was killed early in the conflict. During this period the Zhodani launched a renewed campaign to drive the Imperials from the region. Some consider this Second Frontier War to be a continuation of the first rather than a separate conflict and in many ways it was. The Consulate needed time to regroup and rebuild its forces after the surprisingly hard first war and may have accepted peace simply to buy that time. Other historians believe the peace would have held but for the Civil War; the opportunity was too good to pass up.

With a depleted fleet under her command, the current Sector Admiral, Arbellatra Khatami Alkhalikoi, should not have been able to stem the Zhodani advance. However, despite being wracked by conflict among its top-ranking nobles and great admirals, the Imperium remained essentially intact. Official histories downplay the quiet mutiny of many ships and squadrons, which left the forces battling for Capital or abandoned their posts on other borders to make the long voyage spinward. These crews placed loyalty to the Imperium above any particular claimant to the throne – including the one currently occupying it. The subject is an awkward one to this day and generally avoided by both the navy and the high nobility.

Regardless of the rights and wrongs associated with this fleet movement, Arbellatra received an intermittent flow of reinforcements from the early months of 616 onwards. Many crews were weary from their long voyage but still had to be pushed into the fray to shore up failing defences. Despite their losses, these forces turned the tide and emerged from the conflict battle-hardened and more importantly unified. Admiral Arbellatra had won their respect and admiration in forcing the Zhodani back to the negotiating table. History records little dissent when she proposed marching on Capital.

Leaving a force to secure the Spinward Marches and put out the remaining fires, Arbellatra led her fleet to the Core and proclaimed her intention to end the war. She did not at that time seek to ascend to the Iridium Throne, although arguably she had the strongest claim.

Right of Fleet Control was cited by most claimants, along with vague bloodline-related factors. Arbellatra commanded a bigger and better fleet than any other claimant and it was strengthened when ships came over from other factions to join their former comrades.

Arbellatra still had to fight, and fight hard, but her reputation swayed many and her unified fleet smashed those who still resisted. She had an allure none of the others did – whilst they had been selfishly fighting for power, she was saving the Imperium from invasion. The 'quiet mutiny' of forces that went to assist her is another difficult topic today but in that time it was inspiring to many. Most claimants commanded a force from one region or another but Arbellatra had attracted supporters from all across the Imperium. It was this symbolism, as much as the ships themselves, that brought the war to a close.

In addition, Arbellatra was wiser than other claimants. She firmly announced her intentions to stop the fighting so that an Emperor could be properly selected by the Imperial Moot. As her dominance grew, she actually kept that promise, humbly offering her fleet to the service of the Imperium rather than demanding rulership of it. Whether this was a clever gambit or an honest gesture is debatable but it succeeded. Arbellatra was installed as Regent until an Emperor was selected and in due course she was asked to accept the throne. Thus began the current dynasty of Emperors.

The Third Frontier War is generally considered to be part of the Early Frontier Wars period despite occurring over three centuries later, largely because it is difficult to trace a specific point where the conflict became inevitable, nor to say whether it always was. Tensions between the Imperium and the Consulate were not alleviated by the outcome of either conflict and as a result the Third Frontier War is generally considered to be a continuation.

The shape of the conflict was determined by astrography and strategic reality. This was no longer an Imperial frontier; it was a developed region containing multiple worlds capable of fielding powerful defences. The Zhodani, for their part, were much more aware of the Imperials' strengths and their determination to hold systems. Jewell in particular was a 'fortress world' with massive defences bolstered by forward-deployed elements of the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet. Taking such a well defended system would have absorbed massive resources, so the main Zhodani advance bypassed it.

While lighter elements of the fleet conducted hit-and-run raids on Jewell and the surrounding systems, the main advance went by way of Boughene, Efate and Pixie. The Imperial 'thin, hard crust' strategy of stationing heavy forces right on the frontier was proven flawed, as Zhodani forces broke through in some areas and bypassed others. These forces were either crushed piecemeal over the next few months or forced to retreat through contested systems to regroup. The Zhodani advance reached Porozlo and a base was established there for an assault on Rhylanor. This was narrowly defeated, leading to a long siege of the mainworld.

Meanwhile, a secondary axis of advance drove into the Lanth subsector. Lanth itself was bypassed, with Zhodani forces moving in towards Regina along the Spinward Main. Other forces staged through Sword Worlds space and attempted to push trailing-coreward. This was a much smaller force, intended as a diversion from the main drive on Rhylanor. Strikes on systems on the Spinward Main in Lanth and Lunion prompted fears of an attack on Mora but despite some intense raiding no large-scale assault developed.

Regina came under heavy attack and is widely assumed by Imperial historians to have been the primary target of the first phase. Its importance as a communications and commercial centre was considerable but outweighed by the political value of the target. The loss of Regina would have sent shockwaves through Imperial society and possession of the local group of systems would have allowed the Zhodani Consulate to 'bite off' the coreward end of Regina and all of Jewell. These would surely have fallen within months.

Efforts to relieve the pressure on Regina led to a rather scatterbrained series of Imperial counter- offensives which cost both sides dearly. These had to go around the hotly disputed systems near Rhylanor, where Zhodani forces were gradually building up their strength. Ironically perhaps, the fall of Rhylanor was prevented by the transfer of fleet elements falling back from the front towards Regina. Had these concentrated for the defence of Regina instead they would have wasted less time in transit and obviated the need to mount costly relief efforts. These could have been directed at Rhylanor – an altogether more logical and less costly strategy.

It is easy to criticise in hindsight, of course, but overall the commanders of the Imperial Navy in the Spinward Marches made a poor showing in the war. With Lanth under siege, Jewell cut off and a confused scramble going on from Regina to Rhylanor, the likely outcome was an Imperial collapse. Desperate times called for desperate measures, so the flow of reinforcements to the battle front was halted entirely. The Deneb Fleet had already sent all it could, along with the Corridor Fleet. These had been fed into the Regina-Rhylanor meatgrinder with little effect, other than prolonging the conflict. Additional forces coming from deeper in Imperial space were short-stopped in Deneb.

Some have pointed to this measure as an indicator of imperial desperation, suggesting the Imperial Navy was building a new fleet to oppose further advances after the fall of the Spinward Marches. In reality, the move was a strategic necessity. Defeat, if defeat was occurring, should not be reinforced. If the forces in the Spinward Marches could hold on long enough they would be relieved by a force powerful enough to make a strategically significant advance. If they could not, the reserves would move to Mora and Trin for a new defence or counterattack a scattered and weary Zhodani fleet.

In the end, sufficient forces were assembled for a counterattack which came through the Sabine subsector. The Zhodani naval base at Porozlo was overwhelmed in 981, placing the fleet around Rhylanor at the end of a suddenly lengthened supply chain that ran through the Regina theatre of war. Retreat was necessary, so the Zhodani fleet pulled back in good order. Although hard pressed it was able to fight a rearguard action which prevented a collapse and even attempted a last-ditch breakthrough in the Regina system. Once this had failed, the Zhodani fleet switched to a strategy of making the advance as costly for the Imperials as possible.

For the next five years the Zhodani were gradually driven back, although some systems changed hands several times. Negotiations finally brought about an end to the conflict with little really changed. Some systems were ceded to Zhodani control whilst others became part of a demilitarised zone along the borders. The outcome was a stalemate, with the poor performance of the Imperial fleet blamed largely on political direction from the high nobility and the Emperor himself. In 989, three years after the armistice, Emperor Styryx defused what might have been a bitterly divisive situation by abdicating in favour of his son Gavin.

It has been speculated that Emperor Gavin intended to renew hostilities with the Zhodani early in his reign but instead attempted to reintegrate the Solomani Autonomous Region into the Imperium. This led to the bloody Solomani Rim War, which drained imperial resources for long enough that the situation on the spinward frontier settled into business-as-usual.

#### THE FOURTH FRONTIER WAR

Despite the near defeat of the Third Frontier War, the Imperial Navy retained its 'crust' strategy over the next century, placing battle squadrons along the borders with a reserve deeper in the sector. Tensions were not relieved by having heavy elements of the fleet positioned where they could be attacked with no warning and incidents were not uncommon. One such, at Quar, precipitated a full-scale, if short, conflict.

Quar had been an Imperial naval base until the end of the Third Frontier War and in 1082 the navy decided to recommission the base to support forward- deployed warships. The Zhodani Consulate objected, the Imperials pressed ahead and shows of force were made to back up both sides' diplomatic positions. This had all happened before and escalation was not intended but the situation went out of control and a skirmish resulted. As the stakes grew higher neither side could be seen to back down so cruisers, then battleships, were drawn into a period of posturing and minor live-fire incidents. With little warning, the minor incidents became a major conflict.

Fighting was raging along the frontier before local commanders received word of the inciting incident. By the time the Emperor found out the conflict was at its height and his instructions did not reach the fleets until after an armistice had been signed. The conflict was characterised by opportunistic Vargr raiding along the coreward border and a hasty attempt by the Zhodani bypass the Imperial defences around Jewell by pushing through Yres and Menorb. This advance was halted at the so-called Battle of Two Suns, which was in fact a sprawling conflict in both systems which spilled out into Boughene, Pixie and Louzy.

Neither side had wanted war and neither was prepared for one. Losses prompted some territorial reorganisation; the Imperium ceded Narval but regained Margesi and Saurus, which had been ceded to the Sword Worlds Confederation after the Third Frontier War. By the end of 1084 peace had been restored. The Fourth Frontier War is often referred to as the False War but it had some significant outcomes. One was the establishment of Emperor Strephon as an effective leader – despite him playing virtually no role in the conflict. Another was a rethinking of Imperial strategy.

Although the 'crust' doctrine had actually worked in this case, strategic studies prompted by the conflict led to the conclusion that it needed to be replaced with a more flexible plan; one less vulnerable to defeat in detail. Over the next decade the fleet moved to a doctrine of
'elastic defence', with light elements placed forward and heavy units concentrated for a counterblow. To offset the weakening of the front-line defences,
'fortress worlds' were strengthened, to act as islands of resistance against an enemy assault and bases for a counterattack. Rather than create an oversized sector fleet, the Imperial Navy decided to create a strategic reserve well back in the Corridor sector. Local forces and the Spinward Marches Fleet would delay hostile advances and disrupt sieges of key worlds until these fleet reserves were ready to intervene.

Another change was the move back towards battleships. For some time, the Imperial Navy had been favouring squadrons of battle riders and their associated tenders over self-mobile capital ships. The shift to a more active and mobile defence necessitated a force of battleships and dreadnoughts capable of carrying it out. Large numbers of battle riders left the fleet early, mostly transferred to the defensive forces of the fortress worlds. Those retained were generally considered mobile defensive assets rather than striking forces.

The nature of any conflict is shaped by certain strategic realities. Engagements between squadrons of battleships may catch the attention of the public when they appear on the newsvids but this is only one part of a large and complex process leading ultimately to victory or defeat. This process arguably begins when a state makes decisions about what forces it will deploy. The available materiel, along with doctrine and training, will dictate what the force can do at all and what it can do well. A state that tailors its forces to the needs of a conflict, or which fights to its strengths, will win more victories and suffer fewer losses than one that must cobble together a solution to an awkward strategic situation.

There are many factors affecting a state's ability to procure the right forces; the available technology and the facilities to construct and maintain suitable forces; the most prominent factor is usually referred to as budget, although it is more complex than just finances; materials must also be considered, since no amount of money can buy what is not available. A state has a finite amount of money and resources, and this must be distributed between many needs.

More money for the army and navy requires either a reduced budget in other areas or an expansion of the state's economy. In desperate times a population is likely to accept curtailment of arts projects and urban regeneration in favour of more warships but in a large state most people are unaffected by a distant conflict – or think they are. Cutting social budgets to buy a new battle squadron might be a good deal for the navy today but unhappy people are less productive on the whole. This can lead to unrest or dissent which could weaken the economy and ultimately reduce the future budget. Highly militarised states have less of a problem here but do risk severe unrest or even revolt if the matter is pushed too far.

Budgets are finite and must be spent wisely. How much should be spent on bases and infrastructure, and how much on fighting units? Ships can deteriorate into near- uselessness as they wait their turn for what should have been routine maintenance. How much should go to warships and how much to support vessels? A horde of battleships is little use if it is in the wrong place and has no tankers or supply vessels to help it get into action. What type of ships are needed? Security must be balanced against the ability to project power.

Every state must answer these questions as best it can. Decisions also need to be made about retention of older ships and equipment. It may be more cost-effective to refit and upgrade older ships than to build new ones but at some point they will wear out or be technologically outclassed. Policies on when a ship should go into reserve or be disposed of entirely influence the naval budget to a huge degree. Long before a conflict breaks out these decisions will dictate what forces are available and how well they can be supported.

#### THE NATURE OF INTERSTELLAR WAR

Wars of annihilation are rare and wars of eradication rarer still. Annihilation in this case refers to the destruction of a state; eradication refers to the extermination of its people. More commonly wars are fought to bring the enemy to the negotiating table at a disadvantage. Even where annihilation is the ultimate goal it is more practicable to fight a limited conflict and weaken the enemy by demanding concessions with the intent to resume hostilities later. Those who try to do too much risk becoming over-stretched and disorganised. Wars have been lost this way, by states too greedy or too enraged to know when to stop.

To be meaningful, victory in space or ground battles must produce a useful result. This can be strategic, for example clearing an area of enemy forces, denying them an important base, or gaining a good staging point for a further advance. It can be political, in the sense of persuading an enemy's allies to stop supporting them or triggering a revolt against the losing power. It can be economic, for example choking off the supply of raw materials to an important industrial centre. Destruction of the enemy's forces is a step towards future gains and eventual victory but forces that seek victories for their own sake risk defeat by those who understand how to accrue advantages throughout a conflict.

## STRATEGIC REALITIES

Even when a war is 'won', gains can be thrown away at the negotiating table. It is here, when the final outcome of the conflict is agreed by both sides, that the true situation emerges. A state that has lost heavily in terms of territory or forces may have to make big concessions, although it is possible to bluff or to conceal the level of damage that has been taken. Negotiators may also obscure their real desires, attempting to convince the opposition they want something badly in the hope they can get their real objectives whilst giving away little in return. A critical part of strategic planning is figuring out how important various goals and locations are to the opponent and what long-term advantage can be obtained from an apparently minor gain.

COMMUNICATIONS AND LOGISTICS The harshest reality of interstellar warfare is the communications lag caused by the need for multiple jumps. This was a major failing of the 'crust' strategy, in that a concentrated strike at one point could smash the local forces and be heading deep into the interior before units deployed in neighbouring subsectors knew anything had happened. Requests for reinforcements take weeks to produce a result, during which time the situation could have changed completely.

One problem a commander has is finding their forces once they have left their base. At the start of a conflict or when a force is first deployed its status is known along with its location, so the first set of orders should find a force of known composition without the couriers having to search multiple systems – which imposes long delays for every additional jump. Once forces have moved or dispersed to carry out missions even locating them can be a problem. Elements that are found may not be suitable for the necessary mission and in any case the courier cannot order captains to act – their commander must be located and given instructions to preserve the chain of command.

The solution to this problem is to ensure commanders at all levels know what to do as command devolves. Ideally the command element of a fleet or force will remain at a particular location or operate close to it, with rendezvous points for units that have become detached or completed their missions. Couriers stationed at the rendezvous point are kept updated with the force's location and status. This can work well but eventualities may disrupt the process; if a force is driven away from its communications nexus it becomes uncontrollable to its higher commander, who may not even know if the force has survived. The local leader must decide if it is better to carry on as best they can or retire and seek to re-establish the chain of command.

This pattern is repeated throughout the conflict. Forces begin under good control and with a clear picture of the strategic situation, gradually becoming dispersed as control is loosened or lost. This can happen in waves, with reinforcements arriving at the beginning of their loss-of-control cycle as forces already engaged are struggling against a lack of information and coherent orders. In some cases the local commander will take control of these forces or be co-opted into them; on other occasions the dispersed force is pulled back to reorganise.

There have been instances of a unit thought to be lost turning up at the end of the war having conducted an impromptu raiding cruise or fought a lone action to protect an otherwise undefended world. However,
'orphaned' captains are generally expected to find a force and attach their ship to it, or to retire to a known rendezvous and report in. The overall pattern is akin to entropy; highly effective, concentrated forces gradually disperse into large and small groups whose ability to affect the strategic outcome is reduced over time.

This problem is offset by good training and ensuring that ship captains know – in general terms at least - what the plan is. Contingency orders are also useful, such as 'if communications are lost, proceed to Regina and place your vessel under the command of the defending admiral until new orders arrive', or 'in the event communications are disrupted, retire immediately to Utoland and await further orders'. Contingency commanders may be put in place at strategic rendezvous points, whose unglamorous task is to direct stragglers back for repair or to fighting forces where they can be effective.

The fight for communications is critical to the effective prosecution of a war. Naturally, both sides will try to disrupt communications by raiding the region couriers must pass through or predicting rendezvous and communication points. A single destroyer, disabling a courier and chasing others off their communications nexus, can neutralise a fleet for a short time by preventing it from receiving orders. Even a delay of a couple of days could swing a battle elsewhere.

The same comments apply to logistics. Fleets start out well provisioned and loaded with munitions but fuel in particular is used up quickly. Tankers and logistics vessels are vulnerable to attack as they skim fuel or return to base for reloading. A fleet can of course skim at a gas giant but this is a lengthy process for a large force and relies on a suitable giant being available. As a result the tempo of operations starts out high but drops over time, especially if a successful raid breaks the logistics chain or inflicts heavy losses on the vessels required. On the other hand, assigning too many ships to protect the logistics and communication chain weakens the fighting forces, as does chasing commerce raiders. These threats cannot be left uncountered but ultimately the fleet must retain sufficient potency to be able to defeat its opponents in battle.

PROSECUTION OF A WAR
A successful strategy balances the different kinds of operation to overcome the enemy at a decisive point. Unless the opposition obligingly places its fleet where it can be attacked in overwhelming force, it will not be possible to win through a single decisive battle. Indeed, it is possible to fight a major war without the main fleets engaging at all. So long as they remain a threat, the big fleets limit the enemy's options. In some cases this results in the fleets standing ready to act but never doing so whilst lighter forces seek to alter the strategic balance by raiding and disputing minor systems.

More commonly, a war will be fought on several levels. Major fleets try to take significant objectives, either to disrupt the enemy or as political bargaining chips, whilst other forces seek to impede the enemy by raiding and minor actions. In some cases a major world will be attacked because it has to be defended, drawing enemy reinforcements along a predictable route and pinning down major fleet elements. Often attacks on major worlds become sieges, with the attackers establishing a logistics marshalling point at a gas giant or some other body in the system. Whilst clear and quick victory is usually desirable, it can sometimes be more strategically effective to threaten a target for a protracted period or try to wear down the enemy defending it. This is particularly true when the strategic world is at the end of a long supply chain that can be harassed.

Controlling a system can sometimes lead to the surrender of a world but often the battle proceeds to orbital space and the surface. In theory, once orbit is controlled the attackers have all the cards. Cities and military centres could be wiped out by orbital bombardment and this is sometimes the case. However, most conflicts are at least slightly limited. If nothing else, there is the likelihood that the enemy will reply in kind. A raiding force might not be able to take and hold a world in the enemy's rear but they can drop rocks from orbit or deliver nuclear warheads before retiring. A smashed world might inspire others to surrender through fear but it is not likely to be of any economic value for a long time to come. Orbital bombardment is therefore as precise as possible and directed only at military targets.

This means that the defenders have to be overcome in ground combat. Depending on circumstances, this could mean large-scale pitched battles between conventional forces or nasty street fighting against irregulars and the remnants of the planetary armed forces. Even after the world has officially surrendered the occupiers will need to deal with insurgents and guerrillas. All this is a drain on the attacker's will to fight and the available resources. A quagmire on a world at the end of a long supply line is an opportunity for raiders to weaken the enemy. Enough such small drains on resources can become significant.

The pattern for reduction of a major world is predictable. First the fleet has to reach the target and keep open its supply line. If a quick victory is not won a siege must be implemented, necessitating a logistics area to be established and defended. Once the system defence force is ground down, there may still be raids from concealed bases in the system. Next, control must be established over orbital space and if surrender does not occur a ground campaign is necessary. This will usually begin with assaults on key areas whilst command and control centres, bases and the like will be eliminated.

Once the attackers have a foothold – ideally at a starport or spaceport – they can begin bringing in additional troops and supplies. Offensives will not necessarily be determined by terrain or proximity, given the availability of grav vehicles and spacecraft for transport but centres of resistance will need to be suppressed. If full control of the world is required it will have to be pacified which can be a long procedure, yet is often enough to control major cities and push insurgents back from them. They may lose heart over time or the world might be handed back in return for concessions elsewhere. If the attackers intend to keep the world they will work harder to pacify it.

In addition to major worlds, key targets include bases and choke-point systems. Military ships can jump long distances but commerce plods along the mains. Capturing or merely interdicting a couple of key systems can severely disrupt the local economy and grants a level of importance to otherwise very minor systems. If capture is not possible, fear of raids will also be disruptive. Invaders might choose to capture a system to use it as a raiding base rather than for any intrinsic value or just to ensure it is sanitised of hostile forces.

Some objectives are worth expending large resources to capture or at least threaten but is it not possible to be strong everywhere. Systems may be controlled or denied on a temporary basis, with no attempt to take permanent ownership. Controlled systems contain sufficient naval assets to prevent the enemy from making use of them, whilst denied systems are more lightly held or even just threatened with raids. A major fleet might be able to move through a denied system but couriers, tankers and damaged warships will be in danger.

If denial is not possible, the best a commander can hope for is to dispute a system. This usually means having some presence there but in some cases a system can be disputed merely by the threat of a raid from somewhere nearby. This means the enemy must tie down ships to guard or clear the system or risk losses as vessels pass through. Widespread system denial can be highly disruptive or a large drain on resources and can result in the occasional windfall like a critical courier or heavily damaged warship. Denial can also have political consequences, as populations demand to know what is being done about hostiles attacking ships near their homes.

The Fifth Frontier War takes place over a wide area, beginning in 1107 and, according to previously published sources, ending in 1110. It also takes place on many levels; military, naval, economic and political. Events in one theatre of war have varying effects on other theatres. For example, a serious naval defeat near Lanth might result in reinforcements intended for deployment elsewhere being diverted, weakening a planned offensive near Regina or forcing its postponement. Likewise, a military event such as a spectacular victory in ground combat can have effects in the political and economic arenas.

Such a large and complex subject is difficult to comprehend all at once. It is simpler to look at the situation in a given theatre of war almost in isolation but it must never be forgotten that everything is interconnected. A naval battle off Efate might be lost due to the actions of a covert operations team at Mora. Sometimes the connections are difficult to see and sometimes the results are not what was intended by the initiator. Ultimately, victory will go to the side that brings the most effective force to bear at the right places. That force could be naval, military, political, economic or something entirely different.

The strategic initiative lies with the Zhodani Consulate and its allies in this conflict. The Imperials are not expecting a war any time soon and could be described as being rather complacent. That said, the possibility has always existed and the Imperials have planned for many eventualities. There are contingency plans for an offensive against the Consulate but the assumption has always been that the Zhodani will strike first – the best the Consulate can achieve is tactical surprise. The Imperials have planned on the assumption that they will be attacked at some point and can predict likely targets but what they cannot know is when or indeed if it will happen.

Details cannot be predicted with any accuracy. There may be a period of extended buildup or a sudden onslaught. The main attack might be directed at Lanth or Regina, or somewhere else entirely. What the Imperial Navy can do and has done is to prepare contingency plans for every possible eventuality and put in place sufficient intelligence assets to be able to spot warning signs early. However, intelligence work is not a precise science. With war scares shaking everyone up periodically, the intelligence community runs the risk of triggering a war that would otherwise not have happened, or failing to react to a real threat.

The Imperium is far more internally divided than the Zhodani Consulate. Nobles, megacorporations and ethnic or cultural groups all have their own agendas. Some are willing to put aside their internal goals whilst there is an external threat but others see only opportunity. A far-off war is unlikely to have direct consequences for them but in the meantime they may be able to achieve recognition advancement, or profit. This is one of the ways empires fall; external problems are internalised for gain.

As a result, things are not clear or simple for the Imperials. 'Just send more dreadnoughts!' is an obvious solution and one that has indeed occurred to planners and officials of the Imperium. If it were practicable they would do it but there are many other factors to be balanced. For example, there were those who advocated placing the equivalent of five or six sector fleets in the Spinward Marches to deter the Zhodani – and those who took it further by demanding a pre-emptive strike. Such a huge deployment would weaken the Imperium elsewhere and might be seen as inflammatory. It could trigger the very war it was intended to deter, or lead to an expensive arms race that could cripple the Imperial economy.

The present situation is that the Imperials are aware of the possibility of attack but do not expect one in the foreseeable future. It may be that the war scares of recent decades were part of a long-term Zhodani plan to desensitise the Imperials to their movements. Deployments that would have triggered an alert in 1050 were considered commonplace in 1082 – and when the Fourth Frontier War broke out everyone asked how the Zhodani strike was such a surprise! A period of nervousness followed the Fourth Frontier War but is now dying down and there are those who wonder if the conflict was not a deliberate 'really serious false alarm' intended to create long-term complacency in the Imperials. Such is the paranoid world of the intelligence analyst.

## OVERVIEW OF THE CONFLICT

Future historians will be able to trace a pattern of increased and decreased tension, some of it deliberate, leading up to a series of deception operations on the eve of the war. Warning signs were seen by Imperial Naval Intelligence but they were no stronger than before and were not heeded beyond a slight increase in alertness. When the Zhodani attack came it was a surprise but not a complete surprise. Nevertheless, the Imperium found itself very much on the defensive and forced to react to Zhodani movements. The early part of the war was fought very much on the terms of the Zhodani Consulate... but that did not mean everything went their way.

The heaviest fighting took place in what became known as the Riverland Theatre, named for a world in the region used as a jumping-off point for some of the involved forces. The fortress worlds of Efate, Jewell and Regina were obvious targets and came under siege for most of the conflict. Victory here would open the way for an advance on the naval depot at Macene, then Rhylanor, and perhaps even Mora. The situation was characterised by major fleet battles, planetary sieges and heavy raiding throughout Regina and into Rhylanor and the coreward end of Lanth.

The rimward end of Lanth and Vilis also saw heavy fighting, although with more emphasis on ground combat than space battles. Zhodani and Sword Worlds forces established themselves on several worlds and took control of some. Lanth itself was the scene of fierce ground fighting, even in the streets of the planetary capital. With the battle fleets mostly engaged in the Riverland Theatre control of systems around Lanth was more tenuous, with the advantage shifting several times.

Sword Worlds forces formed the backbone of the drive into Lanth but also conducted raids into Lunion and Glisten, and attempted to take territory in District 268 – all whilst fighting the Darrian Confederation. The technological limitations of the Sword Worlds fleet were offset by the fact that major Imperial units were mostly drawn into the Riverland campaign.

Various minor theatres of war saw action as well. A Zhodani force deployed to the Trojan Reach applied pressure against Imperial holdings there, whilst Aslan ihatei bands attempted to take advantage of the situation to claim territory. Vargr raiding into Aramis influenced the Riverland Theatre to some extent, with raids all along the coreward end of Deneb and Corridor interfering with the flow of reinforcements. Insurrections and covert operations on various worlds bought the conflict deep into both the Consulate and the Imperium.

The conflict can be divided into phases, although these relate mainly to the main theatres of war. Some areas saw virtually no combat except for a couple of sudden outbreaks whilst others were characterised by near- constant skirmishing. The precursor phase is hard to pin down exactly; some historians trace it back to before the Fourth Frontier War. During this period both sides tried to consolidate their position and gather intelligence but the Zhodani Consulate was far more active. Supply caches were concealed in Imperial or neutral space, to facilitate a rapid advance, and 'sleeper' agents placed on many worlds. The precursor phase ended in 1107 with a period of preparations for imminent hostilities.

The war officially began on 187-1107, with the delivery of a declaration of war by the Zhodani ambassador at Regina, preceded by violations of the demilitarised zone in the Jewell and Vilis subsectors. The most serious was the assembly of an assault fleet at Ruie and the deployment of a force to Arden. An immediate assault on Regina was narrowly defeated, bringing about a fierce battle to close off or keep open the Jewell Salient. Fighting rapidly spread, with Jewell and Efate coming under siege. For the rest of 1107 and into early 1108 the Imperials struggled to avoid defeat in the critical theatre whilst attempting to counter thrusts elsewhere.

By early 1108, the conflict had achieved a form of stability, with small gains and losses on each side. On the face of it the Imperium was holding its own but the reality was quite different. Ships that should be withdrawn for repairs could not be released, fighting on until disabled or destroyed. Reinforcements arrived but were deployed according to cross-cutting political agendas rather than the strategic needs of the situation.

In late 1108-09 the Imperial region 'Behind the Claw' was in political turmoil over the conduct of the war, with internal divisions dissipating naval strength even further. The situation changed decisively with the elevation by Imperial Warrant to Sector Duke of Norris, Duke of Regina. His new leadership faced serious challenges and what amounted to a mutiny by some elements of the Imperial Navy – although there were many who considered this necessary resistance to a coup.

Reorganised and reinforced, the Imperial Navy launched a counteroffensive in 1109 which went on into 1110. This did not go exactly as planned, encountering setbacks and heavy losses despite making some gains. A final Zhodani counterthrust towards the depot at Macene and other strategic targets brought the fighting to a crescendo in early 1110, with the outcome in doubt almost to the moment an armistice was declared.

The Fifth Frontier War pitted two of the great powers of Charted Space against one another. Both had internal factions whose goals differed from one another. The Consulate seemed more unified to an outside observer but there were forces at work within it which affected the conduct of the war. The smaller powers, likewise, had in some cases complex agendas. At times the belligerents were able to make use of these divisions by influence or covert operations, attempting to neutralise great fleets with a single pistol shot or datanet diatribe, leading to riots and political pressure.

The Imperium is very powerful, with member worlds in 30 sectors. Presence in some is small but most are wholly the territory of the Imperium. This vast economic and industrial base is capable of building vessels at TL15, outclassing its enemies at least in terms of front-line warships. However, the Imperium is operating at the end of a very long chain of command stretching back to Capital.

The Spinward Marches is around 44 weeks from Capital by courier, with messages and military reinforcements having to proceed around the coreward end of the Great Rift through Deneb, Corridor and Vland. This relatively narrow route was potentially threatened by raiders from the Vargr Extents, creating additional problems for command and control.

In most regions the Imperium is guided by Archdukes who answer directly to the Emperor and can respond to a crisis much more quickly. The Domain of Deneb has been established, formed of the Imperial holdings in the Spinward Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach and the coreward-spinward part of Reft but no Archduke has been appointed. Indeed, the Spinward Marches has no sector duke. The reasons for this are complex, relating mostly to factionalism and the unwillingness of some nobles to accept the elevation of another. Decades of negotiations have produced only greater demands for concessions among those who feel they, or their faction, would lose out upon the appointment of one candidate or another. Deneb is similarly factionalised.

Despite being a critical frontier region which has seen numerous wars, the Imperial Domain of Deneb lacks clear political guidance. It may be that the Emperor is more worried about an insurrection against the throne than invasion from the Zhodani Consulate, which is a reasonable fear given that it has happened in the past. However, this focus on internal troubles has left the region unprepared to deal with an external threat. Even after fighting has broken out, many of the senior nobles will be more concerned with how they can gain an internal advantage than in defending the Imperium.

THE IMPERIAL NAVY The defence of the Imperium and destruction of its enemies rests upon the Imperial Navy, organised into fleets which are commanded by naval officers rather than nobles. An admiral might also be a noble but they command as part of a chain stretching down from the commander-in-chief – the Emperor – rather than by right of holdings and titles. The nobility provide political direction but cannot legally order the navy's ships and crews around. However, great nobles wield a lot of influence and may be able to manoeuvre, browbeat or otherwise induce an admiral to do what they want.

The most senior officers in the Imperial Navy hold the rank of Grand Admiral. Normally they are assigned at Domain level and serve primarily as strategic planners, although one might be given command of a major theatre of war. There is no Grand Admiral assigned to the Domain of Deneb but there are two in the Domain of Vland. One commands the fleets of the Domain whilst the other is assigned to the strategic reserve force held in Corridor. In the event of major hostilities this officer may be ordered to lead a reinforcement operation into the Spinward Marches, although they are more likely to establish a forward headquarters to direct the conflict than take personal command of battle squadrons.

The warfighting forces of the Imperium are concentrated in the sector fleets, each commanded by a sector admiral responsible for overall conduct of a conflict in the local sector and sometimes beyond if astrography dictates. The Spinward Marches sector admiral is also responsible for the relatively minor forces in the Trojan

# BELLIGERENT POWERS: THE THIRD IMPERIUM

Reach. Likewise, the sector admiral for Deneb sends forces to Reft if needed. In time of war, the Spinward Marches sector admiral has primary responsibility for the defence of the sector and conduct of any operations beyond it. The sector admirals in Deneb and Corridor are responsible for dealing with raids into their territory but can be expected to send a large segment of their force as reinforcements, in turn receiving additional forces from deeper within the Imperium.

Below the sector admiral are the fleet admirals, who will hold one of three ranks: admiral, vice-admiral or rear-admiral. Each subsector has a numbered fleet assigned to it, commanded by an officer whose title is subsector admiral but whose rank can vary. Most are full admirals but this depends on the availability of personnel. Subsector fleets are mainly security formations in peacetime but in war may receive reinforcements from the sector fleet, other sectors or reserve forces. In particularly critical subsectors, the numbered fleet may be turned into a heavy defensive force tasked with operations only in its home subsector, although less threatened areas may have to manage with what they have.

Lower-ranking admirals command elements of the sector fleet or any new fleets, which may be formed from reinforcements or reserve forces. Fleet admirals holding vice-admiral or rear-admiral rank typically command the heavy squadrons or major sub-units of the sector fleet and may sometimes be assigned to lead an important task force. A full admiral commanding a fleet will have a vice-admiral as second in command and usually one or more rear-admirals who can take over detachments as necessary.

The standard model for a subsector fleet is a single warship in the light cruiser or light carrier class, plus a mix of destroyers and patrol vessels for security work. As noted, sometimes this is greatly expanded with heavy units but a subsector fleet remains responsible mainly for security work. In a wartime context this usually means countering raiders and gathering up- to-date intelligence on enemy movements in the area. The subsector admiral will normally remain in charge as they should have years of experience planning for the unique circumstances of their home subsector.

The warfighting strength of a sector fleet is nominally one squadron of four capital ships (battleships or dreadnoughts) and one squadron of four heavy or light cruisers per subsector, plus some additional vessels such as carriers and specialist cruisers. These are supported by destroyers and escorts, tankers and supply ships, auxiliaries and couriers. However, the sector fleet is not deployed by subsector – that would invite defeat in detail. Heavy units are concentrated at primary bases for the most part, with some elements detached for various reasons.

SPINWARD MARCHES SECTOR FLEET
The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet is overstrength, as befits a force located on the frontier. However, despite urgings from various quarters, it has never been given huge numbers of capital ships. This was seen as potentially provocative and was opposed for other internal-political reasons. The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet was assigned extra squadrons under various pretexts, notably to ensure it had sufficient strength to protect Imperial holdings in the Trojan Reach and Reft. The latter is nonsense, as there is no significant threat, but it serves as a polite fiction that allows an extra squadron or two to be assigned. The Trojan Reach does face a possible threat from Aslan forces and the need to project power across the sector justifies a deployment.

The fleet has also been strengthened in relatively subtle ways. Since the Fourth Frontier War, the Imperial Navy has phased out many of its battle rider squadrons. The usual route for these is to be assigned to guard bases or be sold to well-off worlds that feel they need capital ship-grade protection. However, a proportion of all riders leaving sector fleets across the Imperium have been quietly reassigned to potentially threatened systems on the Solomani and Zhodani borders.

This project has been going on for decades, with a specialist facility at Macene refitting old riders before they are returned to service. Some are sent to battle rider squadrons, which will serve as mobile defensive reinforcements to be deployed as an enemy axis of attack becomes apparent. Most, however, have been assigned to guard the naval bases and fortress worlds of Jewell, Regina and Lanth. These assets are theoretically mobile but there are far more riders than tenders to support them. They are assigned to the subsector fleet, keeping them off the sector fleet's table of organisation and equipment, and creating the impression that the sector fleet is only a little stronger than the norm.

The defence of the sector is further augmented by subsidies to major worlds on the frontier, assisting them in creating a powerful system defence flotilla and making contributions to the Colonial Fleet. This is almost entirely made up of small vessels in most subsectors but along the frontiers some worlds choose to operate larger vessels. However, since Colonial Fleet assets can be sent off to fight far away, most worlds prefer to obtain non-jump-capable vessels which cannot be removed from their home system.

The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet also has a larger than average reserve contingent, held at major bases and in varying states of readiness. A few need only crews but most would require weeks or months of work to return them to fighting condition. This effort would begin as soon as war was declared and be accompanied by the call-up of reservists to crew the vessels. The fleet receives ships from 'safer' sectors from time-to-time, creating a large reserve of older but still serviceable vessels.

Even with these measures in place, the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet cannot hope to win a war against the Zhodani Consulate without major reinforcement. This would initially come from the Deneb fleet if that sector was not in severe danger, with contingents from more distant sectors arriving in due course. The Corridor Sector Fleet is the primary source of reinforcements, however, due to its status as the regional strategic reserve. In addition to a full-strength sector fleet assigned as normal to bases in the sector, the Corridor Depot is also home to a double-strength reserve fleet commanded by a grand admiral.

The Corridor Strategic Reserve Fleet is positioned to assist against an attack into the Spinward Marches or to move trailingward in the event of hostilities with the Julian Protectorate. Its arrival, along with elements of the Corridor fleet proper and the Deneb fleet, would bring the warship strength deployed in the Spinward Marches to the equivalent of three and a half standard sector fleets plus Colonial, reserve and local forces. This force is still likely to be outnumbered but has a technological advantage in addition to being able to operate on interior lines of communication. Additional forces would be over a year arriving.

The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet currently lacks a commanding officer. The fleets, and the strategic reserve, have officers of appropriate rank in place but there is no sector admiral at present. This is the result of a reshuffle several years ago which encountered various setbacks. An unexpected retirement, a reassignment coming 30 weeks into the journey to take up command, failure of the sector's nobles to agree on a suitable candidate and other inconveniences have prevented the appointment. The planning and administrative staff are in place, with the commander of the Macene naval base making routine decisions. In peacetime, the lack of an overall commander would not matter very much and the Imperium is most certainly not expecting a war.

The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet is tasked with resisting an initial assault and making counterattacks where possible. Raids into the rear are expected, and must be countered by mobile forces, but as soon as practicable the Marches fleet is expected to begin impeding the enemy advance by attacking supply lines or conducting deep raids of its own.

The deployment and assignment of some formations is unusual, either for historical reasons or due to the complex internal politics of the region. For example, some of the subsector fleets have assets that would normally be assigned to a sector fleet. Elsewhere, these ships might be loaned to a subsector commander but retained with the sector fleet in case of a need elsewhere, but here they are assigned permanently. Those asking about the reasons for this deployment are ignored, given a vague answer, or ordered not to ask again depending on their service and level of importance.

The Imperial Navy favours squadrons of four ships for cruisers and capital ships, usually with destroyers and escorts assigned. In large forces, tankers and support ships are assigned to separate squadrons with an escort and kept back from the battle area. Task forces may be built from a single major ship plus escorts and supports, which means detaching assets from a four-ship squadron or breaking it up entirely. Thus not all squadrons or larger formations will be at their 'paper' strength, even in peacetime. In wartime, depleted squadrons may have to be combined or filled out with vessels of a different class in order to remain combat-worthy.

#### SPINWARD MARCHES

#### STRATEGIC RESERVE: MACENE

The naval base at Macene is critical to the defence of the sector. The system is protected by a large force of monitors and battle riders serving as in-system defensive assets and a large pool of transports and logistics vessels are based here along with couriers and auxiliaries. There are also multiple battle tenders assigned to the base rather than the fleet. In peacetime, these are mainly engaged in bringing riders and monitors to Macene for refit or moving them to a new defensive deployment. These forces are in addition to those assigned to the Spinward Marches Flag Fleet.

As the strategic reserve and main warfighting force of the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet and its forward headquarters once underway, the force held at Macene is known as the Spinward Marches Flag Fleet. Elements are routinely detached as squadrons or task forces for various reasons but the fleet as a whole remains concentrated at all times. Millenia of conflict have taught that dispersal brings about defeat. Once the shape of a conflict is beginning to appear, the fleet will move as a unit or in detachments to bring about the defeat of the enemy.

The Flag Fleet can, on paper at least, field a capital ship strength of three dreadnought squadrons, three first-class battleship squadrons, one second-class battleship squadron and one battle rider squadron, plus task forces built around four fleet carriers. At any given time, some of these ships may be detached. Typically, the second-class battleships will be used as the centrepiece of task forces with the top-end fighting units staying with the fleet. One dreadnought, usually a Tigress class vessel, is always on detachment to the flotilla at Andor, with another preparing to replace it. In addition, at least two other dreadnoughts are usually on detachment to politically rather than strategically important systems.

Cruiser strength is nominally four heavy and five light cruiser squadrons, plus some individual vessels assigned to carrier task forces, plus specialist squadrons of bombardment and missile cruisers. Most of these vessels are available for fleet operations but a significant proportion will be conducting patrols or flag-showing missions at any given time. In the event of war, the cruisers would secure the battle fleet's route of advance and chase down raiders, with some going over to a raiding posture as quickly as possible.

# IMPERIAL NAVAL ORDER OF BATTLE

The battle squadrons are supported by light carrier task forces and several destroyer flotillas, mostly powerful fleet destroyers intended to operate as squadrons of four. Additional escort destroyers and fleet escorts are mostly assigned to squadrons of capital ships or task forces including support formations. The many small escort vessels and couriers are grouped into administrative flotillas but operate singly, or are attached to other formations.

#### JEWELL-REGINA THEATRE

The Jewell-Regina theatre is the 'position of honour' in any conflict with the Zhodani Consulate. At one time this region was packed with capital ships but a move to a more elastic defence has resulted in greater dependence on fortress worlds breaking an enemy assault and counterattacks in force then defeating the enemy's major units. The worlds around Jewell are fortresses, along with Efate, Pixie and Regina. Although located in the Lanth subsector, Extolay is considered part of the Jewell-Regina theatre and is also heavily fortified.

Sector fleet elements are generally light, consisting mainly of cruiser and destroyer groups whose task is to harass and report on an enemy advance. Battle rider squadrons deployed at Jewell are intended as mobile defensive reserves, along with heavier fleet units. In the event an invasion can be countered at the border, the battle tenders will deploy their forces then return to Jewell or another fortress system to pick up more riders to replace casualties and can also be used to deploy heavy units to hold captured or liberated systems. This policy frees the more mobile and flexible jump-capable warships for offensive or counter-offensive operations.

The subsector fleets of Jewell and Regina are unusual in that they are more geared towards warfighting than most others. Their combat strength comes mainly from Colonial Fleet vessels operated by the major worlds of the subsector. These tend to be older ships than those in use by the navy but their crews are experienced and determined. Subsector fleet assets normally operate close to home and are unlikely to be reassigned to offensive operations elsewhere if more potent units are available.

#### RHYLANOR-ARAMIS THEATRE

The Rhylanor-Aramis theatre contains the Flag Fleet and fortress systems at Macene, Rhylanor, Risek and Jae Tellona. The Rhylanor subsector fleet is highly unusual in that it includes a squadron of Tigress dreadnoughts as well as older but still potent warships. This makes it the most powerful subsector fleet 'Behind the Claw' and prompts periodic questions about why such potent ships would be tied to a subsector command rather than being assigned to the sector fleet. The security element of the Rhylanor subsector fleet is about average for the Imperium as a whole, whilst the Aramis subsector fleet has a few additional destroyers and escorts to deter raiders from the Vargr Extents.

In addition to the powerful forces held at Macene, a small contingent is based at Aramis for operations to Coreward. Other naval bases are mostly specialist or support facilities, though capable of staging major forces if necessary.

#### LANTH-VILIS THEATRE

Vessels assigned to the Lanth-Vilis theatre are normally referred to as belonging to the Lanth Theatre Fleet or, less formally, the Lanth Fleet. They are tasked with warfighting operations in the Lanth and Vilis subsectors, along with suppression of raids into Lunion if local forces cannot handle the situation. Capital ship strength is much lower than the Macene force as this region is primarily threatened by less advanced Sword Worlds ships. Additional battle squadrons are sometimes moved to Lanth or D'Ganzio from Macene, ensuring potential enemies never know quite what they are up against. The Lanth Fleet is dispersed between bases at Lanth, D'Ganzio, Frenzie and Mirriam.

The fleet headquarters is at Lanth, home to a single battleship squadron and two squadrons of cruisers, plus supports. The system is heavily defended by a force of battle riders and monitors, and intended to serve as a bulwark against an offensive coming out of the Sword Worlds. D'Ganzio and Ghandi are likewise fortress systems. Their bases are capable of supporting a fleet if Lanth were to fall but in the meantime they are mainly home to communications and logistics formations, plus some specialist intelligence-gathering units.

Frenzie is home to a cruiser force intended to protect Vilis or to operate against the flanks of hostiles moving along the Spinward Main towards Regina. This mission is shared by forces based at Denotam, whilst Mirriam hosts patrol and security formations of the subsector fleet.

#### LUNION-MORA THEATRE

The Lunion-Mora theatre is politically complex due to the insistence of the Duchess of Mora upon holding a naval force ready to defend her subsector. Formations that really should be deployed in the Lunion subsector, or perhaps elsewhere in the sector, are held in reserve at Mora. Critics state that these forces are too far back to be useful in the early stages of a conflict and too weak to swing one that is already being lost in the forward areas. Naturally, the Duchess of Mora continues to demand ever more ships to be moved to her home system and has not been mollified by a standing deployment of a Tigress dreadnought detached from the Flag Fleet at Macene.

Forces deployed in the Lunion-Mora theatre are tasked with halting an offensive out of the Sword Worlds Confederation, ideally well forward at the so-called Lunion Shield from Rabwhar to Smoug. The envisaged role of the Lunion Contingent is as a mobile defensive force, with cruisers striking behind the advancing enemy. If the assault is too powerful to stop, the fortress worlds of Adabicci and Lunion will act as breakwaters whilst reinforcements move up from Mora.

#### GLISTEN-TRIN THEATRE

Relatively little threat is perceived to Trin's Veil, although raids from the Sword Worlds are a possibility. Sector fleet bases in Trin's Veil are mainly training and support facilities, although they have the potential to host a major force if necessary. There are extensive fleet reserves at Trin, with ships in varying states of repair awaiting reactivation. There are no major fleet assets assigned to the subsector. Glisten has only a cruiser squadron and some destroyers, which is deemed sufficient to deal with small raids. Reinforcements from Trin or Lunion are available in the event of a heavy attack or an attempt to push the Sword Worlders out of District 268.

#### FIVE SISTERS THEATRE

The Five Sisters subsector is separated from the rest of the Imperium by neutral space and contains the Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory, which are under heavy blockade. Forces assigned to this subsector are not part of the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet chain of command, forming a separate force known as 74 th Blockade Fleet. This is routinely augmented by a dreadnought and some support vessels from the Flag Fleet, serving under the temporary command of Flag Officer Andor. Forces are dispersed among the subsector's several naval bases, all of which are well defended, with a battle group centred on one or more capital ships always deployed at Andor.

#### TROJAN REACH FLEET

The Trojan Reach Fleet is small, little more than a placeholder formation. Its major warships are mostly older vessels, although there are a handful of more modern cruisers and destroyers available for operations beyond the border. In the event of a serious threat, reinforcements could be dispatched from Trin. This is one of the Duchess of Trin's arguments for additional ships to be assigned to the region. For the most part, the small subsector fleets are sufficient for internal security.

#### ADDITIONAL FORCES

In addition to the forces listed above, which will be under the direct command of the Sector Admiral once one is appointed, the Imperium can field a variety of other space forces. Notable among these are the subsector (numbered) fleets of the member subsectors. In peacetime, these are made up mostly of old destroyers and patrol craft suitable for keeping the peace but not warfighting. In some cases these forces will be shifted to a regional defence role and given additional assets. A transfer of cruisers or even capital units from the sector fleet is possible, although this is uncommon. More often, a subsector fleet is given control over the jump-capable assets of its member worlds, known as Colonial Fleet assets.

This use of Colonial Fleet forces is a generally acceptable compromise between leaving them under the command of their parent world and possibly sitting uselessly in a non-threatened area and transferring them to the sector fleet where they may be sent far away. Typically, the existing flagship of the subsector fleet remains in its role, with Colonial battleships attached as heavy combat assets. Colonial Navy vessels tend to be old and of lower capability than modern ships, rated as third or even fourth-rate vessels. They are still formidable combat assets, however.

It is possible that some of these numbered fleets will be eventually deployed on offensive operations. In this case they cease to be a subsector fleet as such but retain their identity for identification purposes. For example, the 43 rd Fleet is assigned as the subsector fleet for Lunion. In the course of the conflict it might be augmented with Colonial ships and vessels reactivated from the reserve but continue to serve as the fleet assigned to Lunion subsector, in which case it owns both identities of the Lunion Subsector Fleet and the 43rd Fleet.

If this fleet was sent into the Sword Worlds on offensive operations it would retain its designation as 43rd Fleet but would no longer be the Lunion Subsector Fleet. That role would be taken on by whatever portion of the force was left behind, referred to as the Lunion Subsector Fleet without a numeric designation.

This sort of role transfer has at times resulted in as subsector fleet being assigned a new number whilst the numbered fleet becomes the subsector fleet in a new location. Post-war reorganisation and redesignation is likely to be complex but it is a problem every Imperial admiral would prefer to have.

Subsector and numbered fleets will be augmented with Colonial forces at the outbreak of war and receive reactivated ships from the reserve. Some of these vessels will go to the sector fleet instead, to replace losses or increase fighting power in a critical area but each subsector fleet will receive at least a small allocation of capital ships and cruisers – albeit old ones

- once they become available. If a numbered fleet is assigned to offensive operations it will likely receive a mix of Colonial and reserve forces, plus some front-line ships arriving from other sectors.

Vessels will also be made available by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. Most of these ships are small couriers with no real fighting power but they can serve as reconnaissance platforms and assist in maintaining routine communications. Typical Scout Service courier vessels are capable only of jump-2 but there are a lot of them. Some scout vessels have outstanding sensor capabilities and may be assigned to specialist roles but for the most part ships will be assigned to ScoutRons attached to navy forces or stationed at key points to undertake whatever communications work is required.

Light forces may also be donated by or obtained from merchant lines, corporations and mercenary groups. These will be composed of small vessels for the most part, suitable only for escort and patrol work, or ships intended for a non-combat role. Corporate freighters may be co-opted for logistics and resupply work, with smaller vessels serving as auxiliaries. Mercenary vessels are likely to be used for security work, freeing naval assets to operate with the fleets.

Control of space will determine the shape of the conflict but ground troops are necessary to hold or capture installations and entire planets. The main ground forces fielded by the Imperium belong either to the Marine Corps or the Imperial Army. The Marine Corps is outfitted at TL15 and generally operates as small units in conjunction with the navy. In addition to ship's troops assignments, which can involve boarding enemy vessels, marine forces often spearhead attacks on enemy-held worlds. Meteoric assault techniques, involving dropping personnel from orbit directly onto an objective, may be combined with a more conventional attack from landing shuttles.

Whereas the marines are set up for short and very direct operations, the Imperial Army is prepared for a much wider variety of roles. Most regular army units are equipped at TL12, enabling a larger number of worlds to produce equipment and formations tend to be larger than those used by the marines. Whereas a battalion is the largest marine force likely to be deployed, the army thinks in terms of brigades formed of multiple battalions and divisions formed of multiple brigades.

Recruitment to what is formally known as the Unified Armies of the Imperium is undertaken by individual member worlds, other than for certain specialist and elite formations. Member worlds with sufficient populations are required to provide a regiment of three to five battalions for Imperial service, which includes providing Imperial-standard equipment if this is different from what the world uses for its own forces. Regiments may be raised specially or seconded from the world's own armed forces. The latter approach, with units rotated through Imperial service, allows an army to retain current operational experience even in peacetime.

The regiment is an administrative formation and it is common for battalions to be sent to widely separated Imperial forces. Worlds that cannot afford the cost or personnel for a whole regiment will sometimes supply a contingent to a composite regiment or battalion. Equipment for these often has to be provided by the Imperium but the cost is deemed worth it if it allows minor worlds to contribute and be part of the fabric of the Imperium.

Forces are deployed at the sector and subsector levels, in numbers ranging from field armies down to small detachments. The majority of personnel belong to Ground Force Command, fighting conventionally to take and hold terrain against whatever opposition appears. Close Orbit and Aerospace Control

## IMPERIAL GROUND FORCES

Command is concerned with defence against threats from space as well as flying craft and vehicles. Its assets range from planetary defence bases to fighter squadrons. Nautical Force Command is the smallest of the subdivisions, being concerned with operations on and under water or in the littoral zones.

The most senior army officer in a sector holds the rank of grand marshal, sometimes phrased as sector marshal, with vice-marshals assigned at the subsector level. These positions are associated with grand strategy and long-term planning; command of field armies is the work of generals. The headquarters for the Grand Marshal of the Spinward Marches is at Mora, with subsector headquarters typically being at a major army base or the subsector capital.

The backbone of the Imperial Army is lift infantry; personnel riding in and operating from armoured grav transports. These are armed for infantry support and to give a measure of defence against aerospace and armoured threats. The infantry are supported by light and heavy grav armoured formations, grav-mobile artillery and supporting elements including engineers, medical units and logistics formations. The standard tactical formation is a lift infantry brigade, consisting of three lift infantry battalions plus a battalion-sized headquarters and support formation.

IMPERIAL LIFT INFANTRY BRIGADE (FULLY GRAV-MOBILE) Brigade Headquarters Headquarters Company Aerospace Defence Company Combat Engineer Company Logistics and Supply Transport Pool

Lift Infantry Battalion x 3 Battalion Headquarters and Support Company Lift Infantry Company x 3

Brigades are combined into divisions, typically incorporating three lift infantry brigades, an armoured formation and an artillery formation which will include heavy anti-aerospace weapons. In addition, a division will have specialist formations attached; engineers, reconnaissance units, medical and vehicle repair formations, electronic warfare units or whatever other forces are available and/or deemed necessary.

A brigade will be commanded by a brigadier-general or an officer acting in that rank for lack of a suitably qualified individual. A division is commanded by a major- general, who will take control over attached forces or the overall theatre of operations if the division is the highest level of force assigned. Larger forces, made up of multiple divisions and attached forces, are termed corps and commanded by a lieutenant-general. An army
(more correctly, army group) is commanded by a full general, who answers to the subsector vice-marshal.

In many cases an army, corps or even division may be split up across several worlds. It remains under the command of its senior officer but local command is exercised by the most senior officer present. Higher formations always have additional general officers who can be given overall command of a detached force. For example, if an army group breaks off two lift infantry brigades, a strategic aerospace defence brigade and a maritime operations force to defend a nearby world, this force approaches divisional size and will be given a major-general as its overall commander.

The Imperium does not particularly like making use of mercenaries but will do so, along with contributed forces from member worlds or economic entities. These forces will not be trained or equipped to Imperial standards so will be assigned to provisional units which can make best use of whatever capabilities they may have. The forces of a member world may also not meet Imperial standards but can be relied upon for a higher level of interoperability and cooperation than donated forces, so may or may not be integrated with Imperial Army formations depending on circumstances.

HUSCARLE FORCES The personal forces of Imperial nobles are termed huscarles. In most cases they are too small to be of any significance but some nobles can field a small army or even a flotilla of warships. Huscarle forces vary considerably in composition and equipment, so are often treated the same as donated forces or reserved as a bodyguard for their liege. Huscarle units can be placed in the army chain of command, with the permission of both their owner and the army commander they will be serving under. Cooperation is generally good between huscarles and regulars but keeping a unit private does create a potential command and control issue, so they typically operate as separate entities.

For example, a senior army officer might also be a high- ranking noble with a battalion of grav-mobile infantry among their huscarles. If these were added to the army chain of command they could be deployed anywhere the officer's superiors wanted but if they remained
'private' they could only be commanded by their liege. The officer might use them as a security force at headquarters or send them off on a strike mission on the flanks of an Imperial force the officer commanded.

The Zhodani Consulate holds territory divided into nine provinces which do not follow the neat rectangular sector model favoured by the Imperium. This roughly corresponds to 10 Imperial-type sectors. The Consulate has not been expansionistic since contact with the Imperium and has apparently stabilised at a size that can be centrally governed.

Since the Consulate stopped annexing territory – apart from the odd exception of course – it has enjoyed stability and prosperity. Outsiders are prone to credit this to the idea that 'everyone is brainwashed by the thought police' but this is not quite the case. It is true that psionic re-education is used to put people onto a path better suited to society's well-being, as well as their own but this sort of personality alteration is less common than outsiders think. The Zhodani people are masters of psychology, partly due to their psionic abilities and partly from long research and practice. They have created a society that guides people towards activities they will find fulfilling and productive. There are criminals and there is dissent but the majority of the population are productive and content.

Political and military direction tends to be more centralised than in the Imperium, perhaps because communication distances are generally shorter. Within a military force, telepaths permit instant transmission of information and instructions with no doubt arising over wording. This is certainly useful in a tactical sense but thoughts cannot be transmitted over interstellar distances. Zhodani forces are therefore as limited by communications lag as anyone else.

The Zhodani Consulate navy, more properly known as the Zhodani Consulate Combined Interstellar Forces, uses a system of ranks based upon what the officer is qualified to command. This means that a battleship may have multiple destroyer officers aboard in subordinate positions. Imperial observers frequently use their more familiar equivalent ranks, so might refer to a battleship officer as a captain and a cruiser officer as a commander. Since titles are being translated from the Zhodani language anyway, so long as general meaning is preserved there is no real issue.

# BELLIGERENT POWERS: ZHODANI CONSULATE BELLIGERENT POWERS: THE

The Consulate maintains a dedicated ground force but there is no independent marine corps. Instead, some naval personnel are assigned to the Naval Special Landing Force (NSLF) and receive training in ground and shipboard combat. Most larger ships carry a contingent of NSLF personnel who form part of the crew when not assigned to a boarding or landing party. Warships are usually built at TL14 and are larger than Imperial equivalents. They are also for the most part broader in function. Whereas the Imperium has for many years favoured capital ships configured almost solely for combat, a Zhodani equivalent will also have a fighter or gunboat contingent aboard, as well as significant numbers of ground troops and some courier vessels. This gives greater flexibility but at the cost of straight-out per-ton firepower.

#### FORCE COMPOSITION

Whereas the Imperium favours four-ship squadrons of identical or at least closely similar vessels, the Consulate creates what would be considered task forces in the Imperium. A three-and-one ratio is preferred, with each significant vessel in a formation being assigned three destroyer-sized ships as escorts and supports. A battleship would not normally operate with just its own escorts, however, and would normally be the flagship of a squadron containing three cruisers, each with its own escorts. The cruisers' spinal mounts provide additional firepower whilst their destroyers combine into a formidable escort or strike force.

Some observers consider a Zhodani battle squadron not as a battleship and escorts but as a force of three cruisers with a battleship as the command and support platform. Such a force would theoretically start out accompanied by 12 destroyers, although it is rare to encounter any force matching its paper strength as squadrons commonly detach subordinate ships to carry out whatever tasks are required. This might be a single destroyer or a group of them, or a cruiser and its associated destroyers.

Battle squadrons are led by a squadron officer, whose flagship is still commanded by the usual battleship officer. Groups of lighter vessels are usually led by the commanding officer of the most senior ship. Typically this is a highly experienced officer who will eventually take command of a more powerful vessel. Thus a force put together from three cruiser squadrons supported by a destroyer squadron might be commanded by a battleship officer. Having gained experience in operating groups of lighter ships, a battleship officer is readied for the eventuality when they may have to take over a force when the flagship is destroyed or the flag officer is disabled.

Larger forces follow a general one-and-three model, although this is not rigidly applied and force levels can vary considerably in the field. A Fleet of the Third Rank is a force that nominally contains three battle squadrons plus any assigned supports, with a third- rank fleet officer in command. A Fleet of the Second Rank nominally contains three Fleets of the Third Rank, totalling nine squadrons, plus a flag squadron and any additional support vessels. A Fleet of the First Rank could be of any size so long as it contains two or more second-rank fleets and will have a flag squadron of its own. Even larger formations are commanded by provincial officers, although these will be dispersed across a theatre of war rather than in a single system.

By way of example, a first rank fleet officer might command a Fleet of the First Rank from aboard a battleship which leads its own squadron and acts as a final reserve. This officer might have under their hand two full Fleets of the Second Rank, one of which is detached to another star system but still under the first rank officer's command. These formations have their own flag squadrons. Two other provisional Fleets of the Second Rank are also present but understrength. One is little more than an administrative placeholder as so many vessels have been detached or sent back for repairs. The other contains two Fleets of the Third Rank at more or less paper strength, plus a provisional squadron made up of remnants and newly arrived reinforcements.

Not all forces follow this model. Some kinds of raiding operation are best carried out by lone vessels, although often a strike force will hit an initial target as a concentrated unit, then split up to carry out raids on specified targets as the opportunity presents itself. However, whenever possible the Consulate navy favours the one-and-three model which has proved itself effective in large and small-scale conflicts.

**_BellIgerent Powers: tHe ZHodanI consulate_**

FLEET OF THE FIRST RANK
**Flag Officer of the First Rank Flag Squadron**

**Fleet of the Second Rank Alpha (present)** Flag Officer of the Second Rank Flag Squadron Fleet of the Third Rank x 3

**Fleet of the Second Rank Beta (detached)** Flag Officer of the Second Rank Flag Squadron Fleet of the Third Rank x 3

**Provisional Fleet of the Second Rank Gamma** Flag Officer of the Second Rank Flag Squadron Fleet of the Third Rank x 2 Provisional Miscellaneous Squadron

**Provisional Fleet of the Second Rank Delta** Flag Officer of the Second Rank Flag Squadron Provisional Fleet of the Third Rank Provisional Miscellaneous Squadron

The commanding officer can deploy force Alpha as a unified formation containing nine battleships and 27 cruisers plus destroyers, supported by Gamma which has around six battleships and 18 cruisers. The flag squadrons of all three forces are not counted among the fleet strength but are available as reserves in a dire situation. Beta has roughly the same combat power as Alpha alone, whilst Delta might be seen as a waste of command officers since it contains only a single battleship and supports within the flag squadron. However, this is still a functioning fleet and could be brought up to strength – or at least effectiveness – by the addition of reinforcements or vessels transferred from another force. In the interim this is a command element that can be assigned to any necessary task.

Flag officers are sometimes reassigned to another role, such as governing a conquered world, but if they remain in their fleet role they will always have a flagship. Efforts will be made to keep this vessel suitably supported, although reinforcements tend to be sent to formations that remain combat-worthy, creating multiple orphaned flagships or weak flag squadrons. It would be more efficient in terms of hardware to
'beach' the flag officer until a suitable command is available and reassign their vessel(s) to a coherent fighting force, but this does not fit the Zhodani way of thinking. A flag officer who is reassigned is needed elsewhere. One who loses their flagship is surplus to requirements; there is a major difference.

Rather than inflict such disgrace upon undeserving commanders, the Consulate uses them as additional command and political assets. This means that a flag squadron – or what is left of it – might become the centre of government for a conquered world and coincidentally be positioned to drive off raids. Alternatively, a fleet flagship might become an administrative centre, accepting and assigning reinforcements as they move up until some are finally sent to reconstitute the fleet.

These 'fleet fragments' will begin to appear soon after the start of a conflict, eventually returning to the fight with vessels reassigned from other battered forces or arriving as reinforcements. One consequence of this is that early in a conflict the Consulate Navy tends to send complete units forward as reinforcements but later on vessels will muster as a fleet fragment as soon as they can get there rather than waiting for sufficient forces to create a whole new force. This can look chaotic to Imperial observers but Zhodani flag officers train for the situation and are adept at getting a scratch force into fighting condition in an impressively short time.

ZHODANI WARSHIPS Ships are built at TL14, with greater standardisation than encountered in the Imperium. Some older or very new designs may vary from the standards but will usually be equivalent in capability. A Zhodani battle squadron of one battleship and three cruisers plus destroyers is generally considered equivalent in fighting power to two or three Imperial first-class battleships, although less resilient in the long term. A Fleet of the Third Rank, containing three battle squadrons, is therefore in theory about equivalent to six to eight Imperial battleships. This makes it about 50–100% more potent than an unsupported Imperial battle squadron. However, Imperial squadrons are never unsupported and over a protracted engagement the Imperial force is likely to remain combat-capable for longer. The newest and best Imperial dreadnoughts are said to be able to take on a Fleet of the Third Rank on their own, although there is an element of propaganda to this claim.

Battleships are mostly 400,000-ton vessels with jump-3 capability. Their size and lower fuel requirement should make them superior to Imperial capital ships one-on- one but the technological difference is significant and Zhodani ships sacrifice considerable space to carry small craft, troops and other systems not directly connected with heavy combat. Battleships are considered command assets, whilst a squadron centred on one is the basic tactical asset in Zhodani naval thinking.

**_BellIgerent Powers: tHe ZHodanI consulate_**

Fleet Cruisers are mostly 100,000-ton vessels with jump-3 capability. They are larger than Imperial cruisers, with powerful spinal mounts, and are sometimes referred to as 'pocket battleships'. Fleet cruisers are in many ways smaller versions of battleships and share the same multirole design philosophy. A fleet cruiser will be assigned three fleet destroyers when deployed, creating a Fleet Cruiser Squadron.

**Raiding Cruisers** are typically 60,000-ton designs with jump-4 capability. They are intended to operate solo or in groups of two or more, without destroyer support. Raiding cruisers are also reconnaissance platforms and may sometimes be used to secure a line of advance by operating in force. Raiding Cruiser Squadrons are administrative formations for the most part, as vessels are expected to operate independently. The squadron flagship will carry a squadron officer who will be in overall command of a raiding force but how much direct control is exerted can vary.

**Fleet Destroyers** are typically 10,000-ton designs with jump-4 capability. They are designed to support heavier units or operate in squadrons of three but can be given solo missions. Fleet destroyers are often used to guard lines of communication or replace couriers – a fleet destroyer can get through a system a courier could not. They are also deployed as fleet scouts or detached completely if the need arises. As a result, a Fleet of the Third Class that begins a campaign with 36 fleet destroyers might be down to 10 or less within a month. Orphaned destroyers are usually sent to the nearest force rather than seeking their original squadron.

Scout Destroyers are typically 4,000-ton vessels with a more limited range of capabilities than their larger counterparts. These vessels can act as raiders or secure a region but their primary role is to collect data on threats or targets for more potent vessels.

Minor Combatants include patrol vessels and escorts. Many of these are frigates in the 1,000–2,000-ton range. These vessels rarely have any impact on a major engagement other than to intercept a courier or keep missiles away from a tanker. They are rarely deployed in systems where combat is expected but may sneak around performing scouting or system monitoring tasks.

The Zhodani Consulate makes little use of dedicated carriers. Instead, its small craft combatants are carried by battleships and fleet cruisers for screening and escort operations. Some minor combatants also carry fighters for use as scouts or to harass weakly defended targets. The effect of a handful of fighters will be negligible but when all the small craft of a squadron and its supports are combined they can become a formidable force.

**_BellIgerent Powers: tHe ZHodanI consulate_**

The Zhodani Consulate has enjoyed the luxury of being able to prepare and pre-position forces. Direct comparisons are difficult but around four to five times the strength of the Imperial Spinward Marches Sector Fleet is available to the Consulate for the initial attacks. An additional force around 150–200% of the Imperial strength is available as reserves or en route from distant stations. This should be sufficient to overrun the forward-deployed Imperial forces and crush the strategic reserve as it moves up from Macene. However, the situation is not as good for the Zhodani fleet as it seems. One reason for this is the 'hardening' of Imperial space by subsidising or augmenting the system defence flotillas of frontier worlds. Facing opposition everywhere, however minor, the strength of the Zhodani fleet may be dispersed and gradually worn down.

Putting together a force of this size means pulling much of the fleet strength from other provinces. Even without considering losses, this force will be unavailable in its home regions for months or even years. In this, the Fifth Frontier War differs from previous conflicts; the Zhodani Consulate is staking more in a victory and is prepared to pay a high price for it. Any troubles elsewhere during the conflict will be more serious for lack of resources to respond. Why the Consulate feels this war is worth the price is as yet unclear.

CAMPAIGN RESERVE Based at Cronor, the Campaign Reserve is commanded by a provincial officer who has jurisdiction over the entire theatre of war. This officer would normally remain in position but could in theory co-opt a squadron to act as a mobile headquarters. The Campaign Reserve consists of two Fleets of the First Class plus additional forces. Sufficient forces to almost double this strength are en route from distant provinces but some will not arrive for many months. In the meantime, the Campaign Reserve will detach formations or whole fleets to follow up successes or secure gains.

The provincial officer intends to keep this force concentrated as far as possible but is required to detach some elements in order to secure the flanks and 'mop up' minor worlds bypassed by the advancing fleets. The headquarters is likely to remain at Cronor for much of the war, although contingency plans for switching to a forward base are in place. This will necessitate some communications difficulties until the new headquarters is firmly established but will shorten lines of communication once the task is completed.

## ZHODANI NAVAL ORDER OF BATTLE

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 35 (CRONOR/NINJAR) It is expected that Fleet of the First Class 35 will be committed as a whole early in the conflict, either to resume momentum in a stalled advance or to exploit a weakness detected during the first phase of conflict. Its expected axis of advance is towards Jewell or through the demilitarised zone around Arden in the direction of Regina. In order to secure this axis, 35th Fleet has forward-deployed some elements at Ninjar. These are to advance through the demilitarised zone, probably meeting little or no resistance and will land occupation forces which will be reinforced by army units as soon as possible.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 40 Fleet of the First Class 40 is likely to be broken down to provide replacements for damaged units or to conduct lower-level operations and is designated as the holding formation for reinforcements moving up from deeper in the Consulate. If it must be committed as a unit it is likely to be understrength unless detached units can be replaced. A significant detachment, consisting of a second-class battle fleet and attached light forces, has been sent to Rapp's World to cover the rimward flank of the advance. Whether this detachment is recalled to join an operation by the 40th Fleet, or the remainder of the fleet is sent to assist it, will depend on circumstances.

PROVINCIAL RESERVE FORCE The campaign reserve also contains a force intended to be broken down to carry out relatively minor tasks. It is commanded by a flag officer of the second rank and equivalent to a weak second-class battle fleet.

This force will detach battleship or cruiser squadrons as required to assist other forces or carry out minor operations. These include securing the route for large- scale army forces once the enemy's main battle fleets are driven from the region.

#### VICTORY FORCE JEWELL

Victory Force Jewell is tasked with a direct assault on the Imperial formations defending Jewell and the surrounding worlds, which includes raiding operations and thrusts into the rear to cut off the Jewell Salient. The primary assets are Fleet of the First Class 28 and Fleet of the First Class 68, which have different but complementary tasks. The force assigned to directly assault and capture Jewell is the 2nd Assault Fleet, whose commander holds the same rank as those of the 28th and 68th fleets but is in overall command of the Jewell theatre until advised differently by the provincial officer at Cronor. For this reason, any or all elements of Victory Force Jewell may be misidentified as belonging to 2nd Assault Fleet.

The 'Jewell plan' follows the same general format as those aimed at Regina and Efate. One first-class fleet is aimed at the primary objective, followed by an assault fleet. Another first-class fleet is assigned to operate in the local area, securing targets of lesser importance and keeping enemy reinforcements at bay.

Once Jewell is secured these forces will push into Regina sector, possibly assisting with the campaigns against Regina or Efate. If these have gone well the remaining forces will begin the next phase of the war; an advance on Macene and Rhylanor.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 28 Like most of the forces involved, 28th Fleet marshals at Cronor then moves to a holding station. Its jumping- off points are Cipango and Clan but the fleet will remain there for a minimal period to refuel and make final preparations. The Imperials will have only a few days to notice the activity before attacks are launched into Ruby, Emerald, Mongo, Nakege and Lysen. The 28th Fleet will break down its fighting strength as necessary, regrouping to assist in the capture of Jewell or advancing on Efate or Regina. If the target worlds can be occupied without serious losses this is to be done but otherwise 28th Fleet is to clear naval resistance from these systems then move on. Imperial ground forces can be left isolated until the army can muster a suitable invasion force or cruisers in orbit can force a surrender through blockade.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 68 Fleet of the First Class 68 is tasked with the rapid capture or neutralisation of Jewell and to that end has additional heavy forces. Its jumping-off point is the naval base at Chwistyoch but like 28th Fleet it will only be there for the minimum time required to refuel and make preparations. The fleet will jump to deep space to refuel from its tankers, arriving with sufficient fuel for a one- parsec retreat to a prearranged deep space rendezvous. Elements of the force which are heavily damaged will be sent there before retiring to base for repairs.

Ideally, 68th Fleet will overcome the defences and take control of the Jewell system. If this is not practicable the fleet is to create a secure area to bring up its supports and implement a planetary siege. Reinforcements are available from the Campaign Reserve and a prolonged siege is not undesirable since it will pull in Imperial reinforcements through systems contended by 28th Fleet and other forces. However, the intent is to capture Jewell quickly if possible.

The majority of the fleet will jump into the outsystem and proceed to the attack after regrouping. However, to ensure maximum damage to unprepared defenders, a vanguard force is assigned to jump close to the mainworld and the naval base in order to exploit the advantage of surprise. This force is expected to hit hard but suffer serious damage, with ships being authorised to break off and flee as their commanding flag officer directs.

ASSAULT FLEET OF THE FIRST RANK 2 The battle force will be followed by elements of 2 nd Assault Fleet, whose mission is to reduce the ground defences and take possession of centres of government. This force will hold in deep space awaiting word from the battle force, so will not reach Jewell for about 20 days after a foothold is established in the Jewell system. If the defences are too strong, this force will be dispersed to reinforce attacks on worlds that can be taken and a new assault force will be assembled.

#### VICTORY FORCE EFATE

Victory Force Efate is tasked with clearing the coreward flank of the advance by overrunning Efate and Pixie, eliminating the forward Imperial bases there. Whether or not a quick victory is achieved, the force is also intended to contest the systems rimward of Efate, completing the encirclement of Jewell and hopefully ambushing reinforcements directed there. The forces assigned include two fleets of the first class, the 7th and the 67th. Both are weaker in strength than the fleet aimed at Jewell, containing two second-class fleets and some supporting vessels. The overall operation hinges on Assault Fleet of the First Class 1, whose commander is in overall charge of the Efate theatre.

The Efate operation faces significant logistical difficulties. In order to avoid a deep space rendezvous, which inevitably is more hazardous than jumping into a star system, Zhodani forces need a forward base or rendezvous point. The only suitable candidate is Louzy. Zhodani warships can jump straight to Louzy from their base at Farreach but Louzy has no gas giants for refuelling and no significant starport which can be co-opted. Nevertheless, it will be a pivotal location in the campaign against Efate. A tanker depot is to be established there and heavily protected, allowing ships to make the three-parsec crossing from Farreach and get straight into the fight.

The Efate campaign is intended to facilitate the main advance rather than being a war-winner in its own right. Once Efate's naval base is reduced, it is likely that operations to trailing will be minimal and all efforts directed towards establishing a forward base for the drive on Macene. For this reason the Efate campaign is considered a heavy flank-clearing operation after which the easier routes into Imperial space, by way of the demilitarised zone or the Jewell Cluster, are to be used. Elements of the Efate Victory Force may continue to hold this flank but if necessary it can be abandoned in favour of a defensive position on Farreach, at the other side of the rift.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 7 Fleet of the First Class 7 stages on Farreach and launches its initial attack at Pixie with the intent of eliminating the base and any vessels stationed there. Capture of the world is not important so long as the base is overrun or heavily damaged. Instead, 7th Fleet is instructed to do as much damage as possible then continue its advance. Elements of the fleet will raid the trailing side of the subsector whilst the main force makes a feint towards Inthe and Paya in the hope of distracting Imperial reinforcements. Once contact is made with significant forces, the fleet is to make a fighting retreat towards Roup, which is to be secured as a forward refuelling point.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 67 Fleet of the First Class 67 also stages on Farreach but is intended to fight and win the battle for Efate during the opening days of the conflict. Once the system is taken, a security element will be left and the 68th Fleet is to proceed to Roup. Depending on circumstances, it will either 'hold the door closed' against Imperial reinforcements headed for Jewell or join the force pressuring Regina.

ASSAULT FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 1 The capture of Efate is considered a vital objective in the opening phases of the conflict. To this end, a first-class assault fleet has been assigned to follow the battle force once a bridgehead has been established. Groundside assistance is expected as anti-Imperial insurgents have been active on Efate for some years. The assault force is considered sufficient to seize the starport or a suitable landing area, after which it will be reinforced by army units in order to conquer the whole planet. Light assault forces will attempt to capture additional targets or reinforce the main assault.

#### VICTORY FORCE REGINA

Victory Force Regina is tasked with the capture of Regina and shutting off reinforcements to Jewell. As with the other two Victory Forces, two first-class battle fleets are assigned; the 47th and the 65th. Both will stage through Ruie, violating the demilitarised zone, and strike by surprise if at all possible. The same general format is followed as the other Victory Forces; one fleet is assigned to strike the main target whilst the other causes as much damage and disruption as possible.

Regina is the key to the whole campaign. Losing it will be a shock that might bring the Imperials rushing to the negotiating table, and even if this is not the case Regina is the 'big pincer' of a double envelopment which will bite off the Jewell Salient. Holding it and the nearby worlds will greatly impede the efforts of the Imperial Navy to reinforce or retake Jewell, virtually ensuring the Zhodani Consulate will hold that region at the end of the conflict. Even if wider aims are not achieved, the territory gained will ensure a bargaining advantage.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 65 Fleet of the First Class 65 is assigned as the primary force in the initial attack on Regina. Its vanguard units will jump directly to the Imperial naval base and do as much damage as possible before retiring whilst the main elements of the fleet regroup and proceed to the attack. It is envisaged that the base will be under fire from capital ships within six to ten hours of the fleet entering the system and should be destroyed within a day.

FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 47 Fleet of the First Class 47 is assigned to an attack on the naval base at Extolay using one of its second-class fleets and supporting elements. The other will make a feint towards Macene by way of Djinni and Keanou. Enemy reinforcements or logistics assets will be targeted if the opportunity arises. After these operations this force will retire to Regina or its forward marshalling point at Yori depending upon circumstances.

ASSAULT FLEET OF THE FIRST CLASS 3 The attack on Regina will be followed by the arrival of Assault Fleet 3, which will attempt to establish a bridgehead on-planet to allow army units to be brought in. Elements of the fleet may be tasked with securing nearby worlds if an assault on Regina is not practicable.

MOBILE FORCE REGINA Mobile Force Regina is a raiding formation assigned to support the attack on Regina by whatever actions are necessary. Its flag element will initially proceed to the Wypoc system from where it will collect intelligence and conduct raids as the opportunity arises. A secondary role is the maintenance of communications between the elements of Victory Force Regina.

#### COMBAT FORCE LANTH

Combat Force Lanth is not a 'victory force', in the sense that it is not intended to win a decisive victory or capture a significant world. The role of this force is to harass and pressure the Imperial forces around Lanth and distract the enemy from the main theatre of war. It may be possible to assist Sword Worlds forces to make a ground assault on Lanth itself but this force is instructed to operate cautiously to ensure it poses a threat for as long as possible. Combat Force Lanth will stage through Dyrnwyn in the Sword Worlds Confederation.

#### COMBAT FORCE FRENZIE

Combat Force Frenzie will stage through Quare, initially launching an attack on the Imperial naval base at Frenzie. The command elements of the fleet will remain at Frenzie if the base is neutralised or at

Quare if not, maintaining a defensive posture for the most part to protect against a counterattack aimed at Cronor. Raiding operations will be mounted mainly into the coreward end of the subsector, with some elements of the force applying pressure around Vilis in support of Sword Worlds advances.

#### COMBAT FORCE IDERATI

Combat Force Iderati is a medium-range raiding and distraction force intended to present a threat against the Imperial forces deployed around Andor. Operations against the Darrian Confederation are not envisaged, as the Darrians will be distracted by conflict with the Sword Worlds Confederation and an additional active hostile state would be an unnecessary complication. Command elements will establish a position at 886-945 initially but should proceed at discretion. Raids into District 268 or even beyond are acceptable but the main purpose of this force is to draw Imperial reserves towards Andor.

#### RAIDING FORCE PRETORIA

Raiding Force Pretoria is a medium-range distraction force assigned to disrupt the flow of reinforcements and supplies. If possible, vessels are to operate in conjunction with local Vargr forces, with more potent Zhodani units clearing the way for raiders or, ideally, ambushing Imperial Navy forces sent to deal with them. The force has a wide area of operations including Aramis, Pretoria and Lamas.

RAIDING FORCE LUNION Raiding Force Lunion is tasked with presenting a threat to shipping in Lunion and Glisten, and with launching a raid into Mora on at least one occasion. The force is commanded by a flag officer of the third rank whose flagship is the only capital vessel assigned to the theatre. Overall forces are light, relying on destroyers rather than cruisers.

#### RAIDING FORCE TOBIA

Raiding Force Tobia is a small group of cruisers and destroyers commanded by a squadron officer aboard one of the cruisers. Its role is to inflict damage by raiding and to tie down enemy forces. To this end, instructions are to conduct an initial high-tempo raiding campaign over a wide area to maximise damage and threat perception, then to move to low-tempo operations to maintain the threat for as long as possible. The force is made up entirely of cruisers, with the exception of the flagship's escorts.

#### ADDITIONAL FORCES

The Zhodani Consulate does not have an equivalent to the Colonial Fleet used by the Imperials, although its local and regional reserve forces are often referred to as
'Colonial' by observers used to the term. All naval units are part of a chain of command which begins with the provincial officer for that region. However, this does not mean that reserve forces can be given orders by a front- line admiral. There is a separate chain of command for reserves, requiring an order from the provincial officer to transfer a reserve unit to the 'active' chain.

System defence forces are likewise assigned by the Consulate high command rather than being what the local world government can afford or wants to buy. Minor systems at astrographically significant locations may have a significant force assigned and system defences are overall stronger in frontier regions than the core of the Consulate. There is less to fear from criminals, pirates or dissenting worlds than in less unified societies, so defences are arrayed against an external threat.

The Consulate has no equivalent to the huscarles employed by Imperial nobles, in the sense of private armies, but senior officials are provided with a security force and ships may be assigned to them. These are not part of the fleet chain of command whilst assigned and in some cases are specialist designs. These include the 'diplomatic cruisers' used by some emissaries and officials, often assigned to flag-showing and diplomatic missions along the frontiers but some will follow an advancing fleet to act as administrative centres or secure diplomatic bases in the conquered areas.

The ground forces of the Zhodani Consulate are part of the Combined Interstellar Forces and operate in closer conjunction with naval formations than the Imperial Army. There are no separate 'army' and 'navy' logistics formations, for example. One set of transports serves all units of all types. However, the ground forces are specialists at planetary operations on a large scale. Smaller actions and ship's troops are the province of the Special Naval Landing Force. These personnel are trained to operate shipboard systems as part of a crew when not deployed in their specialist role, whereas ground combat personnel are not.

Zhodani Special Naval Landing Force units are generally small, with the platoon as the basic tactical unit. Smaller vessels may carry a detachment, sometimes referred to as a half-platoon, or a section consisting of two four-soldier teams and supporting personnel. These may include vehicle crews if the force has any and one or more warbot technicians will almost certainly be present along with their 'bots.

**Platoon Command Team** Platoon Leader Assistant Platoon Leader Platoon Senior NCO

**Landing Force Section x 4** Combat Team x 2 Team leader Rifleman Grenadier Support Gunner, Medic or Breaching Specialist Support Team VRF Gauss Gun Crew Warbot Technician Vehicle Crews, if present

Larger forces are assembled from the available platoons, usually coordinated by a command officer aboard one of the parent warships. ZSNLF troops are adept at small- unit combat but coordination is good. This looser and highly flexible organisation is augmented by psionic communications and may benefit from the presence of psionic specialists such as clairvoyant reconnaissance experts or teleport-capable commandos.

The bulk of Zhodani ground forces are made up of lift infantry formations, designated 'lift rifle' units. These are equipped at TL14 and differ from Imperial forces in two important ways. The first is the extensive use of warbots at all levels of command. An infantry section will typically contain a warbot technician and one or two warbots, usually a combat 'bot intended to directly and autonomously engage the enemy with heavy weapons and the other a support and logistics unit. Warbots are integrated at the small-unit level, with some specialist bot-handling units attached to higher formations.

The other main difference is that Zhodani units tend to be larger than their Imperial equivalents, with more sub-units, enabling a force to remain combat-capable for longer despite losses and casualties. As with naval forces, headquarters units are normally maintained even if they have few sub-units to command due to losses or detachments. A force commanded by a senior officer which has lost sufficient forces to be incapable of providing its normal function will usually be used as a placeholder to marshal reinforcements and replacements, or assigned as a security force.

It is rare for a formation of battalion size or greater to be completely removed from the Table of Organisation and Equipment as this would be seen as a disgrace of its commander. If merited, it will be done, but forces are only demolished in this way if the leadership is in disgrace, or they are moving to a new command or a different role such as head of an occupation force. This means that as forces take losses they may be stripped out down to a cadre and given a task apparently beneath their official capabilities. However, it may be that the division occupying a backwater world can only field a handful of units until brought back up to strength.

## ZHODANI GROUND FORCES

The Consulate uses a similar system of unit sizes to the Imperium, with a 'three and supports' system for sub- units – the opposite of the 'one and three' used by the navy. The Zhodani also have more distinct armoured units than the Imperials, creating armoured brigades and divisions rather than placing the majority of armoured fighting vehicles in lift infantry formations as supports. Formations are designated according to their primary combat asset, similar to most other powers. Although larger, Zhodani formations are equivalent to Imperial battalions, brigades, divisions, corps and army groups.

The example lift rifle corps presented here is set up for large-scale ground combat operations against a significant enemy. It is designated a lift rifle force as it contains lift infantry formations for its main fighting component but also has light and heavy armoured forces and artillery. A light lift infantry brigade, using relatively lightly protected vehicles, is attached for security operations. Composite support battalions vary in composition but will usually contain logistics, engineering, security, electronic warfare and medical units, as well as workshops and recovery elements for complex or heavy equipment. Larger formations may have dedicated battalions providing these functions.

#### CONSULAR GUARD

The elite of the Zhodani ground forces is the Consular Guard. These units are staffed entirely with nobles and intendents who have extensive psionic powers in addition to excelling in their military field. It is not clear whether all personnel must be capable of teleportation, or whether units contain some personnel who can but are mainly staffed by individuals with other talents. The latter is more likely as teleportation is a rare talent and others – such as clairvoyance and telekinesis – are just as militarily useful.

Consular Guard units are infantry formations supported by whatever they need. This is unlikely to be heavy tanks and the like, as guard units tend to operate on a more subtle level, but grav transportation is a certainty. Any additional support will be available from regular army units. A Consular Guard force might lead an attack in an apparently conventional role but how they operate is anything but conventional. Psionic reconnaissance allows commandos to be teleported directly into enemy positions if they can locate a suitable launch point. Telekinesis can remove obstacles or disable enemy equipment and of course telepathy allows near-perfect cooperation. Whilst effective, this direct-combat role is perhaps wasteful of the capabilities of a unit. More commonly Consular Guard units of platoon size or smaller will make strikes on supposedly secure areas to disable communication or even decapitate a combat unit by eliminating its command team.

The Darrian Confederation operates a 'cruiser navy', with few very large warships. Its ships are built at TL15, with TL16 components rumoured to be aboard some vessels. Most warships belong to the Darrian Confederation Navy but a small force of highly advanced ships are operated by the Special Arm. This force is most famous for being the wielders of the Star Trigger weapon but also undertakes conventional warfare in which it enjoys an enormous qualitative advantage over the ships of the Sword Worlds.

The Darrian command structure is ad-hoc, with vessels assigned to flotillas and fleets as required. There is one exception to this; the Alliance Fleet. This force is equipped with ships supplied by the Imperial Navy and retrofitted with a few Darrian systems. Crews are a mix of Imperial Navy personnel on secondment, Darrians and mercenaries recruited wherever good naval crews can be found. Although mixed in origin, the Alliance Fleet is highly disciplined and steadfast in its loyalty. It represents the single largest permanent formation in Confederation space.

Although allied to the Imperium, the Darrian Confederation has traditionally not undertaken offensive operations against Zhodani targets. The Consulate has reciprocated, to the point where Darrian and Zhodani ships have encountered one another in the rimward part of Querion and exchanged nothing more than a coldly polite greeting despite technically being at war with one another. It is likely, although by no means certain, that this arrangement will be respected in the Fifth Frontier War. The Darrians also act as intermediaries in back- channels diplomacy between the Imperium and the Consulate, whilst the Consulate performs the same function for the Darrians and the Sword Worlds.

Darrian war aims are straightforward. They want to keep the Sword Worlds from gaining more territory and to eject them from the Entropic Worlds. Forces are concentrated to protect the core worlds around Darrian and Mire, and to contest the Trifuge and Entropic combat zones. Base systems have heavy defences built around a force of cruiser-sized monitors, freeing fleet units for a mobile defence or strikes into the Sword Worlds Confederation.

## DARRIAN WARSHIPS

The largest Darrian vessels are not 100% warships. Referred to as 'flagships', these vessels are part super- cruiser, part carrier, and carry a range of systems in addition to their weaponry. A flagship is capable of conducting a scientific or exploration cruise or assisting in the development of a colony if the Confederation feels the need to construct one. Multiple flagships are known to be engaged in non-military activity such as conducting scientific research in orbit around a black hole. The inefficiency of these vessels as warships is offset by their size and sophistication. Tonnages vary from 150,000 up to at least 600,000. According to rumour, the Special Arm has at least one flagship; a colossal monster of over a million tons displacement.

The main fighting strength of the Confederation Navy rests with a force of what the Darrians call major or minor anti-warship vessels. This translates to 'heavy cruiser' or 'light cruiser' in the parlance of other navies but Darrian vessels tend to vary considerably. Most Darrian 'cruisers' are designed for direct combat, with a balanced mix of beam and missile weapons backing up a spinal mount, but tonnages can vary from 15,000 to 90,000 without reflecting the vessel's role.

The Confederation Navy's equivalent to the light/heavy/ strike/armoured designations used by the Imperial Navy is a variation on Anti-warship such as anti-corvette for more specialist vessels. The term 'anti-planet' for a bombardment ship can provoke sniggers but all vessels are powerful enough to be taken seriously. Small combatants are usually designated escorts, sometimes with a qualifier such as anti-fighter or anti-destroyer to reflect weapons fit and envisaged role.

Extensive use is also made of non-jump-capable craft, either carried by flagships or deployed to guard a system. The craft mix carried by a flagship depends on its mission. One engaged in hostilities would be given a complement of fighters, gunboats and perhaps larger craft, whereas an exploration mission would require an entirely different mix of craft.

# BELLIGERENT POWERS: THE DARRIAN CONFEDERATION

Darrian naval strength is considerably lower than that of the likely enemy; the Sword Worlds Confederation. This is offset by qualitative advantages and the presence of the Alliance Fleet. Deployments are defensive and operations are usually cautious, but the Darrians have shown themselves capable of bold action at times. Sword Worlds raids will result in counter-raids deep into Sword Worlds territory. It is thought that both sides maintain deep-space refuelling stations to facilitate warfare of this nature.

MIRE FLEET RESERVE The majority of Darrian forces are based at Mire and Ilium, and will concentrate as soon as hostilities begin. This force may send detachments to assist other formations or move en masse to deal with a major attack.

## DARRIAN NAVAL ORDER OF BATTLE

#### ALLIANCE FLEET

The Alliance Fleet is based out of Laberv. Its most likely wartime deployment is the Trifuge region, initially blocking a Sword Worlds advance and later threatening the Gram Arm of the Sword Worlds Confederation. It is almost entirely equipped with Imperial vessels.

#### RIMWARD SECURITY DETACHMENT

The Rimward Security Detachment is tasked with monitoring the systems rimward of Darrian space and maintaining contact with the Imperial forces in the Five Sisters. Its handful of vessels can call upon reinforcements from the Mire fleet reserve.

NARSIL FRONT FORCE The Narsil Front Force is based at Spume. It is tasked with dealing with incursions from the Sword Worlds fleet based at Narsil. This includes harassment and spoiling raids into the Sword Worlds Confederation, which will be undertaken in conjunction with vessels from the fleet reserve.

#### ENTROPIC FRONT FORCE

The Entropic Front Force is based at Laberv. It is tasked with maintaining a watch on the Entropic Worlds and Querion. Forces are light but would be reinforced by the Alliance Fleet or vessels from the Mire Reserve at need.

#### TRIFUGE FRONT FORCE

The Trifuge Front Force is based at Ilium. It maintains standing forward deployments close to the Sword Worlds border and launches reconnaissance missions into the Gram Arm. Most of these are undertaken by merchant ships with an intelligence team aboard, but the Trifuge Front Force does have some dedicated intelligence-gathering vessels.

#### SPECIAL ARM FORCE

The strength and capabilities of the Special Arm are a closely guarded secret. It is likely that most vessels are quite small but highly capable. Most observers believe the Star Trigger weapon would be carried aboard a flagship, if it exists at all.

ADDITIONAL FORCES The Darrian Confederation does not have an equivalent to the Colonial forces of the Imperium. System defence craft are provided by central command and redeployed as necessary. There is little in the way of reserves, at least in the short term. It might be possible to convert some civilian ships to light carriers or bring armed exploration ships home, but it appears that the Darrian Confederation must fight with what it has.

## DARRIAN GROUND FORCES

Darrian ground forces are equipped to TL12 and organised similarly to their Imperial counterparts, with certain exceptions. Regular forces are known as the Confederation Guard. This force is relatively small but lavishly equipped, with a high proportion of light and heavy grav tanks even in infantry formations, and extensive use is made of force-multipliers such as electronic and cybernetic warfare units. The Guard is a mobile force, backed up by the more or less static Confederation Militia.

The name 'militia' implies an irregular or amateurish force to many outsiders but in Darrian parlance it simply refers to a territorial defence force. There are irregular units within the militia, some of them specialising in guerrilla warfare or other asymmetric tactics, but the main defensive forces are composed of regulars plus a well-trained corps of reservists. Militia combat forces are mostly infantry-based, typically using wheeled vehicles for mobility or to carry support weapons.

All static aerospace defence installations belong to the militia, although they tend to be crewed by full-time soldiers and technicians. A greater budget percentage is spent on these systems than in the Imperium, where mobile forces are favoured. Darrian aerospace defence, like all aspects of their military operations, is based on meticulous planning and endless simulations. Some minor worlds have received quite powerful defences based on predictions of the planning staff.

Within the Darrian armed forces is a large contingent drawn from the Aslan population. Some of these personnel join regular army units but most prefer to serve in all-Aslan formations. These are more loosely organised than their Darrian counterparts and generally optimised for infantry-based assaults or small-unit raiding operations. A highly effective partnership has evolved between Darrian support units and Aslan combat formations. A few Aslan serve in the naval forces but most prefer ground combat.

Light divisions are one of the standard Darrian combat formations, differing from Imperial forces mainly in that they have more armoured vehicles and less personnel, making them smaller in overall size. Rather than infantry- heavy formations, Darrian forces use 'grav-cavalry', incorporating grav armoured vehicles into infantry formations. Firepower is high but resilience suffers due to the emphasis on hardware rather than numbers.

Darrian forces favour multi-capability support formations rather than specialist units. Communications, electronic warfare and intelligence services are combined into Informational Support units, which are as a result larger than their equivalents elsewhere – but not by much. Integration improves efficiency but increases the chance a formation will be disrupted by a well-placed strike. Likewise, support workshops for vehicles are contained in the same Battlefield Support formations as medical facilities. These are maintained at divisional and, on a smaller scale, brigade levels.

The Sword Worlds Confederation is firmly allied to the Zhodani Consulate, although idealistically both are very different. Sword Worlders make no secret of the fact that this is an alliance of convenience and the Consulate is quite happy with the arrangement. Indeed, the forthright declaration is rather refreshing given how convoluted politics can be elsewhere. 'The enemy of my enemy is not my friend but he is a useful co-belligerent' sums up the situation between the two major members of the Outworld Coalition.

Sword Worlds society is heavily militarised but vessels and military equipment of the Confederation are qualitatively inferior to that of its opponents. Ships are produced at TL12 and typically only capable of jump-

2. This limits strategic mobility but the majority of the Sword Worlds fleet is expected to operate on relatively short lines of communication or in a small theatre of war.

The Confederation hopes to gain territory from the war and to weaken its potential enemies. To this end it intends to launch attacks into the Vilis and Lanth subsectors and against the traditional enemy, the Darrians. Placing pressure on the Imperials at Lanth furthers both Sword Worlds and Zhodani strategy as it will distract forces from operations elsewhere. Further distraction will be caused by raiding forces, which will be sent into Lunion for the most part.

Sword Worlds commanders particularly want to remove the Imperial enclave on their rimward frontier, capturing Gunn, Caladbolg and Caliburn. Other war aims are the capture of Margesi and Torment. The latter is not of any great value but owning all of the Entropic Worlds would be of great political significance. Other territories might be seized for use as bargaining chips.

## SWORD WORLDS FORCES

The Sword Worlds Confederation uses a fleet structure intended to be both flexible and confusing to outsiders. Vessels and squadrons are passed from one fleet to another, sometimes weakening a formation to the point where it cannot carry out its primary mission. This force will then attempt to deceive the enemy into thinking it is still at combat strength, concealing the fact that another force has been greatly augmented and is ready to engage in an attack. However, this process does not always follow strategic logic. In addition to the vessels of the Sword Worlds Confederation Navy, individual member worlds also contribute to the fleets. These ships come under navy command but can be withdrawn if the owner deems it necessary. There is always some bargaining to be done every time a fleet commander wants to launch an operation or is ordered to send some of his force to another fleet.

Squadrons are designated for their primary capability, which may be supplied by a single vessel or a group of them. A squadron of five high-quality destroyers supported by an old cruiser might be designated a destroyer force, whilst a battlecruiser and its supports would be a battlecruiser squadron. 'Squadron' in this context refers to a formally constituted formation rather than any particular level of strength. Whereas other powers standardise squadrons and fleets to a greater or lesser extent, the Confederation prefers to use a flexible system in order to confuse the enemy and tailor forces to the task at hand.

Capital ships are designed with either defence or offence in mind and designated according to mission rather than size. First class battleships are capable of jump-2 and are designed to take the fight to the enemy, whereas second class battleships have only jump-1 capability. This enables them to redeploy between systems under their own power whilst using more of their tonnage for weapons and defensive systems. These vessels are normally considered defensive assets but that does not preclude a short-range offensive. Capital ships vary considerably in size and power and each is a source of pride to its owning world and the Confederation as a whole.

# BELLIGERENT POWERS: CONFEDERATION BELLIGERENT POWERS: THE SWORD WORLDS CONFEDERATION

Whilst the capital ships are revered throughout the Confederation, the most prestigious Sword Worlds warships are not the largest or the most powerful. Few other navies use battlecruisers but to the Sword Worlds they epitomise the ability to strike hard and fast. Battlecruisers are built on a 'super-cruiser' model rather than a 'cut-down battleship' concept. They are built for speed and high jump capability, and in theory can outrun what they cannot outfight. In practice, battlecruisers tend to take heavy damage in any engagement against serious opposition.

Battlecruisers sometimes operate with the fleets but raiding operations are favoured. Operating solo or with supports, a battlecruiser can strike deep into enemy territory or cover the flanks of an advancing force. Although the battlecruiser force is credited with great exploits, it is more humble raiders that usually do the most damage. Sword Worlds merchant ships tend to be rugged and well-armed for their type, making them easy to convert into naval auxiliaries or raiders. Para-naval ships are sometimes built on the same hulls, enabling them to pose as a commercial ship whilst concealing significant firepower. Some of these vessels are light battle tenders, carrying small craft to the combat zone or to bolster local defences. Others are configured to undertake raiding cruises. The ability to pass as an innocent merchant of a common design can create a raider capable of longer cruises, more unexpected attacks and overall higher survivability than a traditional warship.

The Sword Worlds Confederation defines a warship over 100,000 tons as a capital ship and one under 10,000 tons as a small combatant – a class including frigates and destroyers. In between are the cruiser classes. Light cruisers are typically 20,000 tons in displacement and biased towards a strike role whereas heavy cruisers, at around 40,000 tons, generally favour a missile-heavy weapons fit. Some command cruisers are also built at 40,000 tons on the same hull as the heavy classes. The largest cruisers, at 80,000 tons, are termed battlecruisers and considered by many to be capital ships in all but name.

Most minor combatants are built either as patrol/escort designs or strike vessels, in which case armament tends to emphasise torpedoes and close-range, heavy- firepower weapons. Frigates tend to be built at 2,000 tons with the escort and patrol roles in mind. A balanced missile/beam armament is common, with emphasis on dealing with small craft and light combat vessels. Destroyers are normally 4,000 ton craft with a higher manoeuvre performance and armament optimised for the strike role. Torpedoes and short-range, high- firepower beam weapons such as plasma barbettes are favoured, enabling aggressively handled Sword Worlds destroyers to damage more powerful warships – albeit at a high cost. 8,000 ton heavy destroyers are built by some worlds of the Confederation and there are also destroyer-leader and destroyer support classes in service. The latter have a heavy missile armament for standoff engagements or attacks on ground targets.

The fleets of the Confederation are named for their home port and vary in composition according to mission. Defensive forces are assigned to local command areas which are static, whilst the fleets are intended for offensive or mobile-defensive operations as required. Fleets in a quiet area will transfer their assets to heavily engaged forces, sometimes retaining just enough ships to maintain the pretence of combat capability.

#### TIZON FLEET

The Tizon Fleet is the largest of the peacetime Confederation fleets, tasked with offensive operations into the Entropic Worlds or the trailing-coreward end of Darrian space if necessary, and with halting major incursions from that direction. At the outset of the Fifth Frontier War the fleet is tasked with inflicting early and sudden reverses on Darrian forces. To this end it will drive in force through Cunnonic and Trifuge in the direction of Jacent. The jump-2 component of the force will advance rapidly, striking at targets on the way but not trying to hold territory. The jump-1 component will follow, along with transports for ground forces.

The overall intent is to stun the Darrians and establish control over the worlds out as far as Jacent. Mobile elements may fall back to make junction with the defensive component of the fleet, either to seek a decisive engagement or to draw enemy forces onto the guns of the whole fleet. Raiding operations will be launched against targets that present themselves, whilst a detachment will take possession of Torment. After this, the Tizon fleet expects to remain on the defensive for the foreseeable future.

## SWORD WORLDS NAVAL ORDER OF BATTLE

#### JOYEUSE FLEET

The Joyeuse Fleet is tasked with offensive operations to coreward, against Imperial targets in the Vilis subsector. At the outbreak of war, elements of the fleet are to clear the Margesi system of opposition, which is expected to be light. The world will then be taken by ground forces.

Cover for this operation is provided by an attack on Vilis, followed by raiding throughout the local cluster. Assigned forces are relatively small; insufficient to deal with a major counterattack from Frenzie. If such a response materialises the Joyeuse Fleet is to skirmish and tie down as many enemy vessels as possible.

#### GRAM FLEET

In peacetime the Gram Fleet is one of two strategic reserve formations. Most of its strength has been transferred to the Dyrnwyn Fleet, retaining a small battle force to counter incursions onto the Gram Arm plus some light forces deployed forward at Gungnir to monitor the systems to coreward. The strength of the Gram Fleet will likely be rebuilt over time, enabling it to conduct offensive operations or send detachments to other formations.

#### SACNOTH FLEET

The Sacnoth Fleet is the second strategic reserve formation. Similarly to the Gram Fleet, its primary peacetime function is to serve as a reserve pool of forces to be reassigned at need. The Sacnoth and Gram fleets are capable of operating en masse however. Whereas the Gram Fleet has been drawn down to reinforce the Dyrnwyn Fleet, the Sacnoth Fleet has been deployed as a single unit.

At the outbreak of war, the Sacnoth Fleet is to strike at Caladbolg, clearing Imperial forces from nearby systems. Light forces can then be stationed in the region to impede Imperial communications and attempts made to capture these worlds. The Sacnoth Fleet will then strike towards Flammarion before returning to reserve status. Redeployment coreward is likely once the rimward flank is cleared.

#### NARSIL FLEET

The Narsil Fleet is tasked with launching raids into Darrian space to spinward and monitoring Imperial forces at Flammarion. Its few heavy units are to maintain a defensive posture whilst lighter forces cause as much chaos as possible.

#### DYRNWYN FLEET

The Dyrnwyn Fleet has been considerably reinforced, largely from the Gram Fleet. Its mission is to drive through Arba and Tavonni with the intent of crippling the Imperial naval bases at Lanth and D'Ganzio. The initial attack will fall on Lanth and will be followed by a ground force to capture the world. After this phase of the mission, the fleet may push on to Ghandi or pivot on Dyrnwyn to threaten Lunion.

#### STING FLEET

The Sting Fleet is tasked with the defence of the trailing end of the subsector by adopting a defensive posture and countering enemy incursions. Deception operations are intended to convince the Imperials there is a threat to Adabicci and its naval base. This will require frequent reconnaissance raids in the surrounding systems, to be carried out by a minimum of vessels changing their identities to conceal their numbers.

#### BITER FLEET

The Biter Fleet is assigned to harass and disrupt Imperial operations in Lunion and District 268 with raids, which are to be carried out by relatively light vessels.

#### ADDITIONAL FORCES

The Sword Worlds Confederation can call upon a great many private starship operators to provide auxiliaries, transports and even raiders. Merchant ships are typically built tough, with a decent armament, and concealed among them are merchant-hull raiders and gunboat carriers which bear a close resemblance to civilian vessels. These ships may be sent into Imperial space to raid directly, or positioned in remote systems to replenish warships carrying out 'cruiser warfare'.

These assets cannot take on major warships but by a combination of stealth and guile they can wreak havoc on the spacelanes. A force of Imperial-design ships is also available which is intended to be inserted into civilian traffic. Some of these vessels are already active, quite far from the boundaries of the Confederation, at the outbreak of war. They are intended mainly as intelligence-gathering assets, guiding raiders without becoming involved themselves, but some have sufficient armament to make an occasional attack. Captains must weigh the importance of good information against the chance for glory; taking out a subsidised merchant will not achieve much but reporting on a concentration of enemy support vessels or the escort strengths of convoys will enable someone else to strike a telling blow.

Most ground forces fielded by the Sword Worlds Confederation are provided by member worlds rather than being raised by the Confederation as a whole. Ground forces use a three-tier system, with high-end formations equipped with grav transport and regular forces using wheeled vehicles for the most part. The third tier is made up of irregular and ad-hoc formations generally referred to as 'volunteer units'. Equipment at this level varies considerably.

Organisation is conventional in most ways but operates on the assumption that units will be heavily damaged in any confrontation with a technologically superior enemy. A 'battlegroup' system is therefore in place, whereby a damaged formation can be broken down into smaller battlegroups and remain at least somewhat combat- effective. Officers at all levels are trained to scrape together whatever forces they have available and make use of them, and this is routinely done even when heavy losses have not been taken. A neatly organised lift infantry brigade might arrive in the theatre of war but very quickly its elements will be mixed up with whatever other forces are available in a bewildering array of task-oriented battlegroups. The system is flexible and resilient but also a logistical nightmare.

A 'hit, scatter, regroup' philosophy pervades most design and doctrine within the Sword Worlds military. Artillery formations are designed to deliver maximum firepower in as short a time as possible; grav cavalry forces emphasise the capability of a single tank to survive a counterattack and continue causing mayhem. Some Imperial observers have misconstrued this as a brute-force approach to warfare but it is almost entirely the opposite.

A force might well be smashed in the first minutes of an engagement but it will already have caused a lot of damage. As larger formations are pounded, they break up into sub-units that continue to fight with aggression and intelligence. Military personnel are warriors as well as soldiers, trained to make intelligent decisions and carry out bold actions even when their comms are down and there is nothing resembling order to the fight. Indeed, it is in this sort of chaotic scramble that the Sword Worlds military excels. Sword Worlds military history abounds with heroic last stands, incredible rampages by lone tanks and death-rides by naval ships that left enemies dismayed and disheartened.

The majority of ground force personnel are trained and equipped as light infantry, with 'light' in this case referring to a lack of transport and the weapons that require it. Light infantry units are paired up with transport assets to create mechanised, motorised or lift infantry formations. Some units are raised as dedicated grav cavalry or lift infantry but most are put together on a temporary basis from light infantry and transport or support units as needed.

In addition to the regular army, the Confederation can field a force of naval infantry not dissimilar to the Zhodani Special Naval Landing Force. Naval infantry are trained for shipboard combat and assaults upon orbital installations. Protocols exist for a naval infantry force to 'borrow' army assets and the converse sometimes occurs when circumstances merit it.

Jaeger formations are also common, irregular units of volunteers with a reputation for excellent marksmanship. In wartime, tradition requires that every member of a Jaeger unit immediately offers themselves for voluntary service without asking for pay. In practice, those taken into service are highly valued as scouts and marksmen, and given a temporary pay grade at least equivalent to a qualified infantry soldier.

Militias also exist in most communities. Some are more organised and may have access to heavy weapons supplied by the state or local notables. Few militias qualify as Jaegers but most are capable of putting up a stubborn defensive fight. Occasionally a militia unit will be co-opted into a regular army unit, although it will generally serve intact rather than being assigned to battlegroups since its members lack the training to be effective in this role.

## SWORD WORLDS GROUND FORCES

Whilst Sword Worlds units typically begin a campaign organised as divisions and brigades, forces in contact with the enemy tend to be using a battlegroup structure. The example force presented here is just one of many possible configurations, being a brigade- sized battlegroup pulled together from whatever troops are available. Galanglic names for units have been used here rather than the Sword Worlds equivalent, for clarity.

This force is designated as a motorised infantry unit with infantry as its primary fighting unit and it can move as efficiently as a totally motorised formation. Some elements are grav-mobile and some are mechanised-mobile but the force as a whole is not. The headquarters element is grav-mobile, as are the two grav cavalry elements. One of these is built out of fresh and formally organised elements – a light grav tank company and a grav-mobile infantry company. The other is built around a grav-mobile infantry unit backed up with whatever grav-mobile combat vehicles could be found. These are grouped as a composite battlegroup with a scratch lift infantry unit cobbled together from various units. Its mobility element is a mix of armoured personnel carriers and repurposed logistics and reconnaissance platforms with little protection.

The mechanised component of the force uses tracked vehicles and is a properly constituted mechanised infantry battalion. The remainder of the force uses mostly wheeled vehicles with some track- layers mixed in. This includes the support element, which is a mix of whatever is available. Overall, this force is potent but has serious mobility restrictions. It can put the equivalent of three battalions in the field, with slight artillery support and some light armour. Using grav-mobile artillery pieces in the direct-fire role exposes them to grave risk and the commander might at some point consider moving them to the support group. However, firepower is firepower and mobility is mobility. The artillery crews will have to fill in for tanks until more are assigned.

Units designated as 'composite' are likely to have been formed from remnants and minor reinforcements, and have a variety of equipment. This may include non- military vehicles in some cases. 'Provisional' units have been formed to parallel their regular equivalents and are more formally organised. For example, a composite infantry company might be built around a couple of understrength infantry platoons and brought up to a reasonable semblance of fighting strength with groups of militia, naval infantry, vehicle and artillery crews who have lost their heavy equipment, or rear- echelon personnel 'combed out' of support units. Given time to shake down and a reallocation of equipment, this force might be upgraded to 'provisional', indicating it is able to function in a similar manner to a properly organised force of the same type.

It is easy to think of the Fifth Frontier War as a straight confrontation between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, but this is a rather simplistic viewpoint. Even expanding the focus to consider the conflict as pitting the Outworld Coalition against the Imperium and its allies creates a misleadingly black and white image. In reality, there are multiple factions within each 'side' and others who see the situation as an opportunity to further their own plans.

#### FACTIONS WITHIN THE IMPERIUM

The Imperium is not a monolithic political entity. It is a huge collection of economic, political and cultural groups overlaid with a framework of interstellar agreements. Not all member worlds or groups are content and there are many who consider their own agenda to be more important than the well-being of the Imperium as a whole. In addition, there are external factors which cannot be ignored.

The Imperium has two 'hostilities likely' frontiers, at opposite ends of its territory. In addition to the Zhodani Consulate, the Solomani Confederation is a powerful potential enemy which has openly stated its intention to reclaim Terra and other territory lost in the Solomani Rim War. Weakening the forces on this frontier is not an option as it risks the Solomani attempting to take advantage of the situation. This is not just one sector fleet tied down; it also reduces the forces that can be spared from the neighbouring fleets and the regional fleet reserve. A war on the Zhodani frontier would have to be truly desperate to justify sending forces from the Solomani Front all the way round 'the Claw'.

The Imperium also faces the Aslan to spinward and the K'kree and Hivers to trailing, plus various Vargr states and the Julian Protectorate to coreward. These threats are less imminent or less severe than the Solomani and Zhodani states, but these regions cannot be left unguarded. Nor can internal security be completely ignored. Sector fleets can be drawn down to provide forces for use elsewhere but the possibility of revolt or deep incursions means that at least some battle forces must be held back.

# FACTIONS AND MINOR POWERS

Each potential theatre of war has its own 'more ships' advocates and decisions about deployments are not always made on purely military grounds. Concessions regarding warship deployments may have to be granted to an influential noble from the Ilelish sector despite there being relatively little threat there, in order to secure support for an initiative of a non-military nature elsewhere. All of this balancing and juggling means that resources will always be limited and assistance for a threatened area might be hindered by someone else's agenda.

Within the Spinward Marches there are multiple powerful factions and an overall lack of centralised leadership. There is no Archduke to decide what is best for the whole Domain or arbitrate disputes. Indeed, there is no Sector Duke in the Spinward Marches sector. This complicates political direction and may result in a confused and ineffectual response to the crisis. The complex and vigorous internal politics of Deneb is particularly notorious and subsector dukes have tried to use the navy against their rivals, unsuccessfully of course. This would constitute civil war, which the navy does not approve of. However, local dukes are quite willing to oppose strategically important movements in order to advance their own internal political aims.

This means that when a request for immediate assistance reaches the Deneb Sector Fleet, it will be followed by a wave of demands and suggestions from local nobles wanting assurances that the frontiers near them will not be weakened, or that their area of interest will be properly secured, or that fleet elements protecting one of their rivals be the ones to leave their usual station. Some of these concerns are genuine; there is a high chance of Vargr raiding into Deneb and a lower but still significant chance that the Zhodani Consulate will hook forces through the Vargr Extents to attack the sector. Alternatively, if too much of the navy is drawn off, an ambitious sector duke might decide to use their own forces to attack a neighbour.

These factors complicate not only the provision of reinforcements from the Deneb Sector Fleet but also forces moving up from the Corridor Fleet Reserve. These will face requests to shortstop some of the reinforcements to replace vessels sent spinward or bolster a region against a possible Zhodani or massed Vargr attack. If such an attack has actually happened, these calls will be louder and more strident. Vessels from the Fleet Reserve do not answer to the Deneb nobility, at least not directly. However, influence might be brought to bear on squadron commanders. It may prove necessary to detach some vessels in order to appease a local duke who will otherwise cause endless minor problems for the force trying to reach the combat zone. Long experience has shown that the security of a relatively distant sector is a minor concern to some nobles and that some will find ways to impede operations unless granted concessions. Truly blatant actions would be considered treason but the Imperium cannot afford to waste effort correcting difficult nobles during a major war.

Duchess Delphine is a proven leader with a good track record and enjoys the vocal support of her second cousin, once removed, Duke Luis Adorania Jesten of Lunion. Together they make a strong case for strengthening the defence of Lunion and Mora against an attack from (or through) the Sword Worlds Confederation. Duchess Delphine opposes the creation of a full naval Depot at Macene, instead putting forward the Mora system as home port for the sector fleet, and has offered to expand the Mora naval base at her own expense. This would be a departure from the usual practice of using an asteroid belt as the Depot and would place the commanding officers of the fleet within summons reach of a very opinionated political leader.

Whilst wrangling with the navy about bases, Duchess Delphine also pushes hard for the deployment of more warships to Mora and Lunion. Her usual argument is that Mora is the economic and political heart of the sector. Damage to its economy hurts everyone and if Mora were to fall the sector would be lost. There is some merit in this, although the argument is skewed to the Mora Foremost agenda. One outcome of this endless pushing is a set of standing deployments from the sector fleet in Mora and Lunion, including some of the finest cruisers and dreadnoughts in the fleet. Of course, since the ships are deployed there, would it not be better to permanently base them out of Mora? So says Mora Foremost.

The Mora Foremost faction is sufficiently powerful as to draw naval officers into its orbit. Patronage is commonplace but Mora Foremost has more senior officers on its side than any other faction, and has used this to its advantage for many years. Its last major action pre-war was to lobby for the movement of large numbers of battle riders from the worlds around Jewell to worlds deeper in the sector, allegedly enhancing security for these systems and not coincidentally increasing Duchess Delphine's popularity there. This move ended in a token redeployment rather than the massed move the faction had envisaged. Had it been implemented, the initial course of the war would have been quite different.

Overall, Mora Foremost has put internal politics far ahead of the need to defend the Imperium for many years and has damaged the strategic situation. The Zhodani threat has been downplayed to the point where it was all but discounted. Duchess Delphine and her supporters will soon be aware of their mistake but admitting the error would be politically damaging. As a

MORA FOREMOST Headed by Duchess Delphine Adorania Muudashir, Duchess of Mora, the Mora Foremost faction is the most powerful political group within the Spinward Marches and is highly influential in Deneb. Its basic tenet is that Duchess Delphine is the rightful sector duke of the Spinward Marches and a solid candidate for Archduke of the Domain of Deneb. The faction has considerable support all across the sector but particularly in the region around Mora and Lunion. This is largely due to the success of Duchess Delphine in creating a strong and stable economy with considerable opportunity even for those with modest resources. result, Mora Foremost will continue to push the same agenda and hope the events of the war can be spun to make them look foresighted and wise. To this end, Duchess Delphine favours naval commanders who claim they can stop the Zhodani cold and will back them against those who consider it necessary to trade star systems for time to bring up reinforcements.

SECTOR DUKE NORRIS Duke Norris of Regina is the main political opponent for Duchess Delphine of Mora. He has gathered a considerable following, particularly among the nobility of the Jewell Salient and is popular with a segment of the navy. However, his faction is not as powerful as Mora Foremost. Norris maintains a poise of reasonableness and not directly opposing Mora Foremost but behind the scenes his leadership quietly works against the policies of Duchess Delphine.

Norris' faction is not as open or as blatant in its use of patronage as Mora Foremost but there are only certain ways to get things done in the Imperium. The faction is not formally organised as such but there are levels of membership. At the top are those who owe allegiance to Duke Norris himself or who have openly or personally pledged their support – and whom he trusts to honour the promise. These include a few naval officers and an assortment of nobles and businesspersons, plus a surprising amount of academics. The latter wield little or no political power but influence society in other ways.

Beneath the upper echelon of 'loyals' are the 'reliables' - those whose interests obviously align with the policies of Duke Norris or who have economic or strategic reasons to side with him in an internal conflict. They may have to be reminded of where their interests lie but can be expected to align themselves with Duke Norris in most matters. Below them are an assortment of groups that generally agree with Norris' policies but might have to be persuaded or induced to assist.

Duke Norris has for several years now pushed the idea that renewed hostilities with the Zhodani Consulate are overdue and that the primary target will be the region around Macene and Rhylanor. This makes strategic sense; Macene is the Imperial naval depot for the sector and Rhylanor is the nearest subsector capital to it. If this region were to fall, the spinward and coreward parts of the Spinward Main would be lost and Mora threatened. He routinely reminds Duchess Delphine that Mora is best defended in the Jewell subsector. She dismisses this as selfish; Norris' own duchy of Regina would benefit disproportionally from a return to a crust strategy centred upon it. This is not quite what Norris' faction is saying but misrepresenting someone else's agenda is a strategy as old as politics.

IMPERIAL HAWKS There is no recognised, unified 'hawk faction'. There are, however, many who hold 'hawkish' – pro-war - viewpoints throughout the region. Many of these genuinely believe that war with the Zhodani Consulate is inevitable and that striking first and hard is the best option. Others are more moderate but feel greater defences are necessary along with a more robust policy of deterrence and bargaining from a position of strength. There are also those who have no strategic reason for wanting more warships in the region but who hope to benefit politically or economically.

There are numerous Hawks among the nobility throughout the Spinward Marches and within the Imperial Navy as well. Most are reasonable and moderate, with solid reasons – although not necessarily pleasant ones – for their viewpoint. A few are hotheads who angrily push for conflict and act in an inflammatory manner. Their conduct is kept within limits by superiors and peers who do not want them triggering a war but it is an open secret that agents of the most rabid Hawks are agitating along the frontiers. Some may be willing to undertake covert military operations such as false- flag attacks and they are not always the most vocal; those who truly want war work quietly to cause one whilst others just shout about it.

One of the most hawkish groups in the sector is the Forward The Imperium! movement. This is relatively small but noisy and much more organised than most of the Hawks. Forward The Imperium! demands a 'rationalisation' of the Imperial borders to link up the Five Sisters and clear a direct route to Darrian space. Moderate members of this sub-faction want a campaign to annex District 268. It is notable that they already refer to it as the Plankwell subsector, named for the controversial Grand Admiral Plankwell who defeated the Outworld Coalition but also initiated the Imperial Civil War.

The less moderate members of this movement go further, calling for a pre-emptive invasion of the Sword Worlds Confederation and annexation of its worlds. In addition to the obvious threat of raiders from the Sword Worlds, this group advocates the benefit of 'free trade along the occupied section of the Spinward Main'. This is nonsense, of course. The Spinward Main is not 'occupied' in this region, its worlds are the sovereign territory of their populations. Minor details like this do not intrude into the fiery rhetoric of Forward The Imperium! adherents.

There are Hawks everywhere but Forward The Imperium! is strongest in the region around Glisten and, curiously, some worlds near Rhylanor. Its noisiest proponent is Viscount Iim Davide Urast, whose fiefdom is on New Rome in the Glisten subsector. New Rome hosts frequent 'defence' conferences which favour speakers proclaiming the need for more warships and a plan to drive the frontiers out another couple of subsectors. Unsurprisingly, these conferences attract representatives from arms companies operating in what is sometimes described as the less classy end of the market, whilst the big players like Instellarms stay away.

IMPERIAL DOVES

As with the Hawks, there are Doves – who are pro- peace – everywhere. Few are the hand-wringing peaceniks they are depicted as by their political opponents and many are dedicated military or naval personnel who would fight hard if they had to. What the Doves have in common is a preference for peace, which most believe can be achieved through dialogue and trade combined with sufficient naval strength to deter an attack. A small percentage advocate disarmament and 'not giving offence' as a way of achieving lasting peace, despite centuries of history demonstrating otherwise.

'Dove' advocates suggest reallocating military spending to purely defensive projects, such as strengthening the in-system defence forces of worlds along the border, along with setting up cross-border trade centres where cultural and social interactions can take place alongside commerce. Some border world governments are strongly behind these moves. Their motivations include a desire not to be battlegrounds and the hope of heavy investment. Support can be found everywhere but there are 'Dove heartlands' around Trin and in parts of the Rhylanor and Lanth subsectors. Here, the main force for peace is economic.

INE GIVAR

Today, the Ine Givar movement is widely known as a terrorist organisation. The term 'terrorist' is often misused to malign any insurgent or dissident group the authorities disapprove of but in this case the label is apt. The Ine Givar, as a whole, is willing to use small and large-scale atrocities to create political influence.

This was not always the case; in its beginnings the movement was dedicated to opposing social injustice by peaceful means. It was gradually hijacked by radicals, to the point where the more moderate members began to distance themselves from Ine Givar activities.

Like many such groups, the Ine Givar was formed from various like-minded movements, all of which were opposed to the Imperial system. Concentration of wealth and power in a small class of nobles and megacorporations is seen as a major injustice by most members. Initial activities were peaceful apart from the actions of a few hotheads. Protests, petitions, boycotts of some companies and their products, and constant condemnation of social injustice were the original tools and in some cases the Ine Givar were surprisingly effective.

Few now remember the work of the Ine Givar in attacking injustice; the idea of this movement preaching peace and tolerance – and actually meaning it – seems laughable now. However, it did happen. The very public work of volunteers shamed governments into helping the worst-off in their society. People came to adulthood who might have died as children but for free clinics run by Ine Givar personnel and went on to successful careers thanks to their basic education and guidance package. There are those who look for a sinister agenda in those early days but there is no evidence of one. It may be that for the first years of its existence the Ine Givar movement was a real force for good.

Exactly what happened is a mystery but over time the protests got noisier and developed into riots, then outright insurgencies. Eventually some members crossed the line into using terrorist attacks - as opposed to strikes on military targets – and the character of the organisation began to change. It attracted troublemakers who just wanted an excuse to hurt someone along with those who wanted to lash out at a society they felt had wronged them.

The Ine Givar never stopped proclaiming its goal as being the peaceful advocacy of greater democracy and social equality but most of the members who are true to this ideal have dissociated themselves from the Ine Givar. What is left is a rather nasty insurgency movement dedicated to bringing about the collapse of the Third Imperium by any means necessary. The Ine Givar quietly sponsors and feeds weaponry to groups that would not choose to be associated if they knew where the support was coming from – anyone with a grievance against the Imperium will be supported whether openly or covertly.

Most Ine Givar chapters believe that the ends justify the means and are willing to engage in terrorism but some seem to relish it more than others. The majority of actions are still 'clean', taking the form of insurgency against military targets rather than terrorist attacks on civilians. Other means are also routinely used; industrial disruption from strikes or slowdowns, bribery, coercion and extortion. This is a factor that makes the Ine Givar more dangerous than most insurgent organisations – it is adept at many forms of attack against the fabric of the Imperium.

It has been suggested that the Ine Givar is a front for Zhodani activities in the Imperium. This is not true, as such, but some chapters of the Ine Givar are now run by Zhodani infiltrators. Others are heavily influenced but do not know it, having become dependent on reliable suppliers of arms and information they do not know are Zhodani agents. Whilst not knowingly serving the Consulate, the Ine Givar movement is certainly doing its bidding, at least some of the time.

Ine Givar methods vary according to the personnel and resources available. In some areas nothing is possible beyond some datanet rabble-rousing and cautious recruitment. The movement uses a 'cell' organisation for its civilian operations, limiting contact between cells to designated individuals. A cell will typically have four to six members and be assigned a function. The most useful recruits are put to work gathering information and planning operations, whilst those inclined to go off at half-cock or act like blunt instruments are assigned to
'active operations' cells and given little information.

The aim of 'civilian' operations is to gain strength and identify targets whilst stirring up dissent and internal division. Once there are sufficient resources this will escalate into minor acts of terrorism or – preferably – inciting those not involved with the Ine Givar to attack one another. 'Special' cells do the same on a much grander scale, moving from one world to the next in order to undertake headline-grabbing actions.

The Ine Givar has a military arm, which is capable of fielding significant forces on a few worlds. More commonly it provides arms and advisors, fuelling local insurgencies which may or may not be openly associated with the movement. There are also support facilities where insurgents and terrorists are trained and where weapons are stored or made. These may include biochemical weaponry or other weapons of mass destruction.

Overall, the Ine Givar is anti-Imperial rather than pro- Zhodani but its willingness to take assistance wherever it is offered has allowed elements of the movement to be co-opted into serving Zhodani aims. It is likely that the organisation would oppose a Zhodani regime as bitterly as it does the Imperium; a fact not lost on the Consulate's intelligence services. This makes it probable that Ine Givar operatives are being tracked by the Zhodani and will be redeployed into Imperial space from overrun worlds or else will quietly disappear.

THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW RIALFFI

Rialffi Amdur does not exist and never did. He is a fictional character created by an otherwise nameless criminal organisation-of-organisations. It is not clear how many worlds have an enclave of People Who Know Rialffi but it is known that their character varies considerably. Some groups are street thugs, some white- collar embezzlers. They are all tied into an interstellar network of cooperation for mutual profit, or perhaps service to some over-arching criminal group. Some are frightened when a courier arrives; others eager to see what new opportunity has been placed before them.

It appears that these diverse and widely separated crime groups are connected by servitude to or friendship with the mythical Rialffi. Couriers who state they know Rialffi are not instantly trusted, of course, but the phrase invites opportunity to discreetly demonstrate allegiance. It is not known how this is done; perhaps some token or knowledge must be displayed. However it is done, the courier's bona fides are established in some manner which grants the right to make requests or give orders. There is presumably a hierarchy and some means to punish those who are supposed to obey and who do not.

The status of a courier appears to depend on who sent them. Some groups are subservient to others, and some are elevated above all. It is possible the organisation, if that is the right word for it, is not a pyramid structure so much as a flat-topped ziggurat, with member groups at different levels answering to a consortium at the top. If there is an overall leader it is not clear who or where they are.

If People Who Know Rialffi have an agenda beyond making money, it is not clear what it is. Associated groups will engage in anything from street robbery to mass murder, smuggling to assassination, although each group has an area of interest and expertise. It is said that some Imperial nobles are in the pocket of Rialffi, or that certain nobles created the organisation for their own advancement. Most of this is speculation and anyone who openly claims they know Rialffi is likely to be silenced before the authorities can interrogate them.

For those who know where to look, the People Who Know Rialffi are a useful conduit through which to obtain weaponry, illicit items and information. They can carry out assassinations, obtain secrets to be used for extortion or move people discreetly between worlds. Misunderstandings are possible, for example if someone not familiar with the local groups turns up and wants 10,000 military rifles delivered to an insurgent group a parsec over, only to find the locals are just a handful of street thugs. The inner leadership know who is capable of what, but not everyone else does.

## FACTIONS WITHIN THE ZHODANI CONSULATE

Zhodani society seems, to an outsider at least, to be almost unnaturally unified behind the actions of its leaders. This is not exactly the case, however. Many citizens have differing opinions on what the leadership is or should be doing and indeed many of the leaders disagree. Open dissent and protests are extremely uncommon but there is in fact a great deal of debate. It is considered socially unacceptable to hold such debates in the presence of outsiders and if asked most citizens will ignore the question or make a formulaic response along the lines of 'we have faith in our leaders to come to the correct decision'.

Differences of opinion among proles are largely irrelevant, unless some issue becomes so serious that the placid veneer of Zhodani society is cracked. Allowing this to happen would be a great disgrace for the local nobles. In fact, the nobility tend to be clearly aware of the mood of their people and will shape policies with their opinions in mind. Sometimes the needs of the Consulate over-ride the desires of a local population but the nobility are well aware of what will be approved of, what the population can be persuaded to expect and what will cause dissent. One reason the Consulate is normally so placid is that the wishes of the people are taken into account far more often than in the Imperium. Anti-Zhodani observers claim the people are brainwashed into going along with what the leaders want, whilst those with a pro- Zhodani viewpoint suggest the people are listened to and led rather than dictated to.

All the same, some of the factions within Zhodani society have radically different viewpoints and high- ranking members who will push for policies suiting their agenda. Factions tend not to have clearly delineated territories, although some agendas are more popular in certain areas than others.

### ANTI-IMPERIALS


The Anti-Imperial faction is motivated by a desire to weaken or destroy the Third Imperium, motivated by perceived military and social threats. Peaceful co-existence is not possible, according to this faction, as the Imperials will sooner or later try to conquer their rivals. In the meantime, and perhaps more worryingly, Imperial culture seeps across the border and infects local populations.

Zhodani people are extremely honest and trustworthy, on the whole. Doors are locked for safety rather than security, if at all, and anyone in distress can expect a response from passers-by. Imperial culture seems strange and alien to the Zhodani, riddled with crime and deceit. In particular, Imperials are seen as selfish and therefore untrustworthy even when they are not fiddling about with the truth for their own ends. This corruption must be kept out of the Consulate, by force if necessary.

The Anti-Imperial faction has been active for many years, infiltrating and destabilising Imperial worlds. It has had particular success with some elements of the Ine Givar movement, which for the most part does not know or care if it is being manipulated for Zhodani ends. An Anti-Imperial faction has been the driving force behind all of the Frontier Wars.

### COLONIALISTS


The Colonialist faction opposes the long-established policy of limiting the size of the Consulate. It would prefer more of the navy budget to be spent on surveying uninhabited worlds and launching well-supported colony expeditions. Such an endeavour would bear fruit in just a few generations if investment were sufficiently high, adding new productive worlds to the Consulate. The Colonialists, for the most part, do not oppose the war. They have accepted that removing the Imperial threat is necessary, although their support comes with requests for a post-war colony programme which might make use of warships too disabled to be returned to service.

### CONSERVATIVES


The Conservative faction wishes to preserve the status quo, opposing any colonial expansion. Its members are split in their opinions about the current conflict. Some believe it is necessary in order for things to continue as they should, whilst others are adamant that the Imperials can simply be blocked at the borders and ignored. The fact that the Consulate has always struck first lends some credence to the idea that the Imperials might not want conflict either.

### DESTINARIANS


The Destinarian faction is less concerned with politics and wars than with the overall destiny of the Zhodani people. They push for greater experimentation in the realms of psionics and metaphysics as well as the social sciences, and at times have suggested some truly bizarre possibilities such as the existence of reachable alternate universes. War with the Imperium is a triviality, a distraction from the important business at hand. However, if the Imperials prove to be a threat to the destiny of the Zhodani they must be swept aside.

The flagship project of the Destinarian faction is the Core Expeditions. Each one of these mammoth undertakings has pushed closer to the galactic core, making discoveries which have largely been kept secret. Destinarians also advocate a colonisation programme along the path of the Core Expeditions. It would be expected they consider the deployment of hundreds of warships against the Imperium a waste of resources that could be used for this purpose but many staunch Destinarians have declined to oppose the war or have even put their support behind it.

### EXPANSIONISTS


The Expansionist faction wants to expand psionic society. This may be by way of new colonisation, spreading the Zhodani people, but also includes educating other intelligent species and helping them create a psionics-based culture like that of the Zhodani Consulate. Expansionist groups were highly active in the Imperium before 800, increasing awareness and acceptance of psionics within Imperial space. The Psionics Suppressions were in part a backlash against increased Zhodani influence rather than psionics themselves.

The Expansionist faction is firmly behind the conflict. Each captured world is a victory for its agenda – or will be, once the population have been properly educated. Driving the Imperium, with its staunch anti-psionics stance, back from the borders of the Consulate is also beneficial, although at some point the Expansionists will have to move into Imperial space to spread their message.

### PROGRESSIVES


The Progressive faction advocates wider psionic training, which would elevate more people into the intendant class leaving less non-psionic proles. This is largely due to concerns over falling numbers of people meeting the psionic standard to enter the noble class. These measures would create less stratified society but the movement may be more pragmatic than egalitarian. The Progressive faction has little direct concern about the current war, other than wishing to see a buffer zone created between Imperial and Consulate space. Likewise, the faction has little interest in colonisation or the Core Expeditions, preferring a self-contained society which could approach 95% psionic capable individuals in due course.

ZHDANJINZ IEPR

The Zhdanjinz Iepr is a dissenting Zhodani group whose name translates as 'Resistance From Within'. Its existence would come as a surprise to many Imperial citizens, who think the Consulate is filled with happily brainwashed drones. The reality is rather different. The Zhodani Consulate does use psionic 're-education' techniques and does indeed have psionic law enforcement agents who can determine guilt or even intent in the non-psionic segment of the population. However, there are far less of them than most Imperials imagine.

The chances of a criminal or serious dissenter being caught by the 'thought police' are actually quite low so long as they are cautious and do not attract a major investigation. Indeed, there are those who report the Tavrchedl', or 'Guardians of Our Morality' are overstretched and rushing from one major incident to another rather than quietly 'redirecting' every person who has a dissenting thought. Crime and dissent are rather low due to an effective programme of what Imperials might call non-psionic indoctrination and social guidance. Everyone is assessed at an early age to determine their aptitudes and guided towards useful and fulfilling roles. This creates a generally more contented populace than elsewhere, with the Tavrchedl' dealing with the outliers.

Unfortunately for the Consulate, there are more outliers than the Tavrchedl' has resources to deal with. Most are low-level malcontents or petty criminals who can be dealt with through normal means. There is, however, a semi-organised resistance movement which seeks to end what it calls 'psionic oppression of free thought'. Known as Zhdanjinz Iepr, this movement is in part an organisation and in part an ideology. The organised component is very loose to prevent psionic interrogation from identifying too many contacts in one go, whilst the ideology is widespread but generally followed on a personal basis.

Zhdanjinz Iepr covertly spreads information on ways of masking thoughts and passing as a typical contented citizen, along with warnings of Tavrchedl' operations in a given area. Active resistance to the Consulate is typically carried out by disaffected individuals pushed in the right direction by Zhdanjinz Iepr contacts or information packs, or by hardcore dissidents who have access to weaponry and psionic shielding equipment. The former are 'lone wolf' type activists who are considered expendable by the Zhdanjinz Iepr leadership. Their sacrifice is necessary and not in vain if they continue to strain the resources of the Tavrchedl' and distract attention away from the more organised groups.

Organised groups generally have access to personal or area psionic shielding and sufficient resources to pose a threat – at least locally. The threat may be second-hand, in the sense of guiding dissidents and presenting them with a plan and a weapon, but direct attacks are always an option if the opportunity presents itself. One favoured tactic is to give a motivated but information-deprived patsy a psionic shield device and a weapon, then incite them to attack a particular target. The security services know to scan for psionic shields and will take an interest in the patsy, distracting them from the unshielded operatives who are skilled at concealing their thoughts. A variant on this is to feed the patsy false information and allow them to get caught after or during an attack.

This is dirty work but members of Zhdanjinz Iepr feel they are on a crusade to save the minds and souls of their people. It is rumoured they have a cadre of psionic- capable individuals among them. These would normally be intendents and even nobles within the Consulate, suggesting that there is a segment even of the privileged upper classes which dislikes the way the Consulate operates... or perhaps they have some other agenda.

Naturally the Zhodani Consulate does not want its people to know there is a resistance movement, nor that resistance is possible. Actions of the Zhdanjinz Iepr are generally attributed to poorly adjusted criminals, sadly deranged people and enemy states sending their agents to cause trouble. Secrecy is sufficiently tight that many local officials are unaware of the existence of the movement, sometimes causing them to under-react to a serious situation.

## DARRIAN AND SWORD WORLDS FACTIONS

The Darrian Confederation has three main factions among its population and leadership, with the greatest movement between them of all the regional powers. Some elements of the population have entrenched viewpoints but most are willing to be swayed by a well- made argument. There has always been plenty of that, with frequent public pseudo-arguments between leaders or respected observers. Typically a set of comments by an advocate of one viewpoint will draw out an indirect response in the form of an interview or a documentary, which will then be countered in turn. Direct challenges are seen as bad form, whereas a presentation that makes another's argument irrelevant rather than refuting it is elegant and demonstrates a high level of intellect.

LONG FUTURISTS

The Long Futurist faction holds that the threat from the Sword Worlds Confederation will eventually go away or be diminished to the point where it can be discounted. Indeed, even the current war with the Sword Worlds is not very important in the grand scheme of things. Many Long Futurists consider the conflict to be an annoying distraction rather than an existential threat.

This viewpoint comes from multiple sources. A certain contempt for the Sword Worlds is one. Not only are they technologically inferior but their society is dysfunctional. A people who cannot even hold together a small interstellar state are not much of a threat in the long term. All the Darrians have to do is outlast them. There is some basis for this argument; Sword Worlds internal politics can certainly be vigorous and disagreements between the most prominent worlds have derailed previous endeavours. However, barbarians can be dangerous if they manage to cooperate for any length of time.

The second factor is belief in Darrian superiority. This is based partially on the technological advantage held by Darrian vessels and borne out by the fact that Sword Worlds attacks have never caused serious losses. The odd unimportant world has changed hands but the existence of the Confederation has never been threatened. The Entropic Worlds, for example, are important only because Sword Worlders seem to like to fight over them. Wars have traditionally been fought far away from the main inhabited systems and seem rather pointless to the Long Futurists.

Adherents of this viewpoint advocate a policy of containment towards all threats, not just the Sword Worlds. One recurring theme is the importance of keeping the Imperial border away from Darrian space. The Imperials are allies but are guilty of commercial and cultural imperialism. Having the Sword Worlds Confederation between the Darrians and the Imperials can be seen as a blessing of sorts. Ultimately, the Long Futurists just want to be left alone to pursue their plans. If action is necessary then so be it but actions should be directed towards maintaining the status quo rather than causing big upheavals.

### SOLVERS


Sometimes referred to as Necessitists but more commonly – for obvious reasons – as Solvers, adherents of this viewpoint take a clinical and scientific approach to all problems, including warfare and the decision to fight or not. The Sword Worlds Confederation has become a problem that must be solved and it must be done efficiently. Despite the generally peaceful nature of Darrian society, the Solvers can be frighteningly militant. Some advocate deployment of the Star Trigger as the ultimate deterrent. Once Sacnoth or Gram has been obliterated the remaining Sword Worlders – and everyone else – will know the price of conflict with the Darrian Confederation. The cost is worth it, according to at least some Solvers.

Others are less keen to use weapons of stellar destruction but still advocate 'solving' the Sword Worlds once and for all. The Darrian Confederation has always fought defensive wars but is quite capable of launching an offensive down the Gram or Sacnoth arms of the Spinward Main. Wrecking the shipbuilding and industrial centres would reduce the Sword Worlds to an irrelevance. If this were to be done at all it would best be done suddenly. War has already broken out, so a strategic surprise is currently out of the question but there is always the possibility of a strike made a few weeks after the inevitable peace treaty is signed.

The Solver faction is no more trigger-happy than anyone else but recognises the need to take bold action at times. Hostile neighbours are a problem, just like a serious drought or a pandemic. Half-measures do not eliminate the problem and cost more in the long run. Better, then, to grasp the nettle and get the job done once and for all. The Solvers are adept at presenting quite horrifying actions as necessary and even logical. Most of the time it is the smallest of the recognised factions but if the death toll rises too high it will gain additional followers.

PEACEFULLY OUTWARD The Peacefully Outward faction has some ideals in line with the Long Futurists and some that are diametrically opposed. Its adherents believe the Darrian Confederation is too insular. In addition to colonising new worlds or absorbing some nearby, Peaceful Outward advocates greater interactions with other states - notably the Sword Worlds. Outward in this sense refers to cultural expansion and the idea that great long- term plans are all very well but there is plenty to be done on a smaller scale in the immediate future.

Both Peacefully Outward and the Long Futurists agree that the Darrian Confederation must maintain stability and pursue big goals but where the Long Futurists see these goals as mostly scientific, Peacefully Outward has social and cultural objectives. Its adherents also see the Sword Worlds as much more of a threat than their rivals do. Peacefully Outward hopes to show Sword Worlders the benefits of cooperation and friendship in the longer term but is willing to concede that these benefits may need to be demonstrated at gunpoint.

Ironically perhaps, Peacefully Outward advocates an aggressive strategy in this conflict. Not as clinically genocidal as the Solvers but much more assertive than in previous wars. Its members feel that Sword Worlders do not consider war with the Darrians as much of a risk; the Darrian Confederation defends itself and is always quick to the negotiating table. It may be necessary to inflict harsher defeats and some real damage on the Sword Worlds in order to make them realise the Darrians are much better friends than enemies.

SWORD WORLDS FACTIONS

There are far too many factions among the Sword Worlds to catalogue and they change constantly. Most are led by charismatic individuals with a strong viewpoint and are often pro-a certain individual rather than favouring a policy for its merit. Those who follow a particular admiral or general may have differing personal views on how war should be conducted but agree on who should be leading the battles. These cults of personality tend to have a constant core membership plus additional adherents drawn by recent successes or statements they identify with.

This low-level factionalism is sufficient to influence the conduct of the war to some degree. Appointment to a policy-making position may be based on support rather than merit in some cases and commanders might well be inclined to take actions they know will be popular rather than strategically important. However, the major factions are the planetary populations of various worlds. Most Sword Worlders are very proud of their homeworld and generally align their views with its interests.

Different worlds have differing goals and viewpoints about how the war should be conducted. This is often influenced by astrography. The population of Sting, for example and not surprisingly, want greater emphasis on operations in the Lunion subsector. Sacnoth is more concerned with enhancing its own prestige and status within the Confederation than defeating any particular enemy and will use its support for one policy or another as a bargaining chip. Gram is adamant the focus should be on 'reclaiming' the worlds to coreward in Vilis, whilst Tizon seems obsessed with the Entropic Worlds.

This is perhaps the greatest weakness of the Sword Worlds Confederation, hampering its forces more than technological limitations. Any agreement to send forces to a given theatre of war is inevitably conditional and logical strategic arguments may not penetrate the pride and stubbornness that lie at the heart of Sword Worlds culture. Common sense generally keeps disagreements from becoming crippling but there is always the chance a given world may withdraw its ships or its support from an operation if an argument escalates far enough.

## NEUTRAL AND MINOR FACTIONS

The Fifth Frontier War will affect everyone in the Spinward Marches. Many neutral worlds and organisations are powerless to do anything but try to survive and will have to ride the tides of war as best they can. Some larger groups do have the resources to make a difference, either by intervention on their own behalf or through bargaining for their assistance. and that trivialities like sovereign territory and war zone hazards do not apply to them. Additionally, DIRS is a religious organisation – almost aggressively so. Its people will tend wounds, supply food and rebuild infrastructure but always at the price of allowing them to preach, sing and lecture about how the current disaster could have been fended off with some good prayers.

The mainstream Church of Stellar Divinity retains links with DIRS but has tried to distance itself from the more aggressive approach to proselyting used by Red Sphere members. They do appear to be sincere in their beliefs and are perhaps over-enthusiastic rather than profit-seeking. Indeed, so far as can be established, the DIRS runs at a loss. Donations from supporters and grateful populations are spent as quickly as they come in. Equipment is lavish but personnel receive only a living wage. Even the higher echelons of the organisation are poorly paid compared to equivalent levels in similar organisations. DIRS is zealous, for certain, but it does appear to be honest.

The Red Sphere spreads its religion and undertake its good works without favour, suggesting that its agenda is spiritual rather than political. However, its members do not rely entirely upon divine protection. Armed guards are common wherever the DIRS is operating and some major operations have paramilitary protection including light armoured vehicles. The Red Sphere will fight when it has to, even going so far as to topple warlords who try to prevent it from helping the population of a disaster- struck city, or extorting tribute from the rescuers. DIRS is generally regarded as 'rather tiresome good guys' and those who wonder if there is more to the organisation are typically dismissed as paranoid cynics.

THE FREE TRADE LEAGUE The Free Trade League (FTL) may not be a single organisation and 'organisation' is quite a strong word in any case. It appears that there exist several loose collaborations of independent starship operators, which may or may not be connected. For the most part, the FTL is an agreement to share information, bargain

#### THE DIVINE INTERSTELLAR RED SPHERE

The Divine Interstellar Red Sphere, or DIRS, is a charitable organisation originally created by the Church of Stellar Divinity. Its members undertake humanitarian works wherever they are needed, without regard to borders or allegiances. It is not clear how many starships the DIRS has, nor how many field teams. The bigger assets are easy to track; the large disaster-relief and hospital ships, and the main relief and recovery projects but in addition there are many associated groups and cadres which work with local volunteers.

DIRS does a lot of good, or at least alleviates a lot of suffering but it is a rather controversial organisation. Its disregard for politics is taken to an arrogant extreme - DIRS ships and teams think they can go anywhere collectively and generally look out for one another. Most League members – associates might be a better word - are more or less honest individuals who are just trying to stay safe on the troubled spacelanes.

The FTL has succeeded in bringing down a few pirates - indirectly, of course. Its members receive information that might not be shared with official investigators and from sources who would not talk to them. If enough information is gathered to pinpoint a pirate haven or locate a ship, it is quietly passed to the authorities or – more commonly – a mercenary band that hunts pirates for the bounty. This is all common knowledge, contributing to a reputation as a force for stability and protection. However, there is more to the FTL than this.

Within the loose framework for cooperation there are a few key individuals with much closer ties. They all believe in free trade... completely free of restrictions. Whilst everyone in the FTL despises pirates, some are happy to play fast and loose with laws... and some are outright smugglers. These individuals use the FTL to recruit crewmembers and additional ships, and to find clients for their services. Speculative smuggling of illicit goods can produce rather random results, so the smugglers of the FTL prefer to serve high-paying clients.

FTL members will transport almost anything for the right price. This includes legal goods in a dangerous area as well as weapons, drugs and whatever else someone will pay to get past the customs stations. With no political affiliation these crews may be willing to operate on behalf of one side or perhaps both. However, their fees increase sharply if there is a chance of ending up on a major power's wanted list.

#### VARGR GROUPS

Within the Vargr Extents there are numerous small states and stateless associations, many of which want nothing to do with the major war unfolding to rimward. Some groups are more inclined towards one side or the other, or feel it expedient to align themselves one way or the other. However, the typical Vargr leader is an opportunist who will consider the available options in terms of long and short term gain. Envoys from both sides will offer inducements or deterrents in an effort to sway these groups and guide their conduct.

The larger Vargr states possess significant warships but the majority of groups willing to get involved in the Fifth Frontier War can field only small raiding craft. These are little more than a nuisance but can distract warships from the combat zones or interrupt the flow of communications. Vargr groups, on the whole, are motivated by gain rather than ideology and will pull out of a difficult situation.

### KFORUZENG


The best-known of the Vargr raiding bands along the coreward frontier of the Imperium, the Kforuzeng are outright and unashamed corsairs. The history of the band goes back to well before the Fourth Frontier War but remains somewhat unclear. It appears that as with many such groups, the Kforuzeng began as a handful of raider captains cooperating in a loose manner – although some say the band originated from a single leader and his followers. By the early 1080s the Kforuzeng was apparently past its prime, consisting of perhaps 20 ships. Most of these were showing their age from years of hard use.

The usual pattern is for such a band to break up or be eclipsed by younger and more powerful groups but the Kforuzeng turned its fortunes around with a series of audacious raids in the years just after the Fourth Frontier War. This attracted a wave of new captains, which in turn allowed the Kforuzeng to co-opt smaller and weaker pirate bands. It is not clear exactly how large the Kforuzeng became but estimates of around 30–70 small vessels are deemed reasonable. The situation is complicated by the fact that most of the raiding along the Imperial coreward frontier is attributed to the Kforuzeng and indeed the words 'corsair' and
'Kforuzeng' are often used interchangeably.

The Kforuzeng have several havens and ports that allow them to base their ships. This is often out of a combination of fear and desire for profit but there is genuine admiration for these bold buccaneers in some quarters. The Kforuzeng has no agenda beyond plunder and extortion but is currently aligned with the Outworld Coalition. It may be that this is simply due to astrography and opportunity but the Consulate has in the past offered inducements to similar raider bands to harass Imperial shipping.

It is known that the Kforuzeng have a large number of vessels in the subsectors facing Aramis and Pretoria, so large-scale raids can be expected there. These might not be as destructive as their Zhodani allies hope, however, and the Kforuzeng have a history of extorting tribute after causing relatively minor harm. It is possible that demonstrations of strength leading to payments will satisfy the Kforuzeng leadership for a while, in which case their main force will probably relocate. Raiding along the whole rimward frontier is likely if the war goes on for more than a few months, at least on a small scale.

Whilst small, the 40th Squadron is more of a military threat than the Kforuzeng as it possesses cruiser-sized warships. These are likely to operate on the flanks of a Zhodani advance or to launch raids in the Regina and Aramis subsectors. 40th Squadron captains are entirely happy to take plunder but theirs is a military alliance. Their forces are more likely to stay concentrated and obey orders than those of other Vargr groups.

The 40th Squadron joins the war because it needs the support of the Zhodani Consulate to maintain its fleet. Without the fleet, there would be no means to control member worlds, which would in any case be vulnerable to attacks from organisations such as the Kforuzeng. It is likely that without Zhodani support the 40th Squadron would cease to exist as a political entity within a couple of decades. The Squadron therefore has no alternative but to follow Zhodani direction. Its leaders do not like this situation and are actively looking for ways to make their fleet long-term viable, taking them out from under the shadow of the Consulate.

40TH SQUADRON

The 40th Squadron is a Vargr state originally founded by a naval force returning from participation in the First Frontier War. Over the centuries its warships were patched up and kept flying long after their contemporaries were retired, but eventually replacements became necessary. These were funded by the Zhodani Consulate, which provides training and support in return for an alliance against the Imperium.

THE ZUENG

The Zueng are a stateless organisation styling themselves as mercenaries rather than raiders. There is a fine line between the two sometimes, especially since the Zueng will take a contract to launch raids or grab plunder when it is available. The Imperium lists the Zueng as a pirate organisation making operations within the Imperial borders hazardous even when personnel are not engaged in combat-related activities.

Despite this, the Zueng are active along the fringe of the Imperium, acting as facilitators for those wanting arms or military training. They are just as happy to smuggle weapons or set up training cadres as they are to attack military targets; so long as there is money to be made from conflict the Zueng are interested. They have overt contacts on worlds outside Imperial jurisdiction and operate through local fronts within the Imperium.

The Zueng can muster over 20 military craft, mostly in the 400–1,000 ton range, plus transports. Many of these are disguised as ordinary merchant ships and configured for personnel smuggling and gun-running activities. The Zueng are willing to do business with criminals if it suits their purposes but generally prefer dealing with 'legitimate insurgents' as they define them. Their motivations are financial; there is money to be made so they are involved. However, there is bad blood between the Zueng and the Imperium, as the Imperial authorities have executed as pirates a number of personnel who the Zueng insist were legitimate mercenaries. This may colour some encounters. were made. Essentially the Arden Society created a loose trade agreement then gradually tightened it to include mutual cooperation clauses that favoured Arden over its partners. Finally the Federation was redefined as a political organisation.

Most of the members were too far in by this time, dependent on Arden for trade or resources, or tied into contracts they could not easily get out of. The Federation became a political entity at that point and any remaining reservations were swept away when a Zhodani fleet arrived on the eve of the Fifth Frontier War. The fleet carried an ambassador who was installed with great ceremony and the formal recognition of the Federation of Arden by the Zhodani Consulate was the first declaration to come out of the new embassy.

The Federation of Arden is officially neutral in the Fifth Frontier War, although it allows Zhodani warships to operate freely in its territory. Logistical bases have been set up in Federation space and independent raiders – pirates as far as the Imperium is concerned – are known to operate out of its ports. It continues to operate as a back-channels conduit for diplomacy and does not directly act against Imperial shipping entering its space. All the same, it would be a bold captain who ventured there, with Zhodani warships and raiders operating openly.

Arden has recently begun acquiring a fleet of multi- purpose vessels suitable for local trade and light patrol work. Its small system defence force has also been augmented. There are rumours that merchant ships taken as prizes by raiders or pirates are being bought and re-registered. Arden is not recognising Imperial legal claims of any sort, even if they can be communicated to the correct recipients.

All of this activity is governed by self-interest. Arden has no desire to fight a war against anyone, let alone the Third Imperium. Arden was offered a deal by the Zhodani Consulate – recognition in return for allowing Consulate ships unhindered movement and not informing the Imperials of their activities. This stipulation extends to action against Imperial intelligence-gathering efforts. Arden has complied but has no illusions; the Consulate could take over at any time. Finding a way to prevent that without triggering a takeover is the top priority for the Arden Society.

#### THE FEDERATION OF ARDEN

The Federation of Arden is the creation of the Arden Society, a group of powerful industrialists and political figures on the world of Arden. At the outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War the Federation was not recognised by any major state, nor in some cases by worlds it claimed as members. It was sneaked into being as first a trade federation before serious political claims

#### IHATEI BANDS

The Fifth Frontier War has nothing to do with the Aslan Hierate, other than being an opportunity to make gains whilst the Imperium is distracted. It is unlikely the Hierate or its member clans will act openly against Imperial-held worlds as this would result in an undesirable war. However, groups of ihatei – the followers of landless young Aslan males – are certain to take advantage in the form of expeditions to grab territory in neutral space or to expand holdings on neutral worlds.

A typical ihatei band has a few starships, most of which are lightly armed transports and perhaps a few hundred ground combatants. Actual numbers vary considerably however; sometimes multiple bands join together to create a fleet of sorts. Imperial resources to repel such an incursion are very limited and in any case direct opposition to ihatei can offend their parent clan, which in turn leads to escalation. By preference, the Imperium prefers to oppose Aslan incursions by the use of mercenaries and local forces since defending a home threatened by invasion is seen as legitimate by the Aslan.

Some ihatei bands may be willing to serve as mercenaries for one side or the other. Ihatei are seekers after territory and would prefer to be paid in good land but there is more than one route to landownership. Money is always useful, as are favours. An ihatei band may be willing to serve in return for payment and a promise not to oppose their next acquisition.

Ihatei forces are not large and their ships are incapable of taking on a naval vessel in direct combat. However, they have the potential to be a real nuisance or even a serious long-term problem unless dealt with. For the most part this means they will be a distraction that must be contained with minimal resources, although a decisive blow might set them back on their heels long enough to redeploy resources elsewhere.

#### MOVERS AND SHAKERS: PERSONALITIES OF THE FIFTH FRONTIER WAR

The events of the Fifth Frontier War are driven by a number of powerful individuals. Few are personally capable of affecting the outcome of a major war but have sufficient influence to gather a faction around them which can. Some of these people hold official posts within a chain of command and are accountable to their superiors, whilst others have their own agenda and the capability to do as they please. In many cases the Travellers will never interact directly with these people but may communicate through envoys and messengers, or have to deal with forces they send to carry out their will. Even direct interactions are likely to be 'talking' rather than 'doing' situations. For example, mortal enemies might meet over the negotiating table with a truce in place, or rivals may have to abide by the rules of a noble's court whilst trying to influence the noble against their opponents.

The Referee should note that these individuals will be featured in future publications in the Fifth Frontier War line. If the Referee's campaign results in them being disgraced, dismissed or disabled before the official product line is done with them, another individual may take their place. This is particularly likely in the case of military officers, who will typically be replaced through a well-established process. How the Referee handles this is a matter of personal choice. Major personalities can be kept out of harm's way; in other words the Travellers are not given an opportunity to affect them. The actions of non-player characters are planned by the Referee or detailed in published materials, so anything permanent that happens to them can be accounted for in the overall campaign plotline.

Each of the personalities presented here can be considered to be Major or Significant Characters (see page 178). They will have a value for Affinity – how well they regard the Travellers – rated from -6 to +6 – and a rating for Power and Influence rated from
+0 to +6. These values are detailed starting on page 180 and indicate how much power and influence the character can bring to bear, along with how likely they are to use it for or against the Travellers.

Power and Influence are defined for these characters by their position and assets at the outset of the war, along with how much leeway they have to use it. Note that these values reflect what the character can use, not everything they have. An admiral commanding a fleet has enormous power but can only use it in accordance with orders and political direction, so what they can bring to bear outside their remit is much more limited. Given a legitimate order to attack the enemy, this admiral can deploy a whole fleet but when a bunch of adventurers ask for help sneaking into an enemy held system the resources available will be much smaller.

Affinity is defined by relationship with the Travellers and in most cases starts at zero. A noble who has never heard of the Travellers will be neither positively nor negatively inclined towards them unless there is a reason not to be. This might be certain knowledge of their deeds or the propaganda of allies and enemies. Someone who has heard the Travellers have taken actions they approve of is more likely to be positive towards them than someone who has been told they are deceitful and malicious.

Open affiliations will also affect the Affinity of major characters. If the Travellers are openly sided with an allied faction, Affinity will start at +1 or +2. For example, a band of Travellers known (or thought) to have assisted the Sword Worlds cause can expect Sword Worlds naval personnel to be somewhat positively inclined towards them. This increases to
+3 for members of the same or an allied service. For example, Travellers serving the Duke of Regina can expect an Imperial Army force to be very positively inclined towards them. However, this can be affected by internal rivalries. It is quite possible that Travellers working for the Duchess of Mora will be viewed less favourably by huscarles in the service of the Duke of Regina than some neutral powers, despite both nobles being on the same side.

#### DELPHINE ADORANIA MUUDASHIR

THE DUCHESS OF MORA

The terms 'Duke' and 'Duchess' are used more or less interchangeably in Imperial parlance. Some noble seats have a tradition of female incumbents and prefer to use the term 'Duchess' to reflect this regardless of who is on the throne. Mora is ones of these and is often referred to as the Matriarchy of Mora. The current Matriarch is Delphine Adorania Muudashir, daughter of Duchess Lutetia Ammon Muudashir of Mora. She ascended to the Ducal throne in 1014 upon her mother's abdication and has ruled for almost a century with great success.

Duchess Delphine is the centre of the Mora Foremost faction and openly states that she should have been appointed sector duke or even Archduke of the Domain of Deneb a long time ago. There is much merit to this claim, although Duchess Delphine has a number of powerful opponents. Chief among these is Duke Norris of Regina, whose followers are strongly opposed to the policies of the Mora Foremost faction and in some cases have a personal dislike of Duchess Delphine.

At 128 years of age, Duchess Delphine has avoided significant deterioration due to use of anagathic drugs but is showing her age. Her mental faculties remain as sharp as ever but she has been described as having a 'body wearied by age, kept upright by the false memory of youth'. She is gracious but haughty and intolerant of anyone who does not show sufficient respect. Those who follow the correct protocols and show deference can win favour which will elevate them to undreamed-of heights but Duchess Delphine never lets anyone forget how they climbed so high. Those who do are ruthlessly brought down.

Duchess Delphine can sometimes allow her rivalry with other great nobles, notably Duke Norris of Regina, to colour her judgement. It has been said, not without reason, that she would rather see Norris fail than the Imperium succeed. However, Duchess Delphine is an Imperial noble and would not be in her position under Zhodani rule. She is as opposed to the Consulate as anyone; it is just that initially she sees the conflict as an opportunity to become Archduke rather than a threat to the entire Imperium.

#### DUKE NORRIS AELLA ALEDON, DUKE OF REGINA

As a young man, Duke Norris followed a career path common among members of the great nobility. He entered the Imperial Naval Academy and graduated with honours in 1084, proceeding straight to the staff college due to an exceptionally high aptitude for intelligence work. This virtually guaranteed that Norris Aledon would not command starships but serve in a supporting role. It was, however, a role in which he excelled.

As a lieutenant, Norris Aledon served in Disapora and the Old Expanses, gaining a different appreciation of naval affairs to that of a command officer of the equivalent rank. Another stint at staff college was followed by promotion to lieutenant-commander in 1090 and an assignment to the tactics college at Macene. Soon after being promoted to commander in 1097, Norris Aledon suddenly became heir to the Duchy of Regina due to the death of his older brother William. After a leave of absence lasting until 1098, Norris was formally invested as heir and began his education and training for the role of duke. He inherited the position months later.

It is said that there is no finer education than the navy for a member of the nobility but a great noble also needs to be prepared for the role. Norris was not. He had the basics, of course, and a crash-course in the complexities of etiquette and diplomacy. However, Duke Norris still thought like a naval officer when he ascended to the Ducal throne. This had benefits and drawbacks; there were diplomatic gaffes and a focus in what others considered to be the wrong places, but there was also an increase in the efficiency of the navy. Piracy and smuggling went down, which increased prosperity and popularity.

As Duke Norris settled into the role he became more of a politician but never completely. He retains a tendency to get to the point efficiently without the elaborate courtesies and ego-strokes expected from such a grand individual. Some find this refreshing, others less so. The courtesies are part of the fabric of high society, where service or agreement is rewarded with the experience of being praised by a great noble. This, and the fact that those seeking advancement are more likely to achieve it by playing court politics at Mora than doing an excellent job at Regina, means that Norris has gained a smaller but perhaps more loyal following than Duchess Delphine.

#### VISCOUNT IIM DAVIDE URAST OF NEW ROME

Iim Davide Urast pursued a naval career in his youth, rising rapidly through the ranks by use of a mix of patronage and the tactic of 'ponding'. His progress in the Imperial Navy was slightly below average until he reached the rank of lieutenant-commander, despite being able to get on all the right courses at exactly the right time to hit an expectation bracket at the next round of promotions. After a brief and uneventful stint as the commanding officer of a fleet escort, Iim Urast transferred from the Corridor Sector fleet to the 100th Fleet which was assigned to his home subsector of Glisten.

The transfer into the smaller pond represented by the subsector fleet came with early promotion into being a bigger fish. As a full commander, Urast was given command of a destroyer but to his disappointment he was not the senior officer in the flotilla and instead forced to serve under someone of lower social status than his own family... and who was unfortunately rather more competent than him. This was Commander Sir Isabel Prasad, who was already thoroughly weary of over-promoted nobles under her command. The 100th Fleet was (and indeed still is) a dumping-ground for well-connected but ineffective officers.

After his attempt to ruin Prasad's career failed, Urast ponded himself again, this time to the Colonial Forces. This came with a promotion to full captain and was put forward as a sacrifice, placing effective command of a reserve force above personal career interests. Patronage and a desire to get him as far away from the naval chain of command as possible supported this role, and Iim Urast served out his time as a battleship captain and acting commodore in the Colonial Forces.

Upon becoming Viscount of New Rome, Urast resigned his naval commission and quickly became a major figure in Forward The Imperium!. He puts himself forward as the generation's greatest strategist and rewards those who treat him as such. He remains at odds with Rear-Admiral Prasad, who now commands the 100th Fleet, and has been reprimanded several times for interfering in naval affairs to an excessive degree. He constantly exhorts subsector dukes for more naval forces, to be held ready to repel the clever Zhodani sneak attack only he has detected.

#### REAR-ADMIRAL FREDERICK SANTANOCHEEV, COUNT FORNICE

Frederick Santanocheev is a career naval officer who has enjoyed rapid promotion. Some say this was more due to the fact he had the favour of Duchess Delphine of Mora than has talent; his wife is the sister of the Duke of Lunion, a staunch Mora Foremost supporter. Be that as it may, Santanocheev is in an unenviable position. There is no official sector admiral at present, with several candidates put forward then sidelined or vigorously opposed by some of the sector's great nobles. Amid this turbulent time, Santanocheev is the favoured candidate of the Mora Foremost faction.

Although only a rear-admiral and outranked by most other candidates, Santanocheev is seen by most as the inevitable holder of the sector admiral's office. This would inspire resentment at any time but Santanocheev has staunch enemies, among them Imperial Naval Intelligence. Some years ago Santanocheev acted upon poor information provided by Imperial Naval Intelligence and whilst both parties acted in good faith he bears a bitter grudge. Ever since his appointment became obvious he has made trouble for the intelligence community, even going so far as to set up a parallel and rival service called the Office of Naval Information. Once formally installed, he will most likely wreck careers and discredit Imperial Naval Intelligence. Opposing him is said by some to be the new priority mission for the intelligence sector.

Santanocheev has enemies and detractors among the fighting admirals and captains as well but a great many supporters. He has already stalled a scheduled redeployment of sector fleet assets which was disapproved of by Mora Foremost and the propaganda blitz that accompanied the action has painted Santanocheev as a wise and sensible leader. He came out of the fraught wrangle with increased support and a more solid position as sector admiral-apparent.

Critics disapprove of the dispersal of the fleet under Santanocheev's leadership. He has approved a number of squadron and task force deployments to individual worlds and announced that some subsector fleets are to receive capital ship squadrons. This is painted as a 'wall of deterrence' and 'long-overdue security measures' but there are many who consider the move to be a political one. Several recipients and promised recipients of the redeployed squadrons have now pledged their support to Mora Foremost.

Despite reservations about his competence or the wisdom of putting internal politics ahead of strategic issues – if that is indeed what Santanocheev was doing – at the outbreak of war he was the obvious candidate for command in the Spinward Marches. Anyone else would have to be brought up to speed and might need to relocate from another base, whereas Santanocheev was at Macene with the flag fleet and could commence operations immediately. In fact, he did so, not waiting for confirmation that he was in command. This was undoubtedly the correct decision under the circumstances, although the situation was far from ideal. Resentment and division caused command and control problems, as did Santanocheev's urgent command reshuffle to put someone he trusted in a key position instead of a rival.

Once the news of the war reached Mora, Duchess Delphine immediately and unilaterally promoted Santanocheev to sector admiral. She did not follow protocol in this but the action was not opposed by her rivals. At that point, someone had to be put in charge and Santanocheev was already there. The war came at just the right time for Frederick Santanocheev, allowing him to leapfrog into the position he had been making long- term preparations for. A unified command with internal difficulties was better than no command at all. In the early months of the war Santanocheev seemed effective as a commander, although that was more due to plans he had been about to change than his own efforts.

#### PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR DLAFL SHTALIJTLAS

Provincial Governor Dlafl Shtalijtlas is a powerful Zhodani noble with a long history of wise governance and good decisions. However, his talents lie in political and economic fields rather than strategic, causing him to view the conflict as a battle of wills between his people and the obviously inferior Imperials. Whilst national will is certainly a factor in any major conflict, Provincial Governor Shtalijtlas overlooked certain strategic considerations.

Over-confidence in the ability of Zhodani agents to influence Imperial policy led to Governor Shtalijtlas taking for granted the absence of a portion of the defensive forces of Regina, Efate and Jewell. As a result, rather than overrunning these systems quickly his fleets became bogged down in sieges. Ironically, Jewell was the only one of these worlds which fell. Where the reduction of Regina and Efate was considered a necessary part of the campaign, it was always
 envisaged that Jewell might hold out. This would draw out Imperial forces attempting a relief, enabling them to be crushed and opening the way to Rhylanor. The fall of Jewell released major forces but the resistance of Efate and Regina limited what they could achieve.

As with all Zhodani nobles, Shtalijtlas is a skilled psion, with abilities in the telepathy, awareness and clairvoyance fields. It has been some time since he left the comforts of his palace at Cronor, although in his younger days he journeyed far afield to see for himself the people and worlds he would govern over. As the war has dragged on Shtalijtlas has increasingly wearied of the bloodshed and has come to believe that educating the population with the basics of telepathy is the path to lasting peace. If people could communicate honestly, mind-to-mind, they would find they had fewer differences to fight over.

The provincial governor's increasing preoccupation with post-war education programmes has attracted favour in some quarters but criticism from others. In particular, Provincial Officer Chteprnentlasche urges Shtalijtlas to focus on the here and now. Rebuilding and creating a new society can wait for when the war has been won. It may be that this is a persistent flaw in Shtalijtlas' thinking; once he begins taking an outcome as a given he becomes blind to the possibility that events may not turn out that way. There are those who suggest he may be reassigned in the near future but for now remains a driving force in a campaign he is certain he will win.

#### PROVINCIAL OFFICER KE CHTEPRNENTLASCHE

Provincial Officer Ke Chteprnentlasche is the supreme commander of the Zhodani forces assigned to the conflict. He outranks the provincial governor in the noble hierarchy of the Consulate but is subordinate to his political direction. Decisions on where to direct attacks come from the governor but the naval commander decides what fleets will be assigned and what their specific orders are to be.

Chteprnentlasche is a career naval officer who started out in the Naval Landing Force as a teleport-capable commando. Decorated multiple times, he rose rapidly through the ranks and established himself as a capable strategist. He still favours the tactics used by teleporting commandos; stealth, deception and surprise followed by an overwhelming assault on a critical point. In this he is frustrated by his superior's insistence on predictable avenues of attack.

Whilst acknowledging the value of grabbing a bargaining chip such as Jewell early on, Chteprnentlasche worries that attacking the Jewell Salient is too obvious. The provincial governor is convinced that the Imperials will have been induced to move some of their defences elsewhere but Chteprnentlasche prefers not to rely on clever political gambits to open the way for his assault. Misdirection and influence are useful but not as useful as a battle fleet arriving in an unexpected place. After all, what use are hordes of battle riders and monitors at Jewell if the Zhodani fleets are charging towards Lunion and Mora?

Despite disagreeing with the overall strategy, Chteprnentlasche does his best to make it work. As the war goes on he continually advocates either a withdrawal and negotiations or a sudden blow in some other area. A grinding stalemate serves no useful purpose but the governor will not release the fleets nor allow Chteprnentlasche to create a new force elsewhere. The divisions between the two will deepen later in the conflict, to the point where Chteprnentlasche may begin petitioning to have Shtalijtlas reassigned.

LUCKY HOSSEN Lucky Hossen is a rather charming young man whose first name really is Lucky. Or so says his documentation, which was created by Zhodani Naval Intelligence, along with a backstory filled with misadventures and narrow scrapes. In fact, Hossen is a Zhodani diplomatic coercion agent. He undertakes all manner of intelligence gathering and rabble-rousing missions but specialises in finding ways to subvert political or military figures.

When not laughing and joking in the starport bars – and not coincidentally picking up local information - Hossen undergoes a transformation into a member of the upper-middle class; the sort of person who wangles his way into the entourage of a minor noble or a celebrity. This gets Hossen into the right parties or the support structures that keep important people from having to do anything for themselves. There, he absorbs information until he finds a weakness. Blackmail, threats, whatever is likely to work. Hossen does not typically carry out that part of the mission himself; once he has what he needs it is handed over to local intelligence teams and Hossen fades away.

Hossen's Power and Influence values are deliberately misleading. He is valuable enough that his superiors would send support if they could, although there is a limit to how much effort can be expended on one  agent. His Power and Influence values reflect his personality as a chancer; someone who feeds the egos of rich people in order to make money off them or find ever more influential friends.

If the Travellers get to know Hossen they will realise there is more to him than meets the eye but this is part of his cover. 'Friends' will discover he is descended from impoverished nobility over in Deneb and might still be slightly wanted for absconding from naval officer training that time. If he can convince others he is a bit of a rogue whose stories have a kernel of truth somewhere, Hossen will make use of the connection and even help others out. If he feels someone is getting close to the truth he will disappear or find a way to eliminate the threat.

#### UMAR RIRKUMKUUD

Umar Rirkumuud is a member of the Free Trade League, operating a heavily modified subsidised merchant not unlike the prototype recently shown by the Reidd-Valaasii Starship Corporation (see Whispers on the Abyss), a mid-sized firm specialising in converting and refurbishing old commercial starships. The resemblance is not coincidental; Rirkumuud became aware of the concept and decided to engage in a bit of free trade. Having stolen the plans, he had a similar vessel put together, only with some additional features. These are mostly concerned with avoiding detection or confusing a patrol ship long enough to slip away.

Outwardly jovial, Rirkumuud is a stone-cold professional. His agenda is money and anyone who gets in the way will be eliminated without remorse or hesitation. He is a highly influential figure within the Free Trade League and can assemble a flotilla of smugglers, gun-runners and ethically challenged merchants at need. His favoured area of operations was the Regina subsector but a relocation to Rhylanor was necessary during the first few months of the war. Once the big clashes and fast fleet movements died down, Rirkumuud and his cohorts moved back.

Rirkumuud and his colleagues can be encountered anywhere from Jewell to Mora by those who know where to look, although the Regina/Lanth/Aramis/ Rhylanor crossroads offers them the most reliable balance of profit and risk. They have contacts in the Imperial Navy and at many starports in the region, and will sell information as readily as transporting arms or stealing a shipment of medical supplies.

Umar Rirkumuud is a big, loud man whose grandiose gestures and flamboyant clothing distract attention from his sharp and highly focused mind. He prefers to be taken for a blowhard or noisy fool, or perhaps  a front for a more competent person. He is quite willing to play that role, sending new contacts on a wild goose chase around several 'people who might help them' whilst he evaluates the level of profit to be made from associating with them.

BISHOP LEWINS OF ATSAN

Bishop Lewins is not an ordained priest of any sort but uses the title anyway. His claim is that he is a leader of the Church of Stellar Divinity in the eyes of the gods and it is not for mortals to gainsay them. Lewins is a Virushi and like most of his kind he is a gentle pacifist - in deed, anyway. His words, thunderously declaimed at every opportunity, are widely considered the most aggressive declarations of peace and universal siblinghood anywhere in Charted Space.

Lewins started his career in the Imperial Army, serving as a battlefield medic. Although he was a big target, he was also capable of dragging fully-armoured troopers to safety without effort. Two terms of service got Lewins into civilian medical school, emerging as a doctor. Rather than a well-paid job in a hospital, he joined the Divine Interstellar Red Sphere and embarked on a career in disaster zones. Given the company he kept, it is no surprise that Lewins became religious. His beliefs are apparently sincere and rather extreme even by the standards of the DIRS.

There is nothing violent about Lewins but his views are intense all the same. The disaster relief ship he now 'guides, not commands' is known for plunging into the middle of battles to rescue casualties, or violating no-fly zones to get to someone in need. It is crewed by people just as zealous as Lewins, not all of whom share his non-violent philosophy. They will defend themselves at need and will fling their bodies in the way of bullets aimed at their 'bishop'.

Lewins is sincere in his beliefs but his views are fuelled by ego and a touch of narcissism. He believes that if he does sufficient good in his life he will not merely be taken into the heavens with his gods; he will be given a top job in their service. Thus he plunges into dangerous situations, often getting some of his followers killed, in search of wounded to save and souls to heal. Whilst non-violent he is utterly intolerant of dissent or disrespect and has no time for trivialities like a navy stop-and-search.

#### MATRIARCH SIOURROUZ

Matriarch Siourrouz is the commander of an arm of the Zueng mercenary group. She is known for her compassion and mercy, and anyone who says different meets a grisly fate. Coming from a relatively privileged background, Siourrouz had a difficult time as a mercenary and to this day there are those who believe she is too soft to be a good commander. She proves all of them wrong, both in crushing their challenge and what she does to the challengers afterward.

Siourrouz commands five combat ships, of which the largest is a 1,200-ton raiding frigate and some armed transports which are normally used to run weapons to insurgent groups or to transport loot out of a combat zone. Siourrouz and her associates are routinely trusted with the plunder gained by other groups, such is her reputation for straight – if lethal – dealing. She has a lucrative sideline as a banker for other mercenary groups, although she will not deal with known pirates.

As a charismatic Vargr leader, Siourrouz attracts significant numbers of volunteers who want to share in her legend. Most rapidly tire of the strict discipline imposed upon them by the Zueng and want to leave, a wish that is sometimes granted... after a fashion. Once accepted into the service of the Matriarch, personnel are bound for life unless released. Anyone who goes over the wall becomes a target for particularly vindictive hunters. However, some are allowed to join the 'fan club'; a support network of ships and personnel associated with Siourrouz herself rather than being part of the Zueng. 'Fans', as she sarcastically calls them, are generally left alone but must serve as directed whenever needed.

It is possible that Matriarch Siourrouz is building up strength outside the Zueng in this manner, although to what end is unclear. Perhaps she intends to challenge for overall leadership, or possibly she has something bigger in mind. She appears to have no confidantes at all, keeping her plans to herself until a given individual needs to know. Even then, the Matriarch gives out minimal information and expects total obedience. If someone fails or dies, it was their own fault. Lack of information was never a factor and anyone who knows what is good for them agrees.

KAKIN RIBIERO

Kakin Ribiero is a regional coordinator for the Ine Givar movement. Like many of its more mature members, she was attracted to the ideology of a fairer society and more even distribution of wealth. She took part in non-violent demonstrations and peaceful activism... and got nowhere. Having vented her frustrations a few times she was approached by another member of the movement and asked if she wanted to get something done. Naturally, she agreed eagerly.

At first, 'getting something done' was not all that different, only now she was in a group supporting those who engaged in more troublesome activities. These were publicity-grabbing stunts or involved minor damage and nuisance towards the property and companies owned by influential people. Then, with no warning, Kakin found herself flying a grav skimmer at zero metres through a major city with two wounded activists in the back and the local police in pursuit. They had been shot by security personnel trying to enter a secure residence.

What Kakin took away from the incident was an appreciation of how much publicity it garnered and the feeling that force was now justified. She found her way into the hardcore membership of the Ine Givar and earned the right to lead others. No longer a bedroom datanet activist, Kakin Ribiero was an insurgent leader. At first she did not believe the claims that elements of the Ine Givar were engaging in terrorism and by the time it became apparent she was on every watchlist in Charted Space.

Kakin Ribiero had a choice; walk away from the struggle or become what the Imperials had already decided she was. Although she has a distaste for civilian casualties, she can justify them to herself with the usual 'anyone not with us is against us' line. Still, she prefers 'clean' operations both morally and to avoid alienating the public. In the end, Ine Givar needs enough people behind it to force change; violence alone will not be enough. Thus Ribiero tries to reform the Ine Givar into a popular movement, taking back control from the radicals who just seem to want to smash everything. As for the Imperium, nothing has changed – it has to go.

### PROGRESS OF THE WAR

At the time the Zhodani leadership made their final decision to prepare for war, tensions were already rising. It was predicted, perhaps correctly, that war would break out sooner or later. Perhaps the Imperials might launch an attack, or perhaps an incident might trigger a war. Either way, the Consulate would be caught unprepared. The only way to ensure the Consulate had an advantage was to launch the conflict at a time of its choosing.

Plans were laid and forces concentrated. This meant moving ships from the rest of the Consulate, weakening it all over to have sufficient strength at the key point. Even if they were not destroyed, these ships would be away for months or even years and might require extensive repairs before they returned to their peacetime stations. A force movement of this magnitude could not be repeated for many years and once begun it would be thrown into chaos by an order to stand down. The absolute worst case was an Imperial attack whilst the fleet was trying to return to its peacetime deployments.

The only answer was to continue no matter what, so once the deployments began there was no turning back. Concentration for the attack began in 1105, with ships from the most distant parts of the Consulate setting out first. Vessels and fleets moved as secretly as possible to holding areas, conducting preparatory maintenance and resting their crews before being formed into the striking and reserve forces. A second wave of reinforcements was called forward in 1106 and a third in 1107, each following the same process.

Early in 1107 the final go/no-go decision was made and the fleets given their orders. Some had voyages of several months to reach their starting positions and the closer they got to the Imperial border the more likely the Imperials would detect the fleets and draw the obvious conclusions. Deception operations concealed the movements or lulled the Imperials into complacency. Sighs of relief as yet another incident was smoothed over or a war scare dissipated could almost be heard over the border and all the while other measures were being put in place.

It was known that the Imperials were strengthening the defences of their fortress worlds with dozens of refurbished battle riders and new-built heavy monitors. This had been going on for years and the balance of power was only going to get worse. Some advocated bypassing the fortresses and heading straight for Mora or the fleet headquarters at Macene but this plan was vetoed as it would place the fleet at the end of a long supply line running past large bases with powerful mobile combat elements. The plan offered a good chance of success but defeat would be decisive and losses heavy in any case. The lower-risk option of eliminating the fortresses and ensuring there was a good bargaining position from the start was selected.

The final decision was influenced by two interconnected factors. The first was the 1105 Fleet Redeployment Schedule, which provided for the establishment of a new regional strategic reserve force in Deneb. The large Corridor Reserve Fleet was to provide a sector fleet-equivalent of ships to form this contingent, placing heavy reinforcements much closer to the Spinward Marches. The remainder of the Corridor Strategic Reserve was to remain in place and would still be available to assist in a protracted conflict.

Ultimately the Fleet Redeployment Schedule never happened. A range of factors caused first postponements and then cancellation of the project. It is possible that opposition to the schedule was orchestrated by Zhodani intelligence assets; there were certainly efforts made in that direction. Whilst direct bribery rarely works, a more subtle combination of influence and coercion may. Imperial nobles who would never dream of assisting an external enemy might be 'helped' to see how their own situation would be improved by opposing the plan. Some genuinely thought it a bad idea; some were more interested in what concessions they could get in return for voting one way or the other, or the economic effects on the people they represented. Ultimately the fleet movement was postponed indefinitely but by that time members of the Mora Foremost faction had pushed another redeployment through.

With the strategic reserve coming to Deneb, Mora Foremost argued for a redeployment of local and sector fleet assets. This would reduce tensions with the Zhodani, which the Doves favoured and increase security of relatively minor systems. 'A battle rider over every mainworld!' was an attractive slogan to those who felt the navy preferred to chase pirates elsewhere. There was also the question of economic benefits. The support infrastructure required for a battle rider – or better yet, a squadron of three – meant investment, jobs and a boost to the local economy. Navy salaries spent in the local port were not unwelcome, either.

The plan would have moved over 100 battle riders out of the fortress worlds and scattered them all over the sector. Again, Zhodani influence helped push the measure through and it was this news that provided the final trigger for the attack. Weakened fortress worlds would be overrun before the Corridor Strategic Reserve could redeploy, opening the way for a decisive thrust at Macene or even Mora. The iron was positively incandescent when the Zhodani high command decided to strike.

In the event, a few battle riders were redeployed on the authority of the de facto sector admiral, Frederick Santanocheev, before the measure was halted. Questions over whether Santanocheev had the authority to make such a major redeployment resulted in feuds and resignations, and in the end the Imperial Navy sued itself to get a definitive answer. The Great

Navy Fiasco of 1107 was a public embarrassment but it stalled the movement for many months. Normally, the Domain Archduke would rule on such matters but none was in place. Nor was there a sector duke to deputise. Duchess Delphine of Mora made representations to the Emperor to be appointed Archduke, resolving what she presented as an embarrassing and rather silly situation. Duke Norris of Regina also sent emissaries to Capital, arguing the opposite.

The matter of who was in charge had to be resolved before the question of authority to move the fleet could receive a lawful ruling. Santanocheev continued to issue orders and most local commanders continued to request clarification rather than obeying what might or might not be a legitimate order. This contributed to a growing reputation for incompetence which Santanocheev did not entirely deserve. He was stuck in the middle of a political wrangle, attempting to do what his patron Duchess Delphine wanted – quite possibly against his better judgement as a naval officer.

The result of over a year of political infighting among the navy and nobility was the deepening of divisions and the loss of trust but it did keep the defence forces in place at the fortresses. The Zhodani order to attack was given in the hope that these ships would be scattered in a new 'crust' strategy instead of being concentrated at the locations the Zhodani fleet had to attack. History may conclude that this was the single most important factor in the Fifth Frontier War.

### THE PRECURSOR PHASE

The precursor phase of the war is considered, in hindsight, to have begun sometime not long after the ending of the Fourth Frontier War. It is an open question exactly when but the most useful definition is the point at which active preparations were put into motion. This was before the fleets began to move into position; even before supply caches were set up at their concentration points.

The Zhodani Consulate long ago accepted that war was inevitable and the Imperium decided it was likely. Both sides prepared in their own way. The Imperials strengthened their fortress worlds whilst the Zhodani moved their fleets into position. There were subtler measures in play, too. The Zhodani Consulate began positioning forward supply caches in Imperial space and infiltrating agents anywhere they might be useful. The most effective were those who could influence large numbers of other people, such as those positioned within the Ine Givar movement or in activist groups. These had the advantage that most of those they incited to action had no idea they were furthering the Zhodani cause.

Some of these precursor actions failed rather badly, not always due to counterintelligence work. Early in 1107, two operations got their lines crossed. The result was the loss of a 'sleeper' agent group on Fulacin who were to have assisted the fleets when they arrived. Circumstances remain unclear but it appears that an attempt to kidnap an Imperial noble who was high up in the naval chain of command backfired due to the intervention of an unknown party. The Zhodani intelligence team on Fulacin attempted to get the operation back on track and were eliminated under circumstances that remain mysterious.

Subsequent investigation found evidence of infiltration and uncovered a large supply cache – notably containing a fuel-processing plant – concealed in plain sight at a disused mining facility. After liquidating the agents stationed there the Imperium brought troops and concealed aerospace defence weapons in the area. Rather than a source of information and supplies, Zhodani naval forces encountered a hostile reception when they arrived.

Other operations went rather better, with insurgencies flaring up on several worlds just before the war and a major intelligence coup that gave the provincial commander almost up-to-the-minute data on the defences of Rhylanor and Jae Tellona, as well as patchy information on ship movements in the region. Similarly, vessels out of the Sword Worlds disguised as normal trade ships were deep into the trade lanes at the start of the war. One particularly audacious battlecruiser captain engineered a 'goodwill visit' to Regina, Rhylanor and Mora such that his ship was at Mora system on the day war was due to start. He was a little late; the Sword Worlders had been given a false start date to reduce the effect of leaks. Nevertheless his raid on Mora itself, and subsequent rampage into Deneb, greatly influenced Imperial strategic thinking.

For their part, the Imperials were at a disadvantage in intelligence work as they possessed few psionic agents. Extensive use was made of 'black sheep' – agents trained in dubious thought-masking techniques and given minor but credible tasks. The black sheep were intended to get caught, creating an impression of clumsy incompetence and allowing false information to be conveyed in a believable way.

Not only did the black sheep programme, cynical as it was, help conceal more competent agents by making the Zhodani think their countermeasures were sufficient, they also allowed the Imperials to draw a major response to a supposed Imperial intelligence base on Quar. This was a trap, with numerous Zhodani operatives killed and some captured. The intelligence/ counterintelligence war continued right to the end of the conflict, sometimes influencing major events.

Both sides made extensive use of personality overlays. The Zhodani implemented theirs psionically, whilst the Imperials used a complex device understood by few. Recipients really believed they were the new personality but could be triggered to revert or to carry out pre-programmed actions. The use of psionic or artificial reprogramming on captured enemy personnel or civilians is illegal in the Imperium but it was done all the same. The Zhodani did it as a matter of course.

Most of the overlaid sleeper agents were expended in the first months of the conflict, typically in acts of sabotage or information delivery. The result was increased disruption of commerce and data flow, and in some cases the transmission of wildly false information by reputable sources. Zhodani agents were discovered as far afield as Tobia and Deneb, with an unusually high proportion in mid-level offices or on the staff of important individuals around Trin, Mora and Regina.

The precursor stage came to an end on 187-1107, when Zhodani ambassadors simultaneously delivered declarations of war at Jewell and Regina. The lead elements of the battle fleets arrived a few hours later.

# THE RIVERLAND CAMPAIGN

Named for the world of Riverland on the Zhodani side of the border, the Riverland theatre of war is the schwerpunkt, or 'point of decision' in any war for control of the Spinward Marches. The important worlds of Regina, Efate and Jewell lie close to the border; close enough for them to be hit on day one of the war without any movement through Imperial space. Success in this region brings Rhylanor and the Imperial Navy depot at Macene within striking distance. Lanth could not be held were this region of space to fall into Zhodani hands and Mora would be seriously threatened. This would certainly be enough to bring the Imperium to the negotiating table.

From the Imperial point of view, the Jewell-Regina region must be held. This means heavy commitment of major forces from the start and counterattacks to prevent enemy consolidation even if the odds are poor. The 'Jewell Salient' may be a strategic liability, forcing Imperial units to fight on the enemy's terms, but its loss exposes Regina to overwhelming attack so reinforcements will have to be funnelled through to keep Jewell in the fight. The Consulate knows this and will try to inflict losses on forces in transit by raiding behind the main combat zone. Pressure can also be applied by raiding from the Vargr Extents, through the Aramis subsector and directly on the carotid artery of the salient, at Regina.

The Riverland campaign is characterised by massed fleet actions and sieges of fortress worlds such as Jewell as the Zhodani attempt to either conquer the region or draw the Imperial fleet into uneven battles where it can be ground down. Early deep thrusts might bring about an Imperial collapse or at least a retreat. If not, the campaign will be an epic-scale meatgrinder. The Riverland campaign will dictate what assets are available for use elsewhere, with both sides trying to balance progress towards victory in the critical theatre of war against gains elsewhere.

In addition to large-scale battles, the Jewell and Regina subsectors – and to a lesser but still significant extent, Aramis and Rhylanor – will be the target of raids and attempts to stir up insurrection or other distractions. In short, these four subsectors are the primary war zone and every kind of activity will be affected. Commerce becomes much more dangerous and political activity focuses on calming dissent and getting more support to drive off raiders or hold the advancing Zhodani back.

OPENING MOVES: JEWELL

Hours after the declaration of war, the first Zhodani warships entered the Jewell system. In the interim, the local Imperial commander had naturally ordered a full mobilisation and sent couriers to other worlds and naval formations. Plans had been in place for such an event, and drills carried out, but no rush mobilisation could ever go exactly to plan. There was a real possibility Jewell could fall on the first day of the war. However, that was not the case. There were glitches, to be sure but overall the system defence forces and fleet elements outperformed expectations.

Like most systems, Jewell had a portion of its forces at full readiness, with most ships active but lacking part of their crew or some officers. Some were stood down for maintenance, with systems removed, and ships of the reserve were for the most part not ready for flight. Nonetheless, the sector fleet elements deployed to the system were backed up by a formidable force of repurposed battle riders crewed by a mix of Colonial Fleet personnel and regulars on secondment.

The lead Zhodani elements were from the vanguard force of the Zhodani 68th Fleet, which pressed a determined attack against the naval base before withdrawing with heavy losses. Damage was inflicted but the sucker punch did not work out as well as had been hoped. However, assembling a battle fleet in just a few hours is a difficult task even when not under fire, and in addition to losses and damage the defenders were at best loosely organised when the main force of 68th Fleet arrived.

The First Battle of Jewell lasted 19 hours, with additional defenders joining as their ships became ready. Notable was the refurbished battle rider Giirkhalum, which put to space with half a crew under the command and on the sole authority of an ensign with eight months' experience. Despite only having five officers aboard, none of whom ranked above ensign, and with some of its systems operated by dockyard contractors, Giirkhalum fought until she was pounded to a wreck. Her inept but vigorous defence of the crippled battleship Buagki enabled that ship to reach the safety of the naval base. Such actions were repeated on both sides until the Zhodani withdrew to regroup.

Over the next 10 days, the dwindling system defence forces fought valiantly against a series of probing attacks and strikes whilst light Zhodani forces cleared and secured the rest of the system. The issue was never in doubt and after a huge clash on 196-1107 dubbed the Second Battle of Jewell, the defenders were too depleted to defend both the naval base and the mainworld. Abandoning the base meant defeat in the mid-term but trying to hold it would bring about annihilation in days or weeks.

On 198-1107 the commander of the Jewell contingent ordered the withdrawal of all personnel from the system's naval base and preparations to be made for demolition. The remnants of the Jewell Contingent abandoned the system two days later, falling back through Lysen towards Regina. Along the way this force was harassed by Zhodani forces in the Lysen system and encountered slight resistance on the approach to Regina.

On 209-1107, Zhodani 2nd Assault Fleet entered the Jewell system and began preparations for planetary assault. By that time most system defence units and those fleet elements unable to make jump-4 due to damage had been reassigned to the 125 th Fleet; the Jewell subsector fleet. Now a warfighting command rather than a security element, the 125th Fleet had few jump-capable ships remaining and in any case was dedicated to protecting Jewell. A portion of losses had been replaced by Colonial Fleet and reactivated Reserve Fleet units but a lack of crews meant that many vessels had to be destroyed at their moorings to prevent capture when the naval base was abandoned. Boarding actions were reported, in which Zhodani ship's troops attempted to seize Imperial vessels.

Despite the loss of the naval base in the outsystem, Jewell remained a formidable fortress. With a hardened highport and deep-site meson guns on-planet, the mainworld was still defended by a powerful force of monitors and repurposed battle riders. System defence boats and other light craft attempted to harass the enemy's logistics tail and assault ships, with some success. The commander of 2 nd Assault Fleet concluded that a breakthrough to the planet's surface was unlikely and began redeploying assault forces to other systems, marking the official beginning of the Siege of Jewell.

For the next few months, raids and sporadic combat wore down both forces. The Zhodani 68th Fleet could send ships back for repair or jump them to other systems to rendezvous with support vessels. The Imperial 125th Fleet had no such luxury. While orbital shipyards remained intact, wonders were performed with equipment never intended to serve military vessels. Nevertheless, one-by-one the defenders' ships became unserviceable. Vessels set aside as too crippled to fight were reactivated as others became even less capable. Some became orbital gun platforms, some weakly armed supply runners. Without relief the outcome of the siege was inevitable... but it was obvious to all that it would not come soon or cheaply.

In the meantime, Fleet of the First Class 28 struck with one of its three second-class fleet elements at each of Emerald, Ruby and Mongo. Ruby and Emerald, home to Scout Service bases, fell quickly, although resistance at Ruby proved unexpectedly stubborn. The minor naval base at Mongo was quickly overwhelmed, not least because its defenders had received no warning and were caught with only their quick-reaction force at combat readiness. Detached elements of the 2nd Assault Fleet arrived in due course to take possession of these surrendered worlds, with Mongo becoming the temporary headquarters of 2nd Assault Fleet.

28th Fleet then joined the Siege of Jewell, detaching some elements to secure Grant against enemy reinforcements. Failure to take Jewell in the initial assault pinned down two entire first-class fleets but also created a situation where the Imperials would have to attempt a relief. The situation was deemed satisfactory by the Zhodani high command.

#### OPENING MOVES: EFATE

On 188-1107 Zhodani forces arrived in Efate, Pixie and Louzy. Near-total surprise was achieved, as the defenders could not have received word of the war from Jewell for at least two weeks. The Pixie detachment met with overwhelming success, eliminating the system's naval base in the opening hours of the war. After refuelling, the main elements of the force began an advance towards Paya and Inthe whilst lighter forces covered the flanks and launched minor raids. A strike on Inthe met relatively light but well prepared defences and was repelled without doing much damage, whilst the Paya detachment succeeded in destroying a portion of the system's naval bases. Whilst light units feinted into the Aramis, Rhylanor and Lanth subsectors, the main force fell back on Roup to take up a blocking position.

The attack on Efate went initially very well for the Zhodani, with a segment of the sector fleet and system defence forces caught unprepared at their moorings. The heavily fortified naval base died hard, enabling deployed forces to inflict losses and retreat to mainworld orbit. Lacking a base, these forces were at a severe disadvantage but were able to defeat the initial attack. Recognising the importance of Louzy to the Efate campaign, the local commander detached a light cruiser squadron, two strike carrier task forces and some destroyers to harass enemy shipping passing through the system – a decision that affected the outcome of the battle for Efate and perhaps the whole conflict.

As an obvious route of approach, Louzy was strongly garrisoned when the Zhodani fleet arrived. The mainworld's facilities could not support a system defence boat contingent but a handful of tenders operating out of Efate permitted a large force of SDBs to be permanently assigned to the system along with a single very old battle rider. The latter was quickly destroyed when the security and support group of 67 th Fleet arrived to clear the way for the assault fleet following. The remainder of the system defence force was ordered to scatter and harass the enemy wherever possible.

The two support tenders in-system were quickly chased down, with a portion of the SDB force lost in their hopeless defence. With limited firepower and endurance the SDBs could do little at first but the arrival of strike carrier task forces Mimiiad and Devastation along with a light cruiser squadron increased the available options. These forces arrived on 196-1107 but by 204-1107 only the light cruisers Doan and Iinshur, along with Devastation's flagship, survived. These three ships, along with the increasingly weary system defence boats, tied down a large Zhodani force for months and severely impaired the ability of the Zhodani fleet to support the siege of Efate.

Meanwhile the 1 st Assault Fleet had passed through Louzy, losing a couple of supply ships along the way, and taken up position in the Efate system. There it remained, its commander presiding over a siege rather than planetary conquest. As with Jewell, sector fleet elements and the few Colonial forces that had survived were reassigned to the 193 rd Fleet whose local commander oversaw the defence of Efate from an improvised command post on-planet. However, whilst the 125th Fleet was able only to operate in the Jewell system leaving the rest of the subsector all but undefended, the 193rd was able to mount some minor operations in other systems despite the siege.

#### OPENING MOVES: REGINA

The Imperial Navy received only a few hours' warning to prepare for an attack on Regina but that was a few hours more than systems nearby received. Sector fleet elements based at Regina were relatively light; a force of cruisers and carriers intended to protect local trade and show the flag in nearby systems. They were, however, almost fully crewed and well deployed when the Zhodani Fleet of the First Class 65 arrived. As elsewhere, a vanguard force was sent against the naval base and was roughly handled in one of the Imperial Navy's finest cruiser actions.

The main fleet fared little better when it arrived, hitting a wall of battle riders which were expected to have been redeployed in penny packets elsewhere. The fighting was ferocious for the first 36 hours of the campaign, with heavy losses on both sides. No gains were made by the Zhodani fleet and, critically, Regina retained its naval base. The aftermath of the First Battle of Regina witnessed one of the most controversial acts of the whole conflict. After the vice-admiral commanding locally deployed sector fleet assets refused to undertake offensive operations without authorisation from central command, Duke Norris of Regina transferred his force to the 193rd Fleet – the Regina subsector fleet – also without authorisation from the sector fleet commander. This required an unlawful arrest of a serving Imperial Navy vice-admiral by the duke's huscarles.

Controversial and perhaps reckless as this action was, it placed powerful warships under the command of Admiral Zhenhua Pael; an officer who agreed with Norris on many matters. Even whilst the heavy units of the Zhodani fleet were massing for a renewed attack on Regina itself, 193rd Fleet made a breakout and jumped to Roup. This proved to be a masterstroke, catching the 3 rd Assault Fleet dispersed in the Roup system and mauling its support vessels. After this cheeky counterpunch, Admiral Pael led her cruiser fleet on a whistle-stop tour of the demilitarised zone, conducting a reconnaissance in force that eliminated a few Zhodani ships and disrupted the flow of supplies.

Although materially insignificant, Pael's cruiser sweep was a rare success in those early days of the war and forced the Zhodani to transfer forces to guard its supply line more effectively. In the meantime, Zhodani 65th Fleet had launched multiple attacks known collectively as the Second Battle of Regina. Although costly for both sides, the offensive failed and after more skirmishing the 65th and 3rd Zhodani fleets pulled back from the Regina system. Two days later the arrival of heavy units retiring from Jewell reinforced the system's defences.

The Zhodani 47th Fleet was vastly more successful at Extolay, overwhelming the defenders who were caught by complete surprise. The 3rd Assault Fleet arrived later, after conceding defeat at Regina and commenced a ground assault. By 279 the last organised resistance was suppressed, although some guerilla activity continued. Although Extolay fell, it never surrendered. Its senior government officials and planetary nobles were smuggled offworld by some means, continuing government of the world in exile.

Other elements of the 47th Fleet made a push towards Macene, eliminating minor opposition along the way. Trailing its coat at Keanou, the 47th drew out elements of the sector flag fleet and fought a sharp but inconclusive engagement before falling back to Yori. There, it successfully rebuffed a force advancing in pursuit. This temporarily cut off Regina from reinforcements, necessitating a response from the sector fleet. A major drive to clear Yori met with no opposition; by this time the 47th Fleet had been recalled to Extolay.

On 259-1107 the Imperial sector flag fleet, under the personal command of Sector Admiral Frederick Santanocheev, arrived in triumph at Regina. Rather than relieving a besieged world, Santanocheev found a stable situation along with news of disaster in Jewell and Efate. Ignoring a request to push on to Extolay and break the siege there, Santanocheev remained at Regina for two weeks during which time Admiral Pael returned from her cruise. Despite protests from Duke Norris and legal questions about rank and authority, Pael was arrested for violations of the navy chain of command, which was later escalated to a charge of treason.

The sector fleet assets 'borrowed' by the 193rd Fleet, along with the remnants of the Jewell detachment, were reinforced with a battleship squadron from the flag fleet and sent to relieve Jewell under the command of Vice- Admiral Janciy Aasha, former commander of the sector fleet detachment assigned to Regina. Designated the 16 th Provisional Battle Fleet, this force set out on 279. It got as far as Grant, encountering Zhodani forces deployed there in a blocking position. Unable to secure fuel, the 16th Provisional Battle Fleet fell back on Forboldn then attempted to rejoin the flag fleet at Regina. Finding it gone, Admiral Aasha sent to Macene for orders, in the meantime co-opting Colonial Fleet ships from the 193rd. This created a significant battle force at Regina under sector fleet command but left the 193 rd Fleet with no significant warfighting assets.

Soon after 16th Provisional Battle Fleet departed for Jewell, news arrived at Regina that the enemy was established at Roup. Sector Admiral Santanocheev decided to launch a counter-offensive. Zhodani forces retired from Roup with significant losses, opening the way for a relief of Efate. Although now within striking distance of Efate or Jewell, Santanocheev decided to retire to Macene out of concern over reports of Zhodani forces pushing in the direction of the naval depot.

Detaching some of his battleship and cruiser squadrons to join the defence of Efate, Santanocheev sent minor forces into nearby systems to conduct reconnaissance whilst his dreadnoughts and the majority of the flag fleet retired. The main elements of his fleet arrived at Macene on 314-1107. Santanocheev's decision at Roup has been hotly debated, and his actions interpreted in a variety of ways. There are those who claim he cynically abandoned the Regina region to ensure the fall of Duke Norris, the main opponent of his patron, Duchess Delphine. The reality is probably more complex.

At that time, Acting Sector Admiral Santanocheev commanded the only force in the region capable of halting a drive on Macene – the loss of which could lose the war. He had not been confirmed in his position, or rather he had not received the confirmation issued by Duchess Delphine on dubious authority – and might be overstepping his authority or derailing a plan made elsewhere. There was also the old adage
'do not reinforce defeat' and until the situation at Efate or Jewell became clear it was not acceptable to risk the only sector fleet asset capable of taking on a first- class Zhodani battle fleet.

On the other hand, Santanocheev did have the means to defeat the forces attacking Efate or Jewell, providing he acted in concert with defending fleets. That meant acting boldly; the defenders might be worn down to nothing if not relieved. Santanocheev could have broken the enemy at Efate then driven on Jewell, his detractors say, or even just remained at Roup in a central position ready to exploit an opportunity or counter a disaster. Instead, he threw a weak force into the siege of Efate, ensuring it became tied down and unavailable elsewhere until the siege was broken – which it was not powerful enough to accomplish. Meanwhile the best ships of the sector fleet scurried home to base, where their commander was confirmed in his position as sector admiral by a rather questionable decree from the Duchess of Mora.

Santanocheev's actions have been defended by those who claim he 'saved Regina' although in fact that had already been achieved. More certainly, he had a responsibility to maintain the fleet in being until reinforcements could arrive. The Imperium could withstand the loss of Efate or Jewell, whilst they would be lost for certain if the sector fleet took heavy losses before major reinforcements arrived. Some say Roup was the moment Frederick Santanocheev passed up the chance to win the war; others claim it was the moment he prevented defeat.

THE PHONEY STALEMATE

By late 1107 the situation had apparently stabilised but in reality the Imperium was just barely not losing the war. Forward deployed elements of the sector fleet had been transferred to subsector control, an admission that centralised command had broken down. Jewell was under siege along with Efate and Extolay had fallen as well as several less important worlds. Allegations and accusations were rife; Duke Norris had committed treason with his unlawful elevation of Admiral Pael – but Duchess Delphine had done something similar with Santanocheev. Pael was facing a summary trial and possible execution for treason, and thereby Santanocheev was depriving the Imperium of an effective and aggressive leader. The strategic situation remained fluid; reinforcements were coming from Deneb but the Corridor Strategic Reserve was months away.

The situation was not much more favourable in the Zhodani Consulate. Senior commanders argued over whether to commit the provincial reserve and where. Regina was the obvious choice but it would surely have been reinforced. Jewell might be a better choice as victory there would free fleets to finish the Efate campaign and drive in force towards Macene. This would bypass Regina. Alternatively, a strong feint into the Regina region might draw out the oddly reticent sector fleet, allowing it to be bypassed for an attack on its base.

Meanwhile, detached forces skirmished between the fortress worlds, seeking to gain control of refuelling points or deny them to the enemy. Information was scarce and timely information even more so. Any major fleet movement by the Imperials was a gamble, whilst the Consulate had sufficient forces to launch a three- pronged advance. Only one of the fleets had to reach Macene or Rhylanor to tip the balance but such a coordinated offensive would take time to organise and could come unstuck due to unknown factors. Zhodani high command chose to wait and see if one of the sieges resulted in a breakthrough. If so, their forces would cascade towards Macene. If not, they would commit reserves to breaking the deadlock. Victory was going to be expensive, and it was not possible to predict where and how it would happen, but the Consulate held most of the cards on the Riverland front.

IMPERIAL REINFORCEMENTS

The first request for assistance reached Deneb Sector Fleet headquarters on 229-1107 and the first fleet elements began moving spinward on 232. These were advance forces, sent to secure the necessary refuelling points and tanker rendezvous, and would not be followed by major fleet elements for another 16 days. Once marshalled, the initial reinforcements moved in two groups; one headed for Macene and one sent to take up a position in the Pretoria subsector. Full authorisation to move the majority of the fleet was granted on 269-1107.

A major fleet redeployment is a slow and complex business and can result in defeat in detail if not conducted with caution. As elements of the Deneb Sector Fleet advanced spinward, they encountered couriers with increasingly recent information about a poor strategic situation but were ordered to stick to their contingency plan. There was, however, some leeway. A portion of the force sent to Pretoria would advance across Aramis in a 'reconnaissance in force' conducted by cruisers backed up by a couple of battle squadrons, and if 'reconnaissance' all the way to Efate were possible it would be attempted. The bulk of the reinforcements, however, were marshalled at Pretoria awaiting orders from the Spinward Marches theatre commander.

The advance elements entered Aramis on 298 and reached Efate on 356. In the meantime light forces had reached Macene on 304-1107, a little ahead of the sector flag fleet. These units did little to increase the fighting power of the flag fleet and heavy units were weeks behind. Their arrival bolstered morale and optimism but may have been a factor in the inactivity of the flag squadron. Delaying a counteroffensive a few weeks increased the chances of success and would reduce casualties. With the situation stabilising, many considered this the wise and cautious inaction of a commander who sought victory rather than glory. They may or may not have been correct.

#### RIVERLAND ENDGAME

The Riverland campaign came to an end as 1107 turned to 1108. Imperial citizens had become used to the enemy nibbling away at the defences of Efate, Jewell and Regina, with skirmishes and raids on systems as deep as Paya and Echiste. Assurances that help was on the way and that the fortresses could hold out reassured many citizens. Meanwhile Colonial Fleet units transferred to their local subsector fleets in readiness for any attacks that might break through and reserve ships were reactivated at major bases. On 314- 1107, the sector flag fleet returned to Macene, where it found advance squadrons of the Deneb Sector Fleet. Other elements were en route to reinforce Efate. These were drawn into the siege but did manage to undertake some minor operations in the surrounding systems. A larger force was assembling in Pretoria for a drive to clear the coreward systems right through to Efate.

A mood of optimism prevailed at Macene and other major political and military centres away from the fighting, but the reality was quite different. After its defeat at Roup, the Zhodani 7th Fleet fell back towards Efate but was redirected towards Jewell where it joined forces with the 68 th and 28 th for the Third Battle of Jewell. This was a massacre of Imperial forces, which had no choice but to fight to the last against overwhelming odds. The battle took place over 20 hours or so, with the total annihilation or surrender of all space-based forces on 318-1107. The invasion began immediately with attacks on orbital defence installations and despite losses among attacking forces these were all put out of action within hours.

By 328-1107 all major governmental facilities on Jewell were in enemy hands. Elements of the ground forces held out until 351, with some minor activity thereafter, but 328-1107 is the official date of the Fall of Jewell. The Zhodani high command had hoped to draw Imperial forces out with a siege but the capture of Jewell was at least as significant. Freed from the siege, the 68th and 28th began a cautious advance followed by elements of the 2 nd Assault Fleet. As they overran minor resistance and pushed towards Regina, the 7th Fleet remained in place to secure Jewell. It transferred significant elements to the 28th and 68th but was now a first-class fleet in name only. Both other fleets, however, were almost back up to their paper strength. On 359- 1107 the fleets reached Grant, pausing to refuel and prepare for an attack on Regina or Efate. At that point the Riverland campaign is considered to have ended, as a decisive Imperial defeat.

### ADVENTURES IN THE RIVERLAND CAMPAIGN

The Riverland campaign is characterised by major naval battles and severe threats of raiding or invasion. Massive call-ups of reserves begin almost immediately, with all ships receiving a naval-reserve subsidy immediately placed under naval command. Travellers operating such ships will be assigned to supply runs and general support, whilst independent operators will be offered inducements to join the war effort. A 'merchant ship' game will be extremely hazardous in this environment, to the point where smuggling and war-effort missions are scarcely any more dangerous.

Travellers at the fortress worlds will find themselves in a major war zone. Movement between systems may be impossible, or require dangerous covert operations. Even travelling between cities means exposure to scrutiny and perhaps passive opposition from security forces which do not want civilians wandering around at will. This is especially true where there is insurgent activity or pro-Zhodani agitation.

Travellers might find themselves trapped on a world like Jewell, facing eventual conquest, or behind enemy lines where systems fall quickly. Zhodani Travellers might be tasked with political agitation, making contact with insurgent groups, or other covert activities, whilst those with loose allegiances may find themselves presented with a mix of problems and opportunities.

Overall, adventures in the Riverland campaign are set against 'grand strategy' level events, with huge resources committed by both sides. There are opportunities for ordinary Travellers to thread their way through these huge events and perhaps to witness them first hand. Alternatively, a high-level game might be played out with the Travellers as senior officers, politicians and economic leaders, or acting on their behalf.

### CORRIDOR STRATEGIC RESERVE

Within minutes of the declaration of war, couriers left Jewell and Regina. Some were destined for other subsector and sector capitals, others for the depots of the Spinward Marches and Deneb Sector Fleets. A group set out with one task; to reach the headquarters of the Corridor Strategic Reserve as quickly as possible. A second wave of couriers was launched soon after, in a well-rehearsed 'sudden war' plan. Some of these shadowed the high-speed, long-range vessels, ensuring that at least some would get through. Others went to bases and alerted fleets there, triggering a second, a third and subsequent waves of couriers. Information rippled out from each of these secondary sources.

'Least-time' couriers were tasked with reaching a specific point as quickly as possible. Usually this was a courier standing ready, fully fuelled, in an outsystem or even in deep space in order to make best use of the jump-6 capability of Imperial Navy fleet couriers. What had been the most boring job in the navy – sitting in deep space for weeks at a time waiting for an emergency message – instantly became the most critical. The courier would jump out as soon as the first had transmitted its data.

This chain of rapid communications between capitals and major bases operated like this at all times and was fully up to the task of carrying word to distant places. Most of the couriers never knew what they were carrying; their job was to maintain rapid communications no matter whether they concerned a major war or a requisition for a million new uniform boots. The Imperial Navy had invested a great deal in its communications network along the frontiers and now it paid off.

The second wave of information rippled out from naval bases and major worlds, whilst the fail-safe system swung into action. This was the 'heavy naval couriers' - light cruisers and rift cruisers – tasked with getting the news through even if the fast comms chain was broken. These ships averaged a little better than jump- 3, refuelling at gas giants and bypassing inner systems, whilst the high-speed chain achieved an almost perfect jump-6 propagation of information.

The first couriers reached Depot in Corridor on 255-1107. Three days later the first light elements began moving spinward to secure the route of advance. Major fleet elements began moving on 273. In the meantime tanker groups began pre-positioning to assist the early stages of the transit. Forces would continue to move out in blocks over the next few months.

Progress spinward was rapid at first, using prepositioned tankers to maintain a jump-4 rate of advance. However, it soon became necessary to use field refuelling either for tanker groups or squadrons, and this time-consuming operation necessitated a decision whether to proceed in smaller groups or remain concentrated but move more slowly. The decision was made to send a vanguard at best speed and follow with the main force.

The advance force reached Depot in Deneb on 321-1107. After a brief pause to reorganise and reprovision it pushed on, reaching Macene in the Spinward Marches on 012-1108. They were followed by the first heavy units of the Corridor Strategic Reserve on 053-1108. A portion of this force was broken off and sent to Pretoria, where it arrived on 019-1108.

These forces were too late to prevent defeat in the Riverland campaign, although Efate and Regina were still holding out. The Spinward Marches Flag Fleet was now reinforced by heavy units from the Deneb Sector Fleet and Corridor Strategic Reserve. Perhaps more importantly, it could count on additional heavy forces arriving in the near future. If Sector Admiral Santoncheev, acting as overall commander for the entire theatre of war, had been holding his force back to preserve the fleet in being, his concerns were now alleviated. Unfortunately, this was not his only reason for inactivity.

Santoncheev was at that time reliant on his own intelligence apparatus, the Office for Naval Information. Although loyal to him, it was staffed with personnel appointed for favour rather than competence or impartiality. Santoncheev was not known to be receptive nor appreciative towards those who did not tell him what he liked to hear, so Naval Information was rather biased in its analyses. The official Naval Intelligence apparatus, on the other hand, was competent and impartial but the truths it told did not please its master.

The extent to which Naval Information was infiltrated by the Zhodani was probably small but the Consulate was expert in disinformation warfare and exploited the inexperience and bias of Santanocheev's system. The result was that although the sector admiral had a powerful force under his hand and could afford to risk it, he was paralysed by the lack of solid information.

Santanocheev's solution was to conduct a campaign of 'sanitisation' of local systems, clearing Zhodani forces out and garrisoning them against further incursions. He began a painfully slow push to spinward and coreward, justifying this by rather convoluted logic; by creating a situation where the enemy definitely was not in certain systems, the fleet could then strike it where it was without fear of being bypassed. Santanocheev's near-obsession with defending his fleet base was not entirely without merit but heavily influenced by the desires of his patron, the Duchess of Mora.

### ADVENTURES WITH IMPERIAL REINFORCEMENTS

The political infighting within Imperial high command creates good opportunities for adventures. Travellers might be given the mission of finding information to discredit someone or to ensure the 'right' intelligence information lands on the sector admiral's desk. Alternatively they may foster discord, perhaps on behalf of the enemy or someone who stands to profit from the situation. These events could be played out at a high level with admirals and nobles coming into conflict, or with ordinary adventurers at the centre of a highly dangerous position. The right push here or there might place a fleet where it can annihilate an enemy force... or vice versa.

Lack of good information and a need to pander to the agenda of the people who put and kept him in power hamstrung the admiral's ability to conduct the war in an effective manner. For this reason the Deneb and Corridor contingents were not put to full use for some time and in the meantime the Outworld Coalition continued to advance.

# THE COREWARD FRONTIER CAMPAIGN

The Coreward Frontier extends from Aramis, through Deneb and into Corridor. The primary threat here is raiding by Vargr groups – both opportunists and those offered incentives by the Zhodani Consulate. There is also a possibility that Zhodani naval forces might set up a base in friendly territory and attack Deneb or Corridor. This is unlikely to be on a very large scale but a strike against supporting assets in Corridor at the right time could interrupt the flow of reinforcements. The Imperial Navy must balance this possibility against the certainty of needing ships in the Riverland theatre, ideally maintaining a force sufficient to counter a large-scale raid without drawing too many vessels away from the point of decision.

Zhodani forces are more likely to be encountered close to the Riverland theatre, perhaps attempting to hook into the rear of the Jewell Salient by way of Aramis. There are few important worlds in this subsector and losing it is not as damaging as, say, Jewell or Lanth. As a result, Imperial forces in the subsector are likely to be depleted as vessels are drawn off to defend Regina or Efate. What remains will be sufficient to counter small-scale Vargr raiding but may not be able to deal with a more concerted assault.

For the most part what happens in this theatre will be on a small scale, involving lighter forces. Insurgency and unrest are likely, as Zhodani agents stir up trouble wherever they find the potential. With the forces of both sides stretched thin, mercenaries will be employed in significant numbers along with irregular forces recruited - again by both sides – from friendly Vargr worlds.

#### OPENING MOVES

The Zhodani force assigned to raid Pretoria was given a late start date for operational security reasons, not least since it was operating with notoriously over-eager Vargr allies. Launching from marshalling points in the Oertsous and Galla systems, lighter elements of the fleet moved into Aramis and the spinward-trailing corner of Pretoria and began raiding operations from 215-1107. Forces committed were mostly raiding cruisers and scout destroyers, which picked off merchant ships and raided minor worlds. Damage inflicted was locally significant but trivial in the wider scheme of events.

Shortly afterward, organised forces of the Vargr 40 th Squadron launched an offensive into the Regina subsector, which is generally considered to be part of the Coreward Frontier campaign. 40th Squadron overcame light resistance and landed ground troops at Dentus and Kinorb before advancing as far as Beck's World. Despite meeting little resistance, the 40th turned back and began raiding local worlds as well as making a follow-up sweep through Pixie.

Forces of the Zueng, loudly proclaiming their mercenary-not-pirate status, advanced into Aramis and began harassing the worlds around Towers. They also seized control of space around Corfu and its gas giants on 234-1107, presumably in the hope of interrupting communications in the region. These relatively formal operations were accompanied by a horde of small Vargr ships conducting outright piracy and planetary raiding. Most of these attacks were attributed to – and credit claimed by – the Kforuzeng group. In all likelihood this was a corsair free-for-all with the Kforuzeng playing a relatively small part.

In the meantime, the main elements of Zhodani Raiding Force Pretoria refuelled at Retion and launched an incursion into Pretoria. The initial attack was at Ash, destroying the scout base there on 223-1107. The force then feinted at Pretoria by way of Miwald before swinging trailingward. A planned raiding cruise into Lamas was curtailed after a sharp action with Imperial cruisers out of Waalikii on 251-1107, after which the force detached its cruiser element for further minor raiding and began to withdraw from Imperial space. Elements of this force re-entered Imperial territory in Aramis from 312-1107.

In the interim these raids had caused concern in Deneb but did not significantly affected plans to send reinforcements spinward. Vargr incursions into Aramis and Regina were more effective in distracting Imperial forces. Cruisers and destroyers from the Aramis contingent of the sector fleet, along with lighter vessels under local command, attempted to locate raiders and were drawn into small but vicious pitched battles with ships from the Zueng and 40th Squadron, as well as Zhodani raiding cruisers.

#### IMPERIAL REINFORCEMENTS

With few rich worlds in the subsector, Aramis had little in the way of a Colonial Fleet. There was no prospect of reinforcement by sector fleet elements; indeed the small contingent based at Aramis had already been ordered to transfer to the Regina subsector. Despite being hard-pressed it was forced to obey but quietly left behind the light carrier Kaaipse and the heavy cruiser Armi Likhii under temporary local command. These vessels attempted a defence of the subsector as best they could, scoring some successes against small Zueng forces or lone Zhodani cruisers. However, the coreward half of the subsector was essentially overrun by 280-1107. The arrival of the Pretoria Raiding Force on 312-1107 reduced the defenders to trying to protect Towers and Junidy whilst Aramis itself was the only really secure system.

On 320-1107, Sector Admiral Santanocheev responded to this situation by releasing the 212 th Fleet from subsector duty and transferring it as a warfighting fleet to Aramis. In addition to Colonial Fleet vessels – contributed only under protest by the Rhylanor subsector world governments – and some reserve ships, the 212th received a battle squadron and a cruiser squadron, further weakening the flag fleet. This force immediately made its presence felt, scattering raiders from around Aramis and driving into the central region of the subsector.

Older Colonial Fleet vessels became guardships whilst the modern vessels searched for major opponents. In an effort to find and eliminate what were expected to be relatively light enemy units, the 212th was divided into task forces each centred on a capital ship. Perhaps its commander was still thinking in terms of peacekeeping rather than warfighting, or perhaps the available intelligence was faulty, but capital ships from the Zhodani Pretoria Raiding Force, along with 40th Squadron cruisers and Zueng raiders, encountered two task forces in the Nasemin system on 351-1107 – the same day the last resistance on Jewell failed. Most of the Imperial force, including the battleships Masji Kimlu and Caxias, were lost in action.

The situation could have been much worse. Unknown to the commanders of the 212th Fleet, elements of the Deneb Sector Fleet had recently passed along the coreward edge of the subsector, eliminating a few enemy vessels and causing others to scatter. This threat resulted in a pause in Vargr activity in Aramis and allowed the 212th to recover from the shock of its losses. A period of raiding and hunting then ensued, with the 212 th trying to run down the Zhodani and clear the way for a fleet movement across the subsector.

This game of cat and heavily-armed mouse went on inconclusively throughout 1108, keeping the raiders from achieving much without destroying them. An engagement at Yebab on 129-1109 finally broke the Zhodani/Vargr forces in the region. The 40th Squadron element was all but obliterated, fighting loyally alongside its Zhodani allies whereas the more pragmatic Zueng cheekily asked for a 'termination of hostilities' payment before retreating. It is unlikely this demand was met. Minor forces fought on until the end of the year but by 350-1109 the Coreward Frontier campaign was more or less over. The 212th Fleet was stripped of most of its remaining heavy units to become a security force once more – but one now associated with the Aramis subsector. It spent the remainder of the conflict chasing down minor raiders.

##### ADVENTURES IN THE COREWARD FRONTIER CAMPAIGN

The Coreward Frontier campaign is characterised by raiding; some of it organised and some rather less so. The situation is chaotic much of the time, creating opportunities for piracy and raiding if the Travellers are so inclined, or small-ship naval operations intended to counter such activity. Minor attacks are common on several worlds, providing employment for mercenaries or opportunities for gunrunners.

Worlds are more likely to be looted by Vargr than taken over by the Zhodani, although raider bands might set up a base or take control over a city long enough to plunder it. Anyone trapped on these worlds will have to avoid or find a way to co-exist with the invaders, or perhaps throw together a militia to remove them. Overall, the situation is much smaller in scale than in the Riverland theatre of war, and well suited to ordinary Travellers rather than major political and military figures.

# THE LANTH CAMPAIGN

The Lanth and Vilis subsectors form a secondary theatre of war with unique problems for both sides. A Zhodani advance along the Spinward Main from Sheyou towards Regina is a virtual certainty and can be considered part of the Riverland campaign. However, it is possible a feint might be made towards Regina, with the main thrust headed for Lanth or Vilis. These systems are also threatened by Sword Worlds forces and by Zhodani battle squadrons staging through Sword Worlds space.

Vilis, even its capital, is not of any great economic value. Strategically, it is important only as a forward base and a shield to protect Lanth and the Spinward Main. However, losing it would be a political blow that might turn popular opinion against the war and in any future war the enemy would be able to marshal forces that much closer to strategic targets. These include Lanth, which is an economically important world as well as a strategic anchor for the defence of the Lunion subsector and the main arm of the Spinward Main.

Losing Lanth was always seen as unacceptable by Imperial planners and losing Vilis was considered a big step on the way to that happening. Thus, the Imperial Navy was forced to implement a plan to hold these critical systems even if it meant weakening the Riverland forces. After all, a breakthrough in Lanth could give Zhodani forces a clear run at Macene, Rhylanor and Mora. Holding the Lanth-Vilis line meant operating at the end of a long supply chain despite the systems being within Imperial space.

The result of this complex strategic situation is likely to be large-scale naval combat around Vilis and Lanth, with raiding into the rear to disrupt support and reinforcement operations. Pleas for reinforcements might be granted, only for the ships to be diverted to Regina or Efate. The Lanth campaign might become a 'forgotten front', overlooked in the light of big events elsewhere, but it may be where the fate of the sector is determined. The fall of Lanth in this war might mean the loss of Mora in the next.

As with Riverland, the Zhodani are well aware of this and plan to use the strategic importance of these worlds to draw the Imperial Navy into a meatgrinder, or as a diversion to pull in reinforcements needed elsewhere. There are no good options for the Imperials early in the conflict. They will have to try not to lose these worlds and hope to eventually use them to launch attacks into the Sword Worlds Confederation or against the flank of forces headed towards Regina.

OPENING MOVES

The Lanth campaign was intended as a diversion which would draw in Imperial reinforcements. The overall plan can be conceived as a jab-cross-left hook combination thrown by a boxer. An initial strike in the Riverland theatre would pull the Imperials' guard to that side, hopefully allowing a straight right to end the matter. That straight right was to take the form of an advance by the 40 th Fleet towards Rhylanor, facilitated by the Lanth campaign. If the right failed, regrouped forces from the Riverland campaign would hook into Macene and Rhylanor, and win the war. The plan was sound in conception, although the Riverland 'jab' was less effective than hoped.

The Lanth campaign began with simultaneous drives towards Frenzie and Lanth, timed to arrive a day after the declaration of war had been delivered. Combat Force Frenzie arrived in the Frenzie system on 188- 1107, broadcasting the declaration of war in accordance with relevant treaties and immediately heading for the naval base. An entire second-class fleet may have represented overkill but unexpectedly stubborn resistance resulted in significant losses before the base was brought under fire. Those Imperial vessels that could broke off the engagement and fled, with the remainder surrendering after a 30-hour battle.

Capturing the base more or less intact was a bonus for the Zhodani forces, who blockaded Frenzie but concentrated on securing their new forward base. At a stroke this action greatly reduced the Imperial threat to Querion and secured the rimward flank of an advance through the demilitarised zone. Ground forces began landing on Frenzie a fortnight later, receiving the surrender of the small population as soon as they touched the ground.

Combat Force Frenzie had by then detached most of its heavy elements to attack Mirriam, which had a few days' warning thanks to vessels retreating from Frenzie. It found the system defence force frantically preparing and launched an immediate attack. Fighting continued throughout 202-1107 and into 203. Late that day, with the mauled remains of the system defence force fighting a last ditch action under the guns of the naval base and the fortified starport, the Sector Fleet's Denotam contingent arrived. Warned by couriers from Regina, the local commander took a gamble and moved all operational vessels to Mirriam.

Arriving in the rear of the battle, the Denotam Contingent attacked the supports of Combat Group Frenzie rather than trying to save the defenders of Mirriam. Although seemingly callous, this greatly weakened that force's ability to carry out offensive operations and improved the strategic situation. A protracted engagement, known as the Battle of Mirriam, then ensued in which severe losses were inflicted on Combat Force Frenzie. The Zhodani retreated to Frenzie and curtailed operations for a time.

For its part, the Denotam Contingent was too battered to continue operations. Absorbing what remained of the Frenzie Contingent, its forces began attempting to secure Mirriam, Denotam and the systems around them. The greatly weakened Zhodani force at Frenzie did more or less the same other than attempting to harass Vilis. Elements of the Zhodani 40th Fleet probed cautiously at the Mirriam-Denotam position but were held at bay by vigorous countermoves and a deception campaign intended to mask the weakness of the available Imperial force.

Inconclusive as the Frenzie-Mirriam-Vilis operation was, it weakened local Imperial forces and removed the threat of a counterattack towards Querion for the time being. In the meantime, Combat Force Lanth launched its operation from Dyrnwyn, staging through Tavonni for a direct attack on Lanth. This arrived on 188-1107 and followed the usual pattern of an attack against the naval base followed by in-system combat.

Comparisons of Imperial and Zhodani forces has always been difficult but the force committed at Lanth has been estimated as worth around 25 Imperial first-class battleships in fighting strength. The Lanth Contingent of the sector fleet had four, plus some cruisers. Caught on a peacetime footing this force had just hours to prepare and was grossly outnumbered to boot. However, it was assisted by heavy defensive units including 12 repurposed battle riders and a local force of monitors and system defence boats. The odds were still poor; most observers claim the Zhodani had around a three-to- two advantage when battle was joined.

The Imperial force did its best but was decisively outfought by the Zhodani. In particular the Third Class Fleet under Flag Officer of the Third Rank Zdavl covered itself in glory. Nevertheless, it was five days before the Imperial system defence force and assigned sector fleet assets were pushed away from the mainworld. They retreated to the mostly-intact naval base and regrouped, whilst their opponents were too scattered to press for a final victory.

The Battle of Lanth is considered to have ended on 193-1107, with the Imperial fleet still in being but unable to do more than defend its base. No Zhodani ground forces were available to assault Lanth, which still had extensive aerospace defences. However, a large Sword Worlds ground force was positioned at Tavonni to follow the attack. This was accompanied by the Sword Worlds Confederation Dyrnwyn Fleet, which had been extensively reinforced for the operation.

Warned by couriers from Lanth, the Imperial Navy base at D'Ganzio could do little but go to high alert and request forces from trailingward. The handful of light vessels based there attempted to interfere with enemy operations against Lanth, fighting a minor skirmish against the Dyrnwyn Fleet on 204-1107. The main elements of the Dyrnwyn Fleet arrived at D'Ganzio on 214-1107, beginning a lengthy campaign of skirmishing and harassment against the naval base, whose in- system defences remained formidable.

SURFACE WARFARE ON LANTH

The ground campaign against Lanth began on 200- 1107 with the landing of the first Sword Worlds forces. Other worlds in the area surrendered or were taken without much difficulty but it was four days before Sword Worlders could even establish secure landing sites. Despite a numerical advantage and orbital fire support, the Sword Worlders faced aggressive counterattacks which made their initial landings unviable. Indeed, an entire corps became trapped in the Hestain Kessel, drawing supporting forces onto the guns of the planetary defences.

Planetary and Imperial Army forces were quickly ground down, with army-level formations replaced by scratch brigades. Cities fell, then the capital and the starport too, but Lanth did not. With naval forces from the base still contesting the system it was possible to run supplies and reinforcements through to Lanth and to interfere with Sword Worlder attempts to do the same. By 300-1107 the Sword Worlds held about 75% of Lanth's major population centres, with Imperial forces clinging to shrinking areas of control.

#### STALEMATE ON THE VILIS-LANTH FRONT

By this time the Lanth theatre had stabilised to a great extent. Zhodani naval forces were transferred spinward to assist in the reduction of Vilis. Although it had no naval base, Vilis was a 'minor fortress world' with a powerful system defence force. Light elements of the Zhodani force began probing the defences on 223 with a raid which was followed by a full-scale attack by the Sword Worlds Joyeuse fleet on 238. This led to a month-long siege with significant losses on both sides. On 271-1107 the Joyeuse Fleet retired to take up a defensive position at Mjolnir, sending light forces coreward to patrol the systems around Vilis. By this time most were under Sword Worlds control or contested by ground forces.

After the failure of the Zhodani attack on Lanth's naval base, additional vessels were transferred to the Sword Worlds Gram Fleet. Most came from the Dyrnwyn Fleet and some, later, from the Joyeuse Fleet. The Gram Fleet was given responsibility for keeping Imperial reinforcements out of Lanth and reducing the bases at Lanth and D'Ganzio. For many months this force fought skirmishes and maintained a mostly-effective blockade at Lanth but was unsuccessful in reducing the defences of the naval base. Likewise a foray against Ghandi naval base, arriving in 263-1107, was unsuccessful. After scouting the system and skirmishing with elements of the defensive force deployed there, the Gram Fleet left on 270-1107 and returned to its blockade of Lanth.

Much was made of this 'repulse' in Imperial circles but the operation matches a standard Sword Worlds stratagem. Forces will advance and threaten a target the enemy must defend, drawing reinforcements from elsewhere, then pull back without a fight. Pursuing forces might be ambushed but even if not the enemy has been forced to take ships away from other theatres where they may be needed. The double-bluff variant of this tactic, where the Sword Worlds force pulls back then makes another advance as the enemy is redeploying, can disrupt enemy forces or tie them down for an extended period.

Having failed to break through the defences of Vilis, Zhodani forces from Combat Force Lanth made a series of small-scale raids throughout the theatre of war, attempting to draw in enemy reinforcements and pick off weak forces. In conjunction with the fleet now based at Frenzie, Combat Force Lanth applied pressure at Mirriam, Lanth and Vilis for the next few months without gaining a significant advantage. Most of the surrounding worlds were pacified by Sword Worlds ground forces in this time, extending the border of the Confederation, at least in theory, out to an arc from Frenzie to Arba.

THE FALL OF LANTH

The stalemate continued until 155-1108, when a large Zhodani force detached from the Rapp's World component of the 40th Battle Fleet arrived in the Lanth system. The Sword Worlds Gram Fleet, then blockading Lanth, joined forces with the Zhodani for a final assault on the system's naval base. Once this was reduced, a huge wave of reinforcements began landing on Lanth.

The Fall of Lanth began on 155-1108 with a multi-day assault on the naval base, which resulted in hand-to- hand fighting. Resistance formally ended when the Sword Worlds commander on-site offered to allow the remaining personnel to leave with their wounded, receiving the full honours of war. Although this provoked a disagreement with the more pragmatic Zhodani commander on site, the concession was granted. Captain Willom Pzerez, acting commander of Imperial Naval forces in the Lanth system, handed over his sword to Admiral Magnus Gunnarsson of the Gram Fleet, who returned it in a gesture that probably meant more in the Sword Worlds than the Imperium.

A flotilla of patched-together transports carried the survivors out of the Lanth system on 162-1108, arriving at D'Ganzio a week later. Captain Pzerez was immediately transferred to Macene for court- martial, which began on 191-1108. After a three-day hearing Pzerez once again received his sword back, along with a recommendation for the Starburst for Extreme Heroism. This move has been criticised as an attempt to spin a decisive loss into something else - 'a Starburst for Extreme Heroism for surrendering a critical system is a sign we've lost' claimed one vid channel's favourite expert. However, the navy agreed that nothing more could have been done by anyone and a commanding officer who surrendered only after running out of ammunition for his pistol should be an inspiration, not a sign of defeat.

Much was made of the defence of Lanth Naval Base and the hope that Lanth itself would fight to the last pistol round. In the event, that wish all but came true. Zhodani and Sword Worlds naval forces moved on from the system, with the Gram Fleet harassing D'Ganzio and the worlds in the direction of Ghandi whilst the 40th Fleet elements withdrew to Frenzie to maintain pressure in that area. Despite overwhelming opposition the defenders of Lanth managed to hold a triangle between the cities of Hestain, Mielce and Armishga, which contained the last functional landing area and aerospace defence base. This was the scene of the 'Miracle at Lanth'.

Against minimal opposition, a flotilla of civilian ships escorted by an assortment of naval vessels managed to run through to Lanth and deliver a last cargo of munitions. Even more incredibly, most of them got away again afterward, although two Colonial Navy cruisers were lost. The Miracle at Lanth did not permit victory – there was never any chance of that – but it did enable local counterattacks. The last of these, Operation Hestain Defiance, drove Sword Worlds forces back from their forward positions and overran the regional headquarters. This triggered uprisings in nearby cities.

The Miracle at Lanth is credited with delaying the fall of the world by perhaps two or three weeks. Naturally, it was lauded as a great propaganda coup in the Imperium; heroic citizens banding together to relieve their defenders. In reality, the event was inconsequential in terms of the overall conflict, other than as a boost to morale. By 215-1108, Imperial forces had been driven back to their start points and the Hestain Triangle began to collapse. A Sword Worlds drive into the centre of the Triangle isolated the main centres of resistance from one another and overran the aerospace defence centre. All three cities surrendered on 221-1108, leaving only isolated pockets of resistance.

D'GANZIO STANDS ALONE

After the Fall of Lanth, Vilis was almost completely isolated. The last official courier out of the system arrived on 284-1108 at Regina. It carried despatches indicating a firm resolve to fight on but in fact Vilis had surrendered on 279. It remains unclear exactly what happened between the departure of this ship and the surrender but accusations have been levelled of corruption and treachery in the upper echelons of government.

It is known that Vilis suffered a coup attempt from 260-268, whose participants have been blamed for destabilising the world. Other sources state that this was an attempt to prevent a surrender as the government had been undermined by Zhodani infiltrators. Whatever the truth may be, the surrender of Vilis sent shockwaves through Imperial centres of government and the general population. A number of prominent figures announced that their homeworlds – none of them near the front – would never surrender and threatened to withdraw support from any political figure who did not immediately begin espousing a 'not one step back' policy.

Meanwhile, Imperial Navy forces based on Denotam requested immediate reinforcement or permission to fall back. The Abyss Rift would be an effective barrier to enemy advances, especially if Ghandi and D'Ganzio were held in force. This would leave only Regina, an intact fortress world, as an avenue for Zhodani offensives. Whilst there was some strategic merit in this, the political repercussions of abandoning Imperial worlds were significant.

Sector Admiral Santanocheev eventually decided to send some forces to assist in the defence of the 'impenetrable Denotam-Mirriam line' as some sectors of the media had begun to call it. Additional squadrons from the Deneb Sector Fleet had been arriving at Macene for some time and were now formed into the 109 th Battle Fleet. This force advanced boldly by way of Ghandi, arriving in the Denotam system on 344-1108. It immediately began operations in the surrounding systems, driving off light elements of the Zhodani 40th Fleet.

Additional reinforcements were assigned to Ghandi and D'Ganzio, stabilising the region but depleting the central reserve at Macene. Although greatly reinforced, the Spinward Marches Flag Fleet continued to operate slowly and with great caution, where a bold advance might have brought about a vital victory. It is widely presumed that Sector Admiral Santanocheev was thinking in terms of not having to report setbacks rather than seeking victory. Had he been bolder or more desperate the course of the war might have been very different.

##### ADVENTURES IN THE LANTH CAMPAIGN

The Lanth campaign is dominated by ground warfare rather than space combat, with the worlds of Lanth and Vilis as the main focus. Thes situation on each is slightly different. Lanth is largely under Sword Worlds control from the start of the campaign, with local and Imperial Army forces on the defensive and in an increasingly desperate position. It is possible to run supplies and reinforcements in with the assistance of a dwindling naval force holding the base but the general trend is downward for the Imperials.

The obvious role for Travellers on Lanth is fighting the enemy – whichever side that is – as mercenaries, irregulars or members of a formal military force. The Travellers might raise an irregular force and so distinguish themselves that they are invited into the formal chain of command – such as it is – with some regular army units assigned to their command. In this role, or as sneaky saboteurs and infiltrators, they might help change the course of the ground war.

Less 'fighty' Travellers might find themselves trapped on Lanth, becoming part of the local social or political scene. In the Imperial enclaves there will be a distinct atmosphere of 'have a good time before the Zhodani brainwash us all', which might conceal attempts to undermine or alternatively bolster the world's will to fight. Travellers might exploit this situation for their own gain or try to secure a way offworld. They might find themselves in a shadowy covert war between Imperial and Zhodani factions, with criminals and self-serving individuals playing both sides.

A similar situation exists on Vilis but without Outworld Coalition forces planetside. There are still raids and infiltrators, and constant fear of invasion. Local systems are contested, meaning that Vilis is sometimes cut off for weeks at a time before a courier gets through. Occasionally the Imperial Navy makes a foray in the area, but it has little available in the way of combat forces. The government of Vilis, of course, keeps appealing for more support.

The Travellers might get involved in the Vilis- Lanth situation as minor ship operators; brave smugglers running weapons to beleaguered worlds or extorting huge fees to get wealthy people to safety. They might be envoys, trying to persuade populations and governments to keep resisting. There is also room for a single-ship or small- detachment naval campaign. The situation on this front is such that even a single vessel in the right place at the right time can make a real difference.

### THE FLANK CAMPAIGN

The nightmare scenario haunting Duchess Delphine of Mora was an all-out Zhodani offensive through Macene and Rhylanor, aimed at what she saw as the capital of the Spinward Marches. The loss of Mora would mean the loss of the whole sector, as far as she was concerned, and it was too lightly protected. Her endless entreaties had produced little in the way of system defence reinforcements, whilst dozens of new monitors and battle riders were sent to Regina, Jewell and Efate. Those were important worlds, she conceded, but Mora was vital to the future of the Imperium Behind the Claw.

Fortunately, Duchess Delphine now had a sector admiral in place who understood this strategic reality, or at least was willing to be educated on the subject. Mora would never be truly safe until the Zhodani were driven back of course but if Fredrick Santanocheev kept his fleet between the Zhodani main force and Mora the war would not be lost. Santanocheev heard the same from his personal intelligence service, as well he might. Personnel were appointed for loyalty to Santanocheev and his patron rather than their objectivity and talent. Of course, they repeated what Duchess Delphine wanted them to, further influencing an already rather timid admiral to do little with his increasingly powerful force.

The Duchess and the Office of Naval Information were actually right – the Zhodani did plan to smash Macene and open the way to all the subsector capitals – but the way to stop them was not sitting waiting for it to happen. More objective observers suggested that whilst the situation seemed stable, the Zhodani were gaining the upper hand. Jewell had fallen, and Regina and Efate were under attack. These two worlds held the flanks of what had been the Jewell Salient and now that Jewell had fallen the Zhodani could mass against either or charge between them.

The answer was to forestall this eventuality by attacking the Zhodani fleets before they could concentrate. To this end, naval staff created the 'return to Roup' plan. Using Roup as a forward base, the fleet could lunge against Zhodani forces in the area or respond quickly to a major assault at Regina or Efate. The plan was submitted for evaluation... and ignored.

According to Santanocheev's advisors, the enemy was fully committed to the sieges of Regina and Efate. Reinforcing those worlds would create a 'meatgrinder' that would deplete the Zhodani forces whilst additional reinforcements continued to arrive.

THE SIEGE OF EFATE

Throughout 1108, squadrons of the Deneb Sector Fleet and the Corridor Strategic Reserve reached Efate and joined the defence. Zhodani forces continued to apply pressure, although the level of threat varied over time. Sufficient strength now lay at Efate to more forcefully contest Louzy, making it difficult to run supplies through the system, and to launch operations in surrounding systems. For their part, the Zhodani seemed content to probe and harass the Imperial forces around Efate.

Those forces were in a difficult position, with no naval base to support them. Instead they relied on a cobbled- together infrastructure based on the world's highport. This inevitably took its toll on vessels that had to continuously remain at combat readiness. Elements of the fleet could cycle through the base at Paya for repairs but had to run the gauntlet of potential ambushes to do so. Likewise, Zhodani ships were forced to retire through Louzy to reach their base at Farreach.

The logistical problems faced by Imperial forces lessened as the Coreward Frontier campaign resulted in reduced raiding against vessels crossing Aramis and as Admiral Santanocheev's ponderous sanitisation campaign secured systems around Paya. All the same, the situation benefited the Zhodani a lot more than the Imperials. Maintaining pressure on Efate might actually be more useful than conquering it, as Imperial reinforcements were directed into a position where they could not greatly influence events elsewhere.

Some elements of the Zhodani fleets were quietly transferred elsewhere, with less capable vessels moved in to maintain the illusion of threat. There were skirmishes and even the occasional major clash, ensuring the defenders never felt safe, but overall the Zhodani high command was satisfied. Efate remained under siege from the first day of the war to the last. Towards the end the Zhodani forces in the area were depleted by transfers elsewhere and did not merit the heavy deployment the Imperials maintained. However, there was always the threat of a huge force massing at Farreach to keep the defenders pinned in place.

The Siege of Efate is notable for one particular exploit, when a squadron of light cruisers was sent to scout Farreach as part of a raiding operation in the surrounding worlds. Finding relatively small Zhodani forces there, the local commander decided to risk an attack in force. Heavy squadrons feinted against the besieging units at Efate then jumped to a refuelling rendezvous. Tankers were left in deep space as the force entered the Farreach and Clan systems. Although losses to in-system defences were significant, both bases were heavily damaged and local shipping disrupted.

It is not clear how much the Farreach Raid, which began on 002-1109, affected Zhodani strategic thinking or their Macene campaign. Certainly it bolstered morale among the forces assigned to Efate and drew some reinforcements back to the siege. However, the fleet did not venture out again in force that year once its last elements returned to Efate on 37-1109. The Siege of Efate was hailed as an Imperial victory but in reality it was a drain on resources which could have achieved more elsewhere.

THE SIEGE OF REGINA

The siege of Regina was looser than those elsewhere, mainly because the naval base remained intact. Zhodani forces maintained a presence in the outsystem for much of the time but could not set up a base there. System defence forces repeatedly clashed with Zhodani scouts or attempts to establish a significant force in the system, whilst the 16 th Provisional Battle Fleet made a series of short forays into the demilitarised zone.

The Siege of Regina was characterised by these minor counterattacks, made in accordance with the rather vague orders issued by Sector Admiral Santoncheev. These amounted to 'defend Regina to secure the flank of the Jewell Salient' and were interpreted creatively until a reprimand arrived for risking the fleet unnecessarily. Even after this, the 16th Provisional Battle Fleet remained active in adjacent systems.

Despite a Zhodani fleet being poised at Extolay, Regina was never completely cut off. Merchant traffic still came and went, usually in heavily escorted convoys but sometimes in daring solo runs under the guns of the besiegers. Much of this traffic carried mundane items and despite entreaties to bring more war materiel and raw resources, the merchant captains knew they could make a lot more money carrying luxuries that by this time were hard to come by. Strategists decried the stupidity of naval crews taking casualties to get a merchant ship in safely, just so that people could parade around in the latest Mora fashions. Ultimately, a highly questionable law was passed that any ship arriving with below a certain percentage of its cargo being war-useful would be impounded.

Throughout this period Regina served as a bulwark against the possibility of a Zhodani assault through the demilitarised zone. Repeated requests for more ships produced only a few squadrons, which in any case were hamstrung by orders not to attempt to remove the threat from Extolay. It was over this matter that relations between Duke Norris and Admiral Santanocheev completely broke down. Requests became demands, accompanied by dire projections of what might happen if Regina fell. These were ignored and close observers claim that Santoncheev withheld further reinforcements just to show he could not be pushed around by Duke Norris.

Throughout 1108 and into 1109, Regina soldiered on. The 'distant siege' came to an abrupt end on 78-1109 with the outbreak of the Third Battle of Regina. Zhodani forces from the Jewell region, with some transferred from the Siege of Efate, were combined into an overwhelmingly powerful force at Grant, arriving off Regina in waves at 10-hour intervals. Their assaults are collectively known as the Third Battle of Regina, which took place over the next four days.

On 080-1109, Zhodani forces finally broke through to Regina Naval Base and took it under fire whilst the much-depleted system defence force was driven off. The base held out under continuous attack until 082- 1109 when it was ordered to surrender by the in-system commander. Little remained at that point, of the base or the forces it supported. The 16th Provisional Battle Fleet, or what was left of it, joined the surviving system defence forces for a last stand off Regina.

The final assault did not come, at least not at that time. After a standoff lasting a few days, Duke Norris requested the 16th Provisional Battle Fleet take him to Macene. This move has been criticised by the duke's detractors but there was no possibility of him exercising influence over the campaign from a fully besieged world. Besides, he had a duty to remain free of the Zhodani, given what he knew about Imperial strategy and capabilities. On 089-1109, the 16th Provisional Battle Fleet made a costly breakout and escaped the Regina system, proceeding indirectly to Macene.

Regina was open to assault now but it would have been costly indeed. Perhaps the Zhodani did not consider it worth the price, or perhaps they hoped to draw in Imperial forces with another siege. Whichever is the case, Regina was isolated and its system defence forces gradually worn down by Zhodani squadrons that seemed to be in no hurry. The combined fleet paused to reorganise then launched the long-awaited drive on Macene.

##### ADVENTURES IN THE FLANK CAMPAIGNS

Apart from the obvious naval adventures, the sieges of Regina and Efate offer possibilities for smuggling and blockade-running, or covert operations on nearby worlds. Both sides are actively trying to trigger insurrections and resistance movements on any world they can, and obtain information by means of spying or directly stealing it from the enemy.

Higher-ranking Travellers might be tasked with finding these spies or setting up defences against invasion. It is impossible for a minor world to resist full-scale invasion but an occupation can be made costly. For the Imperials there is a particular incentive for this – worlds that cost the enemy to keep are more likely to be given back during peace negotiations than those that surrendered.

The Travellers will encounter an atmosphere of paranoia and fear on many worlds, exacerbating minor divisions and perhaps causing entirely unrelated conflicts. The Travellers could experience adventures that have nothing to do with the conflict other than being triggered by the prevailing conditions. For example, ticket- sharking is common among ships still running the blockade, with desperate people willing to pay a fortune for passage offworld. Local criminal groups might seek to expand their business whilst the authorities are otherwise occupied, or political figures might seek regime change to further their own interests.

### THE MACENE CAMPAIGN

The Macene campaign was intended to be the Zhodani endgame. Faulty assumptions resulted in heavy losses at the Fortress Worlds but the fall of Jewell freed large numbers of squadrons whilst additional reinforcements had arrived from deep in the Consulate. The aim of the campaign was to pin the Imperial fleet against its base and destroy it, driving quickly afterward on Rhylanor and then on to Mora and Magash in the neighbouring Deneb sector. Now isolated, Regina could be bypassed for the time being.

The campaign opened with a flank-clearing offensive in the Lanth subsector, conducted by the Battle Fleet of the First Class 40 plus elements of the Battle Fleet of the First Class 35. The 40th had received significant reinforcement and was to be the lead force in this campaign. Whilst the 35th Fleet undertook minor operations in the demilitarised zone and occupied the Calit system, the 40th struck at Mirriam on 011-1109. There, it overwhelmed elements of the recently arrived 109 th Battle Fleet.

Some surviving ships from the 109th tried to fall back on Ghandi naval base by way of Calit, where they were ambushed and all but annihilated. Those that fled to Denotam fared little better; the system was attacked on 022-1109. The remnant of the 109th Battle Fleet arrived at Ghandi on 033-1109 and the news it bore was dire; the Zhodani were no longer attempting to capture worlds – they were destroying bases and pushing on rapidly. The obvious conclusion was that this was a deep thrust aimed at the Rhylanor subsector.

The Battle Fleet of the First Class 40 suffered heavy losses in these offensives but received reinforcements from the 35th Battle Fleet. This represented a reversal of the initial intention – the 35th was to be a hammer and the 40th to provide support. The 35th was to serve as a security force and reserve, filled out by additional units arriving throughout the year. Scarcely was the 40 th back up to strength than it attacked again, hitting Ghandi on 062-1109. Despite reinforcements rushed up from Rhylanor and Macene, the Imperial Navy was forced from system on 064-1109.

These offensives distracted the Imperials from the Third Battle of Regina, which opened a few days later. The 40th was operating at the end of a long supply line which stretched back across the Abyss Rift, but despite logistical problems it forged ahead. Brushing aside minor resistance at Quopist on 082-1109, the 40th Battle Fleet arrived off Fulacin on 101-1109.

It was here that the campaign began to go awry for the Zhodani. Agents on Fulacin had been setting up a covert forward base in a disused mining facility, stockpiling munitions and fuel for the fleet. However, the facility had been discovered and rather than support, the 40th found an ambush waiting for it. A barrage of missiles from the planetary surface caused significant damage among the light elements forming the vanguard of the fleet, whilst the main force was attacked by the Spinward Marches Flag Fleet under the personal command of Admiral Santanocheev.

Imperial victory at the Battle of Fulacin forced the 40 th Battle Fleet to fall back to Tureded, where it attempted to set up a logistics base. The flag fleet did not pursue nor attempt to locate the enemy after the 40 th jumped out. Instead, it remained at Fulacin for a while before returning to Macene. There, Admiral Santoncheev had an unpleasant surprise.

Arriving on 132-1109, Santanocheev found Sector Duke Norris waiting for him. Norris was in possession of an Imperial Warrant proclaiming him Sector Duke of the Spinward Marches and giving him complete authority to prosecute the war as he saw fit. In a bitter exchange where Norris remarked that Santanocheev and his puppeteers might have left him with nothing but the surrender to oversee, the duke relieved Santanocheev of command. He had already pardoned and released Admiral Pael from custody and in Santanocheev's presence Norris installed her as interim Sector Admiral.

Norris' warrant was later confirmed by the Emperor himself to be valid and his actions were approved. At the time, however, there were those who considered this a coup attempt. Some captains refused to accept the authority of Sector Admiral Pael at first and a handful of ships actually mutinied. Santanocheev was 'beached' but not censured or confined at that time and at some point he disappeared from Macene Fleet Base. This was not considered to be of any consequence at the time; after all, the Zhodani were at the gates of Rhylanor.

#### IMPERIAL COUNTERMOVES

Even as the 40th Battle Fleet was launching its thrust at Macene, the main Zhodani force was advancing through what had been the Jewell Salient. Efate was no longer of any consequence and Regina was neutralised. The shoulders of the salient were no longer a threat. Warned of this massive fleet movement, Duke Norris was able to make early countermoves to weaken it, detaching powerful cruiser forces to hook into the rear of the battle formations to harass their logistics vessels and draw off some of the fleet strength. At the same time he ordered the flag fleet into action.

Elements of the flag fleet were formed into the 98 th Battle Fleet and sent to dislodge the Zhodani from Tureded, whilst a smaller force occupied Calit. On 157-1109, the 40th Battle Fleet was driven out of Tureded, falling back across the Abyss Rift with heavy losses. The remnant of the fleet was ambushed and severely mauled at Calit on 190-1109. After this, the Imperial force began a series of demonstration attacks intended to conceal its small size. This deception was successful in preventing a renewed Zhodani attack in the Abyss region whilst the main fleet confronted the Zhodani advance.

On 221-1109, the Battles of Macene began. The term 'battles' applies to the fact that this was a series of fleet actions across several systems between Macene and Wochiers, taking place over several weeks. The advantage tipped each way more than once, with a Zhodani breakthrough force reaching Macene twice and Rhylanor once. By 288-1109, it was clear that both sides were exhausted. The Zhodani fleet pulled back to Roup, then all the way to Jewell when forces detached from Efate at last began harassing the rear. The main Imperial fleet followed cautiously, ending the year at Roup.

Both sides needed time to prepare for new hostilities. The Imperials were close to their main fleet base, enabling ships to be quickly returned to the fighting if necessary, but those requiring major repairs overwhelmed the facilities available. A stream of warships headed further back into Deneb or towards Mora and Trin. Meanwhile, the Abyss flank was wide open and the Zhodani would not be fooled for long. A proper fleet was needed there and Regina had to be relieved, Extolay taken back and a host of other issues attended to. There were also legal questions to be dealt with, ending confusion about the chain of command. 1109 ended with victories of a sort but the issue in serious doubt.

On the Zhodani side, matters were no less clear. The Macene campaign was to have been the hammer-blow that broke Imperial resistance. Instead, the 40th Battle Fleet had been chased back to its start line and was in dire need of reinforcement or replacement with the 35th Battle Fleet. This represented the last major reserve in the region and now it was ordered forward towards Extolay. An advance from there might prevent the main Imperial fleet from pressuring forces around Jewell as they reorganised, or could slip past if they advanced too far. The way to Macene and Rhylanor was potentially still open, either by way of a sledgehammer assault from Jewell or the dagger-thrust from Extolay. Both would take time to organise, so as 1109 turned to 1110 the Zhodani went over to the defensive.

#####  ADVENTURES IN THE MACENE CAMPAIGN

Like the Riverland campaign, these events involve large fleets and high-ranking personages. Political infighting within the Imperial Navy and nobility could be the focus of a campaign played at any level. Travellers might be admirals trying to thread their way through a labyrinth of conflicting and possibly illegal orders or couriers desperately trying to get those orders through.

The big Zhodani advances early in this campaign will result in upheaval and fear on Imperial worlds. Naval bases are shattered and fleets are falling back in disarray. Frightened people will do irrational things, possibly plunging the Travellers into adventures characterised by rebellion and chaos. Of course, there are those who will ask – if everyone is running around in a panic, who is guarding the vaults?

### THE KAMPANJ FÖR FIENTLIG INNESLUTNING

The Sword Worlds Confederation referred to its involvement in the Fifth Frontier War as a Kampanj för Fientlig Inneslutning (literally 'campaign for hostile containment'), undertaking offensive actions and even capturing worlds as a means to protect itself from future aggression. The validity of this justification is debatable, although there are precedents for some of the annexation attempts. Worlds originally settled by the Confederation have long been claimed as its territory and in some cases an invasion can be seen as an attempt to reintegrate lost systems.

The Lanth campaign is not normally seen as part of the Kampanj för Fientlig Inneslutning, as it was undertaken in support of the Zhodani under the terms of the alliance. Conversely, Zhodani activity on the Lunion front is essentially separate from the Kampanj för Fientlig Inneslutning but forms part of its narrative. Actions were undertaken against Imperial and Darrian targets, along with some neutrals. The common denominator is that all actions are intended to improve the strategic situation of the Confederation, or at least further the goals of some of its more prominent members.

DARRIAN/SWORD WORLDS CONFRONTATION

The Darrian and Sword Worlds Confederations have a long history of enmity. Normally this is kept in check by their powerful respective allies, who might intervene if a conflict got out of hand. Whilst the Darrians are generally content to defend their territory, the Sword Worlds see a major war between the Imperials and the Zhodani as an opportunity to make gains whilst the major powers are distracted.

The primary goal of the Sword Worlds against the Darrians is control over the so-called Entropic Worlds of Entrope, Anselhome, Winston and Torment. None are of particularly great value but possession is seen as important to the Sword Worlds for prestige. Cunnonic and Trifuge are also desirable acquisitions. Whilst not valuable, these systems create a buffer zone that could improve local security.

The Darrian navy is smaller than that of the Sword Worlds but more technologically advanced. Jump limitations make a defensive strategy of holding border systems viable for the Darrians, with Cunnonic as an obvious choke point. The Darrians prefer to pursue a 'crust' strategy in this region, freeing mobile assets to launch raids or counter them. The Sword Worlds/Darrian conflict did not see much intervention by the Consulate or the Imperium due to the distances involved and the need to concentrate on critical theatres of war.

Whilst the Darrians were generally content to defend their territory, albeit perhaps by attacking into the Sword Worlds, the Sword Worlders were expansionistic. They hoped to gain territory in the Vilis subsector and perhaps to remove the Imperial enclave in District 268. Some factions within the Confederation hope someday to annex most of District 268, which they believe is possible without triggering an overwhelming Imperial response. This ambition is a distraction from the campaign against Lanth which the Zhodani Consulate preferred the Sword Worlds would concentrate on.

Sword Worlds ships also conducted raiding operations against Lunion and perhaps Glisten, drawing off Imperial vessels from other theatres to protect commerce and installations. The Sword Worlders were creative and aggressive but limited by the technological capabilities of their vessels. Their raids were mainly a nuisance, but there was always the possibility that a 'Sword Worlds raid' was actually intended to draw Imperial ships into an ambush by Zhodani vessels.

#### THE MORA RAIDS

At the outbreak of war, the Sword Worlds Confederation had a number of potential raiders already in Imperial space but only one was aware of the imminent conflict. This was the Denisov battlecruiser Thiele, which was at that time engaged on what at another time would have been a goodwill and flag-showing cruise. Like other Sword Worlds assets, Thiele had been given a false start date by the Zhodani but even so she went over to a war footing long before news reached Mora where she was at that time in-system. The 'Mora Raids' took place on 207-1107 and 214-1107.

Rather than announcing the war's start and clarifying the situation before the first imperial couriers arrived from Regina, Thiele's captain delivered a passionate, incoherent and apparently drunken rant about offences against his ancestors and his gods whilst shooting up a system defence force maintenance facility and a squadron of system defence boats that attempted to defend it. Thiele then launched missiles at a number of distant merchant ships before engaging another squadron of system defence boats and destroying the light monitor Uegai. Lunging after further civilian targets, Thiele damaged several vessels but was intercepted before she could close to finish the job. She jumped out rather than engage an overwhelming force and almost immediately ships were sent to all systems she could have reached.

Thiele reappeared in the Mora system 154 hours later, having made an in-system jump rather than escaping. This time her target was the vast fuel- processing plant in orbit around the system's outer gas giant. Broadcasting a warning to personnel to get into shelter, Thiele made a risky beam weapons pass whilst reserving her missile armament for the defending craft. These were kept at bay long enough to wreck the processing works and its skimmer-shuttle docks, at which point Thiele haughtily announced she would permit rescue operations and fled the system.

Four days later a courier entered the system with news of the war and perceptions of the raid changed. Naval analysts pointed out that Thiele had attacked military and military-supporting targets, engaging defence craft in preference to civilian vessels and that those civilian targets fired upon had all survived. Some observers loudly stated this was proof of Sword Worlds inferiority but others noted a preference for causing chaos without much loss of life. The more rabid segments of the media began screaming for the execution of 'all Swordie pirates' but official histories record this incident as a legitimate if rather underhanded raid.

The Mora Raids had their desired effect. Cruisers were sent chasing after the raider whilst Duchess Delphine of Mora made ever more strident demands for additional system defence assets and heavy units. For months, the Mora Foremost faction pushed the idea that a Sword Worlds fleet was at the very gates of civilisation – by which they meant the Mora subsector, of course, and that the war would be lost without immediate assistance.

The incident may or may not have influenced Duchess Delphine in her decision to appoint Frederick Santanocheev as sector admiral but it certainly affected the demands she made upon him. At a time when the flag fleet could have been counterattacking in force, elements of its cruiser and capital ship strength were wandering around the rimward end of Rhylanor or conducting sweeps along the trailing side of Lanth, looking for a raider that was long gone.

THE RAIDING CAMPAIGNS

It might have been expected that Thiele would run for home after this exploit and patrols were stepped up to catch her in Lunion and Glisten. Instead, she cheekily looped through Star Lane, Vincennes and Zeng, making attacks along the way. Somewhere in Zeng the trail went cold and Thiele was not heard from for some time. In the interim, other raiders had mixed success. Some of the merchant ship raiders never even got started. Correctly identified before the war, some of these ships were captured before they got word of the conflict. Others found coded signals in the Imperial datanets and began their attacks.

These converted merchant ships did a lot of damage in the early months of the war, notably in Glisten and Lunion but also across Rhylanor, Mora and Trin. Most were run down within three months of the war's start, after which the intensity of raiding operations dropped sharply. Raiders that started the war within the Sword Worlds Confederation had to follow relatively predictable routes or stay off the main spacelanes until they got past the heavily patrolled border zones. They scored successes right through the war but only once won a significant victory. This was at Cyan, in Pax Rulin, in conjunction with a Zhodani task force.

Having gained the attention of the notoriously lacklustre Glisten Subsector Fleet with a series of raids, a group of armed merchant cruisers began a protracted nuisance campaign in Cyan. The flag squadron of the Glisten fleet, accompanied by a handful of Colonial Navy vessels, crossed without authorisation into Pax Rulin and entered the Cyan system. The commanding officer of the Glisten fleet was subsequently court- martialled for the fiasco that followed, despite the fact that she was at Glisten attending a strategic conference at the time. Her deputy was killed in action along with most of the flag squadron.

Entering the Cyan system on 001-1108, the Glisten fleet found multiple commerce raiders behaving with unusual boldness – even for Sword Worlders – in harassing the system's vital communications network and commercial shipping. Moving immediately to the attack, the Glisten fleet became disorganised. This was not surprising; Glisten received few good officers at the best of times and the acting fleet commander was an ardent Forward The Imperium! advocate seeking to win glory and the favour of the faction's leaders.

Slower Colonial ships, although more powerful, were outrun by the Glisten fleet flag squadron, which was in turn taken under fire by the flag squadron of Zhodani Raiding Force Lunion. By the time the older Colonial ships got into range the flag squadron was crippled, allowing the Zhodani to inflict serious losses on the heavy Colonial units before retiring.

Sending a handful of destroyers to cause mayhem in the Pax Rulin subsector, Raiding Force Lunion then reversed course and made the most of the opportunity. Glisten had been deemed a low-threat region and assigned no sector fleet element. The Colonial Fleet elements which would be assigned at the outbreak of war were deemed adequate to defend the subsector and reactivation of reserve ships would provide a few more heavy units. This might have been the case but for the debacle at Cyan, which left the subsector with virtually no heavy units of any kind.

The court-martial of Subsector Admiral Sir Isabel Prasad, commanding officer of the 100 th Fleet, was a heavily politicised affair in which the Forward The Imperium! faction pressed for her dismissal. The navy saw it differently, however, and not only exonerated the admiral but assigned her a small force of capital ships and cruisers with which to secure the subsector.

This reconstituted 100th Fleet left Glisten on 181-1108, beginning an aggressive campaign to clear raiding forces from the subsector. This marked the end of large- scale raiding into Glisten, although Zhodani and Sword Worlds ships continued to harass backwater systems.

SWORD WORLDS ATTACKS

After its participation in the Lanth campaign, the Sword Worlds Dyrnwyn fleet returned to base and transferred much of its fighting strength elsewhere and adopted a defensive posture. Most units went to the Gram Fleet, leaving the Dyrnwyn Fleet much reduced. This did not prevent an offensive, launched on 344-1107, directed at Lunion. This rather predictable advance was met at Rabwhar by the Lunion Contingent of the Imperial sector fleet and Colonial ships assigned to the subsector fleet. The inconclusive Battle of Rabwhar resulted in a Sword Worlds repulse.

An immediate Imperial pursuit chased the Dyrnwyn Fleet back to base, where it rallied on the support of system defences forces plus its defensive contingent as well as second-class battleships from the Sting Fleet. The Imperial force was quickly driven back to Rabwhar, followed by destroyers which kept their distance and monitored the situation. Skirmishes became frequent as Imperial vessels tried to clear the system of observers.

In the meantime, raider and battlecruiser forces of the Sting Fleet launched harassing raids throughout Lunion which provoked calls for assistance from the Mora contingent of the sector fleet. These were not granted, possibly out of concern over another serious raid, so the Adabicci Contingent of the sector fleet was forced to weaken its position at Adabicci in order to chase raiders. Composed mainly of battle tenders and carriers, this force was not well suited to such operations.

This situation went on for much of 1108 and into 1109, with sector fleet capital ships facing off against the Dyrnwyn Fleet across a two-parsec gap, with intermittent cruiser and destroyer actions as each tried to obtain up to date information. The Adabicci Contingent did its best but came off worst in a series of actions against heavy raiders until reinforcements finally arrived from Deneb. Even just a handful of heavy cruisers and capital ships was sufficient to clear out most of the raiders, enabling the area command in Lunion to declare victory in the anti-raider campaign.

The small Biter Fleet conducted raids into District 268 and parts of Glisten, interrupting communications but never drawing in heavy reinforcements. The projected assault on Caladbolg never materialised, with Sword Worlds ambitions of annexing territory unfulfilled. Intermittent skirmishes took place throughout the war all across District 268 without affecting the course of the war.

#### SWORD WORLDS DEFEATS

Late in 1109, the Lunion Contingent of the sector fleet received significant reinforcements and was redesignated as the 214 th Fleet. Elements of the Adabicci Contingent transferred to Rabwhar to watch for an attack, whilst the battleship squadrons of that force joined the 214th. This left Adabicci defended only by its in-system forces but these never saw action. The 214th Fleet advanced into the Metal Worlds and scattered elements of the Biter and Sting Fleets assigned to defend them.

Imperial commanders hoped to draw in the Sword Worlds' main strategic reserve, the Sacnoth Fleet, but whilst it advanced to Biter it did not enter the Metal Worlds. After securing its gains, the 214th then launched a direct attack on Biter, taking on the Sacnoth Fleet, system defences and elements of other formations drawn into the battle. A demonstration against Dyrnwyn kept the Dyrnwyn Fleet occupied long enough to trap and destroy the Sacnoth Fleet. Those elements that did arrive in time were mauled and sent fleeing.

Although costly, the Battle of Biter was decisive. Imperial losses were mainly in the form of damaged rather than destroyed ships. Although it would be some time before these vessels could return to service, they eventually would. The same could not be said for Sword Worlds ships unable to escape the collapse of the Sacnoth Fleet. In the meantime, crews were broken up to provide replacements for serviceable ships or sent to reactivated reserve vessels.

In the meantime, a counterattack by Imperial reinforcements now assigned to the 213rd Fleet struck the complacent Gram Fleet at Lanth, driving it out of the system and allowing ground forces to start landing. An attempt to follow up was curtailed due to reports of Zhodani reserves moving into Lanth. Gram Fleet fell back on its base world, still in fighting condition, whilst minor Imperial forces attempted to clear the systems around Lanth.

SWORD WORLDS/DARRIAN CONFLICT

Despite being the Sword Worlds traditional foe, the situation on the Darrian front was relatively static. Both launched raids into each other's territory, with the Narsil Fleet alternately chasing raiders and making a nuisance of itself over the border. Minor forces skirmished in District 268 without much result. The situation was deemed sufficiently stable – and needs elsewhere sufficiently great – that the Narsil fleet was stripped of much of its heavy fighting units in 1109. These ended up being transferred to the Sacnoth Fleet after its defeat at Biter, seeing action only against an Imperial probe up the Sacnoth Arm late in 1109.

ADVENTURES AROUND THE SWORD WORLDS

The region around the Sword Worlds is a relatively low-intensity theatre of war. In the Sword Worlds and the Darrian Confederation, there is little enemy activity for most of the war. In Imperial subsectors and District 268 it will be mostly 'business as usual' but with a medium to high risk of raids, especially in the spinward side of Imperial space.

Cross-border trade, or perhaps smuggling, will continue throughout the war. There is also room for a little empire-building in District 268, with the Travellers forging an alliance or working for someone who is trying to do so. It is possible the distraction of the great powers might allow enterprising individuals to create a commercial federation – or perhaps a pirate alliance lording it over the local worlds.

### THE MINOR THEATRES

The 'minor theatres' can be defined as anywhere conflict took place outside those described previously. In terms of significant naval action, that means parts of the Trojan Reach and the area around the Five Sisters. In the latter case, Zhodani efforts were directed mainly at cutting off the subsector from the rest of Imperial space. Operations began with a move to 885-945, with a pool of support ships established in the outsystem on 212-1107. From there, cruisers and destroyers advanced into District 268 to cut the Imperial line of communications.

The main force struck first at Iderati on 224-1107, catching the defenders by surprise and inflicting heavy damage on the naval base. The force evaded a response mounted by the Imperial 74 th Blockade Fleet, taking a circuitous route to Emape where it launched an attack on 251-1107. The Imperial response was defensive, pulling in forces to Mirriam, Karin and Jone without weakening the blockade force at Andor.

Contact was lost with the Zhodani fleet after the attack on Emape, creating suspicions it was making a deep-space transit to attack the blockade at Andor or Candory. In fact, it hooked around through the Urnian subsector to assault the naval base at Raweh. This was repulsed with heavy losses and again the Zhodani fleet broke contact. In the meantime, its support elements were intercepted by Darrian vessels at Dorannia. The survivors scattered, some retiring towards Consulate space whilst others pressed on into District 268.

Although depleted, Combat Force Iderati continued to launch raids into the Five Sisters from rendezvous points in District 268. Without the strength to assault naval bases, these amounted to a nuisance and a communications problem rather than a serious threat, although the 74th Blockade Fleet declined to leave its defensive positions to seek a decisive confrontation. The conflict became a series of raids and skirmishes between detached forces of cruisers and destroyers, interspersed with the occasional sweep by one or more of the Imperial task forces to reassure local world governments.

This went on through 1107 and 1108, with Zhodani ships returning home one-by-one as they became damaged or needed a refit. Most went by way of Narsil early in the conflict, until Darrian vessels in the systems around Ator made this too hazardous. The longer route through Urnian was safer but some ships fell afoul of long-range patrols on the way home.

The remainder of Combat Force Iderati received few reinforcements as the war went on and became increasingly ineffective. It did manage to inspire some support in the region, receiving supplies and assistance from supposedly neutral worlds and was still a threat in mid-1109 when elements of the blockade fleet were finally authorised to hunt it down. Forces from the 100 th, based in Glisten, also pushed into District 268. Combat Force Iderati fought a token action at Avastan on 167-1109 before retiring from the region by way of a long circuit through Urnian.

District 268 and the Five Sisters were declared free of enemy forces after 167-1109 but this proved premature. On 221-1109, a second-class Zhodani fleet arrived at Jone and defeated the defences as well as a task force from the 74th Blockade Fleet. The base was wrecked, although the Zhodani force took serious losses. Expected attacks against the neighbouring bases or perhaps Andor and Candory did not immediately materialise, although two attempts to expel the Zhodani from Jone were unsuccessful.

Throughout the last weeks of 1109, additional Zhodani forces were observed entering the Jone system and work was undertaken to repair part of the naval base there. Without significant reinforcements, there was no possibility of removing this threat. Some forces had been assigned to the region but were drawn into skirmishes against elements of the Sword Worlds Narsil Fleet around Flammarion. It is not clear how seriously Flammarion was threatened but the situation created a dilemma for Imperial High Command. On one hand the blockade of Andor had to be maintained and the threat at Jone removed but losing Flammarion risked compromising the Five Sisters in the long run.

Elsewhere, minor Zhodani forces harassed Imperial shipping in Pax Rulin whilst diplomatic missions attempted to stir up anti-Imperial sentiment on worlds across the Trojan Reach. Naval engagements were

The minor theatres offer the greatest variety of opportunities for adventure. Small ships can make a difference here, allowing a naval campaign to be run without involving dozens of battleships and orders from the admiral every few days. Travellers can also be influential at a moderate level, attempting to foster support for one side or the other on neutral worlds, or creating an economic empire whilst the great powers are distracted.

Zhodani and Imperial agents are highly active at a world-government level and also in attempting to forge links with lower-level organisations. Travellers may fall foul of those agents or become suspected of association with them. This is true all across the war zone and along its fringes, and also in the rear areas. It would be possible to play through the entire war without going anywhere near a combat zone. A campaign might revolve around politics at the Mora court or chasing infiltrators in Trin's Veil. In that regard, the 'home front' can be considered a minor theatre since there is little chance of a major naval engagement – but it may be that the war is won or lost far from the battle lines. rare and inconclusive for the most part, taking the form of skirmishes between cruisers and destroyers. Ihatei incursions drew off some Imperial strength but for the most part the Trojan Reach remained secure and was not seriously threatened.

### POINT OF DECISION

At the beginning of 1110, the balance appears to be tipping in the Imperial direction but this may be a false impression. The issue is still very much in doubt in the Jewell-Macene region, with reinforced fleets of both sides facing one another and a renewed clash very likely. Pressure is increasing on Sector Duke Norris to negotiate a settlement but with Jewell in Zhodani hands any treaty will involve serious Imperial concessions. The question facing Norris is whether to risk a counter-offensive or accept the status quo and begin negotiations.

The situation could get worse. Regina and Efate are still under pressure and a decisive defeat in the region of Macene would lead to the loss of the major sector naval base and probably Rhylanor and the local section of the Spinward Main. A successful Zhodani offensive could break the Imperial fleet, whilst an unsuccessful Imperial advance would likely have the same result.

From the Zhodani perspective, the situation is similar. Additional forces have arrived and could be committed at various points. A drive on Macene and Rhylanor, perhaps continuing all the way to Mora, could bring about a decisive victory with repercussions lasting centuries but on the other hand losses in this war could critically weaken the Consulate in the longer term. A Pyrrhic victory at Rhylanor might bring about strategic defeat in a few decades time.

Factions within the Consulate are pushing for their favoured outcome, which is not always in line with the real strategic situation. Some suggestions are of the 'just win without inconveniencing us' sort, whilst others would require immense losses to be endured in order to take objectives peripheral to the war effort. The main debate at present is a choice between four courses of action:

1. Peace negotiations based on the status quo, with
    Jewell in Zhodani hands, or a limited offensive
    to take Regina and/or Efate as additional
    bargaining points.
       2. An attempt to draw out the main Imperial fleet,
          perhaps in a counteroffensive against Jewell and
          destroy it.
       3. An offensive elsewhere, perhaps through Lunion
          and Glisten, aimed at Mora.
       4. A direct assault in overwhelming force against
          Macene and Rhylanor.

Ironically perhaps, at the beginning of 1110 Duke Norris faces the same strategic problems as Frederick Santanocheev did in 1107. Keeping his fleet concentrated around Macene would allow him to counter any likely attacks but would not win the war. On the other hand, pushing in the wrong direction at the wrong time could be disastrous. Norris maintains that he has the situation in hand but there are many who wonder whether he knows something nobody else does or is merely paralysed by indecision.

In the meantime, Imperial forces face stiff resistance on Lanth and are struggling to retake worlds on either side of the Abyss Rift. Regina and Efate are under serious threat and whilst Imperial forces are pushing the Sword Worlds back, they remain a threat. The Five Sisters are under threat, as is the strategic link across [[District 268]]. On the home front, the Mora Foremost faction is increasingly strident in its demands for the removal of Duke Norris and a move to a 'better' strategy.

It is likely that 1110 will bring a decisive shift one way or the other. Some observers are predicting a massive Zhodani victory and an occupation of at least the Spinward Marches, whilst others dream of a triumphant drive on Cronor. A more likely outcome is stalemate followed by a tense period of standoff, with the eventual fate of the region determined at the negotiating table. Even in that case, events in 1110 will determine who has the upper hand in negotiations. It may be that apparently small events or overlooked factors will be decisive; factors such as the actions of Travellers caught up in vast events that might not be quite beyond their control.

### RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN

The Fifth Frontier War can be considered to be a giant megacampaign, or multiple cross-cutting campaigns. Everything that happens is influenced in some way by the conflict but that does not mean adventures have to be all about violence and bloodshed. Indeed, it would be possible to play out the entire campaign without the Travellers firing a shot. Some Travellers are not really interested in the fact the Zhodani and Imperial battle fleets are pounding the snot out of one another overhead; they have a heist to complete, or an intricate web of intrigue and corruption to investigate.

Different Traveller groups may experience the war in very different ways. One group might want to play as tough mercenaries fighting for one side or the other; another might prefer intrigue and politics far behind the front lines. Travellers can always go about their business as usual, doing odd jobs and shipping cargoes, although there is always the risk of complications arising out of raids and political turbulence. Certain factors will pervade any campaign, whether or not it takes place on the firing line.

#### PARANOIA AND HATE

Fear and suspicion will be strong in threatened areas but even far from the combat zones it is likely that some elements of the population will become increasingly threatened. Strangers might entertain suspicions they are foreign agents or members of an internal faction, which could be particularly inconvenient if they are! Skulduggery and crime may become more complicated where people are paranoid and actions unconnected with the war might attract the attention of the security services. Getting caught for the wrong reason is still getting caught.

Paranoia will be exploited by everyone from political figures to advertising agencies. Travellers may encounter rushes to the gun store to arm up in case of 'Zeds under the bed' or similarly tasteless slogans. These might be fuelled by arms sellers but also will be used by those with a political agenda. Even commercial groups will take advantage if they can. A firm might go under as the result of a boycott inspired by allegations the company got pally with the Zhodani whilst doing business with them. These rumours can usually be traced back to a competitor but might instead be created by someone with a grievance.

The conflict will also see a rise in hate and a resurgence of hate groups. Sometimes there may be a logic to it, such as a group on a neutral world that remembers the fighting of the last war and blames the Imperials for destruction and loss of life. Others will just be pushing their agenda. There may be no sense to it but a hate group targeting a Minor Race or segment of society unconnected with the war will still use the general atmosphere of fear to swell their ranks. Unsubstantiated and unlikely allegations of collaboration with the Zhodani or the Imperials will be thrown at the targets if it suits the haters' purposes.

Paranoia and fear will also drive those seeking answers to those who say they have them. In a metaphysical sense this can mean religious or spiritual groups, which may or may not be legitimate. A major conflict is a time of bounty for charlatans and frauds. Other desired answers may be more physical. There are those who wonder what they will do if their world is invaded and the answers on offer might include paying a lot of money for a 'guaranteed passage' out of the combat zone, promises of safe haven for money, or a chance to join a militia.

As a result of this atmosphere, the Travellers will encounter increased activity in all of these areas. Preachers and mystics on the vidnets promising salvation or protection, militia members talking tough about what they will do when the enemy comes calling and allegations and counter-allegations flying between political rivals. The overall impression is decreased stability, worse close to the fighting but present everywhere.

#### FACTIONALISM AND DISSENT

A rise in dissent and the creation of factions is also likely. There are plenty of people who believe, or want to believe, that 'the best defence is to give no offence'. They loudly proclaim that if we just stopped antagonising the other power they would leave us alone. Others espouse 'peace at any price' and are entirely willing to cede someone else's homeworld to the enemy in return for a promise to end the conflict. Unrealistic as their viewpoint might be, it is strongly held.

Others protest the war in general, without really having any solution in mind, or object to the way it is being fought. Fuelled by self-serving allegations of incompetence against their side's commanders, protestors will loudly demand admirals be sacked or nobles demoted. One theme the Travellers will encounter quite commonly is the demand that the Duchess of Mora be promoted to sector duke as she will 'sort it all out' in no time. This campaign is orchestrated by her supporters and is the commonest of the political agendas to emerge.

Objections to how the war is being fought extend to petitions and demands that the Imperial Navy 'do more'. Doing more of what exactly depends on the local situation. Chasing down raiders, protecting against opportunistic pirates or deploying ships to protect the local system are all common demands, with some groups wanting the navy to change tactics based on a vidcast by a popular influencer who apparently knows more than the entire Admiralty. There are those who just seem to be annoyed that the navy has not yet won the war.

Factions are also forming or growing. This is more common in the Imperium but the Zhodani Consulate is not as unified as most outsiders think. Supporters of a particular admiral want their ideas implemented or for them to be given more and better ships; supporters of a noble want them elevated to high station. Commercial and business groups may also become factions, seeking deals and agreements in return for greater support of the war effort. In short, everyone with an agenda will push it as hard as they can during this time of opportunity. In some cases this will harm the war effort but most factions do not care that much. Another frontier war is a big deal but it is being fought a subsector away and there are more pressing concerns closer to home.

Factions may include independence movements, campaigners for reform, supporters of various figures or groups and all manner of other agendas. Some of their demands are reasonable, some not. Factions can cause real problems for the war effort, although not always directly. A workers' rights group that has a valid grievance might bring traffic through a critical starport to almost a dead stop. The authorities might resort to brute force to get the traffic flowing again, ending the choking- off of resources to critical war industries but creating a longer-term problem in the area.

Factionalism can of course be exploited by the enemy. A charismatic noble with strong – but not necessarily good – ideas might be encouraged by loyal friends who happen to be foreign intelligence assets. Given enough popular support this noble might be elevated to an important position where they can influence the conduct of the war or support for the fighting forces. The right words whispered in their ear could make more difference than a battle squadron.

#### ECONOMIC DISRUPTION

Wars always cause economic disruption, not all of it direct. Deliberate disruption can be caused by sabotage or by influencing factions to cause trouble, or by raids on infrastructure and shipping lanes. One successful commerce raider can cause tremendous damage, far beyond the tonnage of vessels destroyed. For every merchant ship taken out by a raider, others will refuse to enter the region for fear of being the next victim. Naval assets must be reassigned to hunt the raider, which absorbs supporting resources in addition to making the vessels unavailable for service elsewhere. There will also be requirements or demands to move naval forces to protect systems and shipping lanes against an attack that might never come.

Disruption can also result from secondary effects. Resources diverted into war production are unavailable for civilian use, which can cripple industries and businesses in the long term. Companies and the nobles associated with them will resist calls to do more for the war effort unless it benefits them, or may take advantage of the disruption to expand into the territory of rival businesses. Greed has historically outweighed patriotism on many occasions; during a major conflict on Old Earth, blockade runners would risk the dangerous run into certain harbours laden with the latest perfumes and fashions from other cultural centres, despite exhortations of political and military leaders to bring munitions and weapons. There was simply more money in hats than in cannon.

This will not always be the case, of course, but a great deal of diplomatic effort will be expended on persuading business groups to focus where the warfighters want them to. Promises will be made and perhaps some of them will be kept. Some of the deals are likely to be underhand, not always for bad reasons. Urgently needed war materiel obtained from a dubious source might seem like a good bargain at the time. There will also be those who want to use the supply chain to elevate themselves or further their cause, or simply to make bucketfuls of cash. If the navy desperately needs more missiles they may be willing to pay over the odds or simply bribe those who can get them. If those missiles turn out to be substandard or defective, it is of course the fighting crews who pay the price. Naval actions have been swung one way or the other as a result of corruption or profiteering in the rear.

### OPPORTUNISM


Factors like hate, disruption and destabilisation create opportunities as well as difficulties. The Travellers may find the authorities are willing to overlook or even expunge previous misdeeds in return for assistance with some emergency or problem. Likewise, factions and individuals will be looking for capable people to help them. There is also the possibility that the Travellers will be proactive and develop their own agenda. There is nothing to stop an ambitious group of Travellers from playing one side against the other and building their own little commercial empire... or perhaps an actual one.

In the long term, neither the Imperium nor the Consulate is likely to just agree to a world becoming independent. However, clever Travellers might be able to put themselves in a position to be given high office which might include governorship of a member world. If a peace treaty makes certain worlds neutral, the Travellers might be confirmed as rulers of one or more of them. This is not something that can be done on the fly but Travellers who plan carefully and play their cards just right can come out of the conflict in an important position.

In short, the war could be an inconvenience, a mortal threat, or an opportunity to get away with things the Travellers would never have otherwise been able to. Some groups will be content to do jobs given to them or react to circumstances but those that look at the big picture and make their own plans have a unique opportunity before them.

#### MOTIVATING AND INVOLVING TRAVELLERS

It can be easy to drop into a style of play similar to video games, with an endless repetition of 'quest giver tells the Travellers what to do and hands over money when they have done it'. The habit of scooping up every crumb and loose button after an encounter and tottering into the nearest shop to sell it all can also carry over from video games. A game run by an actual person can offer much more than that. However, it can sometimes be difficult to motivate Travellers who are used to such a structured approach without copying it.

A simple task/reward setup is useful at times, especially when trying to get things going. However, it is best used as a starting point, a reason for the Travellers to be adventuring, rather than the whole experience. By way of example, the Travellers might take what sounds like a simple task-for-cash job, only to encounter complications along the way. Nobody is paying them to rescue those refugees but helping them is the right thing to do so the Travellers get stuck in. Or do they?

Some Travellers will not do anything unless they gain from it and others may not realise they can do whatever they choose in a human-run game. Travellers who are expecting a straightforward task/ reward cycle can become lost in an endless labyrinth of options or simply fail to realise they could do something other than completing the task at hand. The Referee can educate those who have forgotten they have infinite options but must somehow motivate those who hold out for a bag of Credits.

The key is immersion. The more the Travellers are engaged with the game universe the more willing they will be to take action. It really does not matter very much if a bunch of imaginary people come to harm but shrugging and walking away does not make for a very good story. If the people around them are more than faceless cardboard cutouts the Travellers will be more likely to help them. This can be accomplished by adding little details here and there, reminding the Travellers of the sights, sounds and smells of their universe and the fact that the people who live there have actual lives.

It can be difficult to make each starport and planet unique and interesting but there are some shortcuts. Most ports within the Imperium tend to be quite similar, with a few local variations. The occasional unusual feature can be mentioned, mostly as passing detail. However, sometimes these minor details can become important. Travellers can pick up clues by being observant – and occasionally send themselves on a wild goose chase. The behaviour of people can be based on observations of our own world. Little snippets of conversation, random pieces of selfishness or stupidity, levels of politeness and tolerance can all be drawn from real-world observation.

By making the universe and the people in it a little more vibrant the Referee may be able to draw the Travellers in and make them care. If Generic Starport Number Twelve gets sacked by raiders the Travellers may not even remember if they have ever passed that way but the idea that the nice little Deneb-style bistro might have been destroyed might reach them. Making the universe richer in this manner is worth doing in its own right but there are other advantages.

Travellers who care about the game universe and at least some its people are more likely to consider the consequences for them and to help others rather than holding out for more Credits. They are also more likely to care what people think of them and consider rewards other than money to be worthwhile. Travellers cannot buy anything with the thanks of a grateful nation but the parade and being given the keys to the city should be a rewarding experience – but only if the Travellers care about something in the universe other than their own advancement.

Engaging Travellers with the Universe can provide them with motivation to have adventures and in the end that is what playing Traveller is all about. Credits earned in the game cannot be spent outside of it but the shared experience of creating a good story is a memory worth having. Travellers are also more likely to create their own stories. They might take a dislike to a particular public figure and work to bring them down, or seek to protect something they think precious. The Travellers could end up campaigning to save an endangered tree species instead of chasing Zhodani agents. If that results in an enjoyable game, well, that is the point of playing.

If the Travellers are engaged with the game universe they may also begin to create their own goals or find ways to exploit what they have earned. As noted before, the Travellers cannot spend the thanks of a grateful nation – but they may be able to leverage their popularity in other ways. There are those who will pay a great deal to have their products endorsed by a local celebrity, and the Travellers might be able to obtain information or assistance from people who think they are worthy.

Most Traveller groups will not necessarily think of this, so the Referee must educate them about the possibilities. Sometime after a notable deed, someone will just help them for no reason other than they are heroes. Once the Travellers spot this they may begin to consider how they can use their fame (or notoriety). Ambitious Traveller groups might set up a complex plan, then pull it all together using a favour owed here, celebrity status there... and suddenly they are in a much stronger position.

There are many benefits to getting involved in the universe and taking actions because they matter rather than always seeking profit. This can also help avoid campaign bloat. Bloat typically occurs when Travellers get too much too fast. Challenges that were difficult a few weeks ago are trivial now since the Travellers go everywhere in a motorcade of grav tanks. It becomes increasingly difficult for the Referee to provide a meaningful challenge to such Travellers without introducing universe-changing levels of opposition. If the only way to motivate Travellers is to hand them money and equipment by the ton, the campaign will bloat out of control. If, on the other hand, the primary motivation for the Travellers is to enjoy the game they get to do so for much longer without wrecking the setting.

#### BALANCING CONSEQUENCES, EFFORT AND ACHIEVEMENT

It is always possible things will go so badly wrong that the Travellers sink a great deal of effort into a project and come out with less than when they started. That is part of the game and must be accepted when it happens. However, it should not happen just because the Referee wants it to. If the Travellers take on too much or make poor decisions they can lose out, such as if they fail to appreciate the level of opposition and have to abandon some of their expensive equipment to escape.

The Referee should create a logical level of opposition, which may be stronger or weaker than is obvious, without regard to the Travellers' capabilities. That is to say, an Imperial Duke should have a security force based upon their level of wealth and importance rather than one tailored to the capabilities of the Travellers trying to kidnap them. If the Travellers are overmatched, they will have to be creative – that is part of the fun of the game. If the Travellers simply barged into the situation without figuring out how to deal with the large security force they have no right to complain if bad things happen to them. Their failure to overcome the Duke's standard measures to conceal the strength of the bodyguard force is still their own fault. This is not a deathtrap set by the Referee; it is a logical situation which could be solved by investigation, observation and clever planning. Thus, any setbacks are the Travellers' own fault.

The Referee should be willing to be ruthless if the Travellers are stubbornly stupid. If they decide they will just shoot their way through a military roadblock with pistols, they will have to deal with the consequences. Logically, a contact report would be made and reinforcements despatched. If the Travellers somehow win the fight, the military force will hunt them with whatever resources are available.

Obvious consequences can be used to guide the plot or force Travellers to be creative. If they need to get past the roadblock and marching up shooting is not a viable option they might try deception, stealth or some totally off-the-wall solution. This makes for a more interesting game than just blasting the opposition out of the way and can be used to create pressure or constraints that force the Travellers to be heroes.

The consequences of a given set of actions will normally depend on the circumstances at hand but the achievements of the Travellers should depend more on the amount of effort they put in. Even if narrative resolution (see page 184) is in use, the Travellers should not be able to change history with a single small event. In particular, the Referee should be mindful of what can be achieved with a single skill check.

A single Persuade check will never be enough to cause a planet or an admiral to change sides. Indeed, even if the people involved could be convinced to agree to such an action, they would more than likely be over-ruled or removed from office. The outcome should depend on how much effort the Travellers put into it. For example, if they decide to steal a shipment of naval missiles, they will need to do some work. There are skill checks to obtain information, more checks to carry out the heist – and then whatever response is made must be dealt with.

The Referee should consider the implications of a given check. Causing a relatively minor change in someone's outlook seems entirely plausible and this could be built upon over time. Likewise, defeating the security on a door is entirely acceptable as the outcome of a single check. However, it is not reasonable to use a single check to open all the doors in a building, or bring someone to a radically different viewpoint on a permanent basis. Getting someone to make an instant life-changing decision might be possible but they are likely to re-evaluate that decision and try to back out, or resent being manipulated and actively work against the Travellers.

Even if narrative resolution is being used for big events, major events should still be the result of ongoing efforts requiring adventuring and roleplaying. Some actions will simply not happen no matter what the Travellers roll on their dice and others will produce rather minor results. However, working towards a goal in a gradual manner will spawn adventures and roleplaying opportunities. Travellers who are permitted to cause enemy warships to defect with a single skill check will soon begin to suffer campaign bloat, whereas those who work to suborn the vessel's officers over time will eventually achieve a result without breaking the game's setting.

### CHARACTERS


The vast majority of characters encountered by the Travellers are just faces in a crowd; fleeting glimpses of people going about their business. All of these people have a story but the Travellers will never learn it. They may be able to make inferences if they want; for the most part people are obviously what they appear. In other words, a bunch of port workers having a drink after their shift are almost certainly just that; a well-dressed person being rude to a cashier is probably just a self-important and unpleasant individual with a good job.

**Typical AOC**

Experience of Character AOC Example Beginner +0 Someone who has had a basic first-aid course Basic Training +1 Well trained first aider or inexperienced paramedic Basic Training plus some experience +2 Paramedic Training and Considerable Experience +3 Experienced hospital nurse Advanced or Post-Graduate Training +4 Junior doctor Expert +5 Experienced specialist doctor Renowned Expert +6 Senior consultant

Passing references to these little slices of life can make the universe richer and can also be used to keep the Travellers guessing. If the only time a detail is mentioned is when it is significant, the Travellers will be alerted that something is about to happen. Mentioning small details creates ambiguity and can also be used to draw the Travellers into the universe. An explosion that kills 17 people on a starport concourse is a statistic but if the Travellers are reminded that these were people with lives and aspirations they may be more inclined to take action against the perpetrators or prevent future incidents. These characters can be considered to be part of the scenery but they can still be used by the Referee and of course the Travellers can never be quite sure the person they are talking to is not in fact a significant character they have not yet discovered.

TRIVIAL CHARACTERS

It may be a little unkind to describe someone as 'trivial' but in the context of the vast events unfolding in the region some people are of minimal significance. These include people the Travellers interact with in a routine manner. Sometimes they recur, perhaps because the Travellers pass through the same place. If so, they may become familiar to the Travellers and even important to them as friends but they are still trivial in the grand scheme of things. A full set of characteristics and skills are not needed for such characters; indeed, they are not usually relevant at all.

For potential opponents, the Referee can create a partial block giving physical characteristics (STR, DEX and END) and a competence DM. Rather than spelling out all the skills a person has, this DM is used for the character's area of competence. It can be assumed they have other skills but for the purposes of a fleeting encounter this Area of Competence (AOC) DM is entirely sufficient. For example, a security guard with AOC +2 could logically apply it to skills such as Recon, Melee and Gun Combat, and perhaps Medic. A starport ground crew worker might be able to use Mechanic, Electronics and Engineer, whilst a portside broker could make a case for Admin, Advocate and Broker.

AOC is assumed to include characteristic and trait bonuses. A character can have more than one AOC if appropriate. For example, a starport business manager who is also an officer in the planet's defensive reserve force might have a block consisting of:

This tells the Referee everything necessary to use this character in a fleeting encounter or fight. If the Travellers interact with them to a deeper level they may be moved up to Minor Character status and be given a full block.

	PORTSIDE MANAGER/RESERVIST
	STR 8 AOC (MANAGER) +3 DEX 6 AOC (MILITARY OFFICER) +1 END 7

MINOR CHARACTERS

Minor characters are typically someone of importance to the adventure going on at the time but probably not of wider significance. A local guide the Travellers hire could be a trivial character but if the Travellers interact with them a lot or their skills are relevant to the adventure they should be given a minimal block. This gives their six characteristics (STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, SOC) and relevant skills. It is possible this person has additional skills not listed; only those relevant to the adventure are needed. The block can be completed if the character becomes a regular in the game.

By way of example, a tough local guide the Travellers hire to help them get across the mountains might be given a minimal block:

This is not necessarily this character's full skillset but it is the skills that will be relevant to a trek through the wilderness. If the Travellers interact with Tree-Kraken Aberdeen for a lengthy period they may discover he is an excellent cook and likes to play obscure card games, adding Steward and Gambler, and maybe Carouse, to his skill list. Minor characters may or may not be given a name by the Referee when they are implemented, depending on perceived need.

SIGNIFICANT AND MAJOR CHARACTERS

Significant characters are those who have an importance beyond the immediate adventure, or are the main driving forces behind it. They should always have a writeup but full blocks are not necessarily required. If the Travellers never interact directly with these characters their motivations and levels of power and influence will be more important than specific skills.

The same comments apply to major characters who are the driving force behind elements or even the whole of the Fifth Frontier War campaign. Major characters differ from significant ones in that they will appear in future publications. If the Travellers contrive circumstances in which they kill a major character and that character then turns up in a later publication, the Referee will have to adapt. In some cases this is not too much of a problem; if the Travellers assassinate an admiral, someone else will be appointed to fill the vacancy. However, it can be useful to know which characters are going to reappear or be significant later.

#### ATTITUDE, POWER AND INFLUENCE

It is useful to have an indication of the degree of power and influence a given character can wield, and also their attitude towards the Travellers. This provides a quick and simple way of keeping track of who the Travellers can call on for help – and how much they can offer. The same applies to enemies and rivals who might get in the way of the Travellers' plans. Attitude to the Travellers is modelled using an antagonistic pair: Affinity and Enmity. Power and Influence are separate to one another.

AFFINITY/ENMITY Affinity/Enmity represents how favourably inclined the person is, or how hostile they are, towards the Traveller. It is rated from -6 to 6.

Very high levels of Affinity/Enmity are extremely uncommon. Even Enemies and Allies are usually fairly moderate in their outlook and will not allow their relations with the Traveller to dominate their lives. There are, however, exceptions and these may become driving forces in the campaign. Affinity/Enmity can be altered, although extremes should always be hard to achieve. Travellers will, in general, need to work at improving relations but can destroy them with a few thoughtless words.

Affinity/Enmity is a useful indicator of an individual's likely actions toward the Traveller but does not tell the whole story. The numerical value indicates severity of actions taken but the character's motivations and experiences will define their behaviour. For example, a former friend who feels bitterly betrayed but sometimes

	'TREE-KRAKEN' ABERDEEN
	
	(LOCAL GUIDE) STR 8 SKILLS DEX 6 Athletics (dexterity) 1, Gun Combat
	(slug) 1, Melee (blade) 1, Navigation 3, Recon 2, Survival 2
	
	END 9
	
	INT 6
	
	EDU 4 WEAPONS Hunting Rifle (3D), SOC 4 Really Big Knife (2D)

**Affinity/Enmity**

Affinity/ Enmity Degree Notes
-6 Blinded by Hate* May engage in self-destructive actions in order to harm the Traveller, or put innocents at risk.
-5 Bitter Hatred** Will actively plot or take serious risks to cause the Traveller harm at any opportunity.
-4 Hatred Will do almost anything to get one over on the Traveller. Might actively plot against the Traveller for the sake of revenge or causing further harm even if there is little or no gain involved. An Enemy will normally start with this level of Affinity/Enmity.
-3 Very Negatively Inclined |Will go to some trouble to impede the Traveller, just out of spite. Does not care much what happens to the Traveller and will more than likely feel they deserve anything they get.
-2 Negatively Inclined May engage in acts of petty spite for no gain, just to annoy and upset the Traveller. Someone with Enmity -2 or better will probably stop short of actions that would seriously harm or might kill the Traveller. A Rival will normally start with this level of Affinity/Enmity.
-1 Mistrustful Vaguely ill-disposed towards the Traveller (or perhaps everyone in general) but will not go out of their way to impede them. Someone with an Affinity/Enmity value of
-1 is unlikely to take an action that will have serious consequences for the Traveller unless there is some significant benefit. 0 None No Enmity nor Affinity towards the Traveller. This may be because they do not know who the Traveller is, or because the Traveller has done nothing that would create an impression one way or the other. 1 Vaguely Well Inclined About as well inclined towards the Traveller as any random stranger with a social conscience is likely to be. They will take minor actions to help, largely out of common courtesy, but not go to much trouble on the Traveller's behalf unless there are benefits to the action. A Contact will usually begin with this level of Affinity/Enmity. 2 Positively Inclined Will probably help in a safe and easy manner if asked, even without reward, but will not take much risk. 3 Very Positively Inclined

Will take modest risks on the Traveller's behalf or offer help even without being asked, if they realise their friend could benefit. An Ally will normally begin at this level of Affinity/Enmity. 4 Loyal Friend Will do almost anything to help the Traveller but may have higher loyalties to their own family, cause or service, or to other close friends. 5 Love*** Will probably put the Traveller's interests before their own or that of others. 6 Fanatical**** Will do whatever the Traveller asks of them (or what they think the Traveller would want), no matter what risks are involved. May also expect others to do the same. 

* Bitter hatred can also represent an obligation to destroy the Traveller. The reasons might be personal or on behalf of someone else. Alternatively, the Enmity might be due to the Traveller's opposition to a cause. It might even be altruistic after a fashion – someone who genuinely believes the Traveller is a bad guy who must be stopped may be just as determined to destroy them as someone who hates the Traveller on a personal level.

** Someone with this much hatred may be willing to harm others to get to the Traveller and may extend their enmity to his friends and comrades.

*** Love might be romantic or in the manner of a close family member, comrade through some traumatic event, or the like. Someone who owes a debt of honour to the Traveller, even if they do not like the Traveller all that much, might also have Affinity 5.

**** This level of Affinity is rare and may not be healthy for either party. A deluded stalker might have Affinity 6 but it is other considerations that make them dangerous.

**Power**

Power Degree Notes 0 Powerless The individual has virtually no resources they can bring to bear other than their own personal possessions. 1 Weak Has a few friends or other contacts who might be willing to help; the equivalent of a typical band of Travellers. 2 Useful Has a significant asset such as a small starship and crew, or a small force of skilled mercenaries, high-end lawyers, or the like. 3 Moderately Powerful

Has access to very significant assets such as a mercenary unit or a modest-sized business entity. 4 Powerful Has powerful assets, equivalent to a small merchant shipping line or major business group. 5 Very Powerful Has enormous power, such as someone in the top echelons of a planetary government or the CEO of a large shipping line. 6 Major Player Is a factor in interstellar politics, such as a navy admiral or an official in an interstellar government. remembers the good times might have Affinity/Enmity -1 but some extremely strong emotions underlying their disposition. On average, this person will not actively seek to harm the Traveller. However, depending on circumstances they might act in an unexpectedly positive manner – although in a bitter and 'don't you dare thank me' sort of way. On another day they might screw over their former friend out of spite and later regret it.

POWER AND INFLUENCE

Power and Influence are similar characteristics, with different implications. Power represents the level of force, money or other assets that can be directly brought to bear. This does not mean the individual can always send in the troops, of course – an army officer might command a powerful unit but it is unlikely they will be able to divert it halfway across the sector to help out an old friend unless there is an overwhelmingly good reason.

Influence is less obvious than Power but in many ways more versatile. When action is taken using gunmen, cases of cash, or the direction intervention of a top- end legal team, it is usually very apparent what has happened. On the other hand, an influential individual might discreetly put an idea in the mind of a powerful legislator, or remind the sector duke that her nephew owes his life to the Travellers without actually asking for anything. Influence can sometimes result in Power being brought to bear from a different direction; subtly and sometimes untraceably.

Power and Influence are indicated by a value from 0 to 6 and might have similar or quite different values. The Referee should note that these values indicate what the character can bring to bear rather than everything they have. Some people have enormous assets but are tied up in deals, treaties and other agreements that limit their options.

An associate with Power and Influence 0 is still capable of bringing their own personal talents to bear, of course. Conversely, just because an associate has a given level of Power or Influence does not always mean they can bring it to bear, or that they will choose to do so. Also, some characters are off this scale. The Emperor of the Third Imperium, for example, can be considered to have practically infinite Power and Influence if he chooses to act... but the Travellers are unlikely to be able to persuade him to do so!

**Influence**

Influence Degree Notes 0 No Influence Has virtually no influence over anyone. 1 Little Influence Owed a couple of favours by minor officials and local notables such as the leader of a street gang or a port authority official. 2 Some Influence Has one or more minor local notables 'in their pocket' and can get them to act illegally or dangerously on the odd occasion. 3 Influential Has some influence over powerful people such as mid-level planetary government officials or rich portside merchant factors. 4 Highly Influential Has some influence at the interplanetary level, with government or underworld figures that owe them a favour or two. 5 Extremely Influential

Has very significant influence at the interstellar level and can lean on lawmakers or officials in interstellar government. 6 Kingmaker Has the ear of extremely powerful people, such as the ruling noble of the local subsector.

### NARRATIVE EVENT RESOLUTION

The Fifth Frontier War is a big story, requiring shifts of focus from grand strategy to resolution of a Traveller's attempt to get a hatch open before their friend runs out of air. It may occasionally be useful to shift from resolving situations in six-second combat rounds to a more general overview of an incident and its outcome. Some situations are not well suited to resolution using checks in the standard manner, especially incidents that are not important to the campaign plotline but would be time-consuming to play out.

Sometimes, a better option may be to use a narrative resolution, where someone decides what has happened and narrates it. The Referee always has this option but it can be expanded in a variety of ways. Sometimes what will happen is a foregone conclusion or has been scripted, in which case the Referee simply narrates the events unfolding and decides what their consequences are to be.

This is a staple of roleplaying games and should be subject to certain unwritten rules. One is that nothing bad can happen to a Traveller without them having an opportunity to do something about it... unless they consent. This seems an obvious rule for fair play but it is subject to some grey areas. For example, if a Traveller has made choices that lead to them standing in front of a speeding train, should they be allowed a last-second skill check to escape being splattered? Not necessarily. For one thing, the Traveller got there through their own choices so providing there was some warning it may be fair enough to say the Traveller created that situation, which logically leads to an untimely demise.

The Referee might still grant a chance to duck into a maintenance hatch or otherwise escape but if the Travellers have put themselves in a place they cannot get out of they will have to accept the consequences. This is fair, providing the Referee gave enough warning.
'The inspection hatch opens into what you are pretty sure is a meson gun tube. From the feeling of static electricity around you, you get the impression it is live' is a pretty good warning. If the Travellers insist on marching along the tube they will become a targeting anomaly if the weapon is used... and this seems fair. If the Referee provided no clues and just announced the Travellers had been atomised, they would have good reason to be unhappy about it.

Judging exactly where the Travellers' last chance to take the hint or alter their plan is a fine art, and depends greatly upon circumstances. There does come a point where consequences become inescapable and a Referee who is too lenient when imposing the results of what the Travellers chose to do will end up unable to run the campaign in a logical manner. Experienced Referees develop their own style and make judgement calls based on the sort of campaign they want and have a responsibility to be fair.

Narrative resolution can be expanded to include the Travellers some or all of the time, although this depends on the people involved. Some are uncomfortable outside the framework of checks and Referee responses, or may feel overshadowed by more creative Travellers. Others are a bit too creative, so expanding narrative resolution to include the Travellers must be well judged. If the Referee can get this right, they can move the game from a 'crunchy' dice-based resolution system to a team effort aimed at creating the most entertaining story possible. How far along the continuum from no Traveller narrative resolution to a completely freeform storytelling experience is something that should be decided before implementing any of the following play styles.

The Referee is still in charge, even in a fully narrative game. If the experiment is not producing the results hoped for, the amount of narrative responsibility given to the Travellers can be altered. Advice and guidance should also be offered, so that everyone knows what they are trying to achieve. Ridiculous or extremely unlikely statements should be vetoed by the Referee but if the Travellers are willing to create a sensible shared narrative they should be given the opportunity. It may take a few sessions to establish a setup that everyone is happy with and the Referee may decide that a mix of styles allows resolution to be tailored to the needs of the campaign.

As a rule of thumb, narrations must logically fit the situation and should not result in massive gains for the Travellers. No Traveller is permitted to narrate something that directly harms another, although it is acceptable to put another Traveller in a situation where they are in danger. That Traveller must then deal with the new situation either by narration or skill check resolution. Done well, this method allows Travellers to get involved in worldbuilding and create a deeper and more immersive story.

Narrative resolution also allows what would otherwise be a complex and perhaps lengthy situation to be resolved without being blatantly skipped over. This has the advantage of allowing the Referee to include many asides and small incidents, increasing the depth of the game experience, without bogging play down. Also, the Travellers cannot be sure whether the apparently trivial incident unfolding around them has some greater significance or is the lead-in to a full-scale adventure. Clues can be hidden in incidents the Travellers experience without having to spend an entire game session on the matter just to make sure the Travellers spotted that suspicious figure at the starport.

To avoid exploitation of this game mechanic, narrative resolution is always initiated by the Referee. The Travellers cannot simply announce they went to the starport and made a fortune speculating on the local stock exchange or found a cache of fusion guns someone had left lying around. The Referee creates a situation and invites narrative resolution, which must be connected with the events being resolved. Some leeway is useful so as not to stifle creativity but the Referee will determine if actions have strayed too far from what is being resolved. If the Referee and Travellers cannot agree on what is reasonable, resolution reverts to using the standard rules.

#### FREE NARRATIVE RESOLUTION

Using free narrative resolution, the Travellers state what they did and what happened with no requirement to make any dice rolls at all. This is useful when resolving big or complex situations that are not all that important to the plot of the campaign. As an example, the Referee has decided that the downport where the Travellers are returning to their ship is suffering an earthquake. The Referee narrates the beginning of the scene as usual but does not want to spend most of the game session dealing with the incident as there is a major plot point coming up. Rather than resolve every skill check, the Referee asks the Travellers,

'What did you do during the quake?'

'I ducked into a liquor vendor's store and swiped a few bottles, then made myself scarce' says one Traveller. Slightly reprehensible as it is, this is a reasonable course of action the Traveller could likely get away with.

'I tried to rescue people. Got knocked about by some falling debris but I managed to drag a Vargr family to safety. Performed CPR on a security officer but he didn't make it,' says another. The Referee finds that entirely acceptable as it might provide some plot points for later. ' I made off with the entire window display of the local Instellarms outlet!' announces a third. The Referee vetoes this, partly because it is implausible and partly because it is an abuse of the narrative process. Travellers should not be allowed to just award themselves huge advantages.

GUIDED NARRATIVE RESOLUTION

The Referee might go with free narrative resolution if the Travellers are all good storytellers and comfortable with the process. However, it is generally better to use a guided narrative resolution in order to impose a measure of regulation. In this case, a Traveller must choose a skill or characteristic relevant to the situation and make an Average (8+) check. The Effect of this check can be used as a guide to how well things turned out.

Under this system, the actions taken by the Traveller must be connected with the skill or characteristic chosen and they must abide by the narrative type guidelines. A disastrous check will require a Traveller to narrate some circumstance to their detriment, which some Travellers may be unwilling to do. If so, the Referee may overrule the narration and impose one based on the chart result. Travellers may be unwilling to give up an advantage or accept the loss of an item but at least this way they have control over what is lost. If the Referee overrules the narration, they may lose more or worse.

### DAMAGE


If damage to a Traveller is indicated, it ignores armour and is imposed directly – but only if this makes sense. A Traveller attempting to negotiate a good deal on starship parts is unlikely to come to physical harm unless their offer was so insulting the dealer punched them in the face (that could happen if the Traveller feels it should). Damage can be swapped for a Setback of the same level and partial trades are also permissible. For example, a Traveller facing 4D damage or a Severe Setback might trade this off to 2D damage and a Minor Setback.

### INCONVENIENCE


Travellers who are Inconvenienced as a result of their actions will find that the matter took longer than it should, created additional complexities, or resulted in a mountain of paperwork. Local officials might take an interest in the Traveller, which will mean little more than explaining to the local cops what they are up to – providing the Traveller has a clean record. Stupidity on the part of the Traveller could escalate this incident into something serious; even an Inconvenience can spiral out of control if the Travellers make bad choices.

**Example:** A Traveller decides to ask around the starport to see if there is any information about the course of the war that is not in the official vidcasts. A concerned citizen reports a suspicious person and the Traveller ends up having to explain they are not a Zhodani spy to a couple of bored security officers who have nothing better to do but ask endless questions. Eventually they tire of the situation and order the Traveller to leave this part of the port, facing arrest if they return.

MINOR SETBACK

Minor Setbacks include alienating a local figure who will refuse to deal with the Travellers and may incite others to do the same, triggering an investigation that might get the Travellers arrested and held for a few hours, losing an item of no great value but which might otherwise have been useful, and similar incidents. Also, whatever the Traveller wanted to narrate for the incident goes awry. The Traveller must come up with a brief story about what they tried to do and what actually happened. A Minor Setback will not normally prevent Travellers from trying again but will impose DM-2 on the check if a similar method is used to deal with the same problem.

Example: The Travellers want to play a bit fast and loose with the local import/export laws, bringing in goods under a clever euphemism for their type, which is legal but contrary to the intent of the regulations. Instead of turning a big profit, they annoy an important official who arranges for them to be harassed by law enforcement personnel over trivial matters. The Travellers cannot be charged with anything but they have to waste a lot of time answering questions. Interference from this official imposes DM-2 on further efforts in the same field.

MAJOR SETBACK

Major Setbacks include alienating a whole segment of the community, making them unwilling to deal with the Travellers or even becoming slightly hostile. Alternatively, the Travellers may annoy a single person so much they become a Rival. Such a Rival will not go to great lengths to harm the Travellers once the situation is over but will always cause trouble if the Travellers make another visit to their territory. A Major Setback will usually prevent the Travellers from trying again and imposes DM-4 if they do. This is in addition to any interference from people the Travellers have annoyed.

**Example:** The Travellers are looking for someone they suspect may have been acting against them, who might be hiding out in the seedier end of the startown. They intrude into the local portside entertainment scene a bit too forcefully, creating resentment among the bar owners and their clientele. The result is that they are generally unwelcome everywhere, with the possibility of a few hotheads trying to pick a fight. This general hostility imposes DM-4 on further interactions with this segment of society.

SEVERE SETBACK

Severe Setbacks include offending someone so badly they become an Enemy, or annoying a segment of the local population badly enough they are openly hostile and may become violent. This will not usually be of a lethal nature unless the situation is escalated but the Travellers may have small objects thrown at them, face threats of serious violence, or perhaps unarmed blows will be delivered. As an alternative, a Severe Setback could mean the Travellers have committed a criminal offence and will be arrested. A Severe Setback will almost always preclude any further attempts in the same general field.

**Example:** The Travellers were hoping to narrate how they breezed through customs with their locally illegal weapons. Instead they are arrested and spend a week awaiting a hearing. They get away with confiscation of the weapons, a fine and an order not to return for a year. This is a problem, as the Travellers have urgent business on-planet and must now find another way in – and get themselves some more guns.

PARTIAL SUCCESS

A Partial Success allows the Travellers to succeed at most of what they wanted to achieve with the effects of a Minor Setback applied, or to succeed at a smaller portion of their planned outcome with an Inconvenience. Neither precludes another attempt but things may get more complicated next time around.

**Example:** A Traveller decides to swipe some jewellery from a store whilst everyone is distracted by a riot going on down the street. They achieve a Partial Success; a couple of pretty but not very valuable rings from the display. The Traveller also ends up getting a good dose of tear gas as the local security personnel tackle the riot and is hit by a badly thrown rock for 1D damage.

MINOR SUCCESS

A Minor Success, as the name suggests, is of a rather small nature. The Travellers might find an informant who does not know much or achieve a minor profit. Money made by way of a Minor Success is likely to be in the realms of tens of Credits; Travellers will not get rich by narrating petty swindles and thievery. Information will be basic, possibly inaccurate and almost certainly incomplete.

Example: A Traveller needs a gun in an area where they are not permitted and tries to find someone willing to provide one. A Minor Success results in the Traveller paying 2,000 Credits for an old but serviceable revolver with a dozen rounds of ammunition.

MAJOR SUCCESS

A Major Success may be more significant. It may create a Contact, produce a profit in the hundreds of Credits, or produce reliable and detailed information. Travellers should not be allowed to narrate endless repeats of circumstances that get them money or useful items; narrative resolution is intended for situations that need to happen rather than being a tool for endless profit.

Example: The Travellers need information about shipping movements in the region. They decide to seek someone willing to be bribed and achieve a Major Success. For 50,000 Credits now and 10,000 a month thereafter, a traffic controller at the starport agrees to feed them the information they want. Of course, the Referee can use this Contact in future adventures. Perhaps they will be arrested and implicate the Travellers, or they might actually be an intelligence operative for one side or the other.

SPECTACULAR SUCCESS

A Spectacular Success produces an excellent result but is limited by the events at hand. Spectacular Success will produce profit in the thousands of Credits at most, a useful item, or an excellent piece of information. It may also result in the Travellers gaining a Contact or even an Ally.

Example: The Travellers are speculating on the starport stock exchange and achieve a Spectacular Success result. They could give themselves an Ally or a few thousand Credits but eventually decide on they made 600 Credits and encountered a knowledgeable broker who will henceforth be a Contact at this starport. This is reasonable and might be useful to the Referee.

#### NARRATIVE TASK RESOLUTION

Narrative resolution can be used at a lower level, to determine the results of a single action rather than a situation. This can be entirely at the Referee's discretion; upon occasion, the Travellers may be offered the chance to narrate an incident rather than rolling dice. Alternatively, narrative resolution can be built into gameplay as a mechanic alongside standard checks.

If this narrative task resolution is implemented, each Traveller is entitled to a number of Narrative Events per segment of the campaign. This might be a single game session but if the Travellers spend three sessions dealing with the revolt on Dinom or engaging in misadventures in Rhylanor Startown, they only get one set of Narrative Events until the next clear campaign segment.

A Traveller has one Narrative Event for each point of characteristic DM and one for every skill level. These are tied to the characteristic or skill they derive from and must fit the skill or characteristic being used. For example, a Traveller with DEX DM+2 and INT DM+1 has three characteristic-based Narrative Events available. Two must somehow be connected with speed, agility, or manual dexterity, and one with intellect or problem-solving. If the same Traveller also has Pilot
(spacecraft) 3 and Persuade 1, they may perform three piloting-related Narrative Events and one connected with their ability to convince others of something.

Each Narrative Event essentially replaces a skill or characteristic check and under normal conditions would be used to narrate something positive. There is nothing to stop a Traveller narrating some minor disaster where they failed to accomplish their goals if circumstances warrant it. More commonly however, a Narrative Event may be used to automatically complete some task facing the Travellers.

A Narrative Event cannot make the impossible achievable; what the Traveller narrates must be plausible. For example, if the Travellers are trying to move a collapsed wall, it is not plausible for one of them to scoop the rubble out with a teaspoon or blow it up with explosives the Travellers do not have. A Narrative Event must also be interesting. If a Traveller were to describe how they improvised a lever and located a big piece of rubble to move aside, creating a hole big enough to get through, this would seem acceptable. Just stating that the rubble got moved is not really narrative and should not be allowed by the Referee.

This essentially replaces a skill or characteristic check the Traveller might make and cannot be used if they could not succeed on the check. It can be assumed that the Traveller succeeds solidly but outstanding results (equivalent to Effect 6+) are not possible. What a Narrative Event can do is to create a favourable circumstance, such as allowing a Traveller to shoot an enemy before they throw a grenade, no matter what the initiative order might have been.

A Narrative Event cannot be used against another Traveller but can be used to rescue them from disaster. For example, when Arix the Accountant slips and falls from a mountain ledge, 'Two-Guns' Cassandra can narrate how she dives to the edge and grabs him before he falls to his death. The Referee may also rule that certain non-player characters are immune to Narrative Events or can even use them. Some situations, such as the climax of an adventure, can also be off-limits to Narrative Events at the Referee's discretion. This ensures that the Travellers arrive at the final scene in a condition to deal with the big threat but does not give them an easy ride in the climactic battle or challenge.

In addition, a Narrative Event can be used to cause harm to most characters who are not Travellers. For example, a Traveller might narrate how they clobber the gunman with a chair rather than risking a skill check that might fail. However, damage must still be rolled so the final outcome is in some doubt. Major characters in the campaign cannot be affected in this manner. A Traveller might use Narrative Events to snipe the bodyguards protecting a major enemy – although damage still has to be rolled – but the enemy is a Traveller-equivalent character and cannot be affected in this manner.

The use of Narrative Events creates a more cinematic style of game, in which Travellers can automatically succeed or avoid disasters caused by bad dice rolls. This creates a greater chance of getting to the big climax and allows a lot more creative input from the Travellers but it is not suitable for all groups. Some will try to exploit the narrative style of play to gain a competitive advantage, whereas the whole concept of narrative play is that it is cooperative between the Referee and Travellers. With the right group, narrative play creates a whole new dimension to Traveller games but if it is abused then the Referee is advised to return to the normal rules.

### FINAL NOTES

At the time of writing, the outcome of the Fifth Frontier War is in doubt. Even when the 'canon' ending is determined – and there may be some surprises yet! - the outcome of the Fifth Frontier War is still in doubt every time a group begins play in this critical era of the Charted Space universe. Adventures and sourcebooks will fill out details of the conflict, enabling the Travellers to witness and influence the moments where the fate of the region hung in the balance.

Not everything has to be connected to the war, of course. Indeed, it is better if some adventures are totally unrelated, allowing the Referee to hide clues in plain sight or give weary Travellers a rest from endless conflict. There may be some clues hidden in this volume, or foreshadowing of events that will play out in adventures to come. A chance encounter at a backwater starport might not be significant until months or years later in the campaign; a ship that challenges and boards the Travellers looking for contraband might be encountered as a wreck a year later. Something the Travellers learned in an unrelated adventure might turn out to be critical months ahead.

Traveller is not a game about super-powered heroes leaping tall buildings or outrunning speeding bullets. It is about people doing their best with what they have. Whether the Travellers are provincial governors and the commanders of fleets or a bunch of down-at-heel adventurers in a ship desperately in need of repair, they must cope with the resources at hand. If they are always wishing for more, the Referee is doing something right.

Not every situation should be desperately dangerous, however. If the Travellers make good decisions and stack the deck, they may be able to exploit the turbulence of the war, taking advantage of situations or opportunities that might otherwise not arise. Difficult times call for great deeds and it may be that those deeds lead to advancement. Likewise, the Travellers may be able to obtain rewards they do not really deserve in return for furthering the cause of one of the factions.

It may be that the Travellers emerge from the war as political leaders – official or otherwise – or as shadowy figures who pull the strings of those ostensibly in power. They might have to deal with an uncomfortable post- bellum situation but it may be that their actions lead to an outcome favourable to their future aims. At this point, the future is wide open for those who dare to seize it.

The Third Imperium has fought four Frontier Wars against the Zhodani Consulate and its allies. Worlds have changed hands, borders have been readjusted, but never has the Imperium been seriously threatened... until now. As Zhodani battle fleets emerge from jumpspace at Regina, Efate, and Jewell, something is different this time.

The Imperials are divided, arguing over who should be Sector Duke even as raiders tear through the Lunion and Glisten subsectors. Lanth is under ground attack. Extolay is burning. The Imperial response is fragmented and ineffective. Reinforcements are months away and the Sector Admiral is frittering away what forces he has.

Jump into a trench at the Fall of Lanth or join the intrigue at the ducal court at Mora. Run weapons to Ine Givar insurgents or chase Sword Worlds raiders across Lunion. Hold back the Zhodani tide at the First Battle of Regina or lead the breakthrough of the 40th Fleet as it lunges at Macene.

These are the great events that will shape the future, and it may be that the outcome rests on the actions of your Travellers.

The Fifth Frontier War is the first sourcebook in this massive campaign that can span years of play and will powerfully alter the future of the Charted Space universe.
