Querion lies entirely outside of the [[Imperium]]. Most of the subsector is claimed by the [[Zhodani Consulate]] as an area of interest, although if expansion into the area was desired it would have been carried out long ago. Much of this territory was gained at the end of the [[Third Frontier War]].

Six worlds in the subsector are formally part of the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] and linked to it via a narrow strip of territory running coreward through the [[Cronor subsector]]. The Zhodani naval bases at [[Rapp's World]] and [[Querion]] represent the most rimward Zhodani possessions in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

The remainder of the subsector is mostly neutral, although the Entropic Worlds ([[Winston]], [[Entrope]] and [[Anselhome]]) are claimed by both the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] and [[Darrian Confederation]]. They are, at present, held by the [[Sword Worlds]], having been conquered in the [[Fourth Frontier War]].

The [[Imperium]] set up Research Station Delta at [[Retinae]] when that world was part of the [[Imperium]] and has since maintained it as an [[Imperial]] possession on an otherwise neutral planet. It is connected to the [[Imperium]] by way of a naval courier route through [[Thanber]] and administered from [[Frenzie]] in the [[Vilis subsector]].

Although retention of the station was agreed to by the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]], alleged violations of the agreement are a frequent cause of Zhodani diplomatic protests.

The subsector is sparse in terms of stellar density and contains mostly mid-tech worlds of little economic or political importance. One exception is [[Bael]], rumored to be the site of large deposits of [[lanthanum]], which is vital to the manufacture of jump drives. This has attracted commercial interest and a certain amount of competition among freelance prospectors. The world's remote location, requiring jump-3 ships for access, is a barrier to exploitation.

Critics of the Zhodani and their political system point to the fact that, although the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] is supposedly stable and works to prevent internal conflict, the population of [[Asmodeus]] still managed to break into factions and fight a nuclear war, which smashed the planetary economy and infrastructure, as well as drastically reducing the population. The [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] has begun reconstruction as the radioactive dust settles but the conflict ended a century ago and there is little left to rebuild.
