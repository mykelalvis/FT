The 24 star systems of Atsah are all within the [[Imperium]], although the region has a distinct cultural identity as a result of its history. Atsah is astrographically important as a link to Corridor and thus to the Imperial heartland beyond and, as such, it is of strategic interest in regions as far away as the Spinward Marches. A more stable subsector might not draw such great attention but Atsah is prone to rather vigorous internal politics.

This situation has its origins in the pre-Imperial era.  Atsah was the center of a loose federation of Vargr worlds when the [[Imperium]] began pushing through the sector and co-opted into Imperial membership by demonstrations of strength and incentives for local leaders. On one hand this allowed a large region to be incorporated relatively easily; on the other it meant that the Duchy of Atsah continued in the previous tradition of turbulent politics based on personalities rather than policies.

At any given time, some worlds in Atsah are likely to be in rebellion, or in dispute with the [[Imperium]], and some will have client state status rather than full membership.  This is a polite way of saying that the world government is making noise about secession from the [[Imperium]], or even declared it, but Imperial authorities have not recognized the move as this would require a full intervention. This polite fiction allows other, subtler, measures to be taken – which can often be nothing more than waiting until the local political wind changes.

The Dukes of Atsah have always put their disputes with Vincennes and Inar, and their own interests, ahead of those of the [[Imperium]]. The dukes have a history of permitting favored factions to get away with extreme bending of rules and only intervening to stop conflicts when external pressure becomes too much or their favorites start losing. The region has become a constant low-level nuisance, with the occasional major crisis and given its strategic importance this is of grave concern to the Imperial authorities.

The subsector fleet – the 88th – is heavily politicised and whilst it does the job of suppressing independent pirates, it tends to become embroiled in local disputes and turn a blind eye to 'internal' transgressions. Sector fleet assets are routinely assigned to conduct gunboat diplomacy in the region and remind all local factions that there are limits to wayward behaviour, even if the subsector duke is willing to tolerate their actions.

> [!info]- Jump Bridge ^atsa-jump-bridge
> Atsah maintains a [[Jump Bridge]] on a single, very large ice asteroid (map hex 2814). This links 10 worlds in the [[Dunmag Subsector|Dunmag]] and Atsah subsectors with a jump-1 main, which begins in trailing Atsah and runs throughout the Ian and Khouth subsectors in [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]]. In total, this main contains 21 systems in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and another 20 worlds in [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]].
>
> The public reason for this bridge is to promote jump-1 merchant traffic in the subsector. An unstated, but generally understood, reason is to permit jump-1 access to [[Dunmag]], the ostensible capital world of the subsector. This allows Atsah to exert influence on [[Dunmag]] with relatively cheap ships. In contrast, [[Inar]] not only needs a minimum of jump-2, but it also has a greater distance to cover: 14 parsecs instead of Atsah's seven.
