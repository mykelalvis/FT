The syroc is an aerial reptiloid predator that hunts small- to mid-sized creatures on the surface of [[Syroe]]. An adult syroc measures approximately one and a half metres from head to tail and its leathery wings span from three to four metres, ending in sharp talons. Males and females use their talons for different purposes. Males use them to establish mating privileges and females to crack open hard-shelled or skinned prey for their young to eat and to ward off males when they are not ovulating. Syrocs are graceful and precise flyers and are often seen in flocks of two to five, slicing their way through Syroeâ€™s canyons. The air above the canyons is too thin to support their flight capabilities so they are rarely seen on the plateaus. However, they are occasionally found on the edge of an escarpment, hopping along and looking for small prey.
