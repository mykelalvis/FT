Evergreen Research Vessel
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

The Evergreen is a small research vessel, with a collection of
laboratories and libraries that focus on researching plant life. Most
of the ship's space is dedicated to holding samples, each at various
stages of growth, small biospheres being dotted around the entire ship.
The center of the ship contains a larger version, teeming with microflora
and fauna. There is space enough for the crew and four botanists, and
most posted here are given two-term contracts due to the time required
for cultivation.

Being able to travel atmospherically is key, making it possible to gather
plant samples, however it does not have a high jump capacity,and
completely lacks weapons. Its cost means that only the upper echelon
of botanical research teams would consider it. They can sometimes
be regarded as a valuable target, depending on cargo, and most
governments deploy them in a small fleet with two small escorts
capable of fending off pirates.

Jerzi Gerari, Pilot
**By Geir Lanesskog**

Location: Any Corellan League world in The Beyond with a Class A or
B starport
Required Skills: Ship skills, preferably including Engineering and
Gunnery
Reward: Cr50000 for each Traveller and two sets of Corellan identity cards
issued in false names. Also, any 'loot' acquired during the operation

Mission: Fake a hijacking in order to recover a Gerari family heirloom

Jerzi Gerari is a younger great-grandchild (one of 23) of the head of
House Gerari, one of the most powerful Great Houses of Corella. The
ex-navy pilot is captain of the Pearl passenger liner Obsidian Shard,
owned by the Delejora Consortium, a small transport corporation. He
is a decent pilot and fair astrogator, yet known more for his carousing
skills than his keen intellect.

Decades earlier, Annabella Gerari, then head of House Gerari, gambled
away the family's signed copy of the Peace of Kaiear agreement, which
ended the 1,000 years of Aslan Expeditions and brought peace to
The Beyond. The document is one of four remaining copies in non-
Aslan possession and effectively priceless. In the ensuing years the
document changed hands several times. It was recently sold at auction
for MCr200 to Gordon Delejora, chairman of the Delejora Consortium.

The document is being transferred aboard the Obsidian Shard and
kept in a safe inside the ship's locker. Jerzi intends to recover the
document for his family, hoping to increase his standing within House
Gerari, but knows any direct theft would leave him as the only obvious
suspect. Therefore, he has concocted what he believes to be a 'brilliant
plan'. He wants the Travellers to replace members of his crew, who
will conveniently fail quarantine checks at their current destination and
be subject to a 28-day quarantine (by reciprocal agreement between
Corellan systems, they must remain on the world where they failed the
check). The Travellers will be hired through a third-party agency with no
known ties to the Gerari family and will use a set of legitimately issued,
but fraudulently generated, identity cards to become crew members.
Bribes Gerari has made to customs agents, government clerks and the
hiring agency make this process possible.

The replacement crew will 'hijack' the Obsidian Shard as an inside
job and force the ship to jump to an unscheduled destination (within
three parsecs of the starting location – pick a poorly travelled system
with a Class D or E starport and at least one other system within two

parsecs) and escape aboard the Sequoia Nasirim, a waiting Soho-
class light freighter (see JTAS Volume 1, page 76). The Travellers are
instructed to force Gerari to jump at gunpoint, unless they are qualified
astrogators themselves.

The document is in a sealed case, a Formidable (14+) TL13 electronic
lock – although the Travellers are not required to open the case,
just deliver it to the Sequoia Nasirim. The case is in a safe in the
ship's locker. Gerari will unlock the safe 'under duress' and it also
contains Cr25000 in cash and Cr120000 worth of valuables held for
the passengers. The locker also stores four snub pistols and eight
TL12 vacc suits for the crew members – self-sealing, with a standard
electronics suite plus TL12 thrusters and magnetic boots – although
they prominently display the Delejora logo.

To make it look like a 'legitimate' hijacking, the Travellers are allowed
to keep any valuables taken from the passengers – from the safe or
directly – and whatever cargo they can transfer to the waiting ship (up
to 50 tons of the 95 tons aboard Obsidian Shard will fit). No passengers
or original crew members are to be harmed. Gerari is fine with a few
being 'roughed up', if necessary, but will panic if anyone is killed.

Gerari, any unwitting crew and the passengers will be left unharmed
aboard the Obsidian Shard, which can then make its way to the
nearest starport. The crew aboard the waiting Sequoia Nasirim will
take possession of the document case and expect to share in the
value of any stolen cargo they need to help fence, sell or smuggle.
The Travellers can then use their second set of false identities to travel
freely in Corellan space.

Referee's Information
Roll 1D or choose from one of the options below:

1: All is as stated. The normal crew of the Obsidian Shard is six,
including Gerari and the Travellers, but extra stewards and/or gunners
can increase the crew to as many as nine to accommodate a larger
party. The ship has 24 passengers aboard who will need to be confined
to their staterooms for the duration of the 'hijacking', which will last at
least the full seven days of jump and some margin on either side. The
Travellers are free to concoct schemes to rob the passengers and
acquire additional loot from the 95 tons of cargo, as determined by the
Referee. The passengers and any remaining 'legitimate' crew will not
attempt to overpower the hijackers unless they have a clear advantage.
No more than three passengers have military training and none are
armed with more than cutlery and improvised clubs.

The crew of the Sequoia Nasirim will adhere to the terms of the plan
but will insist on taking half the value of any stolen cargo, plus a
Cr1000 per ton 'freight fee', although a skilled negotiator can at least
get the fee waived.

The second set of identity cards will allow the Travellers to freely
move about the Corellan League. A League-wide alert for the
hijackers is issued and irregularities with the records used – identities
not matching other database records – mean the Travellers will trigger
security scans at starports on a 2D roll of a 12, per Traveller, once per
starport. Also, former passengers and crew of the Obsidian Shard are
likely to recognize them immediately unless they take measures to
alter their appearance.

Gerari is likely (8+ on 2D) to be caught eventually because one of the
bribed clerks will talk but he will find it hard to name his accomplices
because he does not know the names used in the second set of
identities. However, he does know them by the names used when first
encountered and will eventually give these up.

On a 2D roll of 10+ (6+ if Gerari is caught), the clerk who issued the
second set of false identities is discovered within D6 months of the
hijacking and those false identities will be traced, leading to automatic
detection at any Corellan League starport as the information begins to
spread from its point of origin at three parsecs every 10 days.

2–3: All is more or less as summarised and as described in 1 but
five of the passengers and one of any remaining legitimate crew have
military training and will concoct a plan to retake the ship while it is in
jumpspace, using improvised weaponry and deception. Events are up
to the Referee and should consider whatever precautions the Travellers
take to secure the ship.

The cargo is as above but the crew of the Sequoia Nasirim will
demand all of it as part of their 'fee' and potentially use force to
achieve it, although persuasive or combative Travellers may be able
to reverse the situation.

4–6: As stated in 2–3 but in addition to the five with some military
background, two of the passengers are elite undercover security
operatives employed by Gordon Delejora. They are suspicious of the
crew change and will watch the Travellers carefully. Both are armed with
body pistols and ceramic daggers, and equipped with Diplo Vest (+3)
armor. They have master codes to unlock full ship access, but this is
not well concealed and any Traveller who thinks to change crew access
codes will notice the Delejora security override code on an Average (8+)
Electronics (computers) check. The security experts do not trust Jerzi
Gerari and will attempt to recover the document, even bargaining the
Travellers' escape for its recovery and the apprehension of Gerari.

Alternative: If the Travellers have a ship, they can take the role of
the Sequoia Nasirim or even both the hijacker and ship roles. The
ship must deliver the document case to a drop location another two
parsecs away. For their trouble, the ship and crew receive Cr250000,
of which Cr100000 is in advance, and a new set of identities including
a complete alternate transponder setting and ship's documentation
with a name and port of registration of their choice. These identities
are subject to the same risks as those of the hijackers but authorities
only make the direct connection with the ship and its crew on a single
check of 9+, subject to any DMs for clever ideas the ship's crew has to
disguise their involvement in the transfer of the hijackers and their loot.

Finally: Delejora Consortium is a law-abiding organization and any
action against Jerzi or the Travellers will involve law enforcement, not
private action – unless one of the security operatives is killed and their
partner survives. If the Travellers decide to keep the document and sell
it, it would be worth MCr50–100 on the black market but House Gerari
will send an elite hit team of four mercenaries to recover the document
and/or eliminate the Travellers. If this happens, Jerzi will meet with an
unfortunate accident if his family finds out he tried and failed to recover
the document. In fact, they will not be very pleased with him even if he
succeeds – certainly not if he is caught, although in success he may
gain stature among one rather unpleasant family faction.

JERZI GERARI
Jerzi Gerari may only be the 20th of 23 great-grandchildren of the head
of House Gerari but he is a proud member of one of the oldest Great
Houses of Corella. Athletic and good-looking in his youth, he has gained
considerable weight and lost considerable hair in middle age, the latter
addressed by permanent full head dilapidation. He is popular at parties
and well-liked by his family but they do not take him seriously. Only family
influence got him into the Corellan Naval Academy and his career in

the Corellan system navy ended
at the rank of Lieutenant after a
dozen years. Employed as captain
of the Delejora Consortium's
passenger liner Obsidian Shard,
he is a solid if uninspiring
employee and only a fair manager
of his crew, treating them as naval
personnel, not civilians.

Class consciousness is evident
in Jerzi's interactions with others.
While he does not believe he is
better than everyone else, he
does believe his 'heritage' gives
him authority to be a leader and
thinks everyone should be aware
of their place in society. Jerzi is
vocal about his assertion that
he should have higher standing
within House Gerari, touting his
'real universe' experience as a
naval officer and merchant ship
captain. To his credit, he is not
afraid of real work and leads by
example, putting in long hours

- sometimes because mistakes
cause him to do things twice
- and expects subordinates to
share his dedication.

Jerzi's biggest flaws are his
sense of entitlement and lack
of moral compass. Although not
willing to commit murder, he is
unconcerned about the legality
of his activities and if someone
were to die as a result of his
actions or plots to gain influence,
he would eventually rationalise it
away. However, if forced to think
hard about his actions, with an
appeal to his naval service, he
may decide to do the right thing
but only if he felt he did not have
other options or a way to shift
blame onto someone else.

PEARL PASSENGER LINER
The Pearl passenger liner is Kraken Heavy Industries (KHI) Consortium's
answer to jump-3 transit between the remote Lyheric Cluster and the
remainder of the Corellan League. Based on a 25-meter spherical hull,
the Pearl uses advanced KHI-engineered drive and battery technology
to optimize performance and is capable of wilderness refuelling to pass
through such undeveloped systems as Nowhere, Dawn, Healer and
Virtue. The Pearl is employed by the Gateway Consortium in transits not
justifying its 40-meter Amethyst merchantmen.

Favorably comparable in price and performance to the Third
Imperium's standard subsidized liner design, and with the ability to add
armament against pirate and ihatei activity, the Pearl liner is a common
starship within and around the Corellan League. It can support 24
passengers in relative comfort and transport an additional 16 in low
berths along with more than 114 tons of cargo.

The Pearl's eight decks are arranged perpendicular to the maneuver
drive orientation. Forwardmost is A deck, which contains the bridge.
The lift connecting A through D decks can act as an egress point when
a Pearl is docked using the forward hatch and can also act as an
airlock when locked on A deck but this is not typical procedure.

B deck includes a large passenger lounge with floor-to-ceiling
viewports, a bar and a galley as well as the medical bay and
accommodations for the remainder of the crew. While the crew manifest
officially lists a single steward, ships within the Corellan League often
supplement the staff with four servitors – usually robotic units stored
in service areas but occasionally clones who are assigned makeshift
or cramped accommodations. When armed, the Pearl's gunners are
usually multi-role crewmembers.

C deck is the main passenger deck with 16 staterooms and 16 low
berths. D deck contains an additional eight staterooms, slightly larger
and better appointed and usually reserved for high passengers. The
cargo compartment occupies half of D and E deck, with a mezzanine
overlooking the six-meter high open cargo area. Large cargo doors on
E deck and an open lift platform can traverse D to F deck to load and
unload passengers and cargo from the slow boat docked aft. The main
personnel airlock is located on F deck. The cargo section is not officially
an airlock but can be sealed and act as a temporary one.

Half of E deck and most of F deck is dedicated to the fuel tankage
required for jump-3. G deck is the lowest full deck and with the partially
usable H deck it is mostly dedicated to the engineering section. An aft-
facing airlock allows emergency and maintenance egress from the ship.

In the decades since its introduction, the Pearl has spawned a number
of variants, most notable the Marble freighter capable of hauling
more than 250 tons of cargo, various luxury yacht conversions and a
number of jump-2 capable liners and freighters that sacrifice range for
decreased cost and increased revenue-generation. The most unique
variant is likely the Patient Sky, built for the Patient of Goal Terminus
to bring converts to their isolated world. A barracks-like common
room arrangement allows the Patient Sky to transport more than 100
aspirants to their new home in orbit of a dead star.

As it allows for standardization of shipyard construction berths, the
basic 25-meter 600-ton hull is common to several KHI ship designs for
commercial, government and military use, including the Morningstar
assault corvette.

Hasumbuk
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli
(Gigans Phacochoerus)

The hasumbuk are herd animals found grazing on temperate worlds,
slow-moving and often unwilling to cooperate with those who manage
them. A native species to Colada (B564685-B) in the Sword Worlds,
wild hasumbuk can only be found near the planet's singular ocean
within which they bathe and play.

Quadrupedal and weighing roughly 200 kilograms they are farmed for
their impressive hides, which can be used as gifts for visiting emissaries
or other persons of importance. Hard to originally ensnare due to their
sharp lower teeth, they now act as both workhorse and profit source for
a handful of farmers on Colada. Unfortunately, due to the sharpness of
their lower teeth they have developed a protruding lower jaw and these
teeth need to be manually filed to prevent them puncturing the roof of
the hasumbuk's mouth or be worn by consuming vegetation.

With a height of 120–140 centimeters at the shoulder, they are
formidable when enraged; a common occurrence when farmhands are
emptying the troughs used to feed them. In the wild they are usually
docile enough although if they feel threatened, will attack using their
teeth to bite any who come near. Aiding in this attack are the forward-
facing spikes on each shoulder that can be used to pin enemies in
place. The marks of previous battles can be seen in the rocks and trees
surrounding their dens. Another evolutionary advantage is their speed
and the hasumbuk' have long, powerful legs that can outrun many other
mammals on Colada.

Their natural lifespan is great, with the oldest recorded hasumbuk living
for 35 years. The gestation period is suitably lengthy, lasting nearly two
years. This is when the hasumbuk is at its most volatile and mothers
are fiercely protective over their young, who are not fully capable until
their third year. Most do not walk for six months, instead relying on their
parents to care for them. However, their necessity for colostrum is still
high and young hasumbuk will fight with their underdeveloped teeth to
access their mothers' teats.

Boisterous and playful when in a pack, hasumbuk can be seen
frolicking in the shallows of Colada's ocean. This can be detrimental to
anyone wishing to corral them, as they have come to recognize their

trainers as part of the pack. The pack has a strict hierarchy usually
enforced by the strongest male, although leadership can also be
awarded to the most brightly coloured. Being shades of deep violet to
teal, with spikes coming in lighter variations of the same colours, their
hide is a coat of velveteen fur.

With a diet consisting of a large variety of vegetation, in the wild they
will simply rest wherever a large swathe of greenery can be found.
Using their snouts and teeth, they can be seen to dig small divots
into the ground to use as dens. When fully grown the hasumbuk are
beneficial pack animals due to their size, strength and proficiency for
training. They should not, however, be mistaken for a domesticated pig,

as their relative intelligence can cause them to behave erratically.

Organised Crime in the Core
**By Christopher Griffen**

Mafias, gangsters, mobs, syndicates – they all refer to the same thing:
organised crime. Despite the best efforts of law enforcement agencies,
criminal organizations thrive in the Third Imperium. The Imperium is a
diffuse polity that allows individual worlds to govern themselves, provided
they do not flout Imperial law or impede the flow of free trade. In such an
environment, myriad forms of governmental and legal structure (or a lack
thereof) are allowed to exist on member worlds. This vast collection of
disparate societies is fallow ground for organised crime.

By and large, most citizens of the Imperium live law-abiding lives,
serving in the military, working for a corporation or one of the immense
megacorporations or running businesses of their own. Some worlds
use the powerful automation of high technology to give their citizens
complete freedom. All of their basic needs – food, shelter and the like –
are provided, freeing them from labour and allowing them to spend their
time doing whatever they choose. Other worlds embrace the notion of
inequality as a motivator with the narrative that the 'haves' acquire wealth
and status through hard work. The 'have nots' can better their station via
the fruits of their labour, or so the story goes. There are other worlds still
that maintain strict caste systems or other hierarchies that hinder social
mobility or prevent it from occurring at all. In each of the cases described
above, criminal organizations have found niches in which to operate.

The Core is one of the richest sectors in the Imperium. It is the seat of
the empire, where Emperor Strephon sits upon the Iridium Throne on
[[Capital]]. It is here the most powerful megacorporations command entire
fleets of mercantile starships and where the nobility and megacorporate
elite store untold riches in the sector's banks, stock markets and other
investments. Despite the wealth and opulence of the Core, its bounties
are not shared equally. Many of its citizens find themselves on the
outside looking in. There is little wonder in such a place that some
would turn to crime to even the scales, to claim what wealth and power
they can through illicit means.

The causes of organised crime are many but the following factors are
generally believed to be the greatest motivators:
•  Wealth disparity – the Core is an immensely rich sector but
distribution of that wealth is far from equal. The difficulty of
establishing legitimate enterprises in the sector have led many
to pursue shortcuts to obtain wealth. Newcomers to the Core
often find its power structure to be opaque and impenetrable,
and some turn to criminal ventures to get ahead.

```
•  Disparate governmental and legal structure – goods and
services that may be legally obtained on one world are often
contraband on the next. Smuggling flourishes in such an
environment. While naval forces can be called upon to prevent
the illegal transportation of goods between star systems, space
is big. Cunning smugglers find ways to elude and circumvent
the safeguards that are in place.
•  Political strife – while the Emperor professes to rule over a fair
and just interstellar society, there are trouble spots throughout
the Imperium and the Core is no different. Amber Zone worlds
are ofttimes those whose political issues have spilled over into
their respective interstellar communities. Malcontents from
such places often seek redress for the perceived ills they have
suffered and turn to criminal pursuits. While the Imperium
is quick to suppress insurgencies, small-scale underworld
activities are sometimes allowed to exist as a necessary means
of 'venting' for the oppressed.
```

In many ways, organised crime serves as a 'cleanser' of sorts. It
provides a means for outsiders to take part in society and the economy,
albeit illegally. Without a viable way to obtain sufficient wealth or
status, many of these individuals would either become a burden, cause
trouble or might simply starve to death. While there are few advocates
for gangsters among law-abiding citizenry, organised crime does
sometimes have a palliative effect in troubled societies.

Many crime organizations operate like corporations. They provide a
supply where there is demand for illegal goods and services. They differ
in many ways from legitimate businesses, of course, none so stark as
the way they handle competition. Operating outside the boundaries of
the law, they cannot seek redress from the courts or law enforcement
agencies; therefore, they must resolve problems for themselves, often
using violence as a means. When one's 'turf' is threatened, criminal
organizations use assassination, extortion, kidnapping and even open
war to resolve issues with one another. However, they must be careful.
Should their activities draw too much attention, their operations can be
disrupted by law enforcement. The wealthiest criminal organizations
corrupt the police with bribes where they can but the public will only
tolerate so much mayhem. Criminal organizations are more successful
when they fly under the radar. If their conflicts spill over into the streets or
their activities cause too much strife, they are inevitably brought to heel.

Organised crime in an interstellar society adds new dimensions to how
organizations operate. Small operations or gangs typically limit their
scope to a single world. Larger gangs operate throughout the worlds of
a single star system or between a few nearby star systems, usually only
one or two parsecs away. The most powerful operate on an interstellar
scale, their activities spanning over a cluster of worlds, a subsector or
even an entire sector.

Running an interstellar crime organization is challenging. Just as it is
for a legitimate polity or corporation, communication and transportation
are limited by the speed of jump. There is no way for a local mob
boss to immediately warn associates the next parsec over that law
enforcement is coming for them, nor can they easily inform them
that the smuggled goods they were expecting have been diverted or
'pinched' by the police. Access to starships is required for all interstellar
gangsters. Messages can be sent via the x-boat network, just like any
legitimate enterprise; however, smart criminals make sure to encrypt
communications lest their missives be intercepted by snooping law
enforcement agents.

Sometimes, the mail system is not enough. Personnel transfers,
smuggled contraband, weapons caches and other capital goods
shipments require access to passenger and cargo space. Judicious
use of commercial spacecraft is enough for smaller organizations
but larger mafias require their own ships, most of which have been
obtained by illicit means. Piracy, theft and starship 'chop shops' are
frequent sources. Smuggling and hijacking networks steal complete
sets of starship components and then have spacecraft built at reduced
cost at shipyards willing to do work 'off the books'. Class A starports
on worlds with low populations and low to middle Law Levels where no
naval or scout bases are present are popular choices, especially those
off the beaten path. Anarki/Ameros (A200524-F), Kersi Am/Shinkan
(A427456-E), Per/Sanches (A673410-C), Kisa/Dingtra (A7C6320-E)
and Siniir Sa/Ch'naar (A599367-D) are all suspected purveyors of
illegally built starships. Much like pirate ships, many of these are
equipped with variable transponders, used to deceive patrol spacecraft.
Possession of such technology is grounds for immediate impoundment
of a ship and the arrest of its crew.

Following are descriptions of four criminal organizations from the Core,
although there are many more to be found. One must merely look in the
right places to find them. Wherever there is inequality, political strife,
inconsistent legal topography or the opportunity to obtain illegal profits,
one will find criminals. Among them can be found well-organised crime
syndicates built to maximise profit and power.

THE YIRSH POY SYNDICATE
The Sylean Worlds are an Imperial Cultural Zone, granted special
privileges and protections that other Imperial worlds do not have. The
Syleans are a human Minor Race, held in high regard by the Imperium
for historical reasons. Sylean philosophy and culture is credited in large
part for the early development of the Third Imperium.

In modern times, the Sylean Worlds are some of the richest and most
powerful in all of the Core. All but two worlds in the zone are exempted
from hosting military bases, with [[Capital]] and Yirsh Poy being the only
exceptions. The Sylean worlds are primarily focused on industrial

output and wealth generation. A cultural emphasis on industriousness,
honor and duty have made them the ideal Imperial citizens. With
a few exceptions, Law Levels are quite low on Sylean worlds, since
criminal behaviour is anathema to them. It might come as a surprise
then that some of the most effective mafias in the sector come from the
Sylean Worlds. Among these is the Yirsh Poy Syndicate, a paragon of
organization and effectiveness.

The Yirsh Poy, like most Sylean syndicates, exist at the leisure of the
cultural zone government, a necessary check on corporate excess and
inequality. Like the Solomani mythical character of Robin Hood, the
Yirsh Poy and other syndicates are allowed to nip away at the profits
of Sylean corporations to the best of their abilities, redistributing this to
members of society who have failed to secure more legitimate roles.
The syndicates generally avoid turf wars but they do occur from time-
to-time. Most are arbitrated by zone officials but when negotiations
fail syndicates may engage in limited violence with one another. Such
conflicts are often quite formal, resolved by duels with individual
leaders, champions or small groups of combatants. The lethality of
these conflicts is negotiable but can range from an aggrandised paint
ball gun or laser-marker contest to more lethal affairs involving melee
weapons or live ammunition.

Outside the boundaries of the Sylean Worlds, the syndicates operate
more like standard criminal organizations, running gambling rings,
smuggling, equity manipulation, loan sharking and protection rackets.
All in the name of securing the Sylean legacy, of course. While most
of the syndicates shy away from sophont trafficking, assassination,
political interference and other crimes that they find distasteful, they are
feared by other gangsters due to their brutal efficiency.

DERUSHANGAR
The Vilani have been present in the Core for over 8,000 years, calling
the sector Ukan after colonising it during the first great expansion of
the Economic Sphere. With no serious contenders to compete with, the
Vilani built their empire at a slow, methodical pace, annexing worlds,
establishing institutions and then repeating the process over and over
as they branched outward. The bleeding edge of Vilani advancement
was very much under the control of the Bureaux, which directed and
cultivated the expansion process. The Vilani were uniquely suited to
the slow establishment of an interstellar empire but the Ziru Sirka soon
became so vast that fissures inevitably began to develop in its culture.

The Vilani caste system relies upon the cooperation of successive
generations to submit to the will of their superiors and accept assigned
roles in society. A variety of factors allowed this idea to break down or
become corrupted over time. Life on hardscrabble colonies was not
always fair and millennia-old traditions were more difficult to enforce
as the Vilani extended further and further away from Vland. The
disenfranchised, people who struggled to find their way and settle into
assigned roles, sometimes strayed from the course, creating pockets
of dissent and unsanctioned subcultures despite the best efforts of the
Bureaux to stamp them out. Sectors managed by individual bureaux
were the most effective at reincorporating dissidents. However, regions
with mixed bureaux control were less thorough and burgeoning
subcultures flourished in the backwaters and underworlds of Vilani
society. Among the most resilient of these were the Derushangar,
loosely translated as the 'Unseen' or 'Invisible People'.

While their exact origins have been lost in the annals of time, it is
believed that the Derushangar originated in either the Kakadan
subsector of Vland or the Apge subsector of Ukan (Core) in
approximately -6400. Before the fall of the Ziru Sirka, the Derushangar
led a precarious existence, constantly under the persecution of law
enforcement. Nevertheless, they managed to carve out a considerable
empire in the slums and hovels of colonial worlds. The fall of the
Ziru Sirka and rise of the Rule of Man was a golden age for the
Derushangar. They thrived in the chaos of Solomani occupation,
smuggling goods, providing much-needed materials for struggling
colonies and frontier worlds – at extortionate prices, of course – and
ensured that the oppressed traditions of shugilii were preserved
in spite of Solomani efforts to squelch them. Ironically, the long-

oppressed Derushangar were instrumental in the preservation of key
aspects of Vilani culture during the occupation. However, the arrival
of the Long Night brought about the end of large scale interstellar
civilization and with it, the fall of Derushangar as a powerful underworld
organization. However, Derushangar did not completely die out. Two
of its most powerful factions survived on Apge/Apge (A772A97-F)
and Mishaar/Perite (B540AA8-E), two worlds that persevered through
the Long Night, both of which had large populations and challenging
environments to deal with.

```
A DISH BEST SERVED COLD
Originating as they did on the Ziru Sirka frontier, the shugilii arts
were very important to the Derushangar. In fact, their kukum
(leaders) are traditionally expert shugilii. While the primary use
of their culinary talents is to feed loyal soldiers, they have also
been known to use their skills for more nefarious purposes.
Knowing which foods are safe to consume means also knowing
which are not. Enemies and members of rival gangs have been
known to die from consuming poisonous foods surreptitiously
inserted into their kitchens.
```

In spite of nearly 1,000 years of separation, the Apgean and Mishaari
branches of Derushangar were reunited centuries before the advent of
the Third Imperium. Early trade missions between Sylea and Vland in
approximately -500 allowed the two factions of Derushangar to rekindle
their association. Despite their inevitable differences, the two factions
began the process of rebuilding their organization. The early days of
trade between the empires of Sylea and Vland primarily benefitted an
elite class in both. Sylean nobles and Vilani bureaux chiefs acquired the
lion's share, with commoners left wanting. Many factors contributed to
the growth of a more equitable distribution of profits but Derushangar
was an early catalyst. In ramshackle starships, Derushangar gangs
hijacked poorly defended traders, selling their goods on the black
market. Over time the organization was reborn, establishing franchises
on most worlds of the Annililik Run but with none so powerful as those
of Apge and Mishaar.

In modern times, Derushangar is a hybrid organization, heavily invested
in legitimate enterprises including significant holdings in the four Vilani
megacorporations, and also remaining firmly entrenched in underworld
activities. Derushangar propagates a narrative in which it stands for the
Vilani people, a subversive agency that refuses to be fully incorporated
into the Third Imperium. Derushangar gangsters are romanticised in
Vilani entertainment media, usually portrayed as dangerous, violent but
ultimately honorable criminal businessmen, grudgingly admired by
the people and somehow always staying one step ahead of feckless
Imperial law enforcement agents. In truth, Derushangar is much like
any other criminal enterprise; it defies the law where there are profits
to be made. The vast majority of its wealth is held by the kukum, rarely
trickling down to Vilani commoners.

EKILATI ONATI
Also known as 'the Antareans', this organization is a multi-sector
Vargr crime organization that primarily operates out of Aarza Kand in
Shinkan. The Ekilati Onati are composed of expatriate Irilitok Vargr
who are considered low-level thugs in most sectors but in Shinkan they
have a more impressive reputation. The Ekilati Onati arose largely in
response to the human Triad of Syndicates that have fostered a lawless
environment on Ishnuunar, Derku and Gekhuu, as well as the rest of
the subsector. The Vargr recognized that Shinkan was ripe ground for
an ambitious gang.

The Antareans try to keep a low profile but when crossed, they are
known to respond to challenges with violence. They often employ
humans as enforcers and assassins to prevent law enforcement officers
from easily implicating their Vargr leadership. Their signature act of
retribution is to perform a 'defanging' before murdering someone. The
bodies of their victims are found with their incisors and often their claws

- or fingernails if human – removed. Mid-level gangsters sometimes
wear collected teeth and claws on a necklace.

The Antareans have an interstellar presence but tend to avoid long-
term ownership of starship assets. Instead, they hijack small traders for
temporary use and hack the software of liner and freighter corporations
to obtain free passage and cargo space to transport personnel and
goods. The Core's Ekilati Onati chapter are most active on Aarza
Kand, making sure to get a cut of every gram of business that flows
through their system but are in the process of establishing franchises
on neighboring systems as well. Their signature operations are
smuggling, sophont trafficking and protection rackets.

Imperial law enforcement has had a difficult time dealing with the Ekilati
Onati since they hide among regular, hard-working Irilitok minority
communities. In addition, their structure relies upon federations of small
cells that are difficult to penetrate. The police have had some success
arresting and incarcerating individual gangsters here and there but they
have had problems breaking down associated groups whose ties with
one another dissipate like smoke once a single cell has been infiltrated
or one of its members arrested.

AURSISIA EXÈRCITI
The nobility are the bureaucracy of the Imperium, administrative chiefs
who watch over its 11,000 star systems, collecting taxes and ensuring
that Imperial law is followed. In most cases, nobles maintain an aloof
presence, deliberately distant from the star system governments they
oversee. There are exceptions, of course.

In the Ch'naar subsector, the [[Duchess Colyere Hajesta daMae]] is as
intrusive a noble as one is likely to find. She micromanages the worlds
under her purview, encroaching upon their affairs like a mother hen,
interfering with policy decisions and often directing local leaders to do her
bidding. The magnate of Aursis, the most powerful world in Ch'naar, is no
more than a puppet dictator whose strings are pulled by House daMae.
The Duchess' household troops – or 'Huscarles' as they are called
in Imperial parlance – are the finest, most well-equipped and trained
soldiers in the subsector, feared by other noble houses. While they are
vastly outnumbered by the planetary armies of the subsector's most
populous systems, most are still afraid of coming to blows with them.

The Duchess claims that the exorbitant amount of authority she wields is
all for the good of the Imperium. She posits that Ch'naar is a necessary
counterweight to the dangers of a massive Chanestin insurgency in the
neighboring [[Dunea subsector]]. The Chanestin, whose culture dates
back deep into the Long Night when they held sway over a kingdom of
25 worlds, have long resisted full incorporation into the Imperium and
have been clamouring for a cultural zone similar to that of the Syleans.
Chanestin extremists have been responsible for multiple terrorist attacks
over the last few decades and minor insurgencies have bucked Imperial
authority on several of their worlds. Despite the occasional kerfuffle, the
Imperium seems to have things well in hand; nevertheless, the Duchess
daMae has been given virtual carte blanche in the establishment of a
veritable Sword of Damocles to hang over Chanestin heads.

One group of agencies that work in her favor are the militias known as
the Aursisia Exèrciti. While the Duchess claims to have no official ties to
them, this collection of private armies operates in virtual lockstep with
her goals. The Exèrciti are active throughout much of the subsector
but have large presences on Ekhuurme, Dimanaam and Malaash, all
former Chanestin worlds. As unsanctioned armies, publicly disavowed
by the Duchess herself, the Exèrciti rely on criminal enterprises to fund
their activities. Most are typical organised crime fare such as gambling,
sophont trafficking, smuggling, racketeering and illegal arms dealing.
While the Exèrciti 'inadvertently' serve the interests of the Duchess,
they sometimes get out of hand. When caught in the open engaging in
criminal enterprises, public outcry follows, forcing the Duchess to act
against them. Typically, she cracks down with an overt show of force
by her Huscarles, who specialise in counterinsurgency. This usually
ameliorates Ch'naari citizens who then return to their affairs and either
forgive or forget the complicity of their Duchess.

There are conspiracy theories afoot that make the Duchess out to
be a more active participant in the affairs of these criminal armies, a
'Madrina' who lords it over an assembly of Exèrciti 'soldatos'. Such
theories are considered absurd by the majority of the populace. Most
note that the Duchess clearly has the Emperor's favor and could not
possibly be involved in such blatantly criminal affairs.

Aursis and more, refer to The Third Imperium.

TravellingTravelling

Monetising Heroism
**By Martin J Dougherty**

Traveller does not have a formal mechanic for rewarding good deeds
done for free. Some Travellers are happy to roleplay this but, as a rule,
advancement in a Traveller game translates to the ability to buy things.
If the Travellers are confident they can obtain a reward without the
formal 'this job for this amount of Credits' agreement, they may be more
willing to behave like heroes. Those who are only motivated by Credits
can be induced to create their own adventures once they realise the
benefits of success do not end with the mission payoff.

If the Referee can establish a reward environment where Credits are
not necessarily king, the Travellers will be forced to look for other
benefits from their current endeavor and may come to realise there
are other ways to profit from being heroes. The first stage is to move
away from the simple money-for-task model. The Travellers can still
expect to be paid for their work – most of the time at least – but the
sums involved need only be relatively small.

How small depends on the mission and level of short- and long-term
risk. Cr5000 is more than a typical starship crewmember makes in a
month and is reasonable for a few days' expert-level work. Physical
risk should increase the payment, as should the possibility of long-
term problems, whilst simple tasks pay less. As a general guideline,
an uncomplicated task requiring some creativity or specialist skills
should pay about two to four times as much the equivalent amount of
time working aboard a starship. Thus, Cr2500–5000 plus reasonable
expenses is a fair rate of pay for a fairly straightforward task requiring a
few days to a week or two.

Levels of danger or long-term risk will increase the reasonable level
of payout by 100–400%, creating a typical payment of Cr5000–25000
per Traveller for a few days' work. This is quite a lot of money but the
client is usually paying to have a problem solved without having to
go through the hassles of conventional recruitment and retention. For
the average working person, Cr10000 for a week's work would be an
unbelievable windfall, yet many Travellers will sniff at such a 'tiny' sum
and refuse the task.

USING REPUTATION
Not every Traveller can trade on their reputation. Those that commit
a lot of crimes or smash their way through every obstacle are unlikely
to be considered heroes. However, those that do high-profile good
deeds will acquire a reputation, which can lead to new opportunities.

This can be administered by the Referee on a freeform basis but some
guidelines may be useful. The Travellers' ability to monetise their status
can be tracked using a Fame characteristic.

Fame represents how widely known and recognized the Travellers are
in interstellar society. It will usually apply everywhere that has good
interstellar communications and an interest in wider affairs. Thus, if a
famous Traveller lands at a typical starport they may well be recognized,
whether they want it or not, but the staff at a backwater Class D starport
might meet the 'do you know who I am?' routine with blank stares. The
Referee should decide if Fame applies. As a general rule, the further a
Traveller goes from the region where fame was won, or from the culture it
was won in, the less likely it is people will have heard of them.

Fame is rated from 0–15 as with any other characteristic. Base value is
0 plus any positive SOC modifier the Traveller may have. SOC does not
necessarily translate directly to fame and reputation; there are plenty of
people who genuinely cannot recognize the sector's senior nobles other
than a vague idea they have seen this person somewhere before. Of
course, the context surrounding a person will aid recognition – seeing
an Imperial noble in their regalia supported by a retinue will usually
make it obvious who the Traveller is dealing with.

For those whose reputation comes from deeds rather than station,
Fame can be used to determine if they are recognized and, more
importantly for the Travellers, what the outcome will be. The Traveller
Reputation table gives an indication of how well-known the Travellers
are in their current region or the wider universe.

Traveller Reputation

```
Fame Notes
0 Who?
1–2 Virtually unknown.
3–4 Aren't you one of those people that... did a thing... one time?
5–6 Minor local or niche celebrity.
7–8 Well-known locally or in a narrow and perhaps unusual niche,
for example the Traveller is widely known among astrogators
and wine afficionados but not outside of these communities.
9–10 Well-known and admired by a broad spectrum of people.
11–12 Major local or niche celebrity, recognized more widely but
esteemed less beyond the local region or niche.
13–14 Hugely famous in the local area, well-known in wider
interstellar society.
15 The Traveller cannot go anywhere without being recognized.
They are a household name and are likely to be pestered by
paparazzi or over-zealous fans at every opportunity.
```

GAIN AND LOSS
A reputation cannot be built overnight. Travellers will usually gain one
point of Fame when they carry out newsworthy and positive actions. As
many as three points of Fame might be gained from some particularly
impressive deed or at the end of a mini-campaign where the Travellers
have undertaken significant actions. This of course presupposes
anyone knows about what they did; some Travellers prefer to keep
their activities out of the newsvids and some actions take place in the
shadows where nobody will ever know about them. It is always possible
for word to get out, so secretive Travellers can still gain Fame.

Fame decays if it is not increased or maintained. Fame drops by one
every 3D weeks, until it reaches a value of 3. Unless the Traveller
changes their identity or otherwise leaves their reputation behind, Fame
will not go below this. In addition, Fame can be drastically reduced if
bad deeds become public knowledge or if the Travellers refuse to help
in a situation where they could be expected to. This should not be taken

to ridiculous extremes; the Travellers are not expected to rush around
rescuing kittens from trees but if they bug out instead of helping in a
disaster, fingers will be pointed. A reduction of one to three points of
Fame should result from letting their fans down in this manner.

The Travellers might also be the victims of a smear campaign intended
to reduce their reputation. It is possible that a rival group of Travellers
might be behind such a campaign, seeking to further their own
reputation at the expense of the Travellers. This might even be turned
to advantage, with two bands of Travellers keeping themselves in the
public eye by engaging in a media feud. Alternatively, it may lead to the
Travellers having to confront enemies in an environment quite different
to the usual adventuring setting. Maintenance of reputation could
become a driver for the campaign, leading the Travellers to places they
otherwise would not have visited.

MAINTAINING A REPUTATION
There are a number of ways to maintain Fame, some of which might
lead to new experiences whilst others are more conventional. If
the Travellers do something modestly newsworthy, their Fame is
maintained. Rumors of a feud or a romance within the Travellers'
group or with a notable person will grab attention. As will sporting a
'raunchy new image' or holding forth on controversial topics. There are
many opportunities here for the Travellers to make fools of themselves
chasing fading fame but such is the celebrity lifestyle.

BENEFITS OF FAME
Some of the benefits of Fame are passive and often will be a
roleplaying matter rather than one of applying game mechanics.
Travellers who have done good deeds or saved people might
occasionally be given a round of drinks on the house or run into
someone who benefited and wants to thank them. It can seem that they
move from one place to the next and are forgotten, so encountering
someone whose life they improved or preserved adds a level of
meaning to the Travellers' own lives.

Fame generates a DM as with any other characteristic, which can
be used to influence the reception a Traveller gets. For example, the
Travellers need to convince someone to take an action – 'get in the air/
raft, no time to explain!' and the subject is unsure. A Persuade check
might be influenced by the fact that the Travellers are famous for saving
lives. They may have to put up with a fan gushing about how great
they are for the rest of the journey but such is fame. Fame might also
be applied without the Travellers realising it. For example, if the local
police are looking at potential suspects a positive Fame modifier might
be applied to a check to determine if the Travellers are investigated.
'Surely not them!' says the detective and looks for suspects elsewhere.

Fame DMs can be used actively as well, in which case a negative
modifier will apply under most circumstances. If the Travellers want
to use their reputation to get or do something they would not normally
have a chance at, a negative modifier will be applied. For example, if
the Travellers try to get a discount on their starship supplies by trading
on their reputation, being only slightly famous might work against
them. Indeed, some people are offended when a Z-list celebrity
demands a free meal or goods. Thus, a negative Fame modifier is
relevant in such situations.

In addition to influencing people, Fame can also be monetised.
Famous Travellers may end up plastered all over promotional videos
or drinking a beer with their names on the can. They may be able to
leverage any opportunity, perhaps making contacts or using the event
as a cover for other activities. There is also the unfortunate possibility
that some opportunities are fake, perhaps run by scammers or
enemies of the Travellers. Others are real but perhaps better passed
up. This monetization will typically not begin until Fame reaches a
value of 11. After this point, the Travellers will have a Fame-related
opportunity every 4D weeks. Each Traveller may roll separately on the
Opportunities table, applying their Fame DM.

Melee Matters
By Andrew Benton

Large melee weapons fall out of fashion as primary battlefield
weapons quickly when you meet a species with greater technological
advancements than your own. Swords and other such weapons tend
only to be carried as sidearms or as a matter of ceremony. Pirates and
other thuggish criminals often carry them for their intimidation value,
even at higher Tech Levels. This is especially true on the less-civilised
worlds of the Trojan Reach, where advanced melee weapons are status
symbols wielded by warlords, champions and wandering heroes.

POLEARMS
Weaponry such as halberds, glaives and poleaxes are all polearms,
melee weapons mounted on a long shaft. Capable of delivering
powerful cutting, slashing or stabbing blows, there are many varieties.
Smaller polearms are nimble and versatile, whilst larger and heavier
ones are harder to wield but deal a larger amount of damage.

Polearms

```
Weapon TL Range Damage Kg Cost Traits
Polearm 2 Melee 3D+2 3 Cr250 —
Heavy Polearm 2 Melee 3D+2 6 Cr400 Bulky, AP 2
```

ADVANCED BLADE MATERIALS
Any melee weapon with a cutting edge can be improved using better
materials at higher Tech Levels. Although melee weapons become less
common in lethal battles, there is still a place for bladed combat. As
material technology advances, armor worn by soldiers will become
ever more resistant to the cutting power of a hand weapon.

Fortunately, melee weaponry is able to advance similarly. Blades made
out of hypersteel are capable of holding unimaginably sharp edges.
Thermal blades are capable of instantly becoming white-hot at the
moment of impact, giving an incendiary effect, thanks to an internal
rechargeable power cell. NanoEdge technology allows the creation of
cutting edges that actively degrade the molecular bonds of the target.

Advanced Blade Materials

```
Material TL Cost Increase Damage Effects
Hypersteel 9 Cr750 — AP 5
Thermal 10 Cr1500 +1D Fire
NanoEdge 14 Cr3000 +1D AP 10

Tamara's Travelling Tavern and Cosmic Cabaret
**By CD Flanigan**

Tamara gained control of her cruiser during an uprising on a frontier
mining colony. The population had been working in unsafe and toxic
conditions whilst being underpaid by the Zand Corporation and were
discontented with their lot. The local Imperial Marines were dispatched to
deal with the problem under command of the now missing ambassador
Karen Ming. As the marines engaged with the miners, Tamara and her
crew boarded the cruiser and took control of the skeleton crew. The ship
jumped away, never to be seen again within civilised society.

Renamed Tamara's Travelling Tavern and Cosmic Cabaret (T3 for
short), the cruiser now makes money through the manufacture and
transportation of illegal anagathics, trade of corporate espionage,
offering of passage to those on the run and by being a meeting place
for those with governmental trust issues. Upon reaching a desired
location the tavern sends notice through its network of underworld
contacts that they are 'present and performing'. This code means the
floating establishment is open for business. It never fails that flocks of
professional criminals, shady corporate recruiters and those desperate
for solutions that Imperium authorities cannot endorse swarm to the
criminal cruiser's latest location.

The sight of the tavern on arrival is impressive. The 800 ton black and
red coated sphere bristles with eight triple turrets that make a point of
training their guns on approaching craft. The warcraft still carries an
Imperial Sunburst on its peak but a large red circle is painted around it
with a diagonal line crossing the circle and sunburst.

ENTRY TO TAMARA'S TAVERN
Any who want to board must avail themselves to one of the two
pinnacle cutters, who depart the T3 and dock with those who want to
pay a visit. The five-member pirate crew of the cutters all wear red and
black vacc suits and carry both laser pistols and stunners on holsters
slung over their shoulders. These thugs will allow only body pistols
and blades to be carried onto the cutter. After getting the names and
potential business prospects of the visitors they will ferry visitors over to
'the big show'.

If a Traveller is attempting to gain admittance to the T3 for anything
other than criminal purposes, such as collecting on a bounty or spying
on Tamara they must be able to lie exceedingly well. Checks made
to access the ship are made at Routine (6+) difficulty for Deception,
Average (8+) for Persuade or Difficult (10+) for Streetwise.

Upon arrival in the 30-meter-tall bay of the T3 they will be searched
again by more mercenaries in red and black vacc suits. Overseeing
this operation is a giant man shrouded in a black hostile environment
vacc suit, who occasionally barks orders through a voice modulator.
How he can see anything is the biggest question on the minds of
the mercenaries, as his face is hardly visible through the polarised
bubble helmet.

Once the Travellers pass these security measures, they will be
escorted to two blast doors that slide back to reveal a small glass
elevator. When filled, it will start the descent into a dark shaft, emerging
from the ceiling of a bowl-shaped banquet space with a round stage in
the middle. The distinct difference to the standard mercenary cruiser
design (see Traveller Core Rulebook, page 216–217) is that the cargo
deck and quarters below have been hollowed out, leaving room for
balconies on the 'cargo deck' walls, with a central stage on the floor of
the old quarters below. Underneath the balconies is a large bar with
accompanying stools, while on the opposite wall is a kitchen with tables
containing patrons drinking or eating rather greasy looking food.

ENTERING THE UNDERWORLD
Once the glass elevator opens, they see a grey haired Vargr MC in a
black top hat striding towards them, his shimmering suit leaving a trail
of hologram stars in his wake. The Vargr carries with him a steaming
crystal glass of Adwuj, the smell of liquorice, cinnamon and burnt
wood wafting through the open doors. As he does, he announces in

a lyrical voice, 'Welcome friends of tax-free commerce, contraband
and conviviality to the Cosmic Cabaret! I am Gzide Lugh, your Master
of Ceremonies. Let us start with a little song from my pack on Theev,
when I was but a young one!'

Six acrobats leap from the shadows and into the spotlight, dressed in
red and black costumes and performing a series of theatrical tableaus.
The Vargr begins to sing in a great howling voice, during which he
constantly turns towards the audience. In between verses he can be
heard spouting phrases such as 'We jump between worlds and fit
between the laws of this Imperious Imperium!', 'Freedom from borders
and banks, taxes and tolls!', 'Find love and life in the moment, not
married to a merchant morality!' and 'We extend our lives with the
absolute best anagathics so as to become living legends!'

As the night continues, a tall mature woman with long braided silver
hair pulled back in a ruby and onyx ring will emerge from the glass
elevator, wearing a cutlass, dagger and an ornate modified stunner
in an elaborate harness. This hangs over a black leather jacket, red
military style pants with black piping and black battle boots. She will
make her way among the patrons and work to advance all the business
deals, legal or less than. Sarge and three regular pirates walk within
10 paces of her at all times. Ten other pirates can be seen flitting
throughout the rest of the establishment.

Tamara will offer the Travellers some services, after a thorough
investigation of their background to make sure she is not being set up by
Imperial agents. Travellers will have to roll an opposed Deception check
if they are attempting to deceive her. All things well, she will allow for a
bounty to be collected at her establishment, provided she is approached
privately and given a 20 percent cut, meaning the Travellers are able to
collect the target when on one of the transports leaving the T3. There
are no other options available for collecting bounties within her tavern, at
least not if you want to stay on her good side.

Any Traveller with medical training may want to see if any of the
rumors about her cosmetic surgeries are true. Upon success of an
Average (8+) Medic check they will be able to see extensive tell-tale
signs of manipulated skin and bones. They are done in such a way
that the signs are minimal, leading the Traveller to believe they cost an
extortionate amount.

A cursory glance of the rest of the ship will reveal a very drunk old man
who talks about working too much making 'potions and poisons' for
the 'rich reprobates of the universe'. Dressed in a stained and worn
laboratory coat he harps on about the anagathics he creates aboard the
ship. A successful Difficult (10+) Broker check will allow the Travellers
to make an under the table anagathics purchase (see Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 243). The man implores them to keep it secret and it
must not be mentioned to Sarge or Tamara.

He bemoans living on the run, wanting to be able to move back into
Imperial Society. Trying to make an extra buck, he offers cosmetic
surgery and augments (up to +1) to the Travellers (see Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 106), however these must be run past Tamara. A deal
can be made that these services will be offered in exchange for helping
Tamara in some anagathics smuggling.

A night on Tamara's Travelling Tavern and Cosmic Cabaret could impart
any number of outcomes, be it a patron, a new business endeavor,
a hideaway from 'Imperial entanglements' or simply a round of drinks
and a beautiful song from Gzide. Many of the guests inside sip from
steaming cups of Adwuj, discussing a variety of rumors about the
infamous crew of the ship...

'SARGE'
Sarge is one of the original
pirates who took the cutter with
Tamara five years ago, now
acting as Tamara's second
in command for her criminal
enterprise. Sarge has one of
the few personal staterooms on
the cruiser and has modified
laser resistant airlock doors
that require a Very Difficult
(12+) Electronics or Explosives
check to breach. Not the most
talkative, he stands guard
over the mercenaries
amongst the crew to
ensure that they do
not do anything
overly stupid.

TAMARA'S TRAVELLING TAVERN
This legendary underworld hangout is a modified mercenary cruiser,
with the callsign 'tee-three' (T3). It travels the edges of the Imperium,
always two steps ahead of the KCr40 bounty on its proprietor and three
steps ahead of the freelance ship tracers employed by Imperial Navy
Admiral Jackson Ababio.

The ship jumps to the outskirts of low-tech, lawless systems that either
have no central authority or rival governments. These systems are
usually Amber Zones and the local warlord, corrupt official or amoral
corporate administrator has ties to Tamara.

These are the thugs of the T3, wearing red and black vacc suits crested
with the same crossed out Imperium star as the front of the ship. With
few decision-making abilities, they are strictly loyal to Tamara, having
seen the consequence of anything other than such. None of them were
part of the original crew to take the cruiser but have joined her ranks
along the years; little more than glorified stowaways when the tavern is
not in operation.

TRADER CAMPAIGNS
•  Tamara needs to move anagathics to a system with a higher Law
Level and will pay the Travellers a cut of the profits to act as escort.
The cut will be increased if they simply do the trafficking for her.
•  The Travellers have some confiscated weapons that an open
market simply does not provide buyers for.
•  A Sword Worlds mining family called the Grisettes wants
to negotiate trading their copper but does not trust regular
corporations or 'Imperials'.
•  The Travellers want or need some augments, anagathics or
cosmetic surgery, under the radar of the Imperium.

MILITARY CAMPAIGNS
•  They encounter a spy who knows the invasion plans on the
Imperial frontier from a fringe member of nobility. He is waiting in
the tavern to hire a ship that can get him safely to the Imperium.
•  Admiral Jackson Ababio has hired the Travellers to link a high tech
(TL13) tracker to the jump engines, in order for him to follow it. This
will require Very Difficult (12+) Electronics and Stealth checks, and
a good plan.
•  A small Imperial colony on the frontier wants to break free of a
dilettante noble who bleeds them dry of taxes and the famous fruit
grown on their farm. A representative offers to pay the Travellers to
train and accompany them.

EXPLORER CAMPAIGNS
•  A down on their luck prospector has the coordinates for an
uninhabited world with a wealth of metal resources. They will give it
to the Travellers for a chance to be taken along.
•  An alien found in a cryoberth is being sold to the highest bidder
on the T3. The Travellers' patron will finance them to win the bid,
defrost the alien and go to their world as first contact emissaries.
•  Tamara came across an ocean world with an abandoned
submerged city on a recent jaunt through the Spinward Marches.
She would like it to be explored (and looted) and will keep a share
of anything found.
•  Sarge hands the Travellers a data pad of unknown design and a
small humanoid figure carved from bone. It has a stellar map to a
world in the Riftspan Reaches. The only thing he says is to, 'Go
there and gain great wealth. If you can leave this offering on the
steps of the floating cemetery you will have achieved something.'

UNICYCLE OF MASS DESTRUCTION

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Some say this is the creation of a lunatic, whereas others view the
creator as a pioneer. Oft used by revolutionaries on planets plagued by
cruel governments, pirates raiding frontier colonies and those who have
truly lost all sense of self preservation, the Unicycle of Mass Destruction
(UMD) is truly a sight to behold. Only the most adept riders can master
this vehicle, as it takes multitasking to the extreme. The side-mounted
light autocannon is counterbalanced by the manipulator arm, which can
be seen holding up those defeated in battle.

Hunting and Preparing Food
By Adrian Tymes and Sabrina Westerman

**This guide is rated** Not Safe For K'kree.

I, Baron Stockington, have been commissioned to provide wisdom gleaned
from my decades of experience hunting prey across the length and
breadth of Imperial space. Whilst many of my peers hunt only for personal
glory, I have endeavored to be of service to the Imperium, whether that
be obtaining food for starving colonies or slaying threatening beasts. This
guide is meant to provide assistance should you find yourself needing or
wanting to consume meat obtained from the wilderness.

My advice is biased towards Humaniti, although I have attempted to
keep this advice broadly useful, so that almost any species may benefit.

Ships have it easy; water has no genetics or organs. Liquid water, ice or
hydrogen from gas giant atmospheres can be converted into ship fuel.
Biological refuelling is a little more complex. If you are going to a planet
and food will not be provided, make sure you know how to convert what
is there into food before you go. Most full galleys have appropriate
equipment but confirming this rarely hurts, especially on smaller ships.
For example, a microwave oven is not appropriate equipment to test for
poison, so a ship that only has a microwave oven must rely on starport
food. Also, starship-grade weaponry will not leave edible remains, nor
trophies in most cases, unless you are hunting megafauna.

CLASSIFYING YOUR PREY
The first step is classifying the prey available, so as to optimize your
hunting. For instance, if you know you are going to need a large
amount of meat, it may be worth the extra work to hunt and process
a large herbivore rather than a herd of smaller, potentially toxic
carnivores. Likewise, if there is an ammonia sea, do not waste your
time and resources fishing there.

**Scavenger, carnivore, omnivore, herbivore or ergovore**
This should be the top priority for classification, even if it requires a bit
of observation. From least to most edible:
- Scavengers can eat meat or plants but they focus on eating
whatever they come across in their environment. In doing so, they
favor a diet of things that are unable to get away due to being
sick, unhealthy or dead. If toxins are the cause, scavengers tend to
devour things with those toxins and concentrate them in their bodies.
Lithovores are often immune to things toxic to most life and so
should be placed in this category.
- Carnivores eat only meat and are usually considered at the top of
the food chain. They prey on weaker animals, which may be more
likely to have toxins but to a lesser degree than scavengers' diets.

```
- Omnivores will eat meat or plants as the opportunity arises but,
unlike scavengers, they tend to distinguish between something
that is unfit to eat and something that is fit to eat. Some herbivores
become omnivores if there is a lack of plant material available or if
meat is readily available.
- Herbivores only eat a plant-based diet, avoiding poisonous plants
and are thus considered the safest option among most animal types.
- Ergovores, such as photovores including most plants, are even
safer since their energy-based diets do not include consumption of
toxins. Of course, even plants can be poisonous or absorb poison
from their living conditions but this is true of any life form.
```

LIVING CONDITIONS
Understanding the environment where the prey lives is vital to
ascertaining whether they will be safe for consumption. If an
environment is highly toxic, filters and specific cooking methods are
needed to make the prey safe to eat.

Water:
- When hunting land animals on worlds with tainted atmospheres, be
prepared to remove concentrations of the taint from their bodies.
When hunting sea creatures, test the water for toxins: if it is in the
water, it will be in the kill.
- If a sea creature lives on a world with a toxic atmosphere but the
oceans are relatively non-toxic, then sea creatures who only live
below the surface will on average be less toxic than ones that come
up for air, especially if they do not prey on air-breathing creatures.
- If an animal's primary drinking fluid is a non-water-based fluid such
as ammonia or methane, assume its entire body is inedible.

Food:
- If the plants an animal feeds on have a low toxin amount, the
herbivore may have a mild amount of the toxin in their system.
Carnivores eat herbivores and compound the toxins they consume,
causing it to build up in their system. Scavengers generally have
a higher build-up of toxins, since they will more often eat corpses
killed by high toxin doses. If the toxin naturally decays over time,
then carnivores may be better options as they would not have high
concentrations for long.
- The same chain of logic applies to carnivores and scavengers if
their prey is contaminated by a toxin. This is particularly a concern
for wildlife near industrial sites that discharge their by-products into
the local ecosystem, rather than using more responsible methods
such as recycling or offworld disposal.

QUICKLY IDENTIFYING COMMON HERBIVORES
There are many sayings originating on Terra with guidelines for selecting
prey. These rules do not apply to birds, insects, reptiles or plants:
**●** 'Fins and Scales': For sea creatures, many of the least toxic
herbivores have fins or a flattened appendage for propelling and
steering the creature through water, along with scales or overlapping
plates on their body. While those can be found separately on
some fish, the lack of one of these items usually indicates the fish
is a scavenger or poisonous. A classic example from Terra is the
pufferfish, an omnivore that has fins but no scales and contains a
poison sac requiring careful preparation to be non-lethal.
**●** 'Cloven Footed and Ruminants': For land creatures, many
domesticated creatures fall under the cloven or split hoof variety and
ruminant diets often require multiple stomachs. Cows, goats, sheep
and other domesticated animals fall under this category, while pigs
only have split hooves and are not classified as herbivores due to
their scavenging/omnivore appetite.

CLEAN YOUR KILL
When handling dead animals or harvesting plants, protective gear is a
must. At a minimum, wear disposable gloves and use a sharp knife to
remove unusable portions of the kill. A vacc suit is usually overkill but will
suffice, although it should be decontaminated soon after handling the prey.

```
DEFENCES
No animal particularly wants to be eaten. Due to this, a number of
species have evolved natural defences:
- Evasion and physically overpowering foes are a common
defence, but do not impact edibility.
- Bones or chitinous armor reduces the amount of edible tissue
but can be removed or ground into digestible powder. Ensure
you check for bone fragments in the meat before consumption.
- Poisons suffusing the prey can be flushed out if known to be
present. They can generally be detected with a quick biopsy
and a medical scanner. Even if a species has evolved a new
version of a toxin, modern scanners are built to recognize
such mutations.
- Bioelectric and poisonous glands need to be removed intact.
If punctured, nearby tissue should be thoroughly screened or
discarded for safety.
```

Bacteria can multiply once prey is slain, particularly in animals, so
bring refrigerated sealable storage if you cannot sterilise tissue on the
spot. Quickly placing the kill in such a container also avoids issues
of environmental contamination, the corpse attracting insects and,
if transportation to the galley takes long enough, rotting. This is why
thoroughly cleaning the tissue is often the first step performed once it
reaches a galley.

Cleaning the knife (and gloves, if non-disposable) frequently with
water, alcohol swabs or ultrasonics while cutting away organs is
recommended, to minimise bacterial contamination from said organs.
My preference is a static dagger, as it cleans itself.

CONCLUSION
When you wish to hunt, be prepared. Bring the right gear, clean and
preserve your kills quickly and know beforehand what to and what not
to hunt. Do this and you may provide food for an entire colony. Go off
on a whim without preparation and you will likely wind up poisoned, sick
or dead. A dead hunter is no good to a colony.

Professor Dania Jereua
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Raised on Rek-Shons (Core, Chant), Dania took to the study of botany
naturally. With a planetologist father and xenobiologist mother, her
education was both intense and broad. In her time as a field researcher,
she travelled widely throughout the Imperium, cataloguing and studying
various forms of plant life. Attending university at the age of 16, Daina
was, until recently, regarded as something of a prodigy within the world
of botany. Unfortunately, her introverted nature has done nothing to
dispel the current rumors of insanity.

Her name is well-known within her field, being a leading botanist within
the Imperium with numerous primary research papers under her belt. Her
speciality on the advantages of hydroponic farming on agricultural worlds
initially gave her a beneficial amount of megacorporation sponsors.
Despite her relative fame, however, she appears to be reclusive. With no
recorded lectures, speeches or public statements, much that is known
about her is derived from personal encounters and the little information
given about travels and experiences in her research papers. These are
by no means biographical documents but she intersperses the plants she
has studied with vague stories of how she came to acquire them.

Personal stories of Dania are similarly hard to ascertain 'real'
information from; any number of Travellers and vid-celebrities attest
to having met her but each of these tales exist in contradiction to one
another. One such story tells that she no longer communicates using
any known language, preferring instead to use a highly developed
form of gesticulating, similar to a sign-language but with her entire
body. Such reports should not be believed, actually being a ploy by
megacorporations to demean her research.

Daina has recently published a paper decrying the ravaging of natural
planetary resources in favor of industrialization on Woodrow (Fornast,
Nareshakir). This naturally led to a number of high-profile corporate
attacks on her person as a way of putting doubt on the credibility of
her research. Likened to a hermit incapable of highly skilled research,
and bemoaned as a restraint on technological innovation, Daina has
been demoted from her position as senior researcher. Intense lobbying
on the part of megacorporations has led to her becoming even more
withdrawn than before, and highly distrustful of strangers to boot.

Due to this, Daina will be stand-offish towards Travellers when first
encountered. She can be found at low class downports, as well as
exploring parks, reserves, and other locations of botanical interest.
Garden planets are her preferred locations, although she may be
placed on scientific research ships as an attempt to regain her
academic reputation by publishing more research. In order to determine
the intentions of the Travellers, she will mention key research papers
she has produced, including 'The effects of air pollution on the native
microflora of Botany Bay evidenced on the microscopic level' and 'A
study on the benefits of zero-G hydroponic moss growth systems as a
method of cleansing toxic atmospheres'. If any recognition is made, or
an interesting conversation ensues, she will be more likely to engage in
conversation with the Travellers.

The Referee should be the judge on whether Daina opens up to the
Travellers about her recent issues. She will implore them to assist her
in regaining her reputation, an undertaking that could occupy a myriad
of avenues. Daina will suggest they do a short video interview where
she discusses her argument and the recent attacks on her reputation,
proving she is perfectly sane and stable. Perhaps the Travellers will
speak on a popular vid-show regarding their meeting of her, including
sharing the aforementioned interview with the host. Discrediting the
rumors created by the megacorporations is key to restoring her image
and, ultimately, her job as a senior researcher.

Daina has an affable personality, although she is prone to periods
of introversion. When speaking about a subject she has a wealth of
knowledge in, such as botany, biology or painting, she truly comes
alive. As she becomes comfortable with Travellers, she will show
them her personal herbariums, each filled with pressings and detailed
paintings of plant species she has studied. Even if the Travellers do
not directly encounter Daina, they may be hired by megacorporate
agencies to attempt to find (or, in extreme cases, falsify) evidence of
her current stray from factual science.

Nenlat
**By Geir Lanesskog**

Nenlat are natives of Deneb (Usani subsector), a marginally habitable
world named after the bright supergiant star it orbits. Although
considered native, the species is thought by most xenologists to have
originated as imports or side-effects of an attempt by the Ancients to
terraform a world around the five-million-year-old star. Some semi-
aquatic Nenlat maintain traditional cultures in Deneb's wetlands, while
others have become assimilated into Imperial society.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The Nenlat are trilateral beings with a rounded barrel-shaped body
approximately one meter in diameter and 1.2 meters tall. From that
body, a tripod of three dexterous legs adds another half meter to the
height of these beings. In addition to the legs, the Nenlat have three
arms, three flippers and a forward-facing head with a long tentacle-
like stringer protruding from the back of the neck. This stinger ends
in a pointed knife-like keratin-based stinger capable of delivering a
neurotoxin fatal to smaller Denebian fauna. All vital organs including the
brain are located within the central body.

The entire Nenlat body is covered in a grey-pink rubbery skin. The
three legs are protected by a segmented keratin shell-like outer skin
and maintain a wide tripod stance to promote balance. The legs end
in three rubbery finger-like toes, which provide grip and traction when
traversing shallow waters. A Nenlat's three arms and three flippers are
set in a roughly hexagonal pattern, with the flippers set slightly higher
and occupying the rear and 'side-forward' locations and the three arms
occupying the forward and 'side-rear' locations.

Sensory organs are located in the head, which is set upon a trunk-
like neck. Two stalked eyes provide binocular vision, centered on blue
wavelength light and ranging far into the ultraviolet. Nenlat eyestalks
are broad at the base and double as ears, which evolved to hear in thin
atmospheres and are especially sensitive in a standard atmosphere.
A relatively small snout contains a mouth and 'nostrils', a labyrinth of
olfactory sensors fed from a dozen small openings above the jawless
mouth. Although omnivores, their dentation is not differentiated but
forms two rows of sharp flat teeth. Taste is a function of receptors on
the finger pads of the small forward arm.

The Nenlat are amphibious, with efficient oxygen-extraction pores
covering their entire body. These pores act as both lungs and gills and
allow the Nenlat to function indefinitely under water. The Nenlat can

adjust the size of the pores by dilation, allowing survival in atmospheres
ranging from very thin to standard. Nenlat do not normally wear
clothing, except as protection, but must cover at least a portion of
their bodies to regulate oxygen intake in dense atmospheres to avoid
suffering oxygen intoxication and associated delirium.

EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT
Deneb's ecosystem is complex but the age of the star Deneb – less than
five million years – and the age of the solid crust of the planet Deneb

- barely 1.2 million years – implies a major terraformation effort and
sophisticated genetic manipulation to create everything from advanced
life forms to parasites and symbionts. As with many such planetary
transformations, most scientists blame the Ancients but significant
evidence points to the oxygenation of the Denebian atmosphere during
a considerably earlier period. In any case, the Nenlat themselves
are members of a widespread class of trilateral fauna endemic in the
wetlands that cover more than two-thirds of the planet's surface.

The Nenlat are omnivorous gatherers, maintaining village-like social
structures on natural and artificial islands in Deneb's wetlands. The more
primitive of these villages resemble beaver lodges, with submerged
entrances and communal spaces within. The Nenlat do not appear to
have a progenitor species and archaeological records point to their
occupation of the abandoned Ancients arcology as early as -290,000.

LIFE CYCLE
As with much of Denebian fauna and flora, the Nenlat have three
genders: activator, bearer and egg layer. Reproduction is external and
ritualised. A bearer will prepare a two-meter-diameter nesting lodge

- an igloo-shaped structure of branches and fern-like leaves – at the
edge of open water on a protected area of wetland and coat it with
hormonal secretions. Egg layers produce a single soft-shelled egg the
size of a human fist approximately every two standard years. If an egg
layer considers a nesting lodge acceptable, they will enter it and deposit
their egg. Scent from the egg will attract activators, who often engage
in ritual combat for the right to enter the nesting lodge and inseminate
the egg with their stinger. This fertilization causes a chemical reaction,
which changes the odour of the egg and triggers the return of the nest-
building bearer, who will then guard the egg for three standard months,
until it hatches into a juvenile Nenlat, whom the bearer then brings back
to their village.

A juvenile Nenlat is a miniature version of an adult, capable of locomotion
but unable to eat anything but regurgitated food for the first two standard
years of its life. The juvenile is communally raised for eight standard
years. Gender is not fixed at birth but determined during a 'pre-casting'
phase at eight standard years, where hormonal pressures from the
community manifest into gender determination. The three genders of
Nenlat are roughly equal in number, with the juvenile reacting to any
imbalance in the community by assuming the least numerous gender.

After gender determination, the juvenile undergoes a 'casting' phase.
Casting is not related to gender but also develops from specific
hormonal influences. These changes are more subtle, with numbers of
each caste varying over time, not necessarily in proportion to the local

communities' need. The Nenlat have dozens of castes, whose names
and purposes are often difficult to translate. In effect, they provide
specialization and social stratification, often manifesting in subtle
differences in abilities and behaviours. Humans cannot determine
Nenlat caste by behaviour, or even place in society, but Nenlat instantly
comprehend it by smell and alter interpersonal behaviour accordingly.
Caste is not a barrier for the Nenlat's asymmetric form of reproduction,
as the three parents of a particular Nenlat may never actually meet.

Approximately half of all Nenlat have assimilated into Imperial culture.
As such, their reproductive practices vary from those of their traditional
brethren. Assimilated Nenlat wishing to reproduce become members
of a creche collective. All members of the collective pay dues and
are obligated to remain members for at least eight standard years,
regardless of their use of the collective's facilities. The collective is
mostly staffed by bearers, who maintain humid nest-like creches where
egg layers can deposit their eggs for an extra fee. Activators pay fees
for the right to inseminate an egg.

A Nenlat is considered adult after 14 standard years and begins life as
a member of their caste. Education is by 'doing, not studying', a limiting
factor even in the education of assimilated Nenlat. Nenlat lifespan
is approximately 80 years but life expectancy among those living in
traditional villages is closer to 60 years.

HISTORY
The origins of the Nenlat remain shrouded in contradictory theories
and fragmentary evidence. The Nenlat themselves have numerous
creation myths, some centered on the vast ruined Ancient arcology half-
submerged in marshlands; others believe, like the majority of Deneb's
human inhabitants, in the divinity of the star itself. In any case, by
-290,000 Nenlat villages existed. Some were squatter camps occupying
many layers of the fallen arcology but most were primitive villages
scattered across the temperate and tropical regions of Deneb.

Despite its relatively small size, the planet Deneb has a very large
habitable surface, especially for a semi-aquatic species. The world
lacks large oceans but possesses many small seas and lakes, linked by
stagnant rivers and surrounded by vast swamplands and marshes. Even
during their stone-age early period, the Nenlat numbered in the billions
forming a single culture, although with significant regional variations.

Tool use and wetland engineering projects became more sophisticated
by -25,000 as Nenlat culture reached TL1. Organised religions, many
based on the worship of sky, water or sun competed for dominance,
leading to a period of sectarian warfare that persisted until first contact
with Vilani explorers and refugees in -2400.

By -2400, the Nenlat had reached TL4, mastering steam power and
experimenting with internal combustion engines – although a lack of
natural oil deposits limited such engines to inefficient biofuels. Ten
billion Nenlat occupied a vast landscape of villages with few urban
areas larger than towns. The shock of first contact effectively ended the
low-level religious warfare that had persisted for most of the Nenlat's
recorded history. Conflicts did not cease but they became more
philosophical and less violent.

The Vilani settlers of the Deneb system eventually became leaders of
the Lidash League. They employed Nenlat first as labourers and later
as soldiers to help fight against Vargr and pirate incursions. These
Nenlat gradually became assimilated into human society, abandoning
many traditional practices such as casting and developing collective
creches for reproduction. During the era of the League, from -90 to 100,
the Nenlat were not considered full citizens. Once Deneb joined the
Third Imperium, Imperial law recognized them as full citizens, elevating
the status of the assimilated Nenlat and, after some prompting from
Imperial officials, Deneb's world government formally recognized the
Nenlat's ownership of 70% of the world's surface.

SOCIETY
The Nenlat number 24 billion individuals, of which more than half – 14
billion – continue to live traditional lives. Another eight billion live in Imperial
urban areas on Deneb itself and more than two billion live offworld in
habitats and stations throughout the vast Denebian star system.

Traditional Nenlat society is still village based, with most Nenlat
spending their days hunting or gathering in the wetlands or practicing
crafts in semi-submerged villages. Culturally, they are relatively
unchanged in the 3,500 years since human contact, maintaining both
their rituals and castes. Traditional Deneb remains at TL4 but higher
tech imported items are common. At least a few members of any village
possess a voice box to communicate with Imperial visitors.

Cultural or religious leaders may have influence over millions, or
billions, but little formal government organization exists above the
village level. Various regions of Deneb have formed village collectives

- a collective of villages – whose councils may coordinate activities
among a few million Nenlat over a few thousand square kilometers,
yet larger organizations do not exist. For most Nenlat, even these
organizations seem be unnecessary. Within the caste system, everyone
has a duty and everyone knows their place. Age-old ritual governs most
activity, leaving outsiders to wonder how small villages can maintain
the equivalent of a complex bureaucratic set of regulations, permits
and laws. For those who do not fit into this society, the 'City' is always
available as an escape valve and rebellious teens (or even elders) may
leave tradition behind and assimilate into Imperial society.

Assimilated Nenlat are full members of Imperial Denebian society,
speaking Anglic with artificial voice box support and surviving in the
dry standard atmosphere air of 'City' arcologies. While their traditional
brethren rarely wear clothing, Imperial Nenlat often wear partial
coverings of 'wetsuits', which keep their skin moist and regulate oxygen
intake to avoid intoxication.

Nenlat are common in Denebian bureaucratic, law enforcement
and military service. Nenlat units of Imperial army and Imperial
Marine troops exist, often optimized for amphibious warfare. Since
Nenlat require specialized weapons and tools, these units are often
homogeneous but with mixed officers. Nenlat veterans have formed
numerous mercenary units that have a reputation for maintaining good
order as well as for their expertise in amphibious operations.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
The lack of a world government does not seem to bother the traditional
Nenlat; they are content to keep their culture and let the 'Imperials' deal
with the outside world. They are not opposed to visitors but they tend
to remain aloof. Most do not appreciate tourists pointing and taking
pictures but they are willing to accommodate polite low-key visitors.

If outsiders get out of hand, a village elder might fire up the radio and
call the 'City' for police assistance. Denebian government officials will
respond quickly and forcefully remove any troublesome outsiders, who
can expect at least a substantial fine for 'disturbing the peace', possibly
accompanied by exile from the entire system.

Other species find even assimilated Nenlat abrasive at times, with most
voice boxes not able to communicate subtleties of expression – these
are not translation boxes but allow an Anglic 'speaking' Nenlat to better
approximate a human voice. Most Nenlat can lack patience and even
those who have rejected traditional values have little time for 'rule-
breakers' or 'time-wasters'.

Certain stereotypes apply to the various genders of Nenlat. Such
behaviours are far from universal but common enough to be almost
expected. The Egg Layer gender is notoriously impatient but usually
responds with briskness or distain, not hostility. The Activator is more
likely to respond to a challenge, or even to boredom, with direct
confrontation. A Bearer seems more even-keeled and agreeable but
this is often a reflection of passive-aggression.

CREATING NENLAT TRAVELLERS
Nenlat Travellers can be of any gender and either traditional or
assimilated. A Traveller can either choose a background and gender or
determine it randomly with a pair of 1D rolls:

Culture (1D): 1–3 Assimilated; 4–6 Traditional
Gender (1D): 1–2 Activator; 3–4: Bearer; 5–6 Egg Layer

Characteristics
Assimilated Nenlat Travellers have the following modifiers applied to
their characteristics: STR +1, EDU -2.
Traditional Nenlat Travellers receive STR +1 but roll 1D for EDU and
automatically receive Athletics 0 and Survival 0 as background skills in
addition to those available from their EDU characteristic.

Additional Nenlat gender modifiers are:

Activators: DEX +1
Bearer: STR +1
Egg Layer: END +1

Traits
Nenlat Travellers all possess the following traits:

Amphibious: A Nenlat is equally at home on land and in water. A
Nenlat can function indefinitely in an aquatic environment and has no
movement penalties when submerged.

**Natural Weapon (Stinger):** Nenlat have a single sharp knife-like
stinger at the end of a meter-long tentacle protruding from the back
of their necks. The stinger inflicts 1D damage with AP 2. The stinger
contains a neurotoxin that causes an additional 2D damage to
Denebian life forms.

Ultraviolet Vision: Nenlat cannot distinguish colour in wavelengths
longer than green light and have poor night vision, meaning they suffer
DM-1 on Recon checks at night or in low or red light.

Very Thin Atmosphere: Nenlat can function in Very Thin (3)
atmospheres without assistance but require clothing to thrive in Dense
(8) atmospheres or risk oxygen euphoria. If they engage in vigorous
activity such as combat or running, they must pass an Easy (4+)
END check every round or suffer temporary 1D damage to DEX and
INT. This effect is cumulative but recovery requires only five minutes
per point of damage. If DEX or INT reaches 0, the Nenlat becomes
unconscious. Additionally, Nenlat breathe using their entire bodies and
require a specialized filter suit in tainted atmospheres (see below). In
standard atmospheres, most Nenlat rarely suffer this effect but must
pass a Simple (2+) END check when engaged in vigorous activity.

**Leg Armor:** Nenlat have Protection +4 against all hazards and attacks
specifically targeting their feet or legs.

Nenlat Hands: Nenlat hands are not suited to equipment designed
for humans. Apply DM-1 to all checks using tools or weapons not
designed for Nenlat.

CAREERS
All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for Nenlat.
Both traditional and assimilated Nenlat who are religious may enter the
Believer career from the Traveller Companion. Nenlat have difficulty
learning in classroom environments and may not apply to university
or military academies. If a Nenlat Traveller rolls an Event mentioning
training and granting a skill, the Nenlat must instead roll once on their
appropriate assignment skills table.

Nenlat begin their first term at age 14 and must begin to check for aging
at the conclusion of their fourth term at age 30.

NENLAT EQUIPMENT
Nenlat equipment is specific to their species and is only common in
Deneb and surrounding systems. A Nenlat will need to check availability
with DM-3 anywhere outside the Deneb system to acquire specific
equipment or tools. In the wider sector the modifier becomes DM-5
and beyond the Deneb sector these items are generally unavailable,
requiring a special order and long shipment delays, which will greatly
increase cost.

Armor and Protective Suits
Nenlat body coverings must accommodate their full-body breathing
characteristic. As such, they cannot wear armor, protection suits or
heavy clothing designed for other sophonts. Suits that accommodate
the full range of Nenlat aquatic motion cost triple the standard price.

Filter Suit
Nenlat require a full-body filter suit to breathe in tainted atmospheres.
This suit will protect against dense atmospheres and can be worn as
normal clothing, allowing Nenlat to function in Atmosphere 2–9 with no
risk of oxygen euphoria.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Filter Suit 9 2 Cr500
```

Voice Box
A Nenlat voice box is a communication device worn as a necklace. A
basic voice box allows a Nenlat to render Galanglic, Vilani and other
human speech in an understandable manner. The improved voice box
acts as translator, both allowing a non-Galanglic or Vilani speaking
Nenlat to understand the language and converting native speech to
either Galanglic or Vilani based on the detected speech of the target
audience. The rarely available advanced voice box acts as a universal
translator. These voice boxes are ruggedised to withstand a semi-
aquatic environment.

```
Voice Box TL Kg Cost
Basic 8 — Cr100
Improved 10 — Cr500
Advanced 12 — Cr40000

Soldiers, Officers and Specialists
**By Matthew Sprange**

During Mercenary and other military-based campaigns the Travellers
are likely to meet a wide variety of personnel. Some will be frontline
troops and officers, while others will occupy more specialist roles, both
in the field and back at base.

This article provides characteristics, skills and equipment for generic
soldiers, officers and specialists. In all cases, it should be assumed that
these are examples only and not be considered 'standard' by any means.
Referees should feel free to create their own but may find these useful
for inspiration or wholesale use should characteristics be needed quickly.

Note that only the most relevant skills are shown here and
Referees are welcome to flesh characters out by adding more skills
and filling in specialities.

Intrusion Decks
**By Matthew Sprange**

An intrusion deck is a specialized hand computer intended for use with
hacking. It is designed to be as portable as possible and has connectors
for multiple target computers, both wired and wireless, as well as built-in
defences against security countermeasures. Some of the software on
an Intrusion deck is on ROM chips and cannot be rewritten or changed,
for greater resilience. All Intrusion Decks are specialized for running the
Intrusion suite and grant DM+1 when using the software.

SYSTEM DETAILS
The Thanber system consists of Than, a red M0 V main sequence
star, a small cluster of rocky planets huddled closely around it, an icy
planetoid belt and the companion M1 V star Treso orbiting far beyond
the rest of the system in an eccentric 90-year orbit. There is no gas
giant in the system.

Than II, III and IV are unremarkable icy rocks, none larger than Thanber.
None of them have any atmosphere or mineral resources of note. When
Thanber was first colonized these planets were dutifully surveyed and
mapped, but there are no permanent settlements on any of them and the
colonists never named them beyond their orbital designations.

The Thanber Belt has been little explored but seems to be mostly dirty
ice chunks. The comets observed in the system from time-to-time
probably had their origin there. Treso has no known planets circling it
and has seldom been visited.

MAINWORLD
The system mainworld, Thanber, is a mid-sized rocky world (diameter
7,684 kilometers) that orbits Than in its innermost orbit. The orbit is
so close that Thanber is tidally-locked, with one side of the planet
constantly facing the star; a Thanber year is only 19 standard days.
Temperatures in the high desert of the hot pole can reach 45°C at the
height of summer; hot but not unendurable. The cold pole of the planet
is a much less hospitable place, with typical temperatures well below
-20°C. The settled areas of Thanber are all in the north-south 'twilight'
between the light and dark sides of the planet and this twilight belt
forms approximately one-third of the surface area of the planet.

The companion star Treso is too distant, even at its closest approach,
to provide much light or heat to Thanber, but its orbit does give the
mainworld very long, fairly mild seasons. Because of Treso's eccentric
orbit 'summer' is the shortest season, lasting approximately 15 years
(Imperial), while 'winter' is the longest at 31 years. Temperature
variations between the height of summer and the depth of winter are
only around 5°C above or below the average.

Shallow, rather salty seas cover 34% of the surface, mostly in the
twilight belt around the edge of the dayside. Their depth varies during
the long seasons as ice melts from the borderlands of the darkside
supply water to the seas during the summer, with some drying up again
during the winter as ice in the borderlands refreezes.

Than is always in the same place in the sky of Thanber, from low in the
horizon at the darkside edges of the twilight belt to directly overhead in
the high desert of the hot pole. Stars are only visible on the darkside of
the planet. Local structures are designed around the fact that the sun is

unmoving and low in the sky, with windows and walls carefully placed to
provide interior light or shade as desired. Solar power facilities are built
with stationary collectors.

Thanber has no natural satellites.

BIOSPHERE
The atmosphere of Thanber is a thin but breathable oxygen-nitrogen mix
with a biological taint consisting of the pollens and spores of local plants.
Native Thanbers are usually fully acclimated but visitors are advised to
wear filter masks with eye protection, especially in the summer.

All native Thanber vegetation is very dark in colour, ranging from dark
green to blue-black, to maximise sunlight absorption.

A source of much of the pollen that taints the atmosphere is the native
tree known as the Thanber blackwood, which is common in the twilight
belt. It is very tall, on the order of 30 meters for an average specimen,
made possible by the low gravity. Both leaves and wood are almost
black in colour, with blossoms in summer being a very dark violet.
Blackwood pollen is produced at an ideal height to be carried far by
local air currents and the trees produce large amounts in the long
Thanber summers. Thanber blackwood is used for building materials
locally but is too fragile in higher gravity fields to be of anything but
ornamental use, so is not often exported.

The most advanced Thanber animals are avian forms. Most animal life
migrates in an east-west pattern within the twilight belt during the long
seasons. Interestingly, all Thanber avian forms have underdeveloped
senses of hearing, and instead of singing they use colourful displays of
bioluminescence to communicate basic threat and warning postures.

Large dark-grey flightless avians called 'pacers' that are about the size
of a [[Terra|Terran]] ostrich forage in the blackwood forests. An aquatic variety
called 'fishers' dominates the shallow seas. Many smaller winged
varieties fill out the ecological niches of the world.

The apex predator is the Thanber condor, an avian with a wingspan
that can reach up to 12 meters. The Thanber condor is light grey on its
belly and coal-black on its back. The feathers around the neck and face
are thinner to allow bioluminescent cells in the condor's skin to be used
for communication. A full-grown condor can lift and carry away a pacer
and occasional attacks on humans or imported livestock have been
reported. Condors avoid most of the more settled areas of the planet.
Tourist hunting of the condor is common but the government keeps
hunters to a strict limit and the species continues to thrive.

Non-native lifeforms often have a difficult time adapting to the unmoving
sun and extremely long mild seasons of Thanber, although [[Terra|Terran]]
food crops have adapted well. Some imported domesticated livestock
has successfully adapted, although respiratory ailments due to the
atmospheric taint are common. Native forms, such as the pacers, have
proven nutritious to humans and are actively farmed.

HISTORY
Thanber was first surveyed by Darrian explorers from Entrope during
the Long Night. The Darrians appreciated the blackwood forests and
found the Thanber condor beautiful but the atmospheric taint, lack
of extensive water resources and the somewhat remote location
precluded any large settlement attempts. They maintained a research
station but the world was left mostly empty; it was not formally claimed
by the Darrians. There were a few Sword Worlds hunting expeditions
but they too showed little interest in the world.

It was not until the First Frontier War (589–604) that someone finally
thought Thanber worth colonising. After a Zhodani raid on Villis there was
an exodus of refugees from that high-population world to surrounding
systems. Thanber was attractive to some of these refugees precisely
because it was somewhat out-of-the-way and not especially hospitable; it
was therefore not somewhere worth fighting over. A million Villis natives
secured transportation and migrated to Thanber within the span of a
few months in 599. The initial allergic reactions to the atmospheric taint
proved daunting to many, but tolerance grew over time. Having never
formally claimed the world, there was no formal transfer of power from
the Darrians. The research station was turned over to the colonists and
the few Darrians on the world simply went back home.

By the time of the Second Frontier War (615–620) the colonists were
well-established and were delighted when the Outworld Coalition
completely ignored their world. Thanber was nominally in an area
claimed by the Imperium, and formed a necessary refuelling point for
traffic to the Imperial research station on Retinae, but it was otherwise
left to its own devices. After the war Thanber entered a period of political
isolation where the government basically tried to make their system as
unnoticeable as possible to the larger powers, with some success.

After the Third Frontier War (979–986), the Imperium renounced its
claim to all systems in the subsector and the Zhodani occupied Querion
and its neighbors. Thanber became officially neutral. Traffic at the port
began to increase, however, with transits between the new Zhodani
worlds and their allies in the Sword Worlds. With no gas giant, Thanber
itself is the only refuelling point for the system. Clashes between the
Imperial resupply missions to the research station on Retinae and
Zhodani and Sword Worlds traffic became increasingly frequent at the
inadequate Thanber port and the government cast about for a solution
to their security problems.

The answer came with an offer from Tukera Lines. In exchange for
taking over management of the port, they made the offer to upgrade it
to Class B and solve the security problem. A highport was constructed
with separate 'Imperial' and 'Outworld' sections to keep the two parties
separated. Traffic through Thanber now need never make planetfall, and
most does not. Tukera makes most of its money refining fuel from the
oceans and collecting highport service fees. The renovated downport on
Thanber itself is not nearly as profitable but justifies its expense.

The investment and continuing tariffs from the new port proved a
boon for Thanber and their local Tech Level climbed to 12. The once
thoroughly isolationist Thanbers now find themselves the owners
of a minor trade hub between the Imperium, Zhodani and Sword
Worlds, and exotic offworld goods from the Sword Worlds and Darrian
Federation have become common in Thanber markets.

GOVERNMENT
The Thanber government consists of hereditary nobles descended
from leaders of the original Villis refugees and the ruling body is a High
Council of 11 nobles elected from the peerage. To qualify for election
to the council a noble must pass a series of academic tests. Election
to the Council is effectively for life but a noble must pass the tests
again every five years or be forced to retire. These qualification tests
are created by the ruling board of the University of Thanber, which is
supposedly independent of noble control. They cover a wide variety of
political, social and technical subjects and are intended to verify broad
competence. All lesser government offices also have tests to qualify
for office, also designed by the university. Member of the High Council
(MHC) is the highest noble title on the planet. Former council members
are known as High Council Member Emeritus (HCME).

Each member of the High Council has a region of the planet for which
they are directly responsible, with the normal feudal lines of fealty to
the lesser nobles of each region. Policies for the planet as a whole are
set by majority vote of the Council. The members of the Council are
all considered legally equal, and each receives a single vote, but in
practice those regions that are wealthier and more heavily populated
tend to have more influence over their fellow Council members. There
are no formal political parties or factions.

The High Council is very protective of Thanber's independence. They
do their best to make any citizen of the other powers of the sector
passing through the system feel welcome, yet offers of closer ties to
other nations have always been met with polite but firm refusal. The
Council is most sympathetic to the Third Imperium and Tukera Lines
has had a great deal of influence on the Council since its purchase and
upgrade of the starport. Imperial star charts of the Querion subsector
often show Thanber as a client state of the Imperium, although the
official political position is still one of strict neutrality.

Personal freedom is high on Thanber and taxation is minimal. Law
enforcement outside of the starport and cities is haphazard. The High
Council prefers a light touch and the population is still low enough that
even the major cities have populations of only a couple of hundred
thousand at most.

Thanber maintains a small defensive squadron of system defence
boats and a Tukera-trained customs enforcement force but there
are no standing military ground forces on planet. Every member
of the population is theoretically subject to serving in the planetary
militia, supplying their own arms, but there has never been a need to
mobilise them.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMY
Thanber receives most of its power production from solar collectors
built in the high desert of the lightside but there are some fusion plants
on-planet to ensure uninterrupted power to vital facilities.

Farming or ranching is the most common occupation but is carried out
with large amounts of automation and robots. Population density is low
enough that there is plenty of arable land in the twilight belt.

Thanber has always had enough manufacturing capacity to see
to its own needs but this is now a growing sector of the planetary
economy. Thanber has the highest Tech Level in the subsector and
demands for high-tech exports to Retinae, the Entropic worlds or
even Querion are growing.

Thanber builds its own in-system spacecraft but most of these are
cargo and fuel lighters in support of the highport. Tourism is not a
major part of the economy.

SOCIETY
Most Thanbers speak Galanglic as a native tongue, with a slight
spinward accent. There is a small ethnic community of Sword Worlders
on the planet who speak the Icelandic of the Sword Worlds as well.

Despite their isolationist past, modern Thanbers are remarkably tolerant
of offworlders. In part this is because they recognize them as the
source of their current prosperity but also because they acknowledge
that Thanber itself with its tainted atmosphere and never-ending day is
not a very pleasant place for most offworlders.

Thanber began as a pre-Civil War Villis culture but the Thanbers
have made an effort to distance themselves from their roots, viewing
themselves as self-reliant and stubborn. They take a certain pride
in living where no one else wanted to live and consider themselves
Thanbers first and foremost, proud of their independence.

THE FUTURE OF THANBER
Since the occupation of the Querion worlds by the Zhodani a century
ago Thanber has had an increasingly important strategic location. Its
exceptional technology and spaceport have only added to its value.
Should another Frontier War erupt it seems unlikely that Thanber will be
ignored this time.

The Sword Worlds are too concerned with securing the Entropic worlds
to take much notice of Thanber but they do have agents on the world
keeping an eye on developments, hiding among the small ethnic Sword
Worlds community on the planet.

The Imperium exerts most of its influence on the planet through Tukera
Lines but the supply runs to Retinae and back also serve to transport
Imperial agents between the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate.
Imperial traders are becoming more frequent as well, encouraged by
the excellent port and high tech goods available on the planet, despite
the jump-3 required to reach Imperial space. Thanber has its strongest
foreign economic ties by far with the Imperium.

Zhodani traders make planetfall on Thanber more often than might
be expected with the jump-3 from Querion and the Imperium is of the
opinion that many of these 'traders' are at least subsidized by the
Consulate, if not full agents. Zhodani influence on the world has been
most noticed in the increasingly tolerant attitude of Thanbers towards
psionic powers. It is rumored that Thanber University is the site
of an underground psionics institute that may soon begin operating
openly. Should the Zhodani begin showing a more active interest
in influencing the Thanber government it is likely that the Imperium
would respond in kind.

Zoë Tran, Researcher
**By Geir Lanesskog**

Location: Cotinga (2225 C725979-8), Vanguard Reaches
Required Skills: Starship and wilderness survival skills
Required Equipment: Starship capable of crossing two parsecs
Reward: One month charter fees and up to half of the proceeds from
sale of recovered items

Mission: Recovery of lost expedition to Cabranidi, any survivors or
bodies, and items collected from ruins

Summary: Zoë Tran was a member of an unauthorized expedition
to the near dark side of Cabranidi. The expedition's goal was to
investigate anomalies detected in an old orbital survey. Cabranidi is
the property of the Cabranidi Corporation, a Harmony-owned operator
of plantations in the planet's twilight zone. The harsh conditions on
Cabranidi include electronics-destroying solar megaflares and lifeforms
that consume plastics and carbon-based synthetics. As a result, the
plantations maintain primitive metal-based equipment and have little
contact with the outside world. Unauthorized landings and extraction of
resources are punishable under the laws of Harmony, although active
measures are usually unnecessary, as few of those who attempt to land
and exploit the planet survive the process.

Zoë was hired as a recently graduated xenobiologist whose thesis
focused on Cabranidi lifeforms. The expedition consisted of eight
people dropped off by a chartered starship to a location near the
anomalies. Their base was a prefabricated module sitting in a clearing
of the jungle created by TDX explosives. The ship was to return for the
expedition after 30 days.

The expedition discovered ruins dating back to Sindalian Diaspora
times, which were completely overgrown by jungle and held few
artefacts the team's archaeologists felt had any intrinsic value. After a
challenging 20 days surviving animal attacks and the effects of various
microbes, the expedition discovered the purpose of the ruins: a nearby
underground site of 'great antiquity'. Zoë does not know what it is,
other than 'not Ancients' but the team recovered two crates of metallic
artifacts. Returning to their base camp, the team encounter what Zoë
calls the trifecta: a nightstalker, some treegators and a slimetulip (see
The Spinward Extents). Zoë got separated from the rest of the party in
the confusion. Lost, she followed a river downstream towards a known
plantation site. Reaching the outskirts of what passes for civilization
on Cabranidi after three days of trekking a total of 35 kilometers, she
was promptly arrested for trespassing, transported to Harmony on the

next cargo run and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Released
after three years, she was unable to discover what happened to her
teammates other than to confirm they did not make it back to their
rendezvous point, nor were they captured and sent back to Harmony.

Gathering her savings and a small inheritance, she took steerage
passage to Cotinga in an unsuccessful attempt to find any other
survivors or to rehire the ship that took her to Cabranidi nearly four
years previously. She found no indication of survivors and the far trader
has long since moved on.

Zoë is looking for a ship to charter. She will pay for a full month charter
but only has Cr140000 for upfront payment. She is willing to pay the rest
out of any proceeds from the recovered artefacts and will offer to split
the remaining proceeds with the Travellers. Alternatively, if the Travellers
do not have access to a ship, they can find a decrepit century-old safari
ship available for a monthly lease of Cr300000. Upfront payment will be
required but few questions asked. The ship has no crew. Roll for 10 quirks
(Traveller Core Rulebook, Page 188).

When approaching the sites of the team's base or the ruins they
uncovered, it is clear the jungle has overgrown any possible landing
zone. The terrain precludes the landing of anything as large as a
starship or spacecraft except in the middle of the river Zoë used for her
escape, about 10 kilometers from the base camp and 12 from the ruins.
An air/raft-sized vehicle could navigate through the triple-canopy jungle
and land at the base camp on a Very Difficult (12+) Flyer (grav) check
(1D minutes, DEX) or a Difficult (10+) check for a grav bike or grav belt
landing. A TDX charge or any explosive that can clear a 15-meter-wide
landing zone can make enough space for an air/raft or similarly sized
vehicle to land with a Routine (6+) check.

Progress through the jungle is at a rate of one kilometer per hour on
foot. A grav belt or grav bike can cover one kilometer in five minutes,
requiring a Difficult (10+) check, or in 20 minutes for Average (8+)
check; a Routine check (6+) requires a full hour per kilometer, making
travel on the ground less risky than trying to fly around the many
branches, vines and other obstructions in the air. An ATV or other
ground vehicle is unable to penetrate the jungle, although construction
equipment could clear a path at one kilometer per day.

For every kilometer of travel or hour in the jungle, roll 2D for an animal
encounter. If a party separates, roll for each group. On a 10+ the
party encounters a dangerous animal. Roll 1D: 1–3 = treegator, 4–5
= nightstalker, 6 = slimetulip. Immediately roll 2D again to check for
a second simultaneous encounter but treat multiple nightstalkers as
treegators since nightstalkers are always solitary. Continue to roll 2D to
see if the party encounters a trifecta – or worse.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION:
1: No ships or surface communications challenge the ship at Cabranidi.

Travel to the base camp proceeds, with only animal encounters as
challenges, unless the Travellers create additional obstacles by their
actions. The base camp is overrun by jungle but after forcing entry to
the unlocked habitat module, it is as Zoë remembers. As far as she can
tell, nobody else made it back. Continuing towards the ruins reaches
the ambush site after one kilometer. Scattered bones and a single
crushed skull are all that remains of her team. Two aluminium crates,
each of a half meter-cubic volume, are half-buried by jungle. They
remain sealed. Each has a mass of 50 kilograms – weighing about
32 kilograms on Cabranidi – but are too bulky for a single individual
to carry. The cases contain non-functional metal artefacts of unknown
origin, two portable computer/3 with Expert Science (archaeology)/2
and a specialized computer running Universal Translator.

The ruin site is an old Sindalian era-camp with four vine-covered
modules containing no salvageable equipment or data. One of these
modules is home to a nightstalker. A fifth module 500 meters distant in
a small overgrown ravine connects to a tunnel dug into an underground
maze of chambers covering a 100 x 100 meter area. This tunnel was
rediscovered and cleared by Zoë's expedition. If the Travellers spend
time exploring these older ruins, they may find up to one box worth of
saleable non-functional artefacts after six person-days of effort.

While travelling in the jungle and outside the camps check for an animal
encounter every hour. The return trip has the same risks as the inbound
journey. Check normally for a starship encounter on the outbound journey.

If the Travellers or Zoë take the time to find the right experts – on a
TL12+ world with at least Population 6 – they can determine the artefacts
are likely 200,000 years old and probably Kursae. If the Travellers find
the right buyer – Difficult (10+) Broker or Science (archaeology) check
(1D days, INT) – each box of artefacts is worth 1D x Cr200000.

2: As in 1, but two team members made it back to the base camp
without the artefact cases. They died of injuries or other factors
shortly thereafter, leaving skeletal remains. Zoë insists on returning
the remains to their families. The boxes with the artefacts and other
remains are located as in 1.

3: As in 1, but a Cabranidi Corporation ship detected the Traveller's
vessel on approach. Check to see if the Travellers detect the ship at
Very Long range. The ship sends a message to the nearest plantation,
who will dispatch a team of four security guards in an air/raft. The
guards are armed with scoped lightweight versions of big game rifles
(200m, 3D+3, 5 shots, Scope), equipped with TL10 Cloth armor
(Protection +8) and are Average Combatants. They have no capability
to contact their base via radio. If they do not return, the plantation will
send out another team as a search party after 48 hours.

4: As in 3 but the Cabranidi Corporation ship is in orbit. It will challenge any
incoming vessel and launch pursuit if appropriate. The ship, Snowplum
IV, is a cargo-only subsidized liner with a pulse laser-equipped slow
boat (Thrust 3) instead of a launch. The Snowplum IV itself will not
actively pursue but is equipped with a double beam laser turret and a
single sandcaster turret for self-defence and will fire upon hostile or non-
responding ships within Medium range. The boat will not attempt to board
a vessel but will insist the ship head to the ocean for refuelling and depart
immediately while under guard. If combat with the boat occurs, there are
four guards (see 3) with TL12 vacc suits in addition to the pilot aboard.
Firing on the boat or starship will result in legal action by the Cabranidi
Corporation if the ship is identifiable by transponder or by Close range
inspection. Travellers will be charged for any offenses under Harmony law
and will have alerts placed upon them and their ship at Harmony, New
Harmony and Cotinga starports. The penalty for trespassing on Cabranidi
is five years' incarceration, although offworlders can pay a Cr50000 fine
and accept permanent exile from Harmony New Harmony, and Cabranidi.
Any more serious crimes will involve longer sentences or with a possible
option of a term at a plantation on Cabranidi.

5: As in 2 and 3 but the artefacts are only 75,000 years old and likely
Droyne, worth only 2D x Cr50000.

6: As in 4. Any ship identifiable by transponder or by Close range
inspection will be noted by the Cabranidi Corporation and reported
back to headquarters regardless of whether it takes offensive action.
The Travellers will at a minimum face a charge of trespassing (as in 4)
if apprehended.

ZOË TRAN
Born and raised on Harmony, Zoë Tran has a doctorate in xenobiology
and spent a full year of study on Cabranidi as part of her doctoral
dissertation. She is a slight woman, dark hair, pale skin and her entire
right side (face, arms, legs) covered in red and black prison tattoos. She
may once have been pretty but now just looks like a hardened street
thug. Her speech patterns switch from those of a cultured academic to
those of a prison gang member, seemingly at random. She has a raspy
voice and a persistent cough, products of her second visit to Cabranidi.

Her family has disowned her and she covered half her body in prison
tattoos because 'it was a way to pass the time'. The tattoos guarantee
anyone from Harmony will know her as an ex-con and she has no
hope of getting an academic position, at least not on Harmony or any
associated system.

Zoë feels responsible for what happened to her teammates. She
was not the team leader, or even a senior member of the team, but
understanding Cabranidi's wildlife and its dangers was her job. In the
chaos of the trifecta ambush she sought to save herself and she did not
return for the rest of the team. When she was arrested at the plantation,
she kept silent, hoping the team would get away but also preventing
any attempt at rescue. She does not expect to find survivors. She
simply wants to recover the artefacts to make the journey worthwhile
to others. She just hopes the effort to return and recover whatever
remains that might be found will make her nightmares stop.

For the purposes of detecting a treegator or slimetulip ambush, Zoë
may use Science (xenology) 3 as a substitute for Recon.

The Price of Villainy
**By Martin J Dougherty**

We generally assume that Travellers are sort-of-heroes, perhaps a bit
grey but inclined toward positive actions. There are always exceptions,
such as Travellers who make a career out of piracy and raiding. Those
who live by the gun can expect to run into others who want them to
stop – living, that is – and causing mayhem and destruction will lead to
a backlash sooner or later.

However, there are times when the Travellers' behaviour is reprehensible
but within acceptable limits. Anti-heroes are interesting characters and
doing bad things can be necessary sometimes. In this case the Referee
should impose logical consequences depending on what the Travellers
do – and what they are seen to have done. Where to draw the line
between a career as pirates and wanton murderers is up to the individual
Referee but there should always be a price for villainy.

NOTORIETY
Travellers who do bad stuff will earn a Notoriety characteristic. This is
rated from 0–15 and can change over time. Note that Notoriety is nothing
to do with what can be proven in a court of law; it is an impression other
people have. An innocent band of Travellers might gain Notoriety if they
are found at the site of a massacre and blamed for it, even if there is no
evidence of wrongdoing on their part. This cuts both ways – Travellers
who cleverly leave behind no clues can still be seen as guilty in the court
of public opinion, whilst those blatantly guilty in the eyes of the law might
somehow convince the general public they are being framed.

The Notoriety table gives an indication of the amount of Notoriety
Travellers will gain for various actions. Note that this is a guideline only;
it may be that some actions are considered 'fair enough' by observers
or the victims may be felt to deserve what they got. A Traveller who
shoots a known criminal terrorising the local community may not gain
Notoriety if the population feel they have been done a favor. On the
other hand, harming someone particularly vulnerable or well-regarded
might result in additional Notoriety.

If the Travellers do a number of bad deeds in the course of an
adventure, they will usually gain Notoriety for the worst offence.
However, if their crimes are varied or there are aggravating factors,
these may apply in addition. For example, beating up a bunch of
innocent people is bad enough but if the Travellers targeted a group out
of hate they may gain additional Notoriety, and if they also defaced a
memorial to a well-loved local figure this might get them still more.

The level of interest on the Notoriety Effects table is a guideline to
what level of resources will be assigned to dealing with or keeping an
eye on notorious Travellers. For lower levels of Notoriety, or where
wrongdoing has never been proven, a response is likely to take the
form of instructions to watch out for the Travellers, advice to increase
security at places in which they have shown an interest and perhaps
deliberate surveillance in the hope of obtaining actionable evidence.
If the Travellers are known or strongly suspected to have engaged in
criminality, an arrest may be attempted.

GAIN AND LOSS
Notoriety gradually fades if it is not increased by further misdeeds,
dropping by 1 every 2D+12 weeks, until it reaches a value of 3. Unless
the Traveller changes their identity or otherwise leaves their reputation
behind, Notoriety will not go below this.

Notoriety can be reduced by good deeds that offset the bad or by
public-relations work. For example, the Travellers are notorious for
using excessive force during an adventure but manage to convince the
public that their opponents deserved what they got. Typically, any such
instance will reduce Notoriety by -1. This can create an on-balance
value, where the Travellers are known for some misdeeds, but people
forgive them because there was that time they helped out. Up to a
value of 10, Fame and Notoriety cancel one another out to a great
extent, so the Travellers' effective Fame or Notoriety can be determined
by subtracting the lower from the higher value. Beyond a value of 10,
Fame and Notoriety do not cancel one another out. Some people will
use the Fame score and generally ignore Notoriety, and vice versa.
Opinion on the Travellers could become polarised but the authorities
are always more concerned with Notoriety than Fame. This might
create a situation where the authorities are trying to apprehend the
Travellers and their fans are trying to protect them.

PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM NOTORIETY
For every 3 Notoriety, Travellers suffer DM-1 when interacting with
honest people, in a non-threatening way, and receive DM+1 to attempts
to intimidate or bully anyone who knows about the Travellers' reputation.
Of course, this sort of behaviour can increase Notoriety but it cannot go
above a value of 10 just by being nasty to people. The Notoriety modifier
applies in whatever other situations the Referee feels are appropriate.
For example, a weapons dealer might be reluctant to sell to the Travellers
in case there is fallout from whatever they do with the guns.

Travellers with a Notoriety DM are more likely to be considered
suspects even if there is no evidence linking them to a crime. This
means that from time-to-time they will be questioned by local police
about something that happened across town just in case they were
somehow involved. The Notoriety DM applies to attempts to persuade
someone of their innocence – essentially, it is harder to dispel
suspicions when you are known to be a bad guy.

Being notorious can result in long-term consequences. Once any of
the incidents below has been indicated, it is in force until something
changes. For example, if a law enforcement official makes it a special
project to bring the Travellers to justice they will continue to do so until
convinced of their innocence, intimidated into breaking off or otherwise
giving up. Even if Notoriety goes down and the Travellers are forgotten,
their enemy will continue to work against them.

robbed or a powerful official. The individual is
considered an Enemy.
11 A large bounty is placed on the Traveller's head,
worth Cr10000 x 1D x Notoriety.
12 A small team of experts is tasked with hunting down
the Traveller. They may or may not be able to obtain
local cooperation but will actively hunt the Traveller
for 2D+12 months.
13 One agency or service makes a priority of eliminating
or apprehending the Traveller. This might be a widely
publicised law enforcement operation or an off-the-
books assassination squad sent by the military.
Significant resources are assigned but only for a
period of 1D+6 months.
14 A powerful individual becomes obsessed with
eliminating the Travellers. This might be a political
or economic figure who can bring considerable
resources to bear or a highly capable individual
willing to take more direct action.
15+ A major multi-agency operation is launched, possibly
including naval and military assets or special forces.
Funding will be reviewed in 2D+6 months, after which
the operation may or may not be continued.
```

The Travellers should realise their actions will have consequences
when they start seeing electronic wanted posters appearing or bounties
offered on the local datanet. Travellers who live by the gun may well
die by the gun and those who had no mercy on their victims can expect
none. This is in no way unfair providing it is a logical consequence of
the Travellers' actions. They may spot the glint of a scope or the dot of
a targeting laser in time to dive for cover but a combination of Notoriety
and complacence can, and perhaps should, get a Traveller wiped out
without a chance to respond. Such is the price of villainy.

Iris Valves: A Users and Abusers Guide
**By Craig Bunting**

As described by Colonel Rudi Flashman, Imperial Marines

What follows are the observations of my one-time captor, Issat
Kutebar, a pirate of some note I was captured by in the Old
Expanses. During one of our pleasurable evening conversations
whilst negotiations for my ransom were ongoing, Kutebar stated that
iris valves are the unacknowledged icon of the Third Imperium. He
declared them more familiar than the Imperial Sunburst but that most
people pass through them without any genuine appreciation. It is only
during failed boarding actions and decompression events that people
really appreciate an iris valve, he argued.

FORM AND FUNCTION
The then crescent-shaped sections that make up the door are called
leaves and, depending on manufacturer, there will typically be five to
nine of them. The structure the leaves are within is called the surround.

It is impossible to talk about iris valves and not airlocks, so when I say
the outside of an iris valve, I mean the side that faces the environment
that the ship, station or facility is hosted within. This is also typically
the side intruders are trying to get through. When I say inside, I mean
the side of the airlock facing the environment us sophonts live in. In
an airlock the space-valve is the one you open to go from the airlock
to the outside, whilst the air-valve is the one you open to get from the
airlock into the ship.

This is an important distinction because the space-valve has to be more
robust when closed, as it forms part of the hull's rigidity. It commonly
has increased security as it has to stop anyone getting in, whereas the
security on iris valves within are there to stop only certain occupants
passing through. I am going to be referring to the outside, inside,
space-valve and air-valve a lot, and will now refer to all structures with
iris valves as habitats.

Without going into a lengthy discourse on architecture, habitats of any
size are divided into blocks or zones, and access from one to another
is through iris valves, sometimes paired into airlocks, so during a
decompression event each block can be sealed.

**Terminology used**

```
Terminology Function
Leaves Sections making up the door
Surround Door frame, containing the leaves
Outside The side of the valve facing the exterior of the ship
Inside The side of the valve facing the interior of the ship
Space-valve Allows access from the airlock to the exterior
Air-valve Allows access from the airlock to the interior
Habitat Any structure with an iris valve
```

The Ling Standard Products internal iris valve, possibly the most common
within the Third Imperium, have singular small windows of about 10–20
centimeters. These will, when closed, be at about face height, although
other manufacturers differ in their designs. Iris valves come in standard
size but can be made to order, so do not expect them to all be the same.
They will certainly have a camera set above the surround, the imagery
from which can be seen in the control pad also set into the surround. Most
manufacturers will also install fittings for other sensors to be attached by
individual clients. One of the common sensors is an ambient radiation
sensor on the outside of space-valves to warn of hostile conditions.

On custom valves additional sensors might instead be at the sides and
barely visible, perhaps just a discrete stud or slight depression. High
Tech Level security sensors might use fine-radar emitters to scan the
front of a potential entrant for unexpected hard surfaces like armor or
concealed objects.

Iris valves are networked to a central computer, either the security or
environmental controller. This means that depending on the habitat's
function, data from these sensors will be logged. As iris valves often
have their own computer it is important to note which controls the valve
and which acts as backup. This is useful to know, as the valve might be
easier to deal with than the computer. If only you could cut off contact
between the two...

The valve's job is to close upon sensing decompression on one side.
Often this means severing whatever might be between the leaves at
the time, arms and legs included. Most use simple yet reliable gears
and hydraulics, rated to work in vacuum and shutting in less than one
second. Even small ones are horrendously powerful. What is less well
known is that if the leaves cannot sever whatever is blocking them, they
are designed to crush the obstruction or deform themselves in order to
effectively seal tight around it.

Everyone worth their vacc suits should know the first thing navy recruits
learn is iris valve discipline. Do not leave loose objects near a valve, just
in case rushing air in a decompression event snatches them up to be
pinched between the leaves. Those parents you see on cruise vessels
letting their hideous children run at a valve, trying to time their jump to
pass through as it opens? They irritate me to the point of profanity.

So how do you get through a locked iris valve? A good question and the
real reason you are here. All iris valves can be digitally or mechanically
locked, so let us go from there.

DIGITAL SECURITY
This lock is a security protocol, which must be bypassed before the
computer signals the iris valves' motor to open. What that protocol is
will vary from some sort of identity tag to a retinal scanner, although
facial recognition is a popular trade-off between security and
convenience. It is redundant when wearing a helmet and many military
groups instead have a barcode, tag or similar on their vacc suit. Voice
recognition is another common type of scanner, useful for valves in
constant use.

A point on facial recognition; do not think face masks in the image of
someone known to have clearance will get you through a valve. If the
scanner has micro-sensitive radar, it will be scanning the front of your
skull as well as the skin on your face.

If you have not managed to obtain a fake or stolen pass you are
going to have to hack the security protocols, for which you will need a
portable computer. Many iris valve control pads have an induction plate
or optical sensor through which they can interface with a computer.
Usually when you buy an iris valve there is a small tablet supplied,
already fitted with interfacing hardware. On this you can compose
whatever digital security you want to install, set the level of pressure
drop required to activate emergency closure, calibrate pressure
sensors and a few other details. You may already be getting some idea
of how these types of valves are hacked.

The tablets are small computers, with the manufacturer's software and
hardware required to communicate with the valve's control pad already
installed. When the software is modified, the tablet becomes a set of
electronic lockpicks. Those well-initiated in this type of access already
own one of these or a hand-made version. A quick hack of the security
software remains the preferred way of getting an iris valve to open
against the occupants' wishes. You do still need to be hasty. If a ship
sees a hostile vessel close in and extend their docking boom, the first
action will be to turn off power to that iris valve, followed by a member
of the crew dashing to mechanically lock it.

MECHANICAL LOCKING
Before I go on, it must be stated that you cannot lock an iris valve in
the open position; from a manufacturer's point of view there is no point.
They can be mechanically locked from the inside only and cannot be
locked from the outside. This is where it gets confusing, as iris valves
inside habitats will effectively have an inside on both sides, whereas
the space-valve of an airlock will have an inside and an outside. Think
of it like having a bolt on the inside of the front and back doors of your
dwelling, and bolts on both sides of all your internal doors.

An internal iris valve has an inside on both sides, meaning it must be
mechanically unlocked from the locked side to open. To lock a valve, you
have to open the surround, which on a standard iris valve is a matter of
two minutes spent popping off the panelling and pulling a lever. No tools
are required and this is how you access the power-coupling to the valve.

You cannot mechanically lock a valve from the outside but you can
unlock one. First you need tools to take the panelling off the outside
surround – you can then unlock a space valve from the outside, with
a hand-crank, a good tactile sense for vibration and a sledgehammer.
An unpowered iris valve can be laboriously cranked open and a
mechanism called the crank-axle connects both locking bolts. If you
attach a hand-crank and rattle it about, you can feel the crank-axle
moving against the locking bolt. By manoeuvring the hand-crank in the
right position and applying pressure, you can bash a certain part of the
housing with a sledgehammer while trying to turn the crank, shocking
the mechanism and unlocking the bolt on the other side.

This is not at all easy in low gravity. In certain circles this is referred to
as 'shot-popping', as a low-gauge short-barrelled shotgun can be used
to shock the mechanism instead of a sledgehammer. Shot-popping is
easier to do with older iris valves that have developed some pliancy.

HOTWIRING
It is also possible to take away the surround's panelling to get inside
the control box and trigger an iris valve to open by interfering with the
wiring between control pad, power source and motor. This is not as easy
as it sounds, as there is a mess of fine wires, micro-switches and other
components in the control box, all of which are generally unmarked.

Hotwiring has the disadvantage that the surround of the iris valve needs
to be removed and specific fine tools are needed to get into the control
box. This takes time but has the advantage of bypassing digital security.
Hotwiring requires knowledge of life support engineering and fine tools,

so it is not something your average ship's third-class mechanic will be
able to do. If done poorly it can result in an electrical shock and the
current required in order to close during a decompression event will
almost certainly kill whoever attempts it.

Providing you are on the inside, an alternative to crossing wires to
trigger the valve is cutting the power to the motors. This makes any
electronic security useless and lets you crank open the iris valve,
provided it is not mechanically locked.

BRIDGES AND ENGINE ROOMS
I have mentioned the outside of space-valves as facing out into the
environment the habitat is hosted by but there are exceptions, such
as the entrance into the bridge of a ship or space station's operations
center. As those who control the bridge generally control the ship, it is
easier to deter boarders if you control the bridge. For this purpose, the
outside of the valve to the bridge will be as hard to get through as an
outside space-valve. It is not unusual for the engine room to have a
space-valve too.

NO POWER, HARD WORK
As mentioned before, iris valves have the ability to be cranked open
providing they are unpowered and not mechanically locked. On derelict
ships this is the main access method and is as simple as removing the
valves' surround panelling, inserting the hand-crank and turning it until
the leaves have opened enough to get through. This usually takes 10
minutes to create a half meter hole, so is not the most effective method.

If the iris valve is part of a deserted facility or derelict ship the gears
may have corroded or be jammed with ice, making hand-cranking
extremely hard if at all possible. This is where motorised cranks
are used, human-portable powered motors that you connect to the
crank-axle of the iris valve. These will crank open a well-maintained
standard 1.5 meter iris valve in six seconds, although you still have to
remove part of the surround. They are often sold as rescue equipment
and human-portable models will open up to a three meter diameter
valve, whilst heavier non-portable models can be plugged into
generators to open larger valves.

The other option for the inside of an unpowered iris valve is to power it
with a battery, although this still requires opening up the panelling and
attaching power cables. Once powered the iris valve can be opened,
although if it has previously been digitally locked it will not unlock simply
due to prior power loss.

AIRLOCKS
Where two iris valves are paired into an airlock, getting past the
security of the outside space-valve often means two minutes waiting
whilst atmosphere is pumped into storage. The last thing anyone
outside a ship in zero-gravity wants is to be blown away by escaping
air. Sometimes hacking the electronic security will bypass pumping out
the air, sometimes not.

Anyone who has previous experience in boarding will hang onto
something when the outer valve is opened. Usually, a ship's captain
with crew outside will evacuate the atmosphere from the airlock
beforehand so they do not have to wait to re-enter, although if
expecting a boarding action, they may increase the pressure inside the
airlock in an attempt to push amateur intruders away.

Usually there is no active electronic security on the inside iris valve
but sometimes if the outside space-valve is hacked it could trigger the
inside valve to lock. It all depends on security protocols.

REFEREE INFORMATION
Hacking electronic security on an iris valve requires a successful
Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check (2D minutes, INT) using a
computer terminal. If hacking the outside door of an airlock, the Referee
should determine how much Effect is required to not trigger the locking
of the inside door. This difficulty assumes a civilian ship or habitat, a
military one should be Very Difficult (12+) or Formidable (14+).

Removing panelling in the surround on the inside of an iris valve requires a
successful Routine (6+) Engineer or Mechanic check (1D minutes, DEX).

Removing the panelling on the outside of an iris valve requires a
successful Difficult (10+) Engineer or Mechanic check using basic tools
(1Dx2 minutes, DEX). If in zero gravity the DEX DM may be replaced
with the Vacc Suit skill. If using a panel hacking kit this becomes
Average (8+) and only takes D3 minutes.

Shot-popping an iris valve that has been locked from the other side
requires the panelling to be removed from the surround, followed by
a successful Difficult (10+) DEX check (1D seconds). This requires a
hand-crank and a heavy tool suitable for imparting shocks. The Referee
should consider how new and well-maintained the iris valve is, as this
will be a Formidable (14+) task on a new iris valve.

Using a sledgehammer in Zero or Low Gravity requires a successful
Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity) check to avoid spinning out of control
(see Traveller Core Rulebook, page 81). Using the clamped shotgun
and solid copper slugs means the Traveller does not need to hold the
shotgun when firing, nor do they need to make the check to avoid
spinning out of control.

Hotwiring first requires the surround's panelling to be removed.
Travellers may then either cut the power or attach a battery to the
inside. Both require a successful Average (8+) Engineer (life support)
check (1D minutes, EDU). To bypass the digital security requires
a successful Very Difficult (12+) Engineer (life support) check (3D
minutes, EDU) using fine tools. The check to bypass the digital security
may get harder for military vessels.

EQUIPMENT
The following equipment can be used to gain access to an iris valve,
whether it be your own or one on another ship.

**Shot-Popping Kit**
This is a heavy-duty bag with a magnetic pad used to clamp it onto the
hull of a starship. Inside, attached to wire tethers, are a sledgehammer
and a hand-crank with a variety of fittings for different manufacturers
of airlocks. For an additional cost, the kit contains a modified short-
barrel shotgun with magnetic muzzle-clamp and 10 solid copper slugs.
The operator should take care, as the shotgun comes flying off the
mechanism when fired, if untethered.

Security Hacker
These are a category 4 restricted item (see Central Supply Catalogue,
page 4) and, outside paramilitary or military forces, almost always
makeshift versions. They consist of a computer terminal that would
normally come with a new iris valve to set up security and other
parameters but has several additional cables ending in various plugs to
suit whichever model of security panel it is being used on. The standard
software on the terminal will have been modified to allow the user to
crack the security and open the valve. When using this, duration is
reduced to 1D minutes.

**Panel Hacking Kit**
This is a selection of tools specific to removing panels from the
surround on the outside of an iris valve. It includes a magnetic clamp
with explosive charges just powerful enough to destroy fixing points and
a clawed tool to rip the panel off.

```
Item TL Kg Cost

Iris Valve Power Pack
This is a battery box with a variety of easy-to-use couplings specific to
iris valves, which can be plugged in to provide power. It is designed to be
strapped to an individual in a vacc suit so the operator can use it hands-
free. Power packs are simple to jerry-rig, provided you have a suitable
size of battery and a basic grasp of electronics. Typically, given the power
required, it will open two standard 1.5 meter iris valves on a full charge.

Iris Valve Crank
This is a heavy box with a protruding shaft that can be clamped to an
iris valve, with the shaft attaching to the crank-axle. It is manufactured
for rescue purposes and with a full charge it will open two 1.5 meter
iris valves or one 3 meter valve. It can alternatively be plugged into a
power source. The mechanism is not powerful enough to crank open
larger iris valves.

The Zhodani Fleet
**By Martin Dougherty**

Naval forces of the Zhodani Consulate undertake a wider range of roles
than their equivalents in most other powers. However, much of this
variation is regional. Forces based along the spinward and coreward
frontiers are largely equipped with general-purpose vessels well suited
to exploration and long-range operations far beyond the borders. Those
facing the Imperium and the Vargr states to trailing of the Consulate
tend to receive vessels whose primary or sole purpose is warfighting
against a major opponent.

The development of any military force is informed by the opponents
it is likely to face. For the Zhodani Consulate the most probable, and
the most dangerous, opponent is the Third Imperium. Its primary
warships are designed for such a conflict, taking into account the
technological advantage of the best Imperial vessels. The Zhodani
fleet is also designed around the use of psionic talents wherever
they are likely to be useful.

The range of many talents places limits on how effective they can be
and the availability of personnel with the correct abilities must also be
taken into account. As a result, psionics are mainly used by special-
operations or support vessels. For example, a flight of Zhodani fighters
might include a two-seat command model, with the squadron leader
using Tactical Awareness or similar talents to provide their force with an
advantage. A stealthy reconnaissance craft or fleet picket might carry a
clairvoyant, enabling it to gather information without any emissions to
give away its location.

Psionic communication is less useful than many non-Zhodani might
imagine. Instant, undetectable and totally secure communication is
easy over distances of a few kilometers and telepaths are common
in the Zhodani armed forces. However, large warships need to
remain many kilometers apart even when operating as a squadron
and communication over greater distances is tiring for the telepaths
involved. With a maximum range of about 50,000 kilometers telepathy
is not useful in assisting with targeting or guiding weapons.

The advantages provided by telepathic communication are still
considerable. Psionic communication between vessels in the same
squadron allows for closer cooperation than most navies can achieve

- each captain literally knows the mind of the squadron commander.
Those classes of Zhodani warships that operate en masse tend to be
smaller and more numerous than Imperial equivalents. Major vessels
are the opposite; they are built for maximum individual capability.

Like many naval powers, the Zhodani Consulate uses a high-end/low-
end procurement strategy. Ships intended to confront a major navy are
built to a high standard, whilst those intended for patrol and security
work use a lesser specification. This trade-off allows the Consulate to
maintain enough hulls to meet its security needs whilst not impacting
the warfighting budget. In practice, these second-line ships are often
tasked with screening or providing security for the main fleets, and also
see service as raiders.

The Argon Gambit
By Frank Chadwick

Additional Assistance: John Harshman, Winston Hamilton, Loren
Wiseman and Marc W. Miller

Location: Janosz (A564978-B), Harlequin, Solomani Rim
Required Skills: Deception, Leadership, Melee (unarmed), Persuade,
Streetwise
Reward: MCr1

Mission: Break into a villa, recover documents and return them

Summary: This adventure is intended for use with a band of Travellers
serving as a crew temporarily grounded for lack of funds at Argon
Downport. Janosz is only slightly less than average in size, measuring
8,000 kilometers in diameter, with a standard atmosphere and water
covering 40% of the planet's surface. Janosz has a population slightly
in excess of one billion and is listed as a balkanised world with an
average Law Level 8. There are, in fact, 32 sovereign states on the
planet, with populations ranging from only a few million to over 100
million. This specific adventure takes place in the city of Argon, the
capital of Intanevac and the site of the world's Class A starport. Due
to the influence of the large population of starfarers in the city, the
local Law Level of Argon is actually 4. Intanevac is a representative
democracy, enjoying a high degree of personal freedom, and is widely
known for its political and religious tolerance.

ACROSS THE BAR ROOM TABLE
When the ship jumped into the Janosz system, it developed a bad
fuel leak that destroyed much of the wiring in several power plant
subsystems. The ship was taken in tow and parked in orbit above the
planet Janosz pending repairs. Towing fees consumed much of the
ready cash of the Travellers, however, and even after the disposal
of the cargo the estimated costs of the repairs will amount to about
Cr750000 more than the group can raise. Forced to effect repairs within
one month or have their ship seized as a hazard to astrogation, they
are desperately seeking employment.

While engaged in idle conversation at one of the bars in the rough
section of Argon city near the starport, the group is approached by
a man who identifies himself as Jason Grant. Grant is expensively
but conservatively dressed and appears to be out of place in the bar.
Nevertheless, he gives the impression of being at ease and capable
of taking care of himself. Grant indicates he is aware of the Travellers'
search for employment, has heard of the type of jobs they have done
in the past (that is to say, occasionally shady and often dangerous) and
says he may have a job for them.

Retiring to a table in the corner where they are unlikely to be overheard,
Grant explains he is in the employ of a public figure who is being
blackmailed. The item in his employer's past is personal in nature,
not political, but public revelation of it would nevertheless destroy his
career. As his employer is out of favor with the government at present,
discretion from the police cannot be expected. He is forced to turn to
unofficial means of protecting his privacy.

Grant and his agents have determined the source of the blackmail to
be one Ganidiirsi Kashkanun, a local citizen of some means but with a
slightly unsavory reputation. Kashkanun is known to have documents
that form the basis of his blackmail plot in his villa, probably in his
personal safe. Only by examining the documents can Grant's employer
determine whether additional supporting documents may exist elsewhere
and prepare forgeries, which can be substituted for the originals.

He appears to be open in discussing the projected assignment,
explaining several other relevant points. Providing a general plan of
Kashkanun's villa, he states he is relatively certain there are only three
bodyguards at work there. He can provide stunners and stun grenades.
The main obstacle to be overcome is the electronic security system,
which requires some intelligence work the Travellers themselves must
do. Grant can stall the final pay-off for seven days. On the eighth day,
the pay-off must be made. Therefore, he suggests the group make the
raid on the seventh day from today.

That should provide them enough time to get the information and make
plans. He also demands the group meet with him once more before the
plans are finalised; it is very important to him that the effort succeed
and as he is familiar with this sort of thing, it is likely he may need to
constructively criticize. If he can make even one suggestion that will
prevent any obvious blunders, then he will be well rewarded. Grant and
his own men cannot carry out the break-in as their known association
with Grant's employer may implicate him if anything were to go wrong.
His employer will pay MCr1 for successful completion of the mission.

RUMOURS
The Argon Gambit is a mystery which the Travellers, to survive, must
puzzle out, at least in part. The clues to the solution of the mystery can
be obtained in several ways but most of them are contained in rumors.
Some of the rumors are red herrings, meaningless to the situation
at hand, while others include critical information. Due to the need to
uncover as much information as possible, a different procedure from
that used in other adventures is used here. Travellers may split into
several groups to independently hunt for rumors and each individual
or group of individuals may uncover one rumor a day. The individuals
involved seek out such information by mingling with the population,
making the rounds of bars and spacers' taverns, the local Travellers'
Aid Society facilities (if the Traveller is a member), the local naval or
scout base and any other appropriate location.

Street Rumors
The following are available upon a successful Average (8+)
Streetwise check:
•  A talkative bartender mentions he has never met Kashkanun but
knows of him. Kashkanun is a well-known Vilani minor racketeer,
generally involved in several different shady deals at one time. If the
Traveller continues buying drinks and talking to the bartender, he
will remember he has heard rumors that Laura Chin, a bigwig in
the local Solomani Party and herself sometimes involved in shady
deals and rough stuff, is apparently after Kashkanun. The word is
Kashkanun somehow double-crossed her, although the bartender
does not think the rumor is true. What business would the number
two person in the Solomani Party be having with a Vilani thug?
•  A local fence says he can get the Travellers in touch with a contact
man. A contact man is an information broker with sometimes valuable
connections. If this is pursued, he will meet the Travellers the next
day in the bar and will be able to obtain the complete plans for the
electronic security system for Kashkanun's villa. He will sell them for
Cr1000. If the offer is taken, he will deliver them the next day.
•  After listening to the description of the men who attacked the
Travellers and beat them up, a local tough says he has seen
a group of men like that together often. The local word is they
work for someone in the Solomani Party as security guards and
bouncers at political rallies and they probably do special jobs on
the side. He does not know their names, however, or where to find
them. This rumor should not be provided until after the Squeeze:
Part One (see page 118), has occurred.
•  A local bookie is nervous and thinking of closing his operation
for several weeks, as he thinks the heat may be on him. He has
heard from a friend who works as a clerk in the municipal police
department that a big raid is scheduled, although he does not know
for sure what the raid is about. If the conversation is prolonged,
he will mention the date of the raid, which is the same date as the
break-in. This rumor should not be provided until after the actual
date of the break-in is determined and told to Grant.

Scout Rumors
The following rumors are available to retired scout Travellers:
•  An active-duty scout is encountered, very drunk. He complains
very bitterly about being stuck in commerce patrol duty instead of
being in x-boats, which he would prefer. He blames his assignment
on the rumors of Solomani arms smuggling attempts, although he
knows of no actual arms interceptions by patrol vessels.

```
•  An off-duty dispatcher from the local scout base claims many scouts
have been pressed into duty in commerce patrols because of a
shortage of naval vessels. Several warships have been dispatched
to support operations against the Solomani insurgents on the planet
Scaramouche in this subsector. The scout has little regard for the
navy or the marines, whom he considers to be equally obnoxious.
The navy, he will forcefully assert, is run by no-talent nobles whilst
the marines tend to think with their fists. A number of marines
recently left the service and went to work for the local Solomani
Party as thugs. If questioned further, he can probably remember the
bar where the Solomani-sympathising marines hang out.
•  A retired scout claims much of the southern continent of Janosz
remains unexplored to this day. There is no telling what mineral
wealth is there for the taking.
```

Marine Rumors
The following rumors are available to retired marines:
•  An active-duty marine sergeant-major, of obvious Solomani descent,
tells the Travellers he is planning to retire soon. Several of his
friends have recently retired and are making good money working
security for the Solomani Party. The sergeant-major is arrogant and
self-important, and brags about his connections and pipeline to the
Travellers. He says a big shakeup is coming in the higher leadership
but when pressed for more information abruptly seems to realise he
has probably said too much and refuses to talk further.
•  A marine corporal is willing to talk about anything that comes
up, although he has only recently been transferred to Argon as
a guard for the Imperial Consulate. He has mostly pulled guard
assignments for the last two terms and unless things pick up soon,
he is thinking of getting out of the service. The only break in the
monotony since his arrival on planet was about three weeks ago.
His squad was pulled in as additional local security after a burglary
at the Intanevaci State Archives, although even then only some
unimportant birth and adoption records were taken.

Merchant Rumors
Any Traveller engaging in trade should be able to find these rumors:
•  A merchant first officer, apparently well-versed in local commercial
transactions, remembers Kashkanun's name and recalls his fortune
was made on an insurance settlement from a hijacked cargo
shipment. The captain of the merchant ship was financially ruined
by the subsequent litigation and the first officer thinks Kashkanun
somehow framed him.

```
•  A merchant captain of a free trader admits to being the primary
supplier of anagathics to Argon but is reluctant to discuss who his
clients are, as that is privileged information. His manner suggests
a bribe will make him less reluctant and he will settle for Cr100.
After accepting the bribe, he will reveal his best customer is Grant,
although the captain is reasonably certain the drugs are purchased
for someone else's use.
```

Navy Rumors
The following rumors are available to ex-naval or retired naval Travellers:
•  A navy officer in a bar bemoans the fact his regular drinking
buddies have not been able to get off duty at night for over a week.
They are junior officers pulling a staff assignment in intelligence
and apparently some big operation is brewing.
•  A retired navy admiral comments he is certain he has seen the
man who calls himself Grant elsewhere, years before, although
when he approached him. Grant denied it sounding innocent and
sincere. The admiral recalls the man he knew was a junior naval
officer serving on the staff of a fleet admiral in the core, although
he disremembers the man's name or exact assignment.

Noble Rumors
The following rumors are available to Travellers upon a successful
Difficult (10+) SOC check:
•  An elderly knight is willing to discuss the ins and outs of the
local Solomani Party structure at length, his description being
liberally interspersed with disparaging remarks about them. Arlan
Samuelson is the current Party chief, although he holds only a
slim majority on the steering committee of the Party. His chief rival
is Laura Chin, a moderate. It appears Samuelson feels strong
enough now to ease Chin out of the steering committee, as at the
last Party Congress Samuelson's keynote address contained a
number of remarks critical of the training of junior Party officials, a
responsibility held by Chin. The main independent on the steering
committee, Cedric Zimmerman, controls the swing votes and if he
is now siding with Samuelson, that could be the reason Samuelson
is coming out in public against Chin. Although an independent
with little solid support on the steering committee, Zimmerman's
popularity with the junior Party regulars makes him the probable
number three man in the Party.
•  A baroness on vacation in Argon from coreward comments that as
a small child, she knew Cedric Zimmerman, although he was then
of about the same apparent age as now. She concludes he must
be using anagathics although he has never seemed to have the
financial resources to do so, even with his Party contacts.

Travellers' Aid Society Rumors
The following rumors are available to members of the Travellers'
Aid Society:
•  Grant is not extremely widely known but he is not a mystery
figure either. A waiter, bartender or any of several patrons in the
Travellers' Aid Society restaurant and bar can easily identify him
and verify his identity from a Traveller's description, as being a
member of the Society and a frequent patron of the establishment.
He is known to be the administrative assistant to Arlan Samuelson,
number one man in the local Solomani Party.
•  The waiter is familiar with Mr. Kashkanun, who is a member of the
Travellers' Aid Society, but he has not come into the restaurant
in about two weeks. Prior to that, the waiter remembers he was
here several times in the company of Laura Chin, a major figure
in the local Solomani Party (although not herself a member of the
Society – she came as Kashkanun's guest). The waiter does not
know what they discussed over dinner and drinks; waiters at the
Travellers' Aid Society do not eavesdrop on conversations and he
is too discrete to mention anything overheard by chance. If asked
about Grant, he will mention he knows him but has never seen him
in the company of Kashkanun.
•  The bartender comments Grant was in the bar the previous night
in the company of an attractive young woman – not a member and
thus Grant's guest. They sat at a secluded table, a fact which did
not surprise the bartender. He knows the woman by sight as an
employee of the municipal police and if she were seen in public
with a member of the Solomani Party, it might mean her job.

General Rumors
The following rumors may be encountered by anyone with a
successful Average (8+) Investigate or Streetwise check:
•  A captain in the Intanevaci Army speculates the Imperials must be
very concerned with the open existence of the Solomani Party in
his country but they cannot do anything about it. The home rule
provisions of the Imperial Charter for the world clearly prohibit
interference in internal affairs and as long as the Solomani stay
within the law, the hands of the Imperium are tied. The captain is
not a Solomani sympathiser but he does not care much for the
Imperium either. Their powerlessness makes him feel smug.
•  A man in a bar orders a round of drinks for the house and then
loudly offers a toast to the anti-redemptionists. Several others
join him, others throw their drinks at him and a general free-for-
all ensues. Questioning of locals reveals the anti-redemptionists
are a local political movement opposed to an immediate demand
for payment on large amounts of Imperial war bonds held by the
Intanevaci government since the Solomani Rim War.
•  A private in the Intanevaci Army has just returned from duty on the
southern border with the nation of Malbak and he says there have
been occasional border incidents, although he does not know why.
A friend of his was wounded and he is glad to be back in the capital
where it is safe.
•  The planet Janosz is truly balkanised. Not only are there 32
sovereign states on the planet, but only 29 are officially members
of the Imperium, with the three others autonomous. One of
these, Cloralie, maintains its tenuous hold on independence by
rigidly suppressing any sign of the Solomani movement within
its borders, thus avoiding any Imperial charge that they are
harbouring rebels.

THE SQUEEZE
The Travellers are not the only ones interested in Kashkanun's villa
and word will leak back to those who have an interest in keeping them
away. As a result, the following two events will happen, the first should
happen on the second or third day and the second should take place a
day or two later.

Part One
While collecting information, it is likely the group will become split up
in order to maximise their use of time. When they do so, one of these
splinter groups, the smallest and ideally consisting of just one person,
will be intercepted by several thugs. The thugs will beat up the Traveller
or group of Travellers they find and the head thug will warn them, 'Get

off this case and stop asking about Kashkanun. There is more to this
than you think, and there are bigger people in it than you will ever be,
so clear out or you will get squashed.' The third street rumor should
not be given to the Travellers until after this incident.

Part Two
If the Travellers persists in their investigation, they will be ambushed by
the thugs. All of the thugs are this time armed with autopistols (3D-3)
and will have surprise (DM+1). After the first round of gunfire, however,
a bright flash of light will literally burn them from behind. The two men
who burned them will show themselves briefly to check the bodies and
then leave. These unknown protectors are armed with FGHP-15s (see
Central Supply Catalogue, page 124) and it is advised not to attempt to
steal the guns from them.

COURSES OF ACTION
After they have gained some idea of what is going on, the Travellers
may want to consider their many options. The following are several of
the possibilities available.

Run
Yes, the Travellers can do this but should be discouraged from flight
for several reasons. First, they have accepted the deal from Grant and
he is likely to be very upset if they just vanish. He will attempt to track
them down and get revenge for having spoiled his plan. Secondly, the
Travellers still need funds to save their ship and running now would
mean giving it up, resulting in a considerable financial loss.

**Go to Imperial Intelligence**
This course of action will be largely fruitless, as the local duty officer
will express no interest in their story and even show some hostility to
the group. His excuse is that nothing in their story actually indicates
any threat to Imperial security and does not justify any action on his
department's part in the group's behalf. In any event, he has no real
jurisdiction in the matter. He seems to soften toward the end of the
conversation and offers some friendly advice: it would be a bad idea
to go to the police with their story, as the local police are notoriously
corrupt. That is not to say the Travellers could bribe them; quite the
contrary. The police are almost totally owned by various local criminal
elements, probably including the people who are after the Travellers.

While leaving Imperial Intelligence Headquarters, the group catches
sight of the two men who killed the thugs. They are seen briefly through
an open office door, where they are engaged in what seems to be
routine paperwork. If the second part of the squeeze comes after the
visit to the Imperial Intelligence, the two men will be remembered and
recognized by the Traveller with the highest intelligence.

Go to the Police
The police are not corrupt and the advice of the intelligence chief was
deliberate misdirection. The chief of detectives will talk to the Travellers
and listen to their story with interest, although he will not be very
sympathetic. After all, he is a police officer and the group is already
guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary at the very least. A reaction roll
will be in order here as a general guide to the detective's behaviour
but extreme reactions will be tempered by either his natural distrust of
criminals or his natural curiosity to find out what is going on.

The most likely outcome of the meeting will be the offer of a deal. The
detective can easily prosecute them for their crimes thus far and that
would be the end of their ship. He instead may choose to offer them
amnesty from prosecution in return for unravelling the mystery. Who
is after what and why? If the deal is offered, he will tell them what he
knows. Grant has leaked to the police the date of their planned break-
in to Kashkanun's villa and the police are planning to seize them when
they leave, hoping to get both them and the documents, which the
police hope will somehow incriminate Kashkanun.

They do not at present have sufficient grounds for obtaining a search
warrant but the documents would become viable evidence if seized
in the course of an arrest. The detective feels, however, there is more
to it than that and the Travellers' story confirms this. Why would Grant
turn them in?

Alter the Plan
The group may decide to conduct the break-in earlier than specified
by Grant. If so, this will spoil Grant's plan and make him very upset,
and this should be pointed out to the group. Grant was adamant
about knowing every detail of the plan and there is the possibility he
will refuse to pay if it is deviated from. The Travellers may carry this
out anyway and use the documents to extort the money from Grant
and from his employer Samuelson. This would be a very dangerous
course of action but possible to pull off if done carefully. They would,
however, accumulate several powerful enemies, which might provide
the background for future adventures.

Grill Kashkanun
Once they have broken into the villa, they may question Kashkanun.
Under pressure, he will break quickly and tell all he knows.
Specifically, he will tell his background (petty mobster), that he
was hired by Laura Chin to burglarise the archives and obtain the
documents proving Samuelson's ancestry, and then double-crossed
Chin by using them to blackmail Samuelson instead of turning them
over to Chin as agreed. Kashkanun also knows enough about the ins
and outs of the Solomani Party to know Zimmerman is dependent
on Grant for his anagathics. This may be why he has sided with
Samuelson on the committee but he is certain even Samuelson
does not have the money to buy the needed drugs. Only Grant does,
although where he gets his money is a mystery.

Check up on Grant
Careful searches of public records indicate Grant has a personal history
leading back only 10 years. Beyond that, no records exist. For the last
10 years he has led an unspectacular life, gradually rising in the ranks
of the party bureaucracy.

**Track Down the Thugs**
If the Travellers return to the bar where they encountered the marine
sergeant major of marine rumor one, there is a chance he will again
be present and this time in the company of his two friends. One of them
will be recognizable as the head thug. If this takes place after part two
of the squeeze, only one of his friends will be with him (the other being
dead) and they will both be depressed.

Both of the ex-marines are in the employ of Laura Chin and can be
made to talk either through threats, bribery or actual physical violence,
depending on their reaction rolls and responses to bribes. They will
eventually admit they are in the employ of Laura Chin and that she has
received information about their planned break-in at Kashkanun's villa.
She plans to be waiting for them with several other thugs and to take
the documents from them.

Go to Laura Chin
Laura Chin is interested primarily in recovering the documents from
Kashkanun intact and may be willing to make a deal with the Travellers,
although she has already been burned once and will be mistrustful. Her
main desire is that they stay clear of the whole thing, although some
of the information they have gathered may prove interesting to her
and may make her sufficiently grateful to offer them both money and
protection from Grant.

Deal Directly with Samuelson
There is no direct link with Samuelson but Kashkanun can make contact
and may be willing to make a deal. Part of the money would be better
than none. Samuelson may be willing to deal with the Travellers directly
if by that time they have figured out Grant is an Imperial agent and can
convince Samuelson of the facts. Samuelson will then pay the group the
MCr1 in return for the documents and demand other documents be put in
their place in Kashkanun's safe. When the police do arrive and search on
the basis of a tip that there is a burglary in progress the documents they
recover will embarrass the Imperium somehow.

REFEREE INFORMATION
The nation of Intanevac on the planet Janosz is a representative
democracy committed to freedom of political expression. Thus, the
Solomani Party is a legitimate and open political movement in the
nation, although generally not a highly respected one. The party
has something of a reputation for rough tactics and is believed to be
involved in activities supporting covert operations elsewhere, although
there is no proof of this. Due to the nature of the Imperial Charter's
home rule provisions, the Imperium cannot intervene to suppress the
Solomani Party on Intanevac unless they actively engage in treason
or in the event of a declared Imperial emergency. Neither of these
conditions is present at the moment.

The hierarchy of the Solomani Party is at present involved in a
power struggle. There are three members in a position of power on
the Steering Committee: Arlan Samuelson, Laura Chin and Cedric
Zimmerman. Samuelson is the leader of the hard-liners and controls
six of the 13 seats on the committee. Laura Chin, a moderate,
controls five seats. The remaining two seats are controlled by
Zimmerman, an independent. Although holding the fewest number of
seats, Zimmerman controls the swing votes in any power struggle and
has recently sided with Samuelson. This makes Samuelson the clear
party leader and moves have been initiated to squeeze Laura Chin
completely out of the party leadership.

Several weeks before the Travellers arrived on planet, Laura Chin
received word there might be irregularities in the genealogy of her chief
rival, Samuelson. Desperate for anything that might give her an edge
in the upcoming struggle, she contacted Kashkanun, a local racketeer.
Kashkanun agreed, for a fee, to arrange a break-in at the state archives
in order to obtain the documents that would prove the irregularities.
These documents are not normally available to the public as they are
considered to be personal and privileged information. For a man with
Kashkanun's connections, the break-in and theft were easy.

The documents did prove that Arlan Samuelson's maternal
grandmother was, in fact, Vilani. This had previously escaped notice
as she bore a Solomani name; she had been adopted during infancy
by Solomani parents. No special note was taken of her race as most
people, even this close to the center of Solomani political strength,
simply do not care much one way or another. Kashkanun, himself
mostly Vilani, found the documents amusing and decided to make
some additional money on the side at the expense of the Solomani
Party fanatics. Instead of turning the documents over to Laura Chin as
promised, he used them to blackmail Samuelson. It was an effective
blackmail ploy, as their publication would ruin Samuelson's position
in the party hierarchy. Laura Chin was naturally enraged, as it was
necessary to her own political survival that she obtain the documents
and use them to drive Samuelson from the Steering Committee, thus
seizing control of the party for herself.

Jason Grant, Samuelson's administrative assistant, then entered
the scene with a plan to save Samuelson. He would hire a group of
adventurers to steal the documents back from Kashkanun and they
would then be destroyed. Obtaining the exact documents would
allow replacements to be forged and the information on Samuelson's
grandmother's birth certificate would enable all additional documents
relating to her to be traced and altered. In fact. Grant's plan was much
more subtle, for Grant is an agent for Imperial Intelligence, planted in
Intanevac 10 years previously in order to infiltrate the Solomani Party
power structure. The appearance of these documents provided him
with a unique opportunity to seize control of the entire party apparatus.

While Grant worked for Samuelson, he hardly controlled him and his
influence over actual party decision-making was very limited. Grant did,
however, control Zimmerman. Zimmerman is actually a very old man,
his life prolonged through nearly constant use of anagathics. On Janosz,
anagathics are ruinously expensive and clearly beyond Zimmerman's
means. Grant, using Imperial funds, supplies Zimmerman with the
needed anagathics and thus wields nearly absolute influence over him.

Up until this point, Grant had used that control to cause Zimmerman to
support Samuelson on the Steering Committee and thus make Grant
indispensable to Samuelson. Now his plan went further.

When Grant made the arrangements with the Travellers, he demanded
to know all of the details of the plan, including its date and time,
ostensibly to check to make sure it is feasible. Actually, Grant leaked
the date and time of the break-in to Laura Chin and also to the police.
Chin and her hirelings would be waiting for the group as they left the
villa and would attempt to relieve them of the documents.

A gun fight would probably ensue and at that point the police would
arrive and arrest everyone in sight. The contents of the documents would
certainly become public, ruining Samuelson, and the criminal notoriety
Chin would receive would probably ruin her as well. Thus, the way would
be open for Zimmerman to step into the party leadership. Grant, controlling
his anagathics, would then be the power behind Zimmerman and able
to closely control his policies. The Imperium would, in effect, control its
most serious political rival in the nation. Laura Chin was anxious that
the activities of the Travellers would not interfere with her own efforts to
recover the documents and thus began putting pressure on them to back
off. When this failed, she tried to have them killed. But since their part in
the plan was essential to Grant's overall plot, two Imperial Intelligence
operatives had been assigned to follow them and to guard them against
just such an attack. It is they who killed the four thugs.

Advanced Education
**By Matthew Sprange**

Successful graduation in a university or military academy gives
Travellers a chance to enter advanced education in a highly prestigious
flight or medical school. These choices are for Travellers determined
to dedicate their lives to becoming a pilot (of aircraft or spacecraft) or
doctor respectively. This requires another four year term but ensures
the Traveller is highly specialized with automatic entry to the career of
their choosing should they be successful.

FLIGHT SCHOOL
For both air forces and space navies there exist flight schools designed
to produce the very best pilots. The most famous of these cater to
fighter pilots of agile aircraft and small space-going craft but no less
important are the schools that concentrate on the deft skills needed to
maneuver the largest warships.

Entry: EDU 8+
DM+1 if DEX 9+
DM+2 if graduated university or military academy with honors

Skills: Gain Admin 0, Science (any) 1 and either Flyer (any) or Pilot (any) 1

Graduation: INT 8+. If 10+ is rolled, graduate with honors.

**Graduation Benefits**
•  Gain two more levels to either Flyer or Pilot (any); these two levels
must be put into different specialities.
•  Graduation grants automatic enlistment to the Navy (line/crew
or flight) if the Traveller has at least one Pilot skill, or the Army
(cavalry) if the Traveller has at least one Flyer skill, with an
automatic commission before the career's first term, allowing
the Traveller to start at officer rank 1. Graduating with honors
increases this to officer rank 2.

MEDICAL SCHOOL
There is more than one route to becoming a doctor, be it specialist or
researcher, but the very best tend to be those who graduate from a
respected medical school. Successful graduation at medical school will
guarantee a high-flying career.

Entry: EDU 8+
DM+1 if INT 9+
DM+2 if graduated university or military academy with honors

Skills: Admin 0, Medic 1, Science (any) 1

Graduation: INT 8+. If 10+ is rolled, graduate with honors.

**Graduation Benefits**
•  Gain Medic 2 and two more levels to Science (any); these two levels
may be put into a single Science skill or split between two Sciences.
•  Increase EDU by +1.
•  Graduation grants automatic enlistment to any military career (if
the Traveller went to a military academy, this must be the same
career the academy is tied to). Graduating with honors grants
an automatic commission before the military career's first term,
allowing the Traveller to start at officer rank 1.
•  Graduation grants automatic enlistment to the Scholar career,
starting at rank 1. Graduating with honors means the Traveller will
start at rank 2.
