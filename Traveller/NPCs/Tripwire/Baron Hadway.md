 BARON EDWARD  HADWAY is a middle aged man with short hair greying at the sides. He wears a finely tailored suit and is rarely seen without a fat cigar (although he rarely lights it). In his day, the baron used to be a proficient fencer but his blade has been hung on the wall for many years now.

The baron has the look of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and from his own perspective that is exactly how he feels. Baron Hadway's failure weighs heavy on his mind, making him miserable and stressed. He is close to having his title stripped and his status removed, leaving him at a loss as to what to do.
