# The Rogue

The Rogue was initially thought to be a deep-space comet. Countless such objects exist in the gaps between the stars, though these areas are so enormous that the chances of finding one are very small. With no emissions to detect and no starlight reflected from their surface, interstellar comets can only be detected by advanced instruments unless a ship somehow happens to jump in close to one. The chances of this occurring are vanishingly small, despite the number of vid dramas where a distressed ship manages to find fuel in the form of ice from a handy comet.




Yet somehow, the Rogue did come to the attention of interstellar explorers. This was almost certainly by chance, probably whilst scanning deep space for some entirely different purpose. The object was marked on a chart and forgotten about other than a footnote that its infra-red signature was marginally above what would be expected from such an object. The difference was just slightly more than would normally be accepted for observational or instrumentational error, but it was not for some time that a follow-up survey charted the Rogue a second time.

This survey provoked some interest, as the comet was not quite where expected. After tracking it for a while, scientists concurred that its motion was anomalous; the object did not seem to be under power but was following what appeared to be a changing vector. Initially this was assumed to be due to gravitational effects, but a detailed model of the local area made this seem highly unlikely. With so many other projects at hand, many of them of more immediate benefit, it was some time before scientists undertook a mission to visit the object in deep space. The fate of that expedition, and the rescue attempt that followed it, remain unknown.

Jumping into deep space is always risky. Calculating a precise emergence point is never easy, and with no local frame of reference a jump can be out by a sufficient margin that the vessel cannot reach its target. However,


the research ship and the rescue vessel sent after it would certainly have carried enough fuel to make a second jump to safety. Neither returned, and a third mission has so far not materialised.


Various theories have been put forward about the Rogue. It may be under the gravitational influence of some undetected object, and if so is probably nothing more than a big comet. It could be a sublight starship from some long-dead civilisation, making the tiniest of course corrections using the last of its power. Wilder theories include the idea that it is a star-creature or a giant superweapon left over from some ancient war. What is known is that the Rogueâ€™s changing course seems to be turning it towards a cluster of heavily inhabited systems. This is more than likely coincidence, and in any case it will be millennia before it reaches any of them unless it begins to accelerate.


According to a recent scientific paper, the object is indeed moving slightly faster than predicted. The change in velocity is just at the outer limit of observational error, and might be nothing more than a figment of long-range instrumentation. But there are those who are adamant that the Rogue is changing course and accelerating towards an inhabited area, and that it has already killed two ships full of people sent to investigate it. Naturally
(to them) this proves that the Rogue is a planet-killing superweapon. This seems rather unlikely, but the truth might be even stranger.
