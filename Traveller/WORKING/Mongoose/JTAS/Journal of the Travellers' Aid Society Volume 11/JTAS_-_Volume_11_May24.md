##### Colonising the Tijian Expanse

By Adrian Tymes and Sabrina Westerman

The rimward portion of the Datsatl sector holds many worlds that Tiji,
ruler of the Tijian Khaganate, has long coveted. The Pirian Domain had
set up a thick line of outposts to keep him from these worlds but Tiji
found a way around them; the Steppehauler class of freighters able to
jump 10 parsecs at once (see The Journal of the Travellers’ Aid Society
Volume 6). As the Empress Wave passed through Datsatl wreaking
havoc, Tiji prepared.

In 1048, once the Empress Wave had done its damage to the
Khaganate and was working through Pirian worlds, Tiji began launching
his freighters to hop right over the Pirian blockade and establish
colonies, so the worlds would be his before the Pirians could react.
He named this new area the Tijian Expanse. Officially, these were to
be mining colonies, providing ore and raw materials to fuel the Tijian
Khaganate’s rebuilding efforts. In truth, Tiji wished to establish an
inhabited zone as a de facto barrier against potential colonization by
the Zhodani Consulate.

These rules let Referees and Travellers establish one of these colonies,
whether to play out the colony itself or to establish a home base which
Travellers might call home and travel to assist. The focus is on the early
years of the colony, while it has not yet reached 1,000,000 people.

PREMADE OR CUSTOM WORLD?
To begin modelling a colony, the first step is to select a world. There are
two ways to do this.

First, there exists a map of Charted Space that you can access at
<https://travellermap.com/>. On that map, find the Datsatl sector and
the Tijian Expanse within it. Pick any of the systems and remove the
colony: set the Starport to X and the Population, Government, Law
and Technology Level to 0. The model begins as colonists are first
introduced to the world.

The other method is to create a world. Refer to the World Creation
procedures beginning on page 248 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.
Select a Size, Atmosphere and Hydrographics (making sure to select
valid values: Size 0 asteroid worlds can only have Atmosphere 0 and
Hydrographics 0, while Size 9 would roll 2D-7+9 for Atmosphere, which
has a minimum result of 4). Leave the remaining components as 0
(or X for Starport) for now; as in the first method, the model begins as
colonists are first introduced to the world. Decide where in the Tijian
Expanse this world exists.

Either way, when choosing a world, there are two main factors of interest.

First, how habitable is the world as determined by its Size, Atmosphere
and Hydrographics? Where challenge is desired, select a degree of
inhospitality appropriate to the challenge. Where a more enjoyable
game would be had by starting with a garden world (such as with a
UWP of X-866000-0), use that instead.

Second, how far away is this world from the Pirian Domain? All worlds
in the Tijian Expanse are within 10 parsecs of the Expanse’s capital
of Buudal, so they are all tied into the Tijian supply chain. The Pirian
Domain offers an alternate market but also a source of potential
raiders. Some worlds are three parsecs away from the nearest Pirian
worlds, offering easy access for traders and raiders. Worlds up to nine
parsecs away may still see some traffic. Beyond nine parsecs there is
no realistic chance of Pirian contact.

Once the world is selected, a location on the world must be selected. It is
not necessary to map the entire world; only the colony and its immediate
surroundings are likely to be of interest before the colony reaches
1,000,000 people. Instead, focus on creating maps of the colony site (see
deckplan guidelines in High Guard). The colony should be located near
a minable source of at least 200,000 tons of common ore such as iron
or copper. If Hydrographics is at least 8, this source may be underwater.
Further surveying will need to be done to locate sources of uncommon
ores, crystals, gems or radioactive material.

If the world has Hydrographics 2+, the colony will also be located
near a convenient source of water, possibly ice. If the world has
Hydrographics 0 or 1, one or more large ice asteroids will have been
landed near the colony site, roughly 250,000 tons worth, enough to last
the initial colonists a bit more than two years.

If the world’s Atmosphere is Thin (5) or Dense (8), the colony will be
located in highlands or lowlands respectively, to provide a local equivalent
of Standard (6). If the world’s Atmosphere is other than Thin (5), Standard
(6) or Dense (8), an atmosphere dome will be provided so the colony itself
is in Standard (6) Atmosphere. If the world’s Atmosphere is at least 4 but
no more than 9 and Hydrographics is at least 1, it may have grasses, trees
and fauna up to insects, otherwise the world has no biosphere.

The only known native sophonts in the Datsatl sector went extinct
thousands of years ago. Their graveyard worlds form the spinward
edge of the Tijian Expanse.

STARTING EQUIPMENT
A vital set of choices that often determines whether a colony survives
its first year or dies out and gets replaced, is the selection of equipment
a colony starts with. Two Steppehaulers with four 500-ton modules
will be sent to establish the colony: a low berth module, a downport
module, a habitation module and a cargo module.

Those who wish to draw maps of the colony should start here. The
modules are slightly flattened half-cylinders 138 meters long by 18
meters wide by six meters high. Three of the modules will be left behind
when the Steppehaulers depart, forming the initial colony.

The Steppehaulers will take the low berth module with them once the
colony is set up, leaving behind the 988 colonists it carries. Medics will
be woken first, followed by those who will unpack and set up the other
three modules and, if needed, the atmosphere dome. In most cases
one quarter to half of the colonists will be children, elderly or otherwise
unable to meaningfully contribute to a colony’s initial workforce, who
are revived last for this reason.

Refer to The Journal of the Travellers’ Aid Society Volume 6 (page 9)
for the downport module’s statistics. This module forms the colony’s
initial headquarters. Most functions are intended to eventually be
replaced with more advanced, locally constructed buildings. The
internal fuel tank contains enough fuel for a Steppehauler and the
workshops are TL13, specialized in maintaining the downport itself.
They can be adjusted to support other high-tech gear as a fallback but
this is intended as a last resort.

The crew consists of one captain, three sensor operators, three medics,
two astronomers, five police, two mechanics, one steward and one
judge. Many of these will either be Travellers or important characters,
which ones depending on the campaign.

If the downport module is the colony’s brains and stomach, the
habitation module is the colony’s heart and lungs. It is a collapsed
habitat able to provide the equivalent of single occupancy staterooms
for all 988 colonists, once expanded fully. The habitat provides light,
heat and sealed life support, regardless of whether the world is
believed to be habitable. It also contains 100 tons of TL8 agricultural
manufacturing plant, which can produce enough food for 1,000 people
per day if worked by 10 people. A 50-ton smelter allows processing of
10 tons of ore into 5 tons of raw materials per day. Another 150 tons of
TL8 workshops allows 50 mechanics to cobble together small tools and
parts from those raw materials.

This all consumes 800 Power, which is provided in one of two ways by
the third module’s remaining contents.

Primary power comes from eight tons of solar panels. As a backup, 80
tons of TL8 fusion provides the same 800 Power, to be switched on
when the solar panels are not running. Regardless of which mode is
running, the power systems occupy another two engineers. 16 tons of
internal fuel tank carries enough fuel to run the fusion plant for eight
weeks. In a pinch, the downport is constructed separately from the
habitation module, able to power the agricultural manufacturing plant
and keep the colony fed while the colony either repairs the solar panels
or waits until evacuation can be arranged.

Most of the cargo module’s contents are selected at the colony leaders’
discretion. It is to be completely emptied once the colony is established,
then filled with 500 tons of ore.

If the world’s Atmosphere is other than Thin (5), Standard (6) or
Dense (8), a set of transparent panels will be provided that deploy
to form an atmosphere dome roughly 30 meters by 300 meters by
300 meters, taking up 200 tons of the cargo module when packaged
away. It will include an airlock sized to fit one Steppehauler, as well as
smaller airlocks to admit grav vehicles and people in environmental
suits. If an ice asteroid had to be provided due to low Hydrographics,
refrigerated storage will be provided, taking 20 tons when collapsed.
If both are provided, the storage section is attached but outside the
dome when deployed.

The rest of the cargo module is intended to be filled with drones, tools
and supplies to establish the colony. A typical loadout starts with 100
tons of vanities and personal goods, 100 tons Ajilchin, 2 tons for 125
tripod-mounted laser drills and 48 tons of air/rafts (10 personnel and
2 cargo). Prospective colony leaders must submit a list of equipment
with their proposal, which will be reviewed. A list that includes no
mining equipment is automatically rejected. The list is technically
limited by tonnage but equipment that costs too many megacredits will
also be rejected, since the Tijian Khaganate is paying for all of this.

The typical single big-ticket item is usually an Ajilchin (‘Worker’)
class ship, which can prospect, mine and carry a message to Buudal
if needed. It will require spare parts that the colony will not be able
to manufacture right away, so it is typical to also request one ton of
spare parts, enough to maintain an Ajilchin for three years. By the time
these spare parts run out, the colony should be established enough
to purchase or build more. No docking space need be provided in the
cargo manifest; the ship will be buried among other goods and must be
dug out before use.

THE FIRST RETURN
One to six months after a colony is established, it is expected to provide
its first shipment of ore. The length is negotiated depending on how
easy it is expected to be to establish the colony. Some overzealous
colony leaders swear they can gather 500 tons of ore in far less than
a month, only to discover the other difficulties of establishing a colony.
On the appointed week, a Steppehauler will show up with one cargo
module and one fuel module. One of three things will happen:

If the colony cannot provide the requisite 142 tons to refuel the
Steppehauler, the ship will use its reserves to hop back and report the
colony as a failure. Within two months, another Steppehauler will arrive
to take everyone back to the Tijian Khaganate.

If the colony provides the fuel but does not have 500 tons of ore ready
to go, the Steppehauler captain will negotiate a new estimated time,
at which time another Steppehauler will come to collect the ore. The
Khaganate will be officially disappointed but understanding.

In the case of the colony providing both fuel and ore, the ore is loaded
into the original cargo module. This will be swapped for the empty
cargo module on the Steppehauler, which leaves with the token cargo
and registers the colony as having officially begun. At this point the
colony can place orders for upgrades, purchased with further ore and
raw materials.

GOALS AND UPGRADES
Officially, the colonies of the Tijian Expanse are mining colonies, with an
informal friendly competition to reach 1,000,000 people. In truth, their
job is to survive and grow, to establish populations that cannot easily be
swept aside once the Zhodani to rimward learn of them, which Tiji and
his advisors know will happen within a century. Thus, Tiji is generous
toward mining failures but intolerant of failures to survive and expand.

Colonies are supplied using a ‘company store’ system, measured in
units of 500-ton containers of common ore. In a normal market these
would be worth about MCr0.5. In this case, goods are transported in
500-ton modules via Steppehaulers, so it is more convenient for the
Tijians to track in terms of container modules.

Only six types of goods are accepted from the colonies:
- 500 tons of common ore is worth 1 container.
- 500 tons of uncommon ore or common raw materials is worth 5
containers.
- 500 tons of uncommon raw materials or crystals and gems is worth
20 containers.
- 500 tons of radioactive materials is worth 1,000 containers.

Each container sent back to the Tijian Expanse adds to the colony’s
credit. While there are several Steppehaulers available, a colony
producing 10 or more containers per month is expected to eventually
construct its own transport ships. Any colony with a positive credit
balance can send a message requesting a purchase using the colony’s
credit, taking D3 months. To reflect a more mercantile Tijian Khaganate,
double or triple the prices. Any manufactured goods not on the list may
be purchased in lots of 500 tons, at a cost in containers equal to the
cost in megacredits times two, rounded up.

A second downport may not be purchased. The downport is intended

tantamount to splitting the colony, which Tiji disapproves of.

RESOURCES AND MAINTENANCE
The main resources that a new colony focuses on gathering are food,
minerals and power, in order to grow the colony and maintain a foothold
on their part of the Tijian Expanse.

Traditional open-field agriculture is seen as inefficient for colonies below
1,000,000 people. Many colonists even prefer manufactured foods,
having grown up with indoor vertical farms, vast greenhouses and other
such infrastructure. Few workers are needed to maintain and run the
plants, as they are aided by drones and automated facilities. Every
standard habitation module includes an agricultural manufacturing
plant large enough that 10 workers can produce enough food for 1,
people per day.

One of the first jobs assigned past general survival and running of the
colony is the gathering of minerals for the general payment and upkeep
of the colony. The rules for Belt Mining (High Guard, pages 73–80) are
a close enough approximation of planetside prospecting and mining
treating the planet as N zone.

Initial power comes from the solar power modules that come standard
in the third module sent with the colonists. Whilst this provides for initial
set up, once established the colony should source alternative methods
of producing power. Infrastructure may be constructed using the same
specifications as solar panels (High Guard, page 36).

Unfortunately, maintenance issues arise with the general wear and tear
on buildings. Due to the high-quality equipment the colonists depend
on daily to survive this unfamiliar environment, the usual maintenance
costs are calculated at the same rate as maintaining a starship.

POPULATION GROWTH
As mentioned above, a primary goal of any Expanse colony is to grow.
A Steppehauler brings in colonists 988 at a time, in a low berth module.
A colony may request more colonists at any time, typically accompanied

by a request for a new habitation module for said colonists. There
must also be evidence that at least a quarter of the colonists will have
something to do within a month of arrival and that at least 90% of the
current colonists are employed, with training and education counting as
‘employment’ for this purpose.

Alternatively, immigrants can be recruited directly from the Pirian
Domain or the Yaskoydri Technocracy. Results are highly variable but
rarely obtain more than 10,000 colonists per attempt, mainly because
colony ships larger than that are rare. Generally, these efforts start
by obtaining a ship with many low berths, then bringing it to the world
targeted for recruitment. The ship should linger for no more than a
month, since any longer risks inviting enforcement actions.

Immigration can boost a small colony toward 100,000 people but that is
well short of the 1,000,000 goal many hold. Natural births, on average,
increase a colony’s population by one percent per year. A common
solution to grow faster is cloning.

Cloning is a well-established technology in the Tijian Khaganate, no
matter what reservations other polities in the region may have. In the
wake of the Empress Wave, cloning technology is only available from
the capital world Tijia, so colonies requesting their own cloning tanks
must have exceptionally good justification. A population of 10,000 is
the absolute minimum, while a population of at least 100,000 makes
justifying tanks easier.

Cloning tanks are a specialized form of metabolic chamber that starts
with a genetic sample and a known maturation sequence. The tank
runs this sequence on fast-forward in a process known as ‘forced
growth’, printing cells and simulating the known effects of hormones at
various stages of life, taking one week per year of life. For sophonts,
this includes neural development, so a cloned adult human produced
will know how to walk and talk.

Artificial wombs are a more widely available but lesser form of cloning
tanks. Artificial wombs only replicate the natural gestation process,
allowing children to be born without temporarily removing a sophont from
the labour force. They take the normal amount of time for the species
being made. Raising the child after birth still requires sophont labour.

Most child raising tasks are grouped under the Steward skill. A full-time
parent is able to simultaneously raise two children per level of Steward
skill, while a part time parent can contribute half of this. This is usually
provided in groups; a teacher, a nursery worker and a nutritionist
with Steward-1 would have different foci for their Steward skills, each
providing their specialty for each other’s children. If they were each
partnered with someone with another job to provide resources for the
families but also having Steward-1 and contributing part time, these six
people would collectively be able to raise nine children at once.

Forced growth clones age faster than those born and raised in a more
traditional manner. They suffer DM-2 on aging checks but can resolve
this through the use of anagathics. Clones born of artificial wombs do
not have this penalty. The Cloning Tanks table shows the tank tonnage
needed per child raised, as well as power, crew and cost per ton. Non-
humans can be made at a rate equal to their average adult mass, in kg,
divided by 70 (an average adult human).

POLITICS AND CRIME
A good colony leader must have the support of the colonists, whilst
maintaining and executing an almost dictatorial authority. Whilst the
colony leader does have full authority over the operations of the colony,
a leader who loses the support of the colony is quickly ejected from
office (perhaps even the colony itself) and a new one is chosen.

Due to the measures needed for a colony to survive and grow, there
are few choices to deal with lawbreakers. A colony cannot afford long
term incarceration and thus turns toward more productive methods
including re-education, rehabilitation or removal of the offender from the
colony. For violent crimes, the offender can also be ‘recycled’. This is a
manner of execution following which the offender’s body parts may be
reused to benefit the colony. Visiting non-colonists who break the laws
of the colony may be removed from the colony or ‘recycled’.

TRADE AND MILITARY
Trade is a complex operation, illegal for any colony to perform with
parties outside of Tijian space. Thankfully, trading is not heavily policed.
Location is key; only colonies near the Pirian border are able to trade
with the Pirians. Due to the distance between the Expanse and the
nearest Pirian worlds, trade requires jump-3 ships or hauling extra fuel
in a jump-2 ship.

Trade brings in actual credit value, as opposed to Tijian container
credit. It is the only way to purchase goods not available from Tijia and
can be a faster way to obtain goods at less cost. The Pirians have laws

against selling weapons and warships to Tijian parties but there are
multiple low Law Level Pirian worlds in the Datsatl sector where such
goods can be obtained.

Trade also invites piracy and raiders. For any colony that insists on trading
with the Pirians, it is advisable that a military presence is established
ahead of time. Some partake in ‘pilgrimage trade’, where a ship makes four
or more jumps in order to trade before returning. All colonists are warned
extensively against making any expeditions rimward. There is nothing for
a few jumps in that direction but there are horror stories about a species
beyond the sector border who use mind control, that the Tijian Khaganate
does not wish to disturb under any circumstances.

When piracy does happen, it starts with a Pirian scout ship jumping into the
system, getting as close to the colony as it dares, taking detailed scans and
leaving. Within a few months, if the colony is not heavily armed, a small fleet
will arrive. The freighters will carry collapsible fuel tanks with enough spare
fuel for the entire fleet, so it can jump away without refuelling in the colony’s
system. The transports will attempt to force their way into the colony and
disgorge troops, who will seize the highest value cargoes they can quickly
identify. The troops will not be needlessly destructive, mostly ignoring anyone
who does not resist. Once the freighters are full, the raiding party will leave.

The Pirians, if contacted, will either claim no knowledge or claim it was
an enforcement action against illegal colonization. Regardless, the
objective is loot and raids will continue until the plunder runs out or
sufficient defences are installed.

CAMPAIGN OPTIONS
There are two main ways to use this content in a Traveller campaign.

The first is to use these to simulate a growing colony, providing the
backdrop for planetary adventures. Using the rules as written and
typical starting equipment, four shifts of 50 miners, 10 transport air/raft
pilots and 2 cargo air/raft pilots can mine a combined average of 200
tons of ore per day, including downtime from incidents, if everything
goes okay. Things not going okay is a common basis for adventures.
A large gas eruption may injure hundreds of workers. The agricultural
plant could break down and the colony’s lone starship must travel to
beg for help. The colony may do suspiciously well and someone must
parley with investigators looking for signs of illegal Pirian ‘help’.

The alternative is to use the colony as a home base for a crew travelling
the Tijian Expanse. Options include visiting the Pirians, trading with
other colonies or engaging in pilgrimage trade. The Travellers may be
troubleshooters based in Buudal, sent to colonies to deal with arising
issues, such as searching for signs of Pirian trade. Options for this style
of play also provide Referees with the ability to call Travellers back to
‘defend their home’, if desired.

##### Ajilchin Prospector Ship

By Adrian Tymes

The Ajilchin (Worker) was designed in the 1040s, as Tiji’s plans to
colonize what would become the Tijian Expanse took shape. It became
evident the new colonies would need ships to carry mail, such as
if there was some disaster and the colonists needed rescue. This
emergency just-in-case need would not justify keeping a capable crew
trained and ready, so a secondary purpose was added: prospecting and
mining, in direct support of the colony’s official goals. The ship would
also have to fit within a Steppehauler’s cargo module (see Journal of
the Travellers’ Aid Society Volume 6), as that was the most practical
way to get a ship to the colonies.

It was not known at first whether Ajilchins would be primarily mining
vessels. The debate continued for a long while and it was only the
imminent Empress Wave that forced a compromise: Ajilchins would be
manufactured with turrets but without anything actually mounted to the
turrets. That way, colonies could either leave the turrets empty, purchase
laser drills or equip more serious weapons as needed. They could even
swap turret equipment if their needs evolved. As it turned out, most
Ajilchins were used for prospecting and mail only, with other colonial
assets better able to perform the actual mining, thus leaving their turrets
empty or with small weapons equipped for self-defence. The model
presented here is for a weaponless Ajilchin fresh from the factory.

This multi-purpose nature extends to an Ajilchin’s mining drones. They
can mine but are often used as sensor extensions while prospecting,
as well as to load cargo. The primary ship entrance leads through the
hangar, leading a number of crew to enter and exit by hanging onto
a drone and letting it carry them between the ship and the ground
outside. Some crew make an art form out of how graceful this mode of
transit can seem, even dressing up themselves and the drones.

When mining, the intent is for the drones and/or laser drills up front to
blast ore loose, which flies to the side and away from the blasting area,
so it can be safely recovered and brought in through the top or rear.
The cargo bay opens like a bomb bay, in order to quickly dump a full
load of ore and get back to the mining site as soon as possible. Since
Ajilchins do not do much mining in practice, this feature is rarely used.
Instead, the cargo bay is often used for exercise, sometimes even

partially refitted as extra commons, with the mining drones being the
only way that cargo gets in or out. Collapsible fuel tanks are sometimes
fitted, to allow an Ajilchin to perform two jumps in a row and take a four-
parsec straight path before refuelling.

Crew accommodations are provided by a pair of staterooms, with open
space between them often pressed into service as a ship’s locker, with
a makeshift galley on the bridge. Double occupancy is expected; a crew
of four allows around-the-clock scanning, using six-hour shifts. The
applicant numbers for positions aboard Tijian Expanse Ajilchins easily
exceeds the number of positions available.

Early Ajilchins were often piloted by lone individuals but this was
eventually found to be inefficient. Due to the need for procreation
as well as prospecting on these colonies, as of 1105 a considerable
number of Ajilchin staterooms are set up to accommodate two sets of
married couples, with a bed sized for two instead of the usual bunk
bed arrangement. On a typical day, a married couple will take adjoining
six-hour shifts. Once one of the couples becomes pregnant, they work
for six further months, learning the skills to raise their future family while
not on shift.

Due to the lengths of time
the crew can be away from
their home colony, in many
cases unmarried crews tend to
comprise a specialized force
often seen as belonging more to
space than to their home colony.
Each colony with such crews
has come up with their own
name for these groups. One
famous example is the ‘Lonely
Nuggets Club’, who made
themselves popular on many
colony worlds by conducting
regular mail trips to Buudal.

One Ajilchin is normally
supplied to a starting colony.
A colony can purchase more
from the Tijian Khaganate and
colonies with multiple Ajilchins
often graduate from prospecting
to full system surveys.

##### Trista Galibaan, Skip Tracer

**By Geir Lanesskog**

Location: Any starport in The Beyond
**Required Skills:** Ship skills, at least Pilot and Astrogation
Reward: Up to half of a Cr500000 bounty

Mission: Recover the far trader Reginald’s Purse and return it to any
Class A or B starport

Summary: The Empress Marava-class far trader Reginald’s Purse,
registered and financed out of Collace in District 268 of the Spinward
Marches, has not made a mortgage payment in over two years. The First
Merchants Bank of Collace has declared the ship in forfeiture of its loan
and set a bounty of Cr500000 for its return to any authorized agency with
which it has a reciprocal agreement, basically any Class A or B starport
on Humaniti’s worlds of The Beyond, or MCr2 if it is returned to Collace,
which is at best seven jumps distance, at worst nearly 40.

Trista Galibaan is a registered skip tracer from Collace who believes
she has a good lead on the ship but lacks the skills to return it to an
authorized agency. She has traced the ship to a backwater system;
pick a nearby jump-2 accessible system three to five parsecs away with
a Class D or worse starport, at Tech Level less than 9 and Law Level
of less than 5 – Opar Nevis, Thaezdhugh, Aakumaska and about 20
others fit the bill. Her source tells her the ship is down for maintenance
and unlikely to lift for at least another month.

If the Travellers do not have a ship, Trista is willing to front them
middle passage to the world and back if necessary, although any such
expenses would be deducted from their share of the bounty, which she
will state to be one-third but be willing to settle for an equal split with
half to her and half to the Travellers.

Her equipment consists of a pocket computer/4 running Intrusion/3,
ballistic vest armor over a diplo vest-grade bodysuit (combined
Protection +7) and two Infiniti Arms weapons, a Model VII stunner
and an identical-looking Model XIII Stazer. She has TL14 enhanced
cybernetic eyes with infrared, ultraviolet, light application and peripheral
vision enhancements (Recon DM+1) tied to a TL14 neural comm and
HUD for her weapons.

Trista’s goal is to recover the ship. She does not care what happens
to the crew but states ‘there will be less trouble if we leave as little
mess as possible’.

REFEREE’S INFORMATION
1: All is as stated. Reginald’s Purse is still stuck at the frontier spaceport,
waiting on a part for its power plant. An engineer could rig a temporary
replacement on a Difficult Engineer check, although the power plant will
leak radiation (see Poor Maintenance, Traveller Core Rulebook, page
154) and the repair will fail after 1D days, requiring an Average (8+)
Engineer check (1Dx6 minutes), with life support failing if in space. Every
time it breaks, the fix will become one level more difficult. The part itself,
prepaid, will arrive at the port five days after the Trista and the Travellers,
or could be acquired at any Class C or above starport for 1D x Cr10000.
The ship has skipped six months of maintenance and has six quirks.

The four crew of Reginald’s Purse are tired of running and will surrender
their ship once one of them is incapacitated in a fight, assuming they
believe they would be spared and the Travellers would just take the ship
and leave them be. If threatened with arrest or death, they will reluctantly
but stubbornly resist until all but one are incapacitated. The ship is
armed with one double turret equipped with a beam laser but only the
sandcaster will function on auxiliary power and the turret will not rotate.

The crew are armed with rifles and shotguns and have TL10 vacc suits
(Protection +8) as armor, although they will generally just be wearing
jumpsuits unless confronted in hostile environment conditions. They
should be considered Average Combatants.

If the ship is returned as Trista has specified, both the banks and
Trista will live up to their end of the bargain. If the Travellers do not
have a ship, the bank offers to sell it to them for MCr15 with a 40-year
mortgage, no deposit. Payments amount to Cr78132 per month and the
bank will pursue them if they fail to pay.

2: As above but the ship is powered up and the part installed. The crew
is testing systems with the intention of leaving the next morning.

3: As 2 but the crew should be considered Experienced Combatants,
are armed with TL11 laser carbines and their jumpsuits are TL12 cloth
armor (Protection +4). They will fight on the ground or in space.

4: As 3 but the crew of Reginald’s Purse knowns Trista and the
Travellers are coming and have set an ambush. They wear both their
vacc suits and cloth (Protection +12) and the captain has the Tactics
(military) 1 skill and INT 9.

5: As 1 but Trista has no intention of splitting the reward. Although she
cannot fly the ship, she will try to kill the Travellers while in jumpspace
to their destination, issuing a mayday upon arrival and claiming, with
forged computer log entries, that the Travellers tried to kill her and take
the ship for themselves.

6: As 3 and 5.

Trista Galibaan is a dark-skinned muscular woman with a lace
of white and silver tattoos covering the left side of her face. The left
side of her scalp is shaved and a long braid constrains the hair on
her right. Her irises are an unnatural blue that reflect light in odd
ways. They are replacements for her damaged eyes, cybernetic
implants with infrared, ultraviolet, light amplification and peripheral
vision enhancements (Recon DM+1) tied to a TL14 neural comm
and a HUD for her weapons. Her grey bodysuit is the equivalent
of diplo vest armor and she wears a paramilitary ballistic vest flak
jacket festooned with pockets when expecting trouble (combined
Protection +7). She is always equipped with her neuro-linked pocket
computer/4, which among other things can run Intrusion/3 software.
She claims to avoid lethal weaponry but one of her two Infiniti Arms
Model VII stunners is a Model XIII Stazer.

Trista is not diplomatic. She speaks her mind clearly and to the
point, sometimes punctuated by expletives. Whilst she appears
to be a straightforward simple character to understand, she has
years of undercover experience and can pass even sophisticated
lie detectors. If pressed and feeling in control, she will state ‘It’s
easy for a sociopath to pass these things’ but never directly claims
to be a sociopath. She does have some concern for the opinion of
others and wonders if she really is a sociopath. So far, she has not
decided whether she is, or whether it matters.

Trista is an example of the adage ‘to catch a thief, you need a thief’.
Growing up on the lower levels of Collace’s arcologies, she fell into
a life of crime while still in her teens. Running guns and drugs for
a gang and working her way up to its ‘soft crime’ computer fraud
team, she established a reputation for staying one step ahead of the
law. Unfortunately, a police raid on her gang’s headquarters turned
violent and she ended up blinded by laser fire.

The government offered her a deal: new eyes in exchange for
indentured servitude as a police agent, spying on the criminals
with which she once worked and competed. After a decade her
term of service was complete and she was free to seek other
employment. While First Merchants Bank of Collace would never
hire a person with her background, it does hire freelancers on
a contract basis and she became a skip tracer, first of ground
and grav vehicles and finally working on a team that took down
starship scofflaws. A run-in with her old gang left her with the
desire to leave Collace for good and she accepted the contact
from First Merchants to search for the far trader Reginald’s Purse,
last reported position Vrel, in the Marrakesh subsector of The
Beyond. Granted enough middle passage vouchers to take her to
Marrakesh itself, she set out alone to make her big score.

##### Shushaka: For the budget-minded Traveller

By Tim Heiderich

Adjacent to the capital system of Kaasu (AA7A9CD-F) in the Khukish
subsector of Corridor lies the industrious system of Shushaka
(A772988-E). Once a stellar nursery, the Shushaka system is now a
fertile field of industrial plants. Its five gas giants are each orbited by
innumerable moons, with rich mining opportunities for the enterprising
belter or trader.

Orbiting the innermost gas giant is the hell world of Shushaka, an
inhospitable moon with a tainted atmosphere, cratered surface and
a strip of ocean winding down one side its only source of water.
Nevertheless, the extremely rich resources of this system have not
dissuaded industrious workers from landing here.

The Shushakan moon’s surface is divided into megacity-sized
compounds of construction sites, management quarters, production
centres, automated factories and squalid dormitories, making Shushaka
a nonstop industrial center. Outside the production centres, the blasted
surface is pocked by innumerable mining sites and pits of chemical
waste. With no concern given for pollution or ecological damage,
corrosives and toxic by-products befoul the wastelands, to be salvaged
by desperate scavengers.

The system is led by the fervent, overworked staff of the planetwide
Sebokea Corporation. Its ambitious and driven culture is working
tirelessly to overtake the subsector capital Kaasu and become an
economic powerhouse in its own right. In the 32-hour Shushakan day,
the people never stop working.

The moon of the innermost gas giant of Shushaka is headquarters of
the Sebokea Corporation and a trade hub of industrial and consumer
products, offering budget goods and services, supported by a
population of relentless, stimulant-addicted factory workers.

The Sebokea Corporation is a vertically integrated producer of budget-
model consumer goods, meaning they do not just produce consumer
products, they produce and export a nearly limitless variety of factory
equipment as well. Every step in the manufacturing process is
controlled by the company, with complete self-sufficiency its goal.

HISTORY
Despite not being as habitable as its neighbor Kaasu, settlers came
to the Shushaka system for its rich mineral deposits and eschewed
creature comforts in favor of the vast wealth that could be made from
the system’s untapped resources. Over time, the system attracted
more of that type of rugged colonist, eager to enrich themselves in
this frontier even if that meant depriving themselves of the domestic
comforts of their more affluent neighbors.

Dogged determination became a badge of honor among the
inhabitants of Shushaka: whoever could work harder, for longer
stretches and do more with less was lauded, and that extreme work
ethic became part of their cultural fabric.

Likewise, universal resentment toward a nearby system that (in their
opinion) did not deserve its greater success made the Shushaka
inhabitants both strongly allied with each other and xenophobic to
outsiders. Shushakans continued to work tirelessly with the goal to
eventually out-produce their more successful neighbors and assert
their home as the rightful capital and economic center of the subsector.
Shushakan inhabitants have a contemptuous view of those from
Kaasu, seeing them as less industrious and leading a charmed life to
which they are undeserving. Their view of those from other systems is
invariably as ‘soft’ or weak, incapable or unwilling to do what it takes to
get ahead, either by taking risks, working more or through deception.

This bitter rivalry (ironically one not shared by Kaasu) led to further
consolidation within Shushakan tribes, until just over a century ago,
when the two largest tribes formally joined into a partnership that
became the Sebokea Corporation, now overseeing all system-wide
industry from mining to industrial and consumer goods to spacecraft,
with development returned back into the coffers of the Shushakan
system, to further enrich its tireless workforce.

SOCIETY
Somehow, in their fervour to increase their economic output,
Shushakans began to work themselves to death. At the bottom of the
workforce are grim, burned-out husks of people, who stay productive
through the widespread use of legal stims. Due to the moon’s slower
rotation, factory shifts are typically 12 hours or longer.

Those working in the corporate sector are highly competitive and
exhibit the culture’s signature mistrust of outsiders. Accelerated burnout
and poor quality of work is overlooked in favor of the company’s
staggering year-over-year growth and there are always eager workers
to take a fallen one’s place.

Executive workers are unethical in their ambition, making under-the-
table bargains, cutting corners and contracting mercenaries to engage
in industrial espionage, all done to beat the competition – which they
see everywhere. This ruthless attitude has proven successful, as
the system continues its inexorable economic ascent. To outsiders,
Shushaka is a powerhouse that could not stop if it wanted to.

The government of the Shushaka system is an impersonal bureaucracy
that exists to manage and protect the interests of the Sebokea
Corporation, which itself manages all resources and economics on a
practical level.

The capital city of Emptor sits at the downport of Shushaka’s Class
A starport. It is an efficient and highly trafficked shipping and service
center, transporting goods across the entire sector. Supporting this
vast demand for goods, its cities are bleak landscapes of cavernous
warehouses, enormous factories and cramped office buildings. In this
industrial amalgam, the only recreational areas are the commons in the
shared living towers. Living spaces are small, unadorned and identical,
meeting only the most spartan needs between work shifts. This design
is repeated at all major production centres for reusability, ease of
familiarity and overall efficiency. If the streets of Emptor look familiar, it
is because every city block looks like every other one.

THE FIVE VIRTUES
Named after the original explorers of the system, the management of
Sebokea has co-opted the symbolism of the system’s five gas giants
as the foundations for their corporate values. Originally, the gas giants
were named for five archetypes from the culture’s early roots:
•  Shushaka: an explorer who leads
•  Muhr: the miser who guards resources
•  Ikös: a navigator who plans ahead
•  Lekïa: the fool, who delights and deceives
•  Engia: a foil to Lekïa, the innovator who works tirelessly

Together, these traits are what employees and colonists of the system
work to aspire to. Workers are often placed depending on which
of these characteristics they best exhibit and those familiar with
Shushakan culture can usually determine which of these strategies a
Shushakan follows.

WEATHER
Relentless strip mining and industrial production has created clouds of
toxic chemicals that drift over the planet, exposing the surface to literal
acid rain and a thick, ashy atmosphere that persists for 2D hours. Roll
2D for the type of toxic atmosphere on any given day.

```

CHEAP, UBIQUITOUS MARKET GOODS
The corporation’s success lies in its ability to efficiently turn out plain,
functional consumer goods of low cost and quality. Disposable goods
mean more repeat customers and low prices keep them coming back.
Market goods are diverse in keeping with the Law Level and all buying
of trade goods is at DM+3 – with a catch.

SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED
Sebokea specialises in budget-model industrial goods that transport
easily but are difficult and time-consuming to assemble. Their universal
language construction guides befuddle all but the most patient of
sophonts and AIs.

Goods are shipped flat-packed and must be assembled by making
a relevant Mechanic, Electronics or Gun Combat check equal to the
equipment’s Tech Level. A failure means the equipment is somehow
faulty or broken, causing it to malfunction if a check falls under the
Effect of the roll (rolling a 5 to build a TL8 item means it will break on
Effect -3 or below, rendering it useless).

Armor loses Protection equal to the effect of the roll in the negative.
Functional gear is always cheap, uncomfortable or shoddy-looking but
can always be improved with a flashy coat of spray paint.

Shipping from the Sebokea starport confers a 15% bonus to tonnage,
due to the corporation’s efficient packing methods. A ship with 20 tons
of cargo space can transport 23 tons of goods.

VEHICLE CONSTRUCTION, REPAIRS AND MODIFICATIONS
Vehicle modifications and repairs are done at relatively cheap prices, with
DM+2 to Broker checks. However, the results will suffer D3-1 quirks. A
vehicle purchased from Sebokea will be 20% cheaper than listed but will
ship unassembled in a crate, taking hours or days of work in a hanger
with proper tools before it is functional. As above, assembling the vehicle
requires a Mechanic check with a difficulty of the vehicle’s Tech Level. A
failed check means the vehicle will break down, sustaining a critical hit
to the affected system, whereas upon a successful Mechanic check the
vehicle suffers no ill effects and functions as expected.

BUDGET SHIPYARDS AND REPAIRS
The moon’s primary downport is constantly abuzz with repairs,
transportation and construction performed with the sort of rushed
abandon that would paralyse a safety inspector. Ships are constructed
on the surface, then blasted into space where the low gravity makes
working on big iron a breeze.

Ships built on Shushaka’s moon are 20% cheaper but suffer D3
additional quirks. Due to weaker, inadequately recycled materials,
repairs are done at one level of repair less than claimed on the Critical
Hits table and will suffer one additional failure if a critical hit is scored
again on the same area without first making adequate repairs.

STIMS
The system permits an active, legal stims market. Despite exports
being completely legal, rival dealers still violently clash for control of this
lucrative market. External cartels will limit the ability of traders to export
Sebokea’s stims, which are produced in industrial quantities for lower
prices and can fetch a higher price in nearby systems.

INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE
Inter-departmental conflict is high and executives are eager to steal, take
credit for or sabotage the work of competing projects and will pay well for
information on technological developments from neighboring systems.

##### Stateroom Excess

**By Pete Nash & Matthew Sprange**

To many Travellers, staterooms are mundane and functional areas
where they can rest, refresh and then leave to engage in adventure.
For others, however, their stateroom is an expression of their own
personalities, a space they customise to their own unique standards.
Some might even take it upon themselves to knock down intervening
walls between existing staterooms to create a larger living area that can
accommodate some truly audacious purchases...

Atmospheric Conditioner: An air conditioner capable of replicating the
smells, humidity, temperatures and gaseous mixture of any atmosphere
it is programmed with. Most atmospheric conditioners come with a
small library of the most popular blends. Being quite bulky, the device
is often disguised as a large wardrobe and needs to be both interfaced
with the ventilation system of the spacecraft and regularly serviced to
reload its scent compound cartridges. The benefit of these devices lay
in the ability to feel at home during space voyages or subtly put guests
at ease. They can also be programmed to create exotic or perhaps
narcotic atmospheres.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Atmospheric Conditioner 10 40 Cr135000

**Autovalet Walk-in Wardrobe** : This marvellous item consumes an entire
standard stateroom. It takes clothing discarded into its pull-out hopper,
cleans and presses it, then carefully stores it in the hanging area. When
the owner wishes to dress, they can stand in front of the wardrobe’s
mirror doors and verbally request a particular garment. The wardrobe’s
computer uses word matching to recognize the specified item and
projects an image of it in the mirror over the owner’s reflection. If the
selection is agreeable, the article is retrieved from climate-controlled
storage and left hanging behind the wardrobe’s doors along with a
selection of footwear, undergarments and complimentary clothing. More
sophisticated models access their owner’s diary to refine selections.

```
Item TL Tons Cost
Autovalet Walk-in Wardrobe 9 4 Cr150000

Bio Carpet: An artificial form of life, the bio carpet is specifically
designed to be the perfect underfoot experience. Not only is it self-
heating, the thick, springy pile also undulates subtly underfoot providing
a gentle massage. The carpet is largely self-supporting, gaining most of
its energy via photosynthesis, but also digests any organic material that

works its way down through the base matting, dealing with small pests
or dropped food. Particularly clean staterooms need to occasionally
supplement the bio carpet’s nutrition.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Bio Carpet 12 18 Cr10000
```

Entertainment Suite: A full environmental holographic suite, this device
is built into the stateroom walls. The suite contains multiple holographic
projectors, complete surround sound, air blowers, temperature control
and electrical field generators. This sensual and projective overlap
produces a fully immersive illusion, to the extent of fooling the viewer into
believing they are planetside or gazing into vertigo inducing space. The
suite adds a new level of interaction with its ability to engulf those within
the room, placing them within the holovid they are watching.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Entertainment Suite 10 62 Cr125000

Floater Chair: The ultimate in decadent luxury, these are ergonomically
designed armchairs with a small antigrav device, allowing the recliner
to move the chair whilst still sitting in it. Like other equipment, these
armchairs can be augmented with additional equipment such as
computers, communications, sensors... and even weapons.

Some floater chairs have privacy screens preventing unwelcome
snoopers from seeing the occupant, if and when the chair is taken into
a public place.

**Guardian Bookshelf:** These storage shelves are protected behind
crystal panelled doors. When sensors detect environmental conditions
that would threaten their contents, any opened doors automatically
close, hermetically seal, turn heat reflective and flood the interior with
inert gas. The shelves are waterproof, crushproof and fireproof (although
decorative cladding material may burn away). As soon as the protective
mode is triggered, the shelves alert the owner via comm link. The
manufacturer guarantees the contents against any disaster save theft.

**Image Frame:** Extra-large image displays capable of filling an entire
wall, these ornate frames are a luxury version of common image viewers
available to the mass market. They are capable of cycling through any
images stored in their memory or play movies. Viewers can tap the
picture frame to get an audio component. More exclusive versions are
generally far larger and have frames decorated with precious materials.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Image Frame 8 35 Cr7000

**Inglesoot Fireplace:** This amazing device can mimic any type of fire,
with regards to fuel burnt, temperature radiated and smell produced. The
fire itself is a computer generated hologram with heat being produced
by induction filaments; the Inglesoot fireplace needs no chimney for
fume extraction. Like the atmospheric conditioner, the fireplace requires
cartridges of organic compounds used to give particular odours, although
the scent function can be turned off. Inglesoot prides itself on the
comprehensive range of fires that can be mimicked, from dried animal
dung and peats to coal-like carbonates and exotic woods. Owners can
quite literally have a different sort of fire every week for the rest of their
lives. Increasing price improves the size and quality of the mantelpiece,
the most exclusive editions carved from precious materials.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Inglesoot Fireplace 10 22 Cr30000
```

**Massage Chair:** Although rather crude mechanical machines at lower
Tech Levels, massage chairs become increasingly more sophisticated
as technology increases, eventually incorporating sonic resonators to
reach deeper muscles and microwave projectors to warm areas and
increase blood flow. Sitting in a massage chair is often so relaxing that
the user will fall asleep and many models automatically stretch out
into a couch as part of the massage. Like other pieces of interactive
furniture, massage chairs can be augmented with other technologies.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Massage Chair 7 14 Cr12000
```

Ultrabath (TL 8): The ultimate in personal hygiene, the ultrabath can
keep the water at a specific temperature, run massaging power-jets and
bubbles to relax the user’s body, add perfumes, oils and detergents,
and even fill itself with any fluid it has a connection to – anything from
asses milk to champagne. It also fills itself in advance and self-cleans
after. More luxurious models incorporate communicators, computers
and entertainment links, although the wisdom of installing this on a
spacecraft that might encounter hazards is often questioned.

The Travellers are contacted by Angelik Mosse, a retired former IISS
senior scout who now works for TCA (The Courier Alliance). Angelik
offers Cr500 each for a couple of hours work that afternoon at the
local low port, provided they can meet her immediately at a hotel in the
complex. She refuses to discuss details until they meet her face-to-face
but promises the work is completely legal. Angelik will make it clear
that she is on a tight schedule – they either meet with her immediately
or she will find someone else. The Referee should feel free to let the
Travellers negotiate a higher fee given the urgency.

Angelik is a coordinator for TCA, matching available scouts with requests
from potential clients. A trusted source informed her that someone may
be planning to steal a package from one of her couriers, a feisty old
Vargr named Long Tooth, after he leaves the shuttleport terminal. The
Travellers are to get the package from Long Tooth first, preferably without
the would-be thieves spotting the switch, then transport the package to
the client using their own vehicle or a rental that she will provide. Angelik
will expect the Travellers to follow local laws and use only non-lethal
weapons in self-defence – no ‘holovid cowboys’! Travellers who do
otherwise will not get paid and may end up in jail.

The ‘package’ is a pair of large blue security cases massing roughly 20
kilograms each. Under no circumstances will Angelik divulge the identity
of the client or the contents of the cases, although she will assure any
who ask that whatever is inside is legal, inert and will not outgas, burn or
explode. The cases are fitted with electronic locks and anti-tamper alarms.

Long Tooth’s shuttle has already left the high port and will land in about
an hour, so there is no time for elaborate planning. The default plan is
to have Long Tooth spill his luggage from a grav baggage pallet. The
Travellers can then simply drop two identical cases (which Angelik will
provide) in the confusion and pick up Long Tooth’s cases. They should
feel free to modify or add to the plan however they wish and Angelik
will provide holoimages of Long Tooth. The Travellers will have an
hour at most to position themselves in the concourse or make other
preparations. The concourse shops may be useful for last-minute
purchases to support their efforts.

ARRIVAL TERMINAL
The groundside shuttleport is a busy place, with flights coming and
going to the highport, orbital habitats and other destinations. Baggage
claim is a limited-access area – only ticketed passengers, crew and
starport personnel may enter and leave. An automated system brings
luggage in from the shuttle docks and deposits it on the carousel, often
before the passengers actually get to baggage claim. Passengers use
a scan code (loaded in their comm or on a disposable fob) to claim
luggage from the carousels. Tags on the baggage will trigger a security
alert if someone tries to remove it from the area without the code.
‘Dumb’ grav pallets are available for a nominal fee (Cr5) to help visitors
transport their baggage around the terminal. The claim area will be filled
with passengers when shuttles have recently arrived but may be almost
empty in between landings. A security guard is always present to deter
theft and prevent incidents.

The baggage claim area opens out into an open, bright and airy multi-
level concourse filled with shops, restaurants, spectacular (and endlessly
changing) holographic ads and small kiosks offering snacks, drinks and
other conveniences. Large atriums extend down several floors with
translucent catwalks and bridges for travel overhead while lift shafts and
escalators provide access between floors. There are always several
dozen people circulating in this space – mostly outbound passengers,
family members greeting new arrivals and starport staff. Slidewalks lead
to hotels, rental vehicle agencies, stations for rail and bus lines, and
parking areas for personal vehicles. The concourse is bright and cheerful,
with just enough people to allow one to blend in and plenty of places
where one could simply sit (or stand) and observe. There will usually be
a starport security guard circulating through the concourse and security
cameras and sensors cover both areas thoroughly.

THE LIFT
Angelik’s information is incomplete – there are actually three separate
crews hired by various parties (or perhaps only one party at the
Referee’s discretion) to ‘lift’ the cases from Long Tooth once he leaves
baggage claim. Each crew will consist of two to three thieves, all of
whom are initially unaware of the others. The thieves are, at most,
lightly armed with non-lethal weapons (stun sticks or stunners) and are
clever and determined, yet will flee to avoid arrest rather than struggle
to the end. Each has their own plan:

The first crew plan a classic distraction lift. One member will bump Long
Tooth, spilling a drink over him while the second pulls the cases into a
larger box (or crate) on a second grav pallet and makes for the nearest
exit. A third acts as spotter and will generate false alerts and other
distractions to confuse and delay security.

The second crew plan on hacking into Long Tooth’s grav pallet and
commandeering it, sending it down a side corridor where the crew will
grab the cases and hide them in a hollowed-out floor maintenance drone.

The third’s plan is simpler yet. They have acquired starport security
uniforms and will simply ‘detain’ Long Tooth for a ‘random customs
inspection’, pulling into a small side room just off the concourse. There
they will simply take the cases and drive off with them in an open-frame
electric utility cart, depending on their IDs to get them clear.

The Referee is free to reduce (or increase) the number of crews.
Each will act independently and not hesitate to ‘liberate’ the cases
from a competing crew – or the Travellers – given the opportunity. The
Travellers may find themselves chasing the cases from one crew to
another throughout the concourse or might find themselves pursued by
several of the crews in turn after executing their own swap. Feel free to
extend the chase up to the very doorstep of the client (in an anonymous
office complex next to the local art museum) if it makes sense.

Long Tooth will gleefully ham up his role, taking it to a delightfully
slapstick level while avoiding getting involved in any rough stuff. Once
obvious conflict occurs or an alarm is set off starport security will arrive
within a minute or two with pairs of officers and a security drone or two.
If the Travellers are detained Angelik will help clear things up so long as
they followed her instructions to stay within the law.

Every time a case is dropped, thumped or otherwise handled roughly
there is a one in six chance the latch on the case will fail, causing the
case to burst open, scattering tens of thousands of cheap plastic and
metal buttons all over the concourse! Once that happens the thieves (and
the Travellers) will realise the truth – the cases were merely decoys all
along. The real package is being delivered via a different route!

AFTERMATH
So long as the Travellers did not break any laws Angelik will pay them
off, deciding they served her purpose as decoys. She has no interest
in trying to find out who was trying to steal the package and will not
discuss where the real package went beyond stating that it arrived
safely and was undamaged. If they did particularly well she will send
them a bonus a few days later – VIP passes to an exclusive opening at
the art museum of a travelling exhibit of almost priceless First Imperium
jewellery. If sold off a Traveller might get as much as Cr250 per pass.

The Referee may decide if further complications follow from this. If the
group performed well Angelik will keep them in mind for future jobs
(making her a possible Contact) or might even offer formal membership
in TCA. It is possible the people behind one or more of the crews
involved in the attempted theft might hold a grudge.

Should they run into Long Tooth again he will laugh as he remembers
the look on their faces when they saw the buttons – ‘is good joke, no?’

Grav Pallets: Grav pallets are a less expensive alternative to carrybots
for moving small loads around. There are a number of common designs
but most consist of little more than a low-powered grav lift unit, a
basket-like bed to carry small boxes or luggage (up to 100 kilograms)
and a small tiller for manual control. Grav pallets can be commanded
using a remote fob or an app on a comm device to follow the user at
a set distance; a hard-coded safety causes the unit to stop if it loses
communication. The pallets do not have enough thrust to negotiate stairs,
limiting their usefulness in irregular terrain. The Electronics (remote ops)
skill may be used to direct them in more complex maneuvers.

##### Connte Monson

By C. Urs Wohlthat

‘The agreement between Clans Galcu and Drushu is as thus: each will
exile one of every 10 of their warriors for one year and one day. So that
there will be peace between the kinsfolk of both.’

Born into the clan of Chieftain Galx, Connte Monson grew up to become
a hunter and protector of his clan. He is of squat physique with ebony
skin and unusually healthy for a Vespexer, owing to his time off-planet
as much as his childhood in a comparatively untainted environment. He
earned his knife at the age of eight, his bow two years later and had his
armor constructed by Clan Galcu’s armorer before turning 18 years
old. Chieftain Galx – literally meaning ‘the chief of Clan Galcu’ – began to
call upon his skills when assembling hunting parties that day.

For several years, Connte’s star rose steadily. He was allowed to visit
the Scholar’s Tower in the palace of King Oleb XVI twice and was even
taught to read and write. It was here that Connte’s luck began to turn.
Part of the same class of Vespexer students was a ranger of Clan
Drushu named Sihaloho. Clans Drushu and Galcu had enjoyed a long
relationship as neighbors at that time and their leaders were even
related by blood but Sihaloho’s father, the leader of Clan Drushu – and
consequently called Chieftain Drux – began aiming for higher prizes
than hunting the largest game or expanding clan borders into more
prosperous hunting grounds.

Ever since Chieftain Galx
became representative of
her clan to the Floating
Palace, Chieftain Drux
had wanted the same for
himself. He recognized the
opportunities that came
with such a recognition by
the king: hosting one of the
many hunting parties the
king liked to conduct on
the surface of Drinax would
mean payment in valuable
items and equipment.
This would in return allow
trade with the outside
world, opening up ways
for expansion into new
territories and maybe even
domed housing to escape
the brutal environment of
his homeworld.

Connte Monson knew
nothing of all these plans
by Sihaloho’s father and so
concentrated on learning
as much as possible while
staying in the Scholar’s
Tower. His assiduity
eventually paid off, when
he was lauded by Scholar
Voha as the best of his
class of six students. While
Connte proudly affixed the
pin concomitant with the
distinction to his patchwork
suit, Chieftain Drux foamed
in anger over the setback.
He had a band of his
warriors attack a hunting
party of Clan Galcu, killing
one and kidnapping two
other members of the clan.

**Vespexer Patchwork Suit:**
When the Aslan fleet obliterated Drinax
from orbit, they not only annihilated its
cities and killed countless Drinaxians
but also destroyed the ecosphere
of the planet. Yet, in a testimony to
human resilience, some Drinaxians
managed to survive. Their descendants
are collectively known as Vespexers,
although the etymology of the name is
lost to history as are so many details
about Drinax. Vespexers struggle
for survival on a daily basis, with
atmospheric conditions remaining
perilous on the planet practically
everywhere. Thus, necessary items
for survival are life-support masks,
rebreathers or any other source for
fresh air, preferably combined with
sealed suits. These cobbled-together
combinations of air tanks, filters,
compressors and sometimes even
sealed armor are colloquially known
as patchwork suits and are both items
of prestige and protection. Each family
or clan usually has one individual able
to combine scavenged or traded parts
into a basic suit. The archetypical suit
offers basic armor as well as radiation
protection and is environmentally
sealed and insulated against extreme
cold and heat. Additionally, a life-
support mask with additional respirator
is integrated, allowing usage in very
thin and tainted atmospheric conditions.
A simple switch enables the use of the
air tank, which lasts for up to one hour.
These suits are not made for light or
hard vacuum environments, however;
they will fail fairly quickly in a Trace
atmosphere (D3 hours) and more
rapidly (D3 x 10 minutes) in vacuum.

Finally, it seemed Connte’s time had come as Chieftain Galx tasked him
with retrieving the kidnapped clan members but this time Connte’s luck
and skill fell short. Sihaloho had placed a small radio beacon onto his
armor and so Chieftain Drux and his warriors saw Connte and his band
approach. Connte barely survived the ensuing ambush and Chieftain
Galx refrained from further rescue attempts. Instead, she asked for help
from the Floating Palace. The king’s help however, did not take the form
Galx had hoped for; the royal diplomat proposed a mere ceasefire and
called for exiling a tenth of the warriors of each clan.

The idea of the king – or at least his diplomats – behind this was to
remain impartial but defuse a situation which could easily spill over and
cause a war between two large Vespexer factions, potentially souring
relations between Vespexers and the Floating Palace. This would not
only make the king’s hunting parties a much more difficult undertaking
(a major concern!) but might also cut off the Scholar’s Tower from future
missions of relic hunting; since ancient Sindalian artefacts are still a
major source of revenue for the royal household, paying for trade goods
from across the sector, peace could not be disturbed.

The fateful words of the clan elders and the royal diplomat have been
spoken. Connte has to leave his homeland. The elders left it to Connte
as to whether he would rather walk the blasted surface of Drinax away
from his homelands or leave the planet completely and he chose
to reach for the stars. Who knows, maybe he will meet a band of
wanderers on the Floating Palace, who would care for a brazen young
warrior able to show them the wonders of Drinax. Certainly, Connte
has an axe to grind. Also, did he not promise Chieftain Galx to find her
means to deliver vengeance unto Clan Drushu?

##### Perela

**by Craig Bunting**

The size of a large domesticated cat, perela are bulbous armored
beetles with three articulated body parts. The head features a mouth
with razor sharp teeth in machine-like jaws and the middle section
has six crab-like legs with claws that allow them to climb walls as fast
as they walk. Perela are carrion-eaters and consume anything hard
like bone or dried jreine-guano, scraping it off the bare ground with a
single hard tooth that can gnaw through a vacc suit in short order. They
amble about in herds of 1D but under duress they summon 1D more by
emitting a high-pitched ‘peep-peep’ noise.

Perela can see in the infrared spectrum and sense vibration and sound
acutely; Travellers will appear to be tall piles of carrion to them.

##### Del Madrin, Scout

**By Geir Lanesskog**

Location: Trelyn Vrra, Vanguard Reaches
**Required Skills:** Astrogation, Engineer and Pilot
Reward: Standard pay +50%, with first month up front, six months minimum

Mission: Crew an IISS x-courier to deliver and pick up diplomatic mail
from Telleria and Baixing, then return to Trelyn Vrra. Estimated 14
jumps and six months contract

Summary: The Third Imperium maintains an extensive x-boat network
of jump-4 ships to rapidly transmit important messages within its borders.
Beyond its borders, the unarmed, thrusterless x-boats are too vulnerable
to use as couriers and more robust ships such as the Marathon x-courier
perform the task. The courier Quadrireme is homebased at Raweh in the
Spinward Marches, the end of the regular x-boat line. Quadrireme and its
crew have recently completed a long voyage through Foreven and The
Beyond to reach Trelyn Vrra, delivering diplomatic messages and small
packages to the Imperial embassy at Ardesh Downport. Unfortunately,
the crew passed through Obykla and may have inadvertently been
exposed to Emerling Plague. With the crew in mandatory six-month
quarantine and messages to pass on to Imperial embassies at Telleria
and Baixing, the embassy’s IISS attaché Del Madrin needs a crew to
take him and communications to these worlds.

Madrin would prefer a crew of Imperial origin but at this point he
will accept anyone who is not Zhodani, as long as they understand
Galanglic well enough to fly a high-tech scout vessel. Madrin will
remain aboard for the duration of the cruise, acting as captain or more
accurately as owner-aboard, as he is barely qualified to stand watch
in any position. His duty is to deliver messages and sealed diplomatic
packages to the two embassies and return with anything they need to
send back to the Third Imperium.

The Quadrireme has just undergone a maintenance overhaul at
Trelyn Vrra and is fully functional, with the ship able to perform some
tasks at Skill 1 via Virtual Crew software and repair drones able to
perform minor maintenance. Del Madrin will claim one stateroom; the
other three are up for grabs for his hired crew. He has a strongbox
with MCr1 to cover expenses and expects to be able to acquire more
currency from the embassies at Telleria and Baixing if needed. Those
destinations will require landing at the main downport and a stay of at
least six days to conduct business and transfer both documents and

packages, plus an inevitable reception or two. In other systems, Del
and the crew may choose to refuel from gas giants or starports. Del is
not in a great hurry but sees this as a necessary duty to be performed
quickly and efficiently. There are few limitations on the route but a
shortcut through Red Zone systems such as Atrephar, Huad Yai or
Htyerle will not be permitted.

Random starship encounters may lead to situations in the course of
the voyage but one scripted encounter will occur. Intelligence officers
operating out of the Imperial embassy at Telleria have uncovered
details on the Eli marauder network and will entrust this information
to Quadrireme both in encrypted data form and on specially secured
diplomatic data canisters. Eli spies are aware of this and will attempt to
intercept Quadrireme at Inhio, stationing a ship at the system’s single
gas giant. Inhio is a moon of the gas giant, orbiting 500,000 kilometers
distant. It has few defensive capabilities beyond surface-mounted laser
and missile turrets, a flight of five aging light fighters and two pinnaces
armed with pulse lasers. It will not normally defend ships attacked
while refuelling at the gas giant, except in conjunction with any patrol or
escort vessel that happens to be in system and willing to aid.

A failed attempt by the Eli to intercept the courier will likely involve
more hastily arranged ambushes at Corymb and/or Anhinga, likely
transit systems for the return journey. In each case, the intercepting
force will consist of a single 400-ton Eli Marauder corsair with crew
and boarding pinnace.

REFEREE’S INFORMATION
Roll 1D or choose from one of the options below.

1 – 4: The Eli Marauder corsairs have no names. The crews refer to
them by number. The one at Inhio’s gas giant is Seven. The crew uses
pseudonyms even with each other. The captain is a fiftyish female
Vargr who goes by ‘Patch’ and has augmented eyes able to see into
infrared and ultraviolet. The first officer and commander of the boarding
team is a male Aslan outcast who calls himself ‘Fluffy’. He is not. The
ship is running silent in orbit around the gas giant. When Quadrireme
is detected, Patch will launch the pinnace with pilot, Fluffy and eight
troops, all equipped with laser rifles and vacc suits. The pinnace will
emulate a ship plying a route between the gas giant and its inner moon
and will respond to hails as a civilian craft. As Quadrireme approaches
to refuel the pinnace will feign an emergency and ask for assistance
while Seven takes up position ‘above’ the incoming courier. Seven will
launch a surprise attack with lasers and missiles prior to announcing its
presence and demanding surrender. It will deactivate the missiles if the
Quadrireme surrenders and allows the pinnace to board.

Once Seven begins to move, Quadrireme sensor operators will spot
it with an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check (1 round, INT)
with DM-4 for Stealth but DM+2 for Advanced sensors. Note that if no
crewmember is explicitly performing the sensor check, the ship’s Virtual
Crew/1 program is running scans in the background and will detect
Seven on a 9+ each round.

If Quadrireme refuels at Inhio’s port, Seven will use that time to shift its
position out to 10 planetary diameters from the gas giant on the likely
departure vector of Quadrireme and wait, hoping to achieve an ambush.

The primary objective is capture of Quadrireme. The Eli are not overly
bloodthirsty, althrough Fluffy will likely lose his temper if his team
suffers fatalities. If Quadrireme is likely to escape, Seven will fire full
missile salvos at the fleeing ship until the racks run dry, then reload and
keep firing. The Eli will not surrender their ship but might flee if badly
damaged. Every Eli starship carries one nuclear charge beneath its
bridge for scuttling, although the crew will evacuate in assault capsules
aimed at the nearest world before triggering the device’s six-minute
fuse. Individual Eli might surrender if faced with certain death but Patch
and Fluffy will go down fighting.

5: The Eli are determined to prevent Quadrireme from escaping. If
the courier does not immediately surrender, the Marauder will fire a
full salvo of six missiles. The Marauder’s turrets are fully loaded with
long range missiles but the ammunition stores hold mostly standard
missiles. The pinnace is armed with long range missiles as well. Seven
also has six nuclear missiles. It will use these to destroy Quadrireme if
necessary and scuttle it (one missile placed onboard a disabled craft
will vaporise it) if captured. The Eli will still take prisoners but not at the
expense of the primary objective.

6: Del Madrin is an Eli spy. He will aid the attack on his own ship
by locking out the crew and possibly alerting the Marauder if the
Quadrireme is attempting to hide. As a last resort, if the Eli have failed
to ambush the courier at Inhio and Corymb, he will insist on refuelling
at Anhinga’s starport and attempt to lock the crew out of the ship while
they are on shore leave and then allow an Eli squad to ‘hijack’ the ship
and depart. The ship itself will resist Del’s attempt to aid the Eli and
alert and aid the crew if it is able, at least until Del realises this and
switches over to the backup computer.

NOTES
If captured, the crew will be taken to a hidden Eli base on the moon of
a rogue gas giant located at hex 1407 of the Vanguard Reaches. This
location would be the most important piece of intelligence discovered
by Imperial intelligence analysts and even if the Quadrireme is captured
or destroyed, the information will eventually find its way back to Trelyn
Vrra. The Referee can develop the base in detail if the Travellers

attempt to escape. If they are still confined after a year, an attack by a
small force of battle dress-equipped Trelyn and Mayan troops, backed
by attack ships, will attempt to storm the base to gather intelligence but
locating and rescuing captives are secondary objectives.

```
Del Madrin is by his own admission a ‘glorified clerk’ working the
IISS desk at the Imperial embassy on Trelyn Vrra. His tenure as an
x-boat pilot has left him with a rather introverted personality but he
wears his uniform well and tries to project a professional image of
the Scout Service to his peers and the Trelyns. After eight years of
desk jobs, he is initially enthusiastic about the idea of returning to
service as a courier, especially aboard a ‘much more interesting’
Marathon courier, but he also knows he is out of his depth. By his
own admission, he knows nothing but ‘chapter headings’ about
starship engineering and will be totally reliant on outside expertise.
He is also a little agoraphobic and would really just prefer to stay in
his stateroom or at a bridge station out of the way.
```

```
He will soon come to dislike his assignment, get testy in
jumpspace and begin to curse the previous courier crew who were
stupid enough to visit an abandoned station on Obykla – although
to be fair, the warning beacon was broken and their library was
not updated with the interdiction information. Still, if not for them,
he would be back at his desk and tiny embassy apartment, where
everything was nice and routine.

MARATHON-CLASS X-COURIER
Within the borders of the Third Imperium, the Express Boat Service
almost exclusively utilises 100-ton x-boats to transfer messages.
This communication system relies on an extensive support network
that includes large x-boat tenders and the assumption of secure star
systems supported by the might of the Imperial Navy. Beyond the
Imperium, this infrastructure becomes less reliable and on those few
routes that extend into or around foreign territories, the x-courier is
often the Express Boat Service’s vehicle of choice. Based on a 200-ton
streamlined hull, the jump-4 Marathon Mk III x-courier is a state-of-the-
art communications starship capable of operation without supporting
infrastructure. Armed, armored and capable of 4G acceleration, the
Marathon carries a crew of four in a streamlined vehicle which – except
for a broad blocky central section – somewhat mimics the appearance
of the smaller Type-S scout/courier.

Under standard operation procedure, the Marathon will make a single
jump and pass on communications like a relay runner to another
Marathon waiting in the next system, then refuel and prepare for
the arrival of a new Marathon carrying messages in the opposite
direction. The Marathon will then jump back to its original location,
which may be a scout base or just a starport in a neutral or client state
system. In some cases, on some sparsely covered routes, a single
Marathon may complete several legs of the relay itself, conducting
wilderness refuelling along the way, until reaching its final destination or
rendezvous point, before returning to base with new messages.

The Marathon utilises custom maneuver and jump drives designed
and licensed by Ling Standard Products and relies on high efficiency
batteries for jump drive operations. Although on-board repair drones
are capable of maintaining the ship’s systems and spares are normally
carried in the cargo hold, maintenance, especially beyond the frontier
can be problematic. Widespread adoption of the Marathon has been
limited by the need to return to Imperial space for annual maintenance.

ELI MARAUDER CORSAIR
The Eli have historically utilised captured ships and ‘standard’ corsair
models but since 1100 some Eli have begun appearing in custom
Marauder ships. The ship is a black flying wing, angular for stealth
but highly manoeuvrable. Limited by its modest Tech Level, it is still
a formidable foe and more than capable of taking on an unescorted
commercial craft. The ship will typically strike from ambush, lying in wait
in orbit or even loitering in the upper reaches of a gas giant, awaiting
unsuspecting prey. Capable of 3G acceleration, it can outrun any
commercial ship but is unlikely to escape from military armed escorts,
although a barrage of missile salvos fired from concealment can often
damage an escort and leave its charges undefended. Limited to one
parsec jumps, the Marauder can jump twice without refuelling, an
advantage when operating along the Tellerian Main.

Detailed descriptions of the ship’s interior are based on the reports of
a few hostages ransomed from Eli captivity. The ship is equipped with
a wedge-shaped boarding pinnace and captives are unloaded into a
prison area capable of holding a fair number of hostages. A medical
bay and low berths are nearby for treating Eli and their captives alike.
Rows of assault capsules allow attacks planetside or escape from a
crippled ship. Despite their antiquated technology, the ships are new
constructions and well maintained.

ELI BOARDING PINNACE
The Eli Boarding Pinnace seems designed to fit within the recently
spotted Eli Marauder. The pinnace’s wedge-shaped body and triangular
cross section fit into a custom rear docking bay on the corsair. The
pinnace itself is limited to 3G acceleration but is highly manoeuvrable
and, like its parent craft, stealth-coated, allowing it to close on
unsuspecting ships. Equipped with a breaching tube and forced-linkage
apparatus, the pinnace can board a resisting vessel and quickly transfer
its squad of raiders. Inside the pinnace’s passenger compartment, the
raiders maintain a full brig and armory. While capable of storing cargo,
the pinnace generally awaits its mothership before stripping captured
ships of valuable cargo.

##### Aezorgh

**By Geir Lanesskog**

The Aezorgh are a species native to Soghzalghag (Windhorn sector,
Voenggaks) who were once enslaved by the Vargr. The small hexapods
are now a minority on their own world and have adapted to both
technological life in the concrete jungles of their occupied homeworld
and amongst the stars. Known for being clever and devious, nimble
yet distracted, they are often more tolerated than liked. Although
not common, Aezorgh individuals and small communities inhabit the
cities and startowns in the sectors near the border between the Third
Imperium and the Vargr Extents.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Iridescent down feathers cover the body of the bilateral hexapod
Aezorgh. Adapted for life in Soghzalghag’s long-lost temperate
rainforests, the Aezorgh are extremely dexterous, with four arms ending
in hands equipped with four delicate tentacles. Two multi-jointed legs
each end in feet with four thicker tentacles covered in gecko-like ridges
capable of supporting the Aezorgh when hanging from branches,
walls or ceilings. The four ‘wrists’ of Aezorgh hands have similar
ridges to facilitate vertical movement. An adult Aezorgh measures 1.5
meters head to tentacle toe pad but tends to stand with stooped legs,
shortening actual height to 1.2 meters. Adults of the spindly sophont
species average less than 40 kilograms mass.

The head of an Aezorgh contains a brain and sensory clusters,
including four eyes, two forward-facing large black orbs focused on the
human visual range and two smaller eyes on either side of the head
focused on infrared light. The main eyes are very acute but limited to
the forward 120° line of sight. The secondary eyes sit higher on the
head and do not provide colour or detail vision but allow sight at night,
expand the total field of vision to 300° and allow the Aezorgh to see
almost directly overhead. Two ears protrude near the jaw hinge directly
under the secondary eyes and provided hearing similar in range and
acuity to a human’s ears. Aezorgh breathe through two large ‘nostrils’
on either side of the rounded mouth. These nostrils independently feed
the Aezorgh’s two lungs. The mouth contains 70–80 small sharp teeth.
The Aezorgh are omnivores but the teeth also allow them to attach
themselves to feed from both sap-filled flora and blood-filled fauna.
An Aezorgh’s sense of smell is controlled by minute sensors in the
head’s down feathers. The head sits atop a stubby neck and has limited
motion, relying on a wide field of view rather than movement to visually
observe the environment.

While the Aezorgh normally wear tightfitting clothing, they keep head,
hands, and feet uncovered in all but hostile environments. This allows
for the best use of their sensory organs and for movement in three
dimensions along walls, ceilings, branches, and other surfaces.

EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT
Before the Vargr arrived, the five small continents of Soghzalghag
were mostly covered by dense flora, from boreal woodlands to tropical
rainforests. In that environment, the Aezorgh evolved as arboreal
hunter-gatherers, ranging across the vast temperate rainforests of the
continent of Thaegzil, living in small bands of extended families and
following migrations of seasonal flyers, eating their eggs and competing
for fruits and nuts. The Aezorgh were larger than most local arboreal
species and also took to the ground, feeding off surface dwelling fauna
and digging up roots.

Intelligence likely arose in response to complex group dynamics and to
the constant improvization and experimentation with food sources. Tool
use was evident by -200,000 with specialist tools developing to ‘solve’
different food problems. By the time of first contact with Vilani explorers
in -5000, the Aezorgh were still TL0 and written off as inconsequential
primitives. Contact with the expanding Vargr in -2400 was much more
monumental, with settlers soon arriving and beginning to transform the
pristine wilderness world in irrevocable ways.

LIFE CYCLE
The Aezorgh have two genders, female and male. While family bands
follow a matriarchal line, Aezorgh society is not differentiated by gender
roles and the genders are externally visually indistinguishable. Aezorgh
can determine gender by pheromones undetectable to Humaniti or
Vargr. Environmental conditions of the developing Aezorgh egg and
not genetics determine gender. An adult female lays one egg every
local year of 590 standard days. A few days prior to egg-laying the
female’s pheromones change, indicating availability to mate, although
often a female will not be receptive to attempts by males to initiate
courtship. Regardless of fertilization status, a single egg is produced,
approximately 10 centimeters in diameter and massing one kilogram.

The female will do as she pleases with the egg. She may incubate, discard
or eat it. An unfertilised egg will still hatch as a genetic clone of the mother
but gender will vary based on a variety of conditions. As most mating of
aboriginal Aezorgh occurs between members of different bands, the father
of a child has no role in its upbringing. The egg, if properly cared for, will
hatch within 30 standard days, producing a blind, helpless, immature
Aezorgh who clings to its mother and feeds upon her regurgitated food for
the first two local (about three standard) years of its life.

An Aezorgh has a long development period but grows to full size and
maturity by the age of 18 standard years. Females are more likely to
remain with their matriarchal birth band but males often set out for

‘adventure’ before eventually joining a band, although in pre-contact
times, more than half are thought to have eventually return to the band
of their mother.

The lifespan of the Aezorgh is nearly 100 standard years, with aging
occurring late in life. A female will continue to lay one egg every local year
from age 11 to 50 but under normal circumstances, few actually hatch.

For most of the period since first contact with the Vargr, the Aezorgh have
not known normal circumstances and their traditional way of life is long gone.

HISTORY
Vargr colonists reached the world they named Soghzalghag in -2400
and claimed the planet as their own. The new settlers spent the first few
decades nearly completely ignoring the indigenous Aezorgh, making just
tentative settlements on the shore of the Thaegzil continent. Fragmentary
secondary evidence of lost xenological research records indicates some
interest in the Aezorgh but most of the newcomers had little interest in the
natives, until interactions began to become contentious.

Official Vargr histories contend that interaction started with Aezorgh
‘thieving’ in outlying settlements. The Aezorgh have no competing
histories as they had no written language at the time and their original
languages and mythologies are long since extinct. For the first century,
Vargr policy varied from forced removal, to extermination, to kidnapping
and training young Aezorgh as technicians. The latter policy became
official in -2180 when the local government proclaimed the Aezorgh
as property, enslaving the entire species. Aezorgh reproduction aided
the spread of enslaved sophonts, allowing eggs to be taken from their
mothers to be factory raised and indoctrinated as tinkerers and techs
forced to work in dangerous environments.

Not all Aezorgh became slaves, however. A significant minority learned to
survive surreptitiously in the growing Vargr cities, occupying underground
tunnels such as sewers and conduits, and living in the walls of buildings,
crawling through air vents to survive on the detritus of Vargr civilization.

Within a few centuries, the Vargr population on Soghzalghag reached
into the billions and the air and water became fouled with industrial
waste. The forests were gone and the Aezorgh survived in two groups;
one was chattel, the other clandestine scavengers living in urban
jungles. By -1200, the Aezorgh had spread to other Vargr worlds in
Windhorn and neighboring sectors, both as enslaved techs and as
stowaways. Their reception on other worlds varied; on some it was as
on Soghzalghag: slaves or vermin. On others, more enlightened views
led to their freedom and even full citizenship.

In 1039 Soghzalghag, or at least two of its major governments, joined
the Ngath Confederation. Ngath is not a strong confederation by any
means but its members must agree to certain principles, including the

abolition of slavery and citizenship for all sophonts. As a result, nearly
every Aezorgh became a free sophont in principle. In reality, the process
took decades, with existing owners unwilling to surrender their property
without compensation and continued discrimination against the ‘vermin’.

SOCIETY
After 3,500 years of oppression and furtive existence, little remains
of the Aezorgh’s original culture and language. While some Aezorgh
have been free for thousands of years, others still remember growing
up in slavery. The Aezorgh have adopted Vargr languages, speaking
mostly Ovaghoun, Aekhu and Gvegh. Those Aezorgh living beyond the
borders of Vargr states often speak the local language in a pidgin with
Vargr loan-words and grammar.

Aezorgh matriarchal bands still exist in modified form in the poorer
sections of larger cities, in the walls of vast archologies and in
startowns along the rimward frontier of the Vargr Extents. Both male
and female Aezorgh often leave their bands when they come of age,
some staying within their home cities but others hire on to working
passage offworld, or stow away in cargo bays. Some Vargr find the
Aezorgh useful, using them as drive hands and maintenance techs on
ships or tinkerers and repair techs in second-hand stores. More Vargr
consider them annoying petty thieves and tricksters, and no Vargr gains
respect from leading a band of Aezorgh.

Many sophonts find Aezorgh eating habits disturbing. An Aezorgh is
a true omnivore and will try eating just about anything at least once.
Cooking is not required and small prey is sometimes eaten alive,
although this is often done specifically to disturb others rather than as
a preferred method of consumption. More disturbing is the Aezorgh’s
ability to cling to the body of a large animal and attach their sharp teeth
to the skin, penetrating flesh to suck blood or other fluids like a large
leech. An anaesthetic in the Aezorgh’s saliva works to prevent the
victim from feeling the bite and acts as a sedative or mild euphoric on
some species but not on all; an Aezorgh can suck blood from a Terran
cow for hours but attempting the trick on a Kian will lead to a rather
extreme reaction.

Aezorgh are very intelligent and nimble but have a curiously split
attention span. They can spend hours without pause fixing an intricate
clockwork mechanism or a tangled electronic mess but often cannot
maintain enough focus to finish a book or movie. There have even been
stories of an Aezorgh becoming distracted mid-conversation, walking
away to perform some other task.

Reputation is more important to an Aezorgh than money but it is
recognition for cleverness, not for honor that matters. All Aezorgh,
even members of a matriarchal band, are individualistic and while they
will not betray a fellow Aezorgh, they may decide not to share their
knowledge or fortune.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
The name Aezorgh derives from an early Ovaghoun dialect, meaning
‘vermin’. The Aezorgh keep this name as an ironic badge of honor to
spite the Vargr. Relations with Vargr vary greatly. On some worlds, the
Aezorgh have long become part of society, even respectable. On other
worlds, they are still considered vermin. Aezorgh opinion of Vargr varies
as well but there is no universal animosity. While individual Aezorgh
may hold a grudge for the millennia of oppression, others regard any
particular Vargr as well as they are regarded by them. Some say the
Aezorgh do not have the attention span to hold a grudge – the Aezorgh
do not find that stereotype amusing and some are known to create
elaborate (usually harmless) pranks to prove their patience.

The Aezorgh are not common within Imperial space but they have
been citizens of some worlds in Corridor and Vland since the founding
of the Third Imperium. They have the same rights and privileges of all
sophonts within the Imperium but carry with them the same reputations
for both cleverness and mischief as in Vargr space.

Whilst Soghzalghag is their homeworld, it holds little significance to most of
them. They number less than five percent of the overpopulated planet and
less than five percent of the Aezorgh call the world home. Travelling Aezorgh
are often alone, as they do not generally crave or need the companionship
of their own kind, especially when they are relatively young. After a few years
or decades most Aezorgh gravitate back to a matriarchal band or other local
Aezorgh community but many continue to wander the galaxy and have been
known to travel as far as the Hive Federation. They are most certainly not
welcome in the Two Thousand Worlds.

CREATING AEZORGH TRAVELLERS
Aezorgh youths often leave their band to seek adventure or new
experiences, making them suitable, if uncommon, Travellers.

Gender
An Aezorgh may be of either gender. While only females lay eggs,
reproductive activity occurs only once every 590 days and eggs can be
cared for in incubators if the female decides to hatch it, although raising
a young Aezorgh requires nearly two decades of commitment.

Characteristics
Initial Aezorgh characteristics are rolled as: STR 1D, DEX 2D+3, END
1D+1, INT 2D+2, EDU 1D, SOC 1D.

The maximum for DEX is 18 and INT is 16.

Instead of standard background skill determination, all Aezorgh gain
Athletics 0, Mechanic 0, Recon 0, Stealth 0 and one additional skill of
their choice.

Traits
Aezorgh Travellers all possess the following traits:

**Gecko Travel:** Ridges on an Aezorgh’s feet and wrists allow the
Traveller to climb walls at full movement speed and to cross ceilings at
half movement speed in gravity up to 1.5 standard.

**Heightened Senses** : Wide infrared vision and innate situational
awareness allow Aezorgh to receive DM+1 to Recon or Survival
checks. If a heat source is present, the Aezorgh’s infrared vision
negates any penalty for darkness.

Multi-limbed: Aezorgh have four dexterous arms, allowing them
to perform two sets of non-movement actions in any round without
penalty. Aezorgh tentacle fingers are flexible enough to allow the use of
tools and equipment designed for other species without penalty.

Careers
All careers in the Traveller Core Rulebook and in the Vargr section
of Aliens of Charted Space, Volume 1 are available to the Aezorgh,
although Noble and Emissary careers are extremely unlikely. In Vargr
society Aezorgh CHA is computed as half SOC, rounded down. Few
Aezorgh have the discipline or size required for military careers,
although support and pilot assignments are more likely. An Aezorgh
receives DM-2 to qualify and graduate from pre-career options.

Aezorgh Travellers begin their first term at age 18 and receive DM+4 to
aging checks until they reach the age of 82 (16 terms), after which the
DM no longer applies.

##### Vrayne

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Vrayne is a secondary world designed to be placed in a system of
the Referee’s discretion. It is a planet upon which rival families vie for
power, their centuries-long disagreements coming to light in the wake
of modern technology brought by visiting brokers. The startling contrast
of the different Tech Level equipment within the downport of Vrayne
(D878530-4) is immense, with holographic displays being guarded by
soldiers in full plate armor.

The history of the planet is tumultuous, with shifts occurring every
few decades as a ruler comes into power only to commit an offence
worthy of a rebellion against them. Control has passed between three
key families (Senar, Poltar and Laynora) for generations as they
are wealthy enough to fund militiamen and, in some cases, employ
offworld mercenaries. Despite this, each government has retained one
aspect of the preceding regime – religion. This religion comes with a
number of rituals, rites and rules, which can seem to exist simply to
confuse offworlders. Due to this, and the consequences of breaking
any of these rules, the system main world advises any Travellers
against visiting Vrayne.

PLANETARY DATA
Axial Tilt: 10 o
Rotation: 32.8 standard hours
Year: 788.4 standard days
Diameter: 11,745km

THE FLAG OF VRAYNE
The flag is a horizontal duotone gradient with the upper section being
ivory and the lower teal. In the center lays an emblem of a human hand
holding a golden goblet, raising it to the sky. The goblet is a depiction
of those used in religious ceremonies on the sparsely populated planet,
specifically in fertility rites.

Flags are less commonplace here than other planets, having changed a
significant amount during the tumultuous era of constant rebellions. The
current flag has been in place for 263 years, created after what is now
known as ‘Ripod’s Rebellion’. The then leader of House Poltar wanted
to encapsulate the ideals of his revolution in the flag itself, as others
had been decidedly lacking, including one featuring only a white dagger
on a field of black.

##### D878530-4

ENVIRONMENT
The atmosphere of Vrayne contains tainted spores and breathing these
in will, if left untreated, cause the cessation of all cardiovascular activity.
The native population has become accustomed to such an environment
and have developed ingenious methods of dealing with the spores.
Combination masks are simply part of getting dressed on Vrayne, with
richer members of society spending thousands of Credits on ornate
designs to distinguish themselves from the rabble. Each home is
fitted with a form of decontamination shower, containing a chemical
compound specifically derived to neutralise the effects of the spores.
The tainted atmosphere has continually restrained the birth rate over
the centuries, meaning births are a highly celebrated affair.

With a verdant ecosphere, the planet does not lack the resources needed
to sustain life and has many distinct features. The large oceans spanning
the majority of the surface are teeming with aquatic life, with creatures
occasionally surfacing to hunt birds that land on the surface. The fauna
is well adapted to the tainted atmosphere, often developing internal
filters. Some have evolved to live with the fungal spores instead, forming
a symbiotic relationship with them. For example, the spores attach to
the fur of some creatures and create a thin layer, preventing predators
from attacking due to the horrendous taste of the fungi. Despite the
prolific plant life on the planet, most of the uncultivated plants are toxic.
This makes food scarce within the uninhabited areas and Travellers are
advised to bring their own supply of food.

Biologists on the planet have studied the atmosphere extensively,
having dedicated centuries to negating the effects of the spores.
Younger children and infants are the most vulnerable as their lungs
are not fully formed at birth, resulting in birthdays for children under
the age of five being riotous celebrations. Collaborating with chemical
researchers and offworld engineers, the government of the time (350
years ago), under Hastyr Senar, formed the shower initiative, ensuring
every home would be safe within. The temperate climate of the planet
allows native inhabitants a great deal of freedom of movement, the
equatorial region rarely dropping below 15oC. However, the vaguely
toxic nature of most life makes this more difficult in reality.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The infrastructure of Vrayne is minimal, with only the major families
having truly developed cities. Each of these three cities is situated in
a different region of the planet, intended to work in a unified manner
to the benefit of the planet as a whole, although the fact that they are
each over 1,000km apart makes travel between the three a days-long
affair. Due to the low Tech Level, only those rich enough (and with
good enough connections) are able to afford higher-tech tools, armor
and weapons from merchants at the downport. With no current desire
to leave the planet, the population relies on travelling merchants for
most of their advancement. As a result of this, technological innovation

has all but halted, the engineers becoming complacent due to lack
of necessity. To some this is unacceptable and there is a sizeable
group who believe only technology made on Vrayne should be used
on Vrayne. This is ridiculous in practise, as compared to the rest of
Charted Space they are primitive and have only a few varieties of crops
to offer the interstellar market.

Leaving the planet is decidedly difficult and if you are born there, you
are very unlikely to leave. Some children of influential families are
sent to spend one term in the Imperial Navy or IISS, which is seen as
an opportunity for personal growth. Some outliers have succeeded
in leaving the planet aboard merchant ships as deckhands but this is
rare. It is unwise to travel here without a ship of your own, as most are
unwilling to take a Traveller from Vrayne on the off chance it breaks
some centuries old religious decree.

Other than the cities built and run by the three major families, only
small towns exist on the planet. Roads are just unpaved paths worn
down by frequent use and no centralised governmental buildings
exist. These towns have minimal access to technology as it can only
be purchased at the Laynora stronghold, often coming at exorbitant
prices, with sales heavily monitored to ensure the populace remains in
hand. Society functions as it has for hundreds of years, the feudalistic
nature having locked most of the population in poverty, with little room
for social advancement within the Poltar and Laynora lands. Senar
provides more leeway for its’ subjects and most are either farmhands,
scientists or soldiers.

There is no centralised government on the planet, with the ruling family
instead granting swathes of land at the time of their installation to
power. The current government is the longest running in the planet’s
history, having lasted for 263 standard years. This has allowed the
populace to become complacent and the government no longer sees
a threat in revolution. During the ‘forgotten era’ of the planet, rebellions
were near-constant, occurring every four months on average.

THE FORGOTTEN ERA
This era is now out of the public eye, only persisting in late-night radio
shows broadcasted to a handful of listeners and whispered to children
by elders. Any divergence from the current regime is dangerous and the
inhabitants of Vrayne must constantly be on guard, as a neighbor could
go to their local lord at any point. The separation of land into fiefdoms
allows a greater degree of autonomy for individual lords but it should be
remembered they are often not entirely accepting of the current family in
power. These titles are hereditary and cannot be revoked once granted.

Feudal lords such as Frell Senar are descendants of previous leaders
and resentment has been passed down through the generations,
moulding it into something uglier than ever before. Small acts of defiance
are common, with House Senar refusing to pay tithe to House Poltar for a

number of months. Due to the lack of a planetary army these are usually
left unchallenged, with Frell pretending it was simply an accounting error.
As challenges like this have gone uncontested for the past few decades,
the strength of the oligarchy is seen to be in decline.

The issue of rebellion lies in the fact that the leader of the world is also
the head of the church. After centuries of indoctrination by the current
government the families are heavily concerned with public opinion, as
the current leader has been in power for more than 40 years. The head
of the family, Alder Trimmel Poltar, has installed the rest of his family
as councilmembers and the second day of each month is dedicated to
hosting the leaders of the other families. This is a point of controversy
as the previous three months’ audiences have been cancelled, leaving
them without a formal platform for grievances to be heard.

```
NOTABLE REBELS
•  Hiarent Laynora – This rebellion was caused by the offence
of being barred entry to the Senar stronghold, after which
Hiarent raised 20,000 militiamen. He was shot upon exiting
the hall after his coronation, due to his natural unlikability.
•  Spivar Poltar – One of the finest examples of a political dinner
going wrong, Spivar was not given an equal amount of food
to everyone else and promptly rebelled. His reign lasted for
three months and eight days, after which he was overthrown.
•  Qumen Senar – After the death of her mother Qumen was
unstable at best and her servants removing the drapes from
the window before the customary eight months drove her to
complete madness. She rebelled with 120,000 militiamen and
mercenaries, who proceeded to overthrow her after realising
quite how insane she had become. Her reign lasted only five
days and 5,000 ‘offenders’ were killed during this time.
```

RELIGION
Locals refer to the religion of Vrayne as ‘Oshnare’ and no Anglic
translation of this word has been attempted.

Religion is an integral part of daily life on the planet, with all offworlders
passing through an anointment pool in the center of the downport. The
process involves a ritual chant and a member of the church offering a
drop of blood to the Traveller by slicing the tip of their forefinger with a
ceremonial blade. When reading the scripture of the church it becomes
apparent this is due to the belief that in doing so, they have welcomed

the stranger in and hold no intentions to harm them. This might seem
odd to a casual visitor but to the native populace it is a general practice
done to show good faith, likely a result of the constant violent rebellions
of the past. The official will be decidedly blunter to any non-human
Traveller, due to the vaguely xenophobic nature of their society and
limited contact with other species. This is not meant as an offence and
if mentioned they will profusely apologise and proffer more blood.

Daily services are mandatory but this is largely unenforced due to
the scattered population, instead relying on community members to
‘snitch’ on their neighbors for non-attendance. This has created an
untrusting attitude within townships and offworlders are still expected
to attend daily services. Not doing so might result in the local militia
being called, who have been known to haul disobedient parties off to
rot in a small, dank cell. As these are built and maintained by each
individual town, their quality varies greatly, with the more secure ones
based underneath the town itself. The smaller towns often simply use
converted outhouses and prisoners can expect to be left both cold and
hungry. The churches are open spaces, often directly next to a source
of water, with semi-circular seating facing a small dais upon which the
speaker stands. This is done to maximise the connection to nature, the
belief being that inside worship is less effective.

The speakers hold no rank within church hierarchy, and anyone could
theoretically speak at a service if they so wished, but often more powerful
families send members to the dais. This is done as a display of both
intelligence and power and allows them to spread a beneficial rhetoric
unchallenged, as it is punishable by death to interrupt a speaker. This
is officially enforced the same as non-attendance, although centuries
of indoctrination have led to occurrences of the public taking action into
their own hands. Travellers should be aware of this when attending a
church service as even minor noises such as coughing could class as an
interruption, depending on how easily distracted the speaker is.

There is no ‘divine being’ in Oshnare and the religion has placed
nature above any single or multifaceted deity. In this way, Oshnare
may be categorised as animistic. The church has no strict hierarchy,
although there is a sect of women chosen as mouthpieces who travel
to settlements to preach. As Oshnare has been in development since
the beginning of intelligent life on the planet, it features rigid customs
that Travellers will be blindsided by at some point; something as simple
as not inclining the head when offered food will be taken as great
disrespect. Oshnare describes the relationship of the populace with
the fungal spores as one of safeguarding. By limiting how quickly the
population can grow, natural life may remain relatively untouched by the
often-wasteful nature of humanity.

Generally speaking, Oshnare does not limit much activity on the planet.
The few religious doctrines that exist only do so to limit the strain of
manufacturing and infrastructure on natural spaces. Waste refuse is

almost non-existent, with recycling and reusing materials being much
more common means of disposal. Nature is prized above all within
Oshnare and the scripture only provides minimal details on how its
believers should live. Helping your community and planet are highly
praised but there are few restricted actions. This, thankfully, leaves
Oshnare open to personal interpretation; although as always there are
a small number of narrow-minded speakers who have platforms within
their local communities.

```
OSHNARE AND TRAVELLERS
Travellers should be aware of the sometimes-disproportionate
responses to waste given by followers of Oshnare. The religion’s
pervasive grip on the population has a widespread effect on
how they see the world, especially in regard to those visiting the
planet. Whilst on other planets stepping on some moss or plucking
a flower would be ignored, such is not the case on Vrayne.
All natural elements are considered when making decisions,
particularly involving infrastructure. Whilst this is an idealistic view
of nature, it has had detrimental effects throughout the history of
the planet, with a Traveller by the name of Breeke Kaweref being
hauled off to rot in a prison cell for throwing a food wrapper on the
ground after he had finished eating.
```

```
However, this intolerance of natural destruction becomes more
reasonable when you take the planet’s natural resources and
cultural/religious history into account. Despite the tumultuous
relationship with the toxic spores in the air, the planet has abundant
natural resources available to the population and as of yet they
have seen no need to take to the skies in order to find more.
Therefore, for the people of Vrayne, particularly followers of
Oshnare, their planet is the sole provider of all things they hold dear.
```

HOUSE POLTAR
Having existed throughout the known history of the planet, the Poltar family
is the reigning oligarchy. The head of the family, Alder Trimmel Poltar, is the
public face of the regime. This is a widespread practice on Vrayne, with the
speaker often being the eldest family member, leading them to be seen as
the head of state. It is widely believed the assassination of Alder Trimmel
would cripple the rest of his family and allow a new family to take control.
Discussions are currently ongoing to this effect.

House Poltar was once considered the most devout of all the vying
families, although this has become less evident in recent years. Alder
Trimmel is known to have a variety of concubines throughout his lands

and has fallen out of favor with the more devoted members of House
Senar. Every member of the Poltar oligarchy have the hand of the flag
tattooed onto their collarbones, done as a display of faith with each being
live streamed across the planet. These are done only when the family
member becomes part of the ruling council at 22 years of age, after
which time they have equal say over the policies enacted upon Vrayne.

Inhabiting their ancestral home of Larchan buried in the south-eastern
mountain range, the Poltar are fair skinned, with mousey brown hair
and dark eyes. They wear the ruling colour of purple and can often be
seen in unflattering robes that smother their true shapes. When visiting
other major families, they have been described as abrupt and strange,
and many no longer trust they understand the daily issues faced by
the populace. Food shortages have become common due to more
aggressive varieties of fungal spores, to which the crops grown are no
longer resistant. This is seen by some as a curse resulting from Alder
Trimmel’s recent departure from piety.

Wishing to retain the old ways is admirable to most but as it is done to
spite technological advancement Alder Trimmel is quickly falling out
of favor with the other heads of houses, specifically Mikra Laynora.
His deviation from Oshnare is a point of contention to Frell Senar,
chosen to lead her house specifically for her commitment to religion.
Travellers will be unlikely to meet a member of the oligarchy outside of
their ancestral home due to an increased wariness of assassination,
although their faces can be seen smiling down from holographic
displays dotted around even the smallest of townships.

HOUSE SENAR
Frell Senar is a domineering young woman, having recently taken
over from her father upon his death. Whilst succession typically falls
to the eldest child, House Senar have implemented a form of elective
succession wherein all blood relatives vote on who they wish to lead.
Frell was chosen due to her strong religious beliefs and extraordinary
military prowess shown during her two terms in the Imperial Navy. As
they retain the largest population both within their city of Anghertz and
the plains of the planet, House Senar has the closest to what could be
called a considerable fighting force. This is bolstered using a sizeable
portion of the money provided by Mikra Laynora to equip them with
rudimentary armor and weaponry.

This military advancement has not gone unnoticed by Alder Trimmel, who
has been making more diplomatic visits in order to enact negotiations
with Frell. To put it lightly, these have not gone well. On one occasion as
his carriage departed the town it was pelted with rotten fungi, one of the
gravest manners of disrespect possible.

Senar maintains the largest farmlands on the planet, the genetically
engineered plants obtained by Laynora growing prosperously in the nutrient
rich soil. With their position as the owners of the starport, House Laynora has
been able to purchase technology that synthesises seeds in order to make
them immune to the growth of spores Trade between Laynora and Senar
has been prolific in recent years, with both families recognizing the need to
support each other in the loss of direction from Poltar.

This trade has included the funding of military buildings on Senar land, with
barracks now housing up to 50,000 soldiers, the largest standing army the
planet has ever seen. The rest of the money provided has been dedicated to
technological advancement, those educated under House Senar receiving
grants to enter scientific fields such as robotics, genetics and physics.
Engineering is one of the most commonly entered areas of study, with
those who become proficient regarded as the future of Senar and indeed
Vrayne itself. Being the center of research has its advantages and the fertility
rates here are the highest on the planet, with a variety of low-tech genetic
modification practises in place. Nutrition has been widely studied by the
scientists here and House Senar retains much of the best food for itself.
However, some believe that Laynora has been falsifying their accounts, with
the income from crops slowly diminishing over previous years.

Increased restrictions are being enacted upon the populace here, with
even the younger society members being trained as soldiers. This provides
a greater amount of risk to Trimmel, as he is now potentially facing a
rather more perilous fighting force. Four generals have been appointed
under Frell’s rule, each leading a section of the Senar army and imposing
their own protocols upon them. The constant military drills are becoming
impossible to ignore, with the inhabitants of the Poltar lands discussing the
possibility of rebellion when they believe they will not be overheard.

HOUSE LAYNORA
Thanks to its position on the main ocean of the world that hosts the
downport, Laynora is the most advanced, due to the stream of merchants
passing through, from whom the house has acquired cutting-edge
technology. The downport of Piirn has developed into a floating city in its
own right. It is steadied in place with gravitic thrusters and was purchased
at great cost from a nearby system by one of the previous governments.
Most of the populace remains in awe of the city, it being the most complex
of systems to exist planetside.

The Laynora are the richest of the major families due to their position at the
forefront of interstellar trade and are the main contributor to the oligarchy
due to the inflated cost of tithes. This is no longer at 10% of their income
and is actually set at 20%, a current point of contention as House Laynora
believes they are funding a leader of dubious religious devotion.

Whilst they are the least religiously strict of the major houses, the pretence
of devotion is seen as worse than being honest. In retaliation to this the
current oligarchy has spread the rhetoric that Laynora no longer cares
about Oshnare and are instead slaves to the money obtained at the
downport, replacing religion with technology. The head of House Laynora,
Mikra, is an aging man with few children, instead having devoted his time
to push trade. The populace of the downport have a differing view of him,
as he is seen as the person who raised them from their outdated culture,
bringing them into a new age of innovation and wealth.

Alder Trimmel has recently been broadcasting defamatory videos
whenever possible, decrying Mikra as a cruel figure who intends to
remove Oshnare from the face of Vrayne. This is attributable to his
interest in infrastructure, most of which has been obtained by traders at
the downport. House Laynora has even acquired contracts with nearby
planetary governments to build new facilities, including roads and a
university. Collaborating closely with the engineers of House Senar,
the two major families aim to complete a number of grand construction
projects over the next three decades that will change the function of
the society almost entirely. Seen by the majority as callous, those in
smaller towns refuse to move to the cities in line to be developed, as
this urbanization opposes core tenets of Oshnare.

It is widely believed that by visiting merchants that, should something
happen to the current oligarchy, Laynora would be the best placed to
take over. They have spent generations brokering deals on behalf of the
planet, including the placement of holographic displays in most towns.
Recently, Mikra has reduced his tithe payments back to the usual
10%, instead sending the excess to House Senar in order to develop
their own technology. The only issue herein is that the leader of House
Senar, Frell, does not believe Mikra cares for Oshnare and if given the
chance he would destroy the religion entirely in the name of progress.

VISITING VRAYNE
In order to integrate themselves with the population of Vrayne,
Travellers may find that attending a religious ceremony is a viable
option. Provided they are aware and respectful of local customs, they
will be encouraged to follow the festivities to a local tavern. Have
the Travellers make a series of Carouse or Diplomat checks at such
events, using the Effect of each check to enhance additional checks.
In this way, a series of checks can be made that will help integrate the
Travellers within the local populace.

Additionally, the people of Vrayne will be especially receptive to those
Travellers who wish to involve themselves with religious practices
derived from Oshnare. Assisting community members in repairing
broken holo screens, defective showers and buildings that are falling
apart by means of an Engineer, Electronics or Mechanic check. Doing
so means the items need not be discarded and the population may
even offer up useful items without cost in repayment for their aid.

If Travellers are set on visiting Vrayne, it is important to be aware of
local customs and the importance of Oshnare. Despite their rather
xenophobic outlook, the population are not intentionally rude to
outsiders; they merely have not experienced many. By the Travellers
attending religious services, birth ceremonies and assisting the
population, there is a great chance that the people of Vrayne may
change their mind about those visiting the planet.

##### The Sword of Oberon

**By Geir Lanesskog**

The Sword of Oberon may only be a myth, based on little more than
a clerical error and some wishful thinking, or it may be part of a
grand conspiracy. The only known ‘fact’ is that a mothballed Cemplas
dreadnaught named Kaskii disappeared from the inventory of the
Imperial Navy’s Deneb Sector Depot sometime around the year 1100.
The 288,000-ton warship was active in the last years of the Solomani
Rim War a century earlier. The ship – designed around a massive
spinal mount mass driver gun, supplemented by 16 large missile and
torpedo bays, and 16 100-ton mass driver, particle and fusion bays

- was specifically designed to crack bypassed Solomani worlds with
overwhelming firepower. Capable of only jump-3 and 5G acceleration,
the warship could not keep up with a fast-moving modern Imperial
fleet and these characteristics, plus the infamy of being responsible
for the destruction of megatons of orbital infrastructure and
bombardments costing tens of millions of lives, turned the entire class
into something of a pariah. All Cemplas ships were either mothballed
or scrapped by the 1030s.

Only one of these ships, Kaskii, was mothballed at the Deneb Depot.
It was recorded as present in the inventory conducted in 1098 and not
counted in the subsequent inventory of 1101. It is uncertain whether
it was ever present or if its disposal at some earlier date was poorly
documented because of incompetency or corruption. The Third
Imperium is a vast decentralised bureaucratic organization and it would
be far from the first time that an object as large as a dreadnaught
vanished in the paperwork.

Within some circles in the Stormhaven Republic, the rumor persists
that agents of the likely apocryphal Order of the Thirteenth Expedition
stole the vessel and transported it to a secret base somewhere in The
Beyond. There, the ship – renamed in honor of a world long lost to
Aslan expansion – waits in preparation for a strike against Aslan clans
who, according to some versions of the rumor, have not signed the
Peace of Kaiear, or, in other versions, have signed it but do not take the
treaty seriously, or – yet others claim – have in some way offended this
mythical secret Storm Knight Order. Some stories have Imperial Navy
sympathisers as co-conspirators. Others credit or blame GeDeCo. In
any case, the starship would destabilize the entire region if it were ever
crewed and put into action.

If it exists at all.

##### Ragno

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Developed by a smaller planetary government, this vehicle is designed
to strike and hide, having no additional armor but equipped with
eight legs. Designed to look like an arachnid, the Ragno is capable of
extracting spies from dangerous situations before covertly blending
back into the wilds. Built for two crew, team leaders can sometimes be
ensconced within the command center, provided they remain there for
the duration of the mission. As the main use of this vehicle is in covert
operations, the rotary autocannon exists simply as a means of self-
defence in case the mission goes awry. It was only used for a small
number of years before a more agile version was developed.

##### Spacecraft as Benefits

**By Matthew Sprange**

Some Travellers are lucky enough to get their hands on a spacecraft
when they muster out from their careers; delipidated, full of quirks and
mortgaged to the hilt but a spacecraft ready for adventure. The space-
craft gained depends on the career followed but there is a huge variety
of spacecraft making their way across Charted Space and Travellers
always like something a little unusual.

Instead of using the ships presented in the Traveller Core Rulebook,
the Referee can instead opt to substitute them with the vessels in this
article. Some may be substantially more valuable than the original ship
but this will often mean higher mortgage and maintenance costs, which
are not so easily overcome.

#### EncounterEncounter

##### Chieftain Neandor

By Tim Heiderich

Neandor was only a boy when the visitor dropped from the sky. It was a giant
stone but fell like a feather. Its surface was polished and smooth as if it had
_lain in some majestic river for eons. It spewed fire and smoke as it touched_
the shore of his tribe’s settlement. While the elders deliberated into the night
over what to do with it, Neandor was entranced by the lights that shone out
of the holes in the gigantic gemstone. He crept from his family’s reed shelter
and down to the shoreline where the strange monolith lay.

_He could see the light of a campfire escaping through a hole in the rock
face. Inside the stone there was no fire, yet it was bright like the dawn.
He saw a man, dressed in ornate hides that shimmered like fish scales,
staring into a box of embers that flashed and danced as he touched the_
surface in front of him.

Neandor’s gasp caused the visitor to whirl around and he started to run
before tripping over the opening in the rock entrance. The visitor dashed
out after Neandor, making low whooping sounds and holding his hands out
to show he was unarmed. The visitor produced a small packet wrapped in
_a leaf and offered it to Neandor. The visitor pantomimed tearing at the leaf_
and eating its contents. Neandor tore open the leaf, took a bite and spat
it out – it was like the bark of a tree. However the inside of the leaf caught
his attention, it was shiny like the surface of the ocean at midday, the
_moonlight it reflected changing shape as he crinkled and unfolded it._

The visitor held out his hand and helped Neandor back inside the stone
vessel, to tend to his injury. The visitor shared gifts of tools and textiles,
spending many days speaking to the elders, asking questions about
the tribe and their history. Neandor learned the visitor called himself a
‘sole man’, evidently the last of his people. It was after the next cycle of
seasons, during the new growth, when the visitor returned. The tribe took
pity on the lonesome wanderer, giving him supplies for what they believed
was a fruitless search for his own kind. He would spend days listening to
their stories and their songs, while he tended to glowing totems of his own
culture. He said they were to protect, or preserve, the legends they told.

Years went by and Neandor grew into a man, now with a family of his own.
The story of the visitor was one he told his children. He was chieftain of his
tribe when the visitor again returned. When he again sat down to speak

with the elders, Neandor saw a frailty in the man he had not seen before,
his hair now thin and grey. When his children were nearly grown, Neandor
decided to join the visitor – with his help, his search might end and he
would no longer need to return to the tribe for aid. Hardest to convince was
his wife but he insisted his family would be there to care for her and he
would only be gone one cycle of the seasons.

Neandor could never have been prepared for the variety of cultures and
lifeforms he and the visitor encountered in the vast black sea outside his
_home world. Many were much like himself, others more different than he_
could have imagined. It was when they landed on a water world similar to his
own that the visitor’s travels came to an end. The worn vessel malfunctioned
during descent; the visitor tried his best to land the crippled boat, bringing it
to a skidding halt on an island on a red-zoned world. The only survivor of the
crash, Neandor understood he was now the lonely wanderer.

He buried his old friend and set up an encampment from the downed
craft. In the following weeks, he fashioned an outrigger canoe to
venture further from the shipwreck and discovered a pod of Githiaskio;
intelligent cephalopods who had chosen this world as their new home.
It has been many years since Neandor’s ship crashed and he used
the skills in Xenology the visitor had taught him to communicate with
the Githiaskio, having befriended two adolescents, Achoblaata and
Nuurekhuloo, who are his companions and defenders.

Travellers may meet Neandor on an aquatic world in a red zone, with
his outrigger canoe and spear. He leads Travellers to the wreck of a
crashed starship – it is unsalvageable after sitting in ocean water for
years. Inside are a number of mostly empty crates, pilfered of food and
clothes. Some trinkets and basic tools remain. On the ship’s computer
are several ethnographic logs from a variety of worlds and the walls are
covered in drawings depicting his personal history. He speaks broken
Anglic, his speech punctuated with squeaks and clicks, the sounds
recognized by his underwater adoptive community.

He misses his family greatly and tearfully pleads for the Travellers
to return him to his home world, although he only has his meagre
possessions and Cr2000 scattered around the ship to trade.

What Neandor does not know is that the derelict Starbright is registered
to the deceased Doctor Milles of the IISS, insured against loss, with
Neandor as its sole beneficiary. Turning this information over to the
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service will avail Neandor of four ship shares
in compensation. He has no need for them and will gladly turn the
shares over to the Travellers in exchange for passage home.

If given the opportunity to
leave, his two Githiaskio
friends would like to
join him, to explore the
stars themselves. They
are excellent starship
crew, possessing high
intelligence, and are agile
in zero gravity. Neandor
himself is a skilled warrior
with bladed weapons, is
highly adaptable and a fast
learner. Although loyal to
those who help him, he
does not seek adventure,
only wishing to return home.

##### Musical Instruments

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Charted Space is filled with a wealth of cultures, each with their own
interpretations of the musical arts. Some of the more dexterous species
use stringed instruments plucked to a strict musical structure, others
see music as a discordant symphony and more still use percussive
instruments slapped with any manner of limb.

HURDY-GURDY
The hurdy-gurdy was born on ancient Terra, used by folk and street
musicians in the courts of kings. The basic structure consists of three
elements: a set of melody and drone strings, a wheel operated by a
crank and a small keyboard. Most mass-produced versions are made
of metal but expensive versions are still made of wood. Speakers are
in-built, meaning the sound carries across even mid-sized starships.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Hurdy-gurdy 4 0.5 Cr700
```

KAKAXXEER
This is a set of percussive drums designed to rest on a harness on the
forward torso of the K’kree. Three drums rest under the arms, each with
a differing pitch. Used when hunting G’naak, these war-drums inspire
fear in those who hear them shortly before the onslaught of K’kree
warriors. The drum head is made from woven vines, which can also be
plucked to emit distorted notes.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Kakaxxeer 9 2 Cr500
```

YAVERKVYUSS
This is a large instrument panel, featuring over 100 buttons, dials and
switches. Most are polyphonic and suit being played by two Droyne
at a time. A set of keys sits at the base of the machine, the sound of
which can be changed into a variety of synthetic noises at the push of a
button. Common practise is to play a melody, add a reverb and loop it.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Yaverkvyuss 12 5 Cr2500
```

AUNTRUPUKYULK
Oft carried by Droyne whilst they ‘do the things that they are doing’,
this is a miniature synthesiser designed to keep morale high on
longer journeys. It has 10 keys and although it has a smaller number
of features, tone, pitch, reverb and looping buttons are still common.
When you blow the side of the device, the reeds inside vibrate to
produce sound, each of which can be individually tuned.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Auntrupukyulk 10 0.2 Cr350
```

AESANGAGH
A small handheld instrument initially designed for young Vargr, the
Aesangagh has thin sheets plucked to create music. These are made
from braided metal strings, in order to prevent snapping and the Vargr
claim they provide a higher range of sounds than human guitars.
Adult versions have dials to adjust the notes being played and such
instruments are played when sects of Vargr are infighting.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Aesangagh 12 0.5 Cr400
```

OUNGOG
A delicate instrument used to honor Aslan ancestors and ask for their
blessings, the Oungog is used before their Shrine of Heroes. Melodies
range from melancholic to rousing, weaving the stories of their
ancestors into the notes they play. The instrument has six holes along
its body, which can be covered to change the note. More intricate,
jewelled designs are common for the wives of family leaders.

```
Item TL Kg Cost
Oungog 7 0.1 Cr200
```

GLILMAN
This is the Gurvin name given to the Hiver instrument. The Glilman is
a series of buttons, often inlaid in the floor of a Federation ship, that
produces sound when pressed. Early designs had five buttons but
newer models feature upwards of 25 and can be programmed with
different sounds. This music appears discordant to most other species
but Hiver larvae and yearlings appear to enjoy it. When without a Voder,
Hivers may use the Glilman to convey simple thoughts and ideas by
way of ‘dancing’ on the instrument.

Item TL Kg Cost
Glilman 13 10 Cr1000

##### Zéno Paradise

By Tim Heiderich

Location: Karnika (A755976C), Perite subsector, Core
**Suggested Skills:** Admin, Art, Broker, Carouse, Persuade
Reward: Cr2000 (additional bonuses available)

After 80 years, rock god Zéno Paradise, the androgynous musician
from the Lancian Cultural Region, is on his farewell tour, playing
concerts at sector capitals between the Gushemege and Core sectors.
Zéno, his band, their manager and promoter, have been touring the
sector in Fairlight, a far trader modified with a recording studio, luxury
amenities and storage.

A miscommunication at their last stop in Loshad means several tons of
cargo containers are missing and Zéno is refusing to perform tonight’s
show without his equipment. The tour has been wildly successful, with
prime seats selling for over Cr8000 and his promoter Kip Hartmann is
frantically looking for solutions.

The Travellers’ ship is indisposed, either being refuelled, repaired or loaded
with freight, making this a great opportunity to earn some quick cash.

BACKGROUND
As the crew arrives at the highport, the comms channels are abuzz with
excitement over tonight’s show. There are several nobles, dilettantes
and members of high society at the station, indicated by the vast
number of yachts and pleasure craft in the docking bay. Holovids carry
more information about tonight’s show, with details about the illustrious
career of this enigmatic, genre-defining – and genre-defying – musician.

A message comes through the open starship comms from tour manager
Kip Hartmann: there are some problems with tonight’s show. He is
recruiting Travellers for a few hours’ work assisting him finding some
missing equipment vital to the performance. He is offering Cr2000, plus
bonuses, for less than a day’s work.

THE SITUATION
Once the Travellers have agreed to assist Mr. Hartmann, he transmits
to them a ‘rider’ – a list of requirements an artist makes that must be
met before they agree to perform. He then transfers the purchase

proxy program (3P or ‘threep’) to their personal computers. Kip uses
the software to transfer Cr1000 to each of the Travellers’ personal
accounts, with more to come at the end of the day.

As the Travellers are not the only ones helping find missing items, Kip’s
assistant Sisi will work with the group, approving purchases, receiving
goods and paying the Travellers at the end of the mission. She can
be found at the stage door of the venue, a woman in her thirties with
a commdot headset. She does not make idle chat with the hired crew,
only marking what they have and what they need. If she seems curt, it
is because she is short on time and her attention is spread very thin.

It is 12:00 station time and Zéno is scheduled to perform in eight hours.

EXPLORING THE HIGHPORT
The highport has a medium Law Level, meaning visitors can move
about freely but no one is walking around heavily armed or armored.
Anyone seen causing a disturbance is met by the station’s security
team, who wear flak jackets and are armed with autopistols and stun
batons. Security is tighter today because of the presence of nobility.

There is a central directory of the station’s commercial and residential
areas, which can be navigated with a Routine (6+) Admin check to find
specific information about the station, its districts, shops or inhabitants.

The highport is formed of concentric rings, with an innermost residential
level, a middle layer dedicated to commercial space and an outermost
deck for shipping and docking. The outer is connected to the station’s
administrative center via elevator shafts. The administration core is
restricted to the public and the residential deck is limited to residents
with key cards but the commercial and freight levels are open to all.

Zéno will be playing a 6,000-seat venue in the entertainment complex
that evening when the station enters the planet’s shadow.

NEGOTIATING AND SHOPPING
Hartmann will not negotiate with the Travellers on prices or extra
expenses, nor will his assistant Sisi.

Sisi furnishes each Traveller with a backstage pass, which can be traded
to sweeten any deal in the Traveller’s favor using a Very Difficult (12+)
Persuade check. Once this has been done the pass is lost.

Nefarious Travellers attempting to short-circuit the adventure by
reselling all the passes and skipping out on their tasks will land their
Travellers in hot water with both the promoter and the recipient of
the passes. The passes are non-transferable and will implicate the
group as fraudulent, for which the station will gladly prosecute them.
Discourage this by emphasising that the passes are a chance of a
lifetime to rub shoulders with rock royalty.

Be aware of the passage of time, as the Travellers have only eight
hours to complete their tasks before the show. Items can be pursued in
any order, either individually or as a group.

Starship Repair Parts
Purchasing one ton of starship parts from the station’s commercial
shipyards should easy but the clerk at the desk says there has
been high demand with all the ships in port and regrets to inform
Travellers that they are sold out until tomorrow. He points out a
starship captain in the hangar loading a ton of parts onto an air/raft,
having just bought the last lot.

The captain is adamant against selling the parts. His free trader was
riddled with laser fire when evading pirates in the last system and
needs to be repaired fast or the late fees on this run negate his profits.
He does not have time to lose.

His crew is green and he gripes that his young engineer is always
asking to ‘take extra time’ when making repairs. He would like
someone more skilled to repair his craft. He needs at most 0.5 tons to
fix his ship and exchanging repair work for any leftover parts sounds
like a fair deal to him. The repairs take 1D hours; use the rules for
starship repairs (Traveller Core Rulebook, page 159) to determine
whether extra parts are left over.

Still the crew may beg other ships for parts. After an hour, this turns up
a number of lots equal to the Effect of an Average (8+) Broker check,
at D3 x 0.1 tons each, for sale at 10% over the base price of Cr10000
per 0.1 tons. Haggling with each captain can reduce the price 5% for
every point of Effect on an Average (8+) Broker check. Brokering is key,
as Hartmann will not pay over base price. Gathering each part takes 15
minutes. Afterwards, Travellers must transport the parts to Sisi.

```
RIDER ON THE STORM
Zéno Paradise requires the following items in order to perform tonight:
- One ton starship repair parts
- Six bottles Dom Lishun ‘63 champagne
- Five bags Starchocs (no green ones)
- Chromatophone, finely tuned
- Exotic party guests
- Recreational drugs
```

**Six Bottles of Champagne**
A Routine (6+) Admin check of the commercial directory finds a suitable
wine cellar among the vendors; the Small Mercies Cellar, which
specialises in rare and premium vintages. It is operated by a sommelier
named DeLantis, who hosts wine tastings for noble clients.

DeLantis is snobbish and requires a Difficult (10+) SOC check to
improve his disdain for the lowly Travellers. He tuts at the Cr200 bottles
of Dom Lishun ‘63 champagne the Travellers ask for, stating ‘If it’s not
from the Parsi subsector of Vland, it’s just sparkling wine. Perhaps a
Brut de Vland, Coreward Crémant or Liradu Blanc?’ These cost Cr300
and are not what was requested.

An Average (8+) Steward check alerts the Travellers that DeLantis
is preparing a tasting of the more expensive bottles. Failure means
the Travellers will not know they are being sold bottles of vintage
champagne as DeLantis offers each one to sample. If the initial SOC
check is failed, DeLantis attempts to overcharge for the bottles by Cr50
each but an Average (8+) Steward check catches him.

Regardless of which bottles are purchased, either Zéno is impressed by
the better champagne selection, or Hartmann is pleased he got exactly
what he asked for, so either selection is ultimately a success.

**Five Bags Starchocs**
Starchocs are a popular multi-coloured, candy-coated chocolate that
can be found at any convenience store but for reasons known only
to him, Zéno does not like the green ones. He wants five bags of
Starchocs, which can be purchased for Cr4 each, with the green ones
removed. Whether done alone or working together this takes one
hour, minus 10 minutes for each cumulative point of DEX DM, with a
minimum of 10 minutes.

Sisi will be relieved when they are brought to her but will not have any
idea why they are so important either.

Chromatophone
What is a chromatophone? An Average (8+) Art (instrument) check
identifies it as a complex musical device used in stage shows to create
dazzling audio-visual effects. It has both a keyboard and a projection
unit, which can each be carried by one person.

There is an out-of-the-way music boutique on the station with a
chromatophone visible right from the window. But the shop is closed.
The street is unoccupied and relatively secluded but an Average (8+)

Investigate check shows the store does have a security system, which
requires a Formidable (14+) Electronics (computers) check (INT) to
bypass. If the silent alarm is tripped, armed security will respond. The
Travellers can break in and run off with the instrument but a stolen
chromatophone suddenly appearing in tonight’s show is very suspicious
and will surely lead back to them.

An Average (8+) Carouse or Admin check finds the shop owner, Ikri
Sewell, is a local musician. He has closed early because he has a
performance at 17:00 at the Teir-Turl Café, a small music club. He
shows up to the cafe to play for two hours before going home. He is
recognizable by the vibrant blue guitar case he carries. He is a big fan
of Zéno and can be persuaded to cancel his gig to tune and rent out the
chromatophone for a fee (paid by Hartmann), plus another Cr500 for
cancelling tonight’s gig but he would much rather have a backstage pass.

Exotic Party Guests
Zéno likes to mingle with exotic, beautiful sophonts of any gender and
species... he is very open-minded. After 30 minutes at an upscale bar
or club, a Traveller can identify a number of potential guests to invite to
the afterparty equal to the Effect of an Average (8+) Carouse check.

Each potential guest has a SOC of 1D+6. Their SOC value is the
difficulty of convincing them to come to the party using a Persuade
check. A check may be attempted on each guest every 15 minutes.
Give the names of the guests to Sisi and she will record them on the
guest list, awarding a Cr100 bonus for each point of SOC a guest has
above 8 – so it may be wise to be fussy. There are several venues on
the station to visit: Power Port, Starfield’s, Jumpspace Lounge, Vargr
Room and Core.

**Recreational Drugs**
The stims and mind-expanding drugs Zéno enjoys are illegal on
this station. Finding a dealer takes one hour and a Difficult (10+)
Streetwise check. Failing this check leads to the inquiring Traveller
being arrested by a plainclothes security officer, who keeps them
at a holding facility for the next two hours, before releasing them
with a Cr300 fine, free to try again. A Difficult (10+) Advocate check
convinces the officer to not fine the Traveller.

While in the holding cell, the incarcerated Traveller meets a drug dealer.
His name is Brun Skez and he insists he was arrested on a loitering
charge, which curiously carries the same Cr300 drug-related fine. He
will help the Traveller if he is also bailed out.

For Cr2000 Skez sells the Traveller enough recreational drugs to keep
a party going for hours.

On the way to make the drop-off to Sisi, whoever is suspected of
holding the drugs is accosted by two junkies with Melee (blade) 1, one
with a blunt pipe (2D-2) and another with a knife (1D+2), who attempt to
steal the stash.

RESOLUTION
When it approaches 20:00 and all the items are in, Sisi pays the
Travellers, including the following bonuses:
- Cr2000 for one ton of parts
- Cr200/bottle of champagne
- Cr1500 for Starchocs
- Cr3000 for the chromatophone
- Cr100 + Cr100/SOC 9+ per party guest
- Cr2000 for drugs

The Travellers are then free to enjoy the show and mingle backstage
afterwards, where they meet one of the sector’s biggest musicians and
party all night. Guests, including Travellers, then retire to Fairlight for
continued festivities.

Some days later, the crew emerges, exhausted, from a haze of partying
in a bed, on a luxury couch, at a piano, in a fresher, a vacc suit or an
empty cargo bay, amidst vaguely-familiar faces and fuzzy memories.
One of the Travellers finds a crumpled note in an unexpected place,
handwritten by Zéno, thanking them for the wildest party he has had in
this subsector. He wrote down his contact details but the ink has been
hopelessly blurred by spilled drinks. What the Travellers recall of the
wild evening will be their most exciting memories for years to come.

##### Enythba

(magnus lolligo)
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Native to Chesapeake (Splendour, Neworld), the enythba is a gargantuan
aquatic animal. Preferring to live in the lower depths of the oceans, enythba
do not require oxygen to survive and suffer at lower pressures. Enythba
hunt large ocean animals by stunning the prey, trapping it in two large front
pincers before ripping it apart. Tentacles that are lost do not grow back and
the enythba has been known to cannibalise these lost limbs.

Enythba are able to sequester themselves in surprisingly small places.
Their limbs fold close to their body and they appear to ‘deflate’,
drastically reducing their size. The only solid part on their body are
the pincers, which can be seen protruding from underwater caves.
Adult males are the larger of the species and mating displays are often
violent, leaving competitors dead or seriously injured.

##### Heavy Plant Vehicles

**By Matthew Sprange**

Whether a Traveller is building a new colony from scratch on a far flung
moon or simply re-arranging the local scenery to give them a better view
out of the master bedroom of their holiday retreat, there are several
options that can be fitted to heavy vehicles to move soil and rocks.

Fitting any of the equipment here to a vehicle will typically reduce its
speed by at least one Speed Band, at the discretion of the Referee.

COMPACT EXCAVATOR
A much smaller version of the same attachment found on heavy plant
machinery, this model is intended for small engineering works in lighter
vehicles. Its price puts it in the range of private citizens, although it is
capable of little more than gardening or basic farm work.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Compact Excavator 7 5 Cr2500
```

DEEP DRILL
Designed to drill through the earth to depths in excess of 250 meters, this
drill creates shallow shafts of 10 centimeters wide. To create shafts deeper
than a few meters, the drill can be paused in operation to insert new
lengths into the mechanism, literally lengthening the drill as work goes on.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Deep Drill 7 14 Cr80000
```

DUMPER
An open box bed, typically found at the rear of a vehicle, this
attachment allows a vehicle to be filled with a cargo and then literally
‘dump’ it out at a destination by hydraulically raising one end of the bed.
This is typically used to move earth, minerals or rubbish from one site
to another. The cost is per Space designated for cargo.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Dumper 5 — Cr1000/Space
```

EXCAVATOR
A hydraulic shovel attached to a heavy-duty arm that is designed to
scoop earth to create trenches, wells and the first stages of foundations.
This is a common attachment for working vehicles and is truly versatile,
being able to lay cables or pipes, knock down walls or dredge rivers.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Excavator 5 8 Cr10000
```

LIFT
A cross between a forklift and a crane, this tall attachment can lift objects
far higher than other vehicles can manage, while keeping them stable.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Lift 6 12 Cr20000
```

MULTI-COMBINE
Harvesters using the multi-combine are far more versatile than their
more primitive or specialized cousins. With this attachment, a vehicle
can till soil, plant seed, spray chemicals or fertiliser, harvest, thresh
and even bale. This range of roles means a single vehicle can be
purchased to tackle many tasks, a benefit on border worlds and
colonies. Note that space must be left in the vehicle to store harvested
crops or else a secondary storage vehicle must run alongside the
multi-combine as it works.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Multi-Combine 7 20 Cr40000
```

PILE DRIVER
A very heavy piece of equipment, the pile driver is designed to drive
pole-like structures into the ground. This can be used to quickly create
arrays of telegraph or electrical poles, or large-scale fencing.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Pile Driver 7 20 Cr90000
```

ROAD ROLLER
Constructed of dense metal, sometimes with the capability to fill it with
ballast (typically water) to regulate its weight, the road roller is designed
to crush surfaces flat. It is an extremely popular tool for anyone looking
to create temporary landing areas for spacecraft.

```
Item TL Spaces Cost
Road Roller 4 20 Cr10000

##### Starships of the Spinward Extents

**By Geir Lanesskog**

CONESTOGA FREIGHTER
Hyperion Lines produces a standardised 800-ton armed freighter
for use with its shipping division and for sale to other operators. The
Conestoga freighter is a sturdy, rather utilitarian jump-2 starship.
Only partially streamlined, the Conestoga depends on its Hauler
shuttle for cargo transfer and refuelling operations on worlds without
adequate highports or worlds with atmospheres making the blocky
freighter difficult to land.

The ship’s advertised 400-ton cargo capacity includes 69 tons of
shuttle cargo capacity, which is unavailable during wilderness refuelling
operations. Although equipped with lifters and capable of belly landing
on worlds with little or no atmosphere, the Conestoga’s cargo handling
and cargo access doors are designed to load and offload from the
Hauler shuttle, requiring the shuttle to undock to allow direct access to
the cargo bay doors. When operating in conjunction with its shuttle, the
cargo cranes allow quick access and cargo movement across the split
six meter high lower cargo holds.

The Conestoga’s power plant can support maneuver or jump drives
but not both, requiring the ship to coast during final jump preparations.
The three-level engineering compartment is partially open with lattice
metal floors and access portals allowing easy maintenance access to
both crew and repair drones.

The freighter is armed with four triple turrets, each usually equipped
with two beam lasers and a sandcaster for self-defence. Although
the manifest lists four crew as gunners, they are rarely called upon
to perform this function and primarily work as deck hands performing
maintenance and cargo handling tasks. The ships are able to defend
themselves well from the lone pirate but travel in convoys in more
dangerous territory, often accompanied by a Hyperion Lines escort ship
or – if sold to another operator – an HIS hired warship.

Long tours across circuitous routes are typical of Conestoga operations
and each crew member is assigned an individual stateroom.
Employment with the Hyperion Lines tends to be for the length of a
career, albeit with slow advancement and little chance to become
captain without influence but service aboard a Hyperion Lines ship is a
prestige assignment with good pay and benefits.

The upper or A Deck contains the bridge, all crew quarters and
access to the engineering compartment. As a freighter, the ship is not
designed to carry passengers, although two or three staterooms can
be available if the junior crew doubles up. Two passenger variants
sacrifice either 110 or 220 tons cargo capacity for 20 or 40 passenger
staterooms and supporting space but the lower level passenger
compartments are not well designed and allow only limited access to
the observation gallery on B Deck.

The Conestoga is designed to operate on established routes and is
not well suited to exploratory trade missions, although some captains
choose to disregard its limitations in search of greater profit. Nearly
all losses to piracy, accident or other misadventure have occurred
outside established Hyperion Lines routes or with other operators who
chose to forgo – or cannot afford – escort support in regions such as
the Tellerian Cluster.

HIS employs a few Q-ships based on the Conestoga design to deter
piracy. These ships are usually armed with pulse lasers in visible
batteries and pop-up missile or laser turrets to provide extra firepower.
Although modifications to A Deck and E Deck allow the installation of
concealed drive units that increase acceleration to 4G, the Conestoga
hull design prevents the installation of additional armor or radiation
protection, leaving the Q-ship vulnerable to well-equipped raiding forces.

```
The Hauler shuttle is a sturdy, reliable yet uninspiring example
of Hyperion Lines engineering. The standard Conestoga
freighter relies on these shuttles to transport goods between
surface and orbit. With a utilitarian design, the shuttle has
both a forward loading ramp and side cargo doors for rapid
movement of cargo. The forward section can accommodate
eight passengers even in cargo configuration, and is often
converted to long term cabin space when a Hauler is tasked
with longer duration intersystem operations. While optimized
for cargo handling, design compromises affect performance.

STELLARIS LINER
The Allarton Corporation owns nearly all shipyards within the Trelyn
Domain and produces all but a few speciality starship designs. To
support smaller scale commercial activity for its own operations and
for sale to third parties – with financing provided through the Allarton
Commercial Financing Corporation – Allarton Yards produces the 400-
ton Stellaris liner and derivative Polaris freighter.

The streamlined Stellaris, capable of jump-2 and 2G thrust, is roughly
based on the Third Imperium’s Type-R subsidized merchant. Rather than
providing a generalised freightliner, Allarton has a distinct split between the
Stellaris and Polaris in terms of commercial capabilities. The Stellaris lacks
the Type R’s launch, focusing on planetary landings or highport rendezvous
to provide transfer capabilities. The ship is broader than the Type-R with its
half-cylindrical cross-section fully 12 meters in diameter and correspondingly
shorter with a lesser wingspan to accommodate narrower downport landing
berths. It features rear cargo doors, but with barely 36 tons cargo capacity
this bay is very limited on the Stellaris.

The focus of the Stellaris is passenger transport. The liner specialises
in high-end travel, with two high stateroom suites and an additional
39 staterooms dedicated to passenger service. The Stellaris can
accommodate additional passengers if the four stewards double-bunk
in the crew staterooms on the upper deck.

The Stellaris carries optimized maneuver and jump drives, the latter
produced on Coos for maximum fuel efficiency. These drives provide
superior power and fuel management but require specialized spares
and maintenance available at Allarton-owned shipyards. Advanced
batteries provide power to the jump drive or short-term power to
additional systems such as upgraded sensors or weaponry, allowing
for a smaller power plant capable of running the ship during normal
operations. A collapsible fuel tank able to cover nearly the entire cargo
hold can accommodate fuel for an additional parsec jump, making
three parsec crossings possible, although these are economically
disadvantageous except when transferring between areas of operation.

Unarmed and only lightly armored, the Stellaris comes equipped
with two empty dual turrets; Allarton can provide a variety of weapons
packages as purchase options. The Stellaris crew manifest with a
base of five non-steward personnel including two engineers and does
not make allowances for gunners but Virtual Crew software would
allow automatic operation of turrets, or gunners could double-up with
engineers and stewards if so desired. Limited to civilian sensors and
allocating little power to potential weapons upgrades, the Stellaris is
designed for civilised routes but does have some capacity to defend
itself or flee hostile vessels if necessary.

THORN CORVETTE
The Royal Navy of Bruhkarr’s main external function is commerce
protection and to accomplish this mission it conducts anti-piracy patrols
and provides escort services to Bruhkarri-flagged merchant vessels
travelling beyond the Principality’s borders.

The newest vessel tasked with this duty is the Thorn corvette.
Developed specifically to counter the threat posed by non-
governmental use of the Mapepire Viper interceptor, the Royal Navy
required a ship capable of absorbing hits from sustained fusion gun
fire in close combat and of striking targets at long ranges, neither of
which were strengths of the older Nail corvette, a derivative of the
Imperial patrol corvette design.

The Royal Navy procurement board approved the resultant Thorn
design in 1087 and class namesake prototype vessel began trials in

1093. The initial order for 100 vessels is still being fulfilled by yards at
Bruhkarr and Yagle.

Although limited to jump-2, this does not inhibit its role as an escort to
Bruhkarri-flagged traders. The savings in drive and fuel from the jump-3
Nail allows the Thorn to thicken its armor and increase crew to include
an eight-person boarding squad, a full medical bay and a brig to house
prisoners. Acceleration of 5G comes nowhere near matching a Viper
interceptor but is more than adequate against pirates and smugglers.
The Thorn’s main armaments are a pair of long-ranged pulse
laser triple turrets and a pair of triple missile turrets with expanded
ammunition bunkers.

The spacious bridge highlights the Royal Navy’s design doctrine. Fully
nine bridge stations are available, allowing gunnery and engineering
functions to occur within sight of the commander at all times. The
captain’s chair sits alone, elevated in the center of the bridge, giving a
commanding view of operations.

The current conflict at Balleau, three parsecs distant from both Bruhkarr
and Yaple, has brought the design compromise of the Thorn into focus.
Unable to reach the contested system in one jump, the Royal Navy has
had to rely on the larger jump-3 capable battle-ready Ardent frigate to
escort merchant ships bound for Balleau, increasing tensions between
Bruhkarri and Katangan protection forces.
