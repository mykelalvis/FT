Meandering throughout the [[Spinward Marches]] is an informal trade route called the Spinward Main. This Main is a line (actually several lines, with branches) of worlds each only jump-1 from the next. The result is that long, often profitable trading journeys are possible even for lowly jump-1 ships. From Regina, the Main extends coreward, into the subsector. It also extends spinward, beyond the Imperial borders, ultimately to [[Querion Subsector]] and the [[Zhodani Consulate]].

The Spinward Main has been popularly divided into several subsections, such as the [[Regina Cluster]], a cul-de-sac branch which enters [[Regina subsector]] at [[Jenghe]] and extends as far as [[Efate]].

Named segments include:
- [[Bowman Arm]]
- [[Collace Arm]]
- [[Darrian Cluster]]
- [[Entropic Worlds]]
- [[Glisten Arm]]
- [[Gram Arm]]
- [[Metal Worlds]]
- [[Mora Arm]]
- [[Regina Cluster]]
- [[Sisters' Reach]]

By long-standing tradition, heading in the direction of [[District 268]] (broadly Spinward-Rimward or along the [[Mora Arm]] from [[Regina Subsector]] is ‘Down the Main’; the opposite direction is ‘Up.’

While most of the Main lies within the borders of the [Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Third_Imperium "Third Imperium"), branches enter the [[Darrian Confederation]] and the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]], and some segments traverse neutral space.

Short branches extend into [[Foreven Sector]] and [[Deneb Sector]]
