### 567-908


A dry world with a thin atmosphere, [[567-908]] has seemingly little to offer colonists or businesses and has not received an official name. The world is still referred to by its Scout Survey Branch designation number. There is a rudimentary starport, little more than a landing pad and beacon that records the comings and goings of visiting starships. A separate landing field is maintained and operated by [[Scout Service]] personnel and private contractors. With little more than a few huts and a small lake to draw water from (for both consumption and hydrogen fuel processing), there is little reason to stay. Few visitors remain planetside longer than it takes to refuel their ship.

Census data takes note only of permanent residents and [[567-908]] has none. There are, however, slightly less than two dozen people currently on-planet. About half are members of the [[Scout Service]]. The remainder are civilian contractors working with the scouts. To be frank, this is two dozen more people than are usually present on the planet. The starport, such as it is, consists of an automated beacon to notify visitors where the landing pad is and a console to record stopovers and flight plans. The landing pad is capable of handling ships up to 600 tons or any combination of ships whose tonnage add up to that total.

The thin air is not a problem and even the dryness is not a shock; it is common practice for a ship in jump to gradually adjust its climate controls to suit the next destination, so by the time they arrive the Travellers should be more or less acclimatised to the conditions at their destination.

The sheer brown-greyness of [[567-908]] is impressive. There is just so very much of it in all directions from the starport. The colours of the landscape vary so little that it can be hard to make out details or even estimate distances to a given object. Not that there is much worth looking at anyhow. The ground rises to the north and falls away somewhat to the south. There is a small lake a kilometre to the southwest. Pipes run from the lake to a holding tank at the port, providing both drinking water and a source of hydrogen for fuel. Refuelling is a lengthy process as the ship's tanks must be first filled with water which is then cracked for the hydrogen content. Oxygen is bled off and the hydrogen cooled until it reaches its liquid form, then another load of water is taken on and the process repeated until the main tanks are full of liquid hydrogen.

567-907's starport and base is a collection of easily assembled prefabricated living quarters, an ATV garage constructed the same way and a few hastily constructed tents that shelter communications equipment. There is another structure visible on a ridge about three to four kilometres northwards. Anyone can tell the Travellers that it is a mobile observatory. It features a multi-wavelength telescope and a number of specialised instruments for measuring things like cosmic radiation, gravitic turbulence and the like.

Anyone talking to the observatory crew will be treated to an extremely technical exposition of how a starship emerges from jump and its mass causes gravitic 'ripples' that interact with other matter in a very scientific and utterly incomprehensible manner. Those who have not lost the will to live by this point can (correctly) draw the conclusion that the observatory is there to try out new instruments and scientific techniques to see if they are any use for something other than boring visitors to death.

The observatory crew has a supply of decent coffee and are glad of company. If they can be persuaded to talk about something other than obscure astrophysical experimentation, the Travellers might spend a pleasant afternoon with them. The same comments go for the port staff, for the most part.

If anyone wants to look around the planet, they can stare at as much drab brown-grey rock as they like. The port has three ATVs, one of which has been fitted with a bulldozer blade. However, these are not available for sightseeing tours. Exploring on foot is somewhat limited and taking water along is a good idea. There is not much to see, other than a few interesting rock formations and a strange sculpture made by some of the scouts from the remains of an ATV. They call it Mandel's Prang after an incident a couple of years back when one of their number remodelled the ATV beyond its working tolerances by driving too fast over rough ground.
