### System Data

The worlds of the system have been surveyed. They consist of:

*   The mainworld.
*   x10 secondary rocky worlds.
*   x1 planetoid belt.

### Mainworld Data

Fulacin is a large, mostly unexplored world, and its plains and deserts abound in wildlife. While multiple orbital surveys have been carried out over the years and relatively detailed charts exist, few locations on the world have actually been visited.

#### Mainworld Size (S)

**Fulacin** is a Meso World between 8,800km and 10,400km in diameter. The world has a standard gravity between 0.6G and 0.8G. The horizon will appear about 4.4km away.

#### Mainworld Atmosphere (A)

**Fulacin** has a pressure of 0.71 to 1.49 atmospheres. While a Standard Atmosphere does not require survival gear this atmosphere also contains an unusual taint such as such as disease, a hazardous gas mix, pollutants, or sulfur compounds which requires the use of a Filter Mask. Some taints may require more protective equipment. TL–3 or more advanced survival gear is required to settle this world.

*   It experiences low to moderate temperatures.

Fulacin's most noted feature is its standard density tainted atmosphere. Widespread taint in the form of heavy metal dust and oxides means that the atmosphere is unbreathable without a filter mask. The dust causes a wide variety of respiratory illnesses, and can cause carcinoma within years of exposure. This metal dust has also made Fulacin an ideal location for use of [[MagnetoDynamics]]'s several patents dealing with recovery of metal from atmospheric and oceanic suspension.

#### Mainworld Hydrosphere (H

**Fulacin** has 35-45% of its surface covered by liquid water. There will be a number of small seas or one larger body of water. Wilderness refueling is possible.

#### Native Lifeforms

Abundant native life occupying every available ecological niche. Its metabolic functions drive the process of atmospheric renewal.

#### Fauna & Flora

The world is well known for several of its native species:

*   Fulacinian Groat: Fulacin is notable as the native world of the Groat, an herbivore prized for its shaggy hair and meat.
    *   Groats are found on a number of other worlds across the region.
*   Fulacinian Snowcat: a carnivore and potentially agressive creature.
*   Fulacinian Trapper: an octopodal carnivore/trapper, known for its aggressive behavior.

![[Fulacinian_Trapper_Twilight's_Peak_Richard_Hentz.jpg|100]]

During its time developing the colony, [[MagnetoDynamics]] has shown little to no interest in investigating the ecological effects of its activities other than to issue the notorious statement: 

> "_the groats don’t taste any different_".

## History & Background (Dossier)

![[Comp-Prog-Dav.jpg]]

Fulacin has been under the control of [[MagnetoDynamics]] through an Imperial charter for development.

### World Starport (St)

**Fulacin** has a **Class A Starport**, an excellent quality installation which includes all the expected amenities including refined fuel for starships, brokerage services for passengers and cargo, and a variety of ship provisions. There is a shipyard capable of doing annual maintenance, overhauls and other kinds of repair, and construction of both starships and non-starships. Most ports of this classification have both a Highport and a Downport.

Though otherwise unimportant, Fulacin's excellent A–class starport was constructed to facilitate access to Rhylanor "Rhylanor (world)") (Spinward Marches 2716), the subsector capital. The starport features ship construction and repair facilities, a Travellers' Aid Society hostel, and overhaul equipment.

*   The region around the downport, now designated Fulacin Down, is surrounded by large towers which draw in atmospheric gases and process them to extract useful chemicals. Similar plants line the shores of nearby seas.

### World Population (P)

**Fulacin** has population of 800 sophonts (hundreds).

*   This is a Low Population World and the population would be too low to sustain itself without moderate outside assistance. This may represent a large transient population such as the crew of a fleet of starships, the dwindling remnants of a dying colony, a construction team building a new colony, or an outpost that could evolve into a colony.
*   Defining some of the downport inhabitants as residents of Fulacin created a planetary population who could be granted Imperial Member status, thereby making Fulacin Imperial territory.

#### Linguistic Topography

The following languages are most commonly heard:

*   Anglic, one of the two official languages of the Imperium.
*   Vilani "Vilani (language)"), one of the two official languages of the Imperium.

### World Technology Level (T)

**Fulacin** possesses a Technology Level of TL–13 or _TL-D_ in Hexadecimal Notation.

*   Common _Communication_ technologies for this TL include: Holovideo recorders.
*   Common _Power Generation_ technologies for this TL include: Miniature super-batteries, prototype collectors, advanced fusion plants.
*   Common _Transportation_ technologies for this TL include:
    *   _Land, Water & Air:_ Personal G-Tubes and advanced gravcraft.
    *   _Space:_ Advanced interplanetary spacecraft (System Craft).
    *   _FTL:_ Jump Drive\-4.

### World Government (G)

**Fulacin** is governed by a _Corporate Polity_ with a single corporation with a typical corporate structure as a government. A company town, or world. The typical corporate run world usually has a single purpose. Examples include mining, agriculture, or other kinds of resource extraction. But rather than a simple base of operations, there are facilities for housing workers and their families including hospitals, schools, and other infrastructure. How, or if, the children of the workers are incorporated into the workforce varies with companies. The corporation running the world may be a subsidiary of a larger interstellar corporation.

*   Fulcain Down has grown into a "Corp Town" where every business is licensed by _MagnetoDynamics_ and most services were provided directly by the company.

### World Law (L)

**Fulacin** has no law in practice. It is an Anarchy. On many worlds, this by itself justifies an Amber Zone advisory. There are few laws, covering only important areas. There may be few or no law enforcement officers, the expectation is citizens will bring law breakers to the attention of the Judicial system. Legal proceedings will be fast, with few people involved. For interactions outside of the framework of the laws, cultural norms dominate.

### Imperial Landed Nobility

**Fulacin**, as a member world of the Third Imperium has a member of the Imperial Nobility overseeing the world.

*   It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.

### Trade Data

*   Importance:1 (ordinary)

### World Economy

*   Resources:5 (scarce)
*   Labor:1 (tens)
*   Infrastructure:1 (extremely limited)
*   Efficiency: -3 (poor)

### World Culture

*   Heterogenity:1 (monolithic)
*   Acceptance:3 (xenophobic)
*   Strangeness:1 (very typical)
*   Symbols:8 (somewhat abstract)

#### World Timeline

Major events that have affected this world and the wider region that it lies within:

*   The Year 0: the Third [[Imperium]] is founded.
*   300-420: the Imperial First Survey charts the system.
*   589-604: [[First Frontier War]].
*   604-622: the [[Civil War]].
*   615-620: [[Second Frontier War]].
*   624: the Express Boat Network is established.
*   979-986: [[Third Frontier War]].

*   1082-1084: [[Fourth Frontier War]], also known as the _False War_.
*   1107-1110: Fifth Frontier War.

### Later Historical Eras

In [[IY1118]], as part of the increased trust and cooperation between the [[Zhodani Consulate]] and the rump [[Imperium]], the Zhodani revealed that they had established a secret base on Fulacin. It was opened up and converted into a state-of-the-art interactive museum that shows the history of the Frontier Wars from the Zhodani viewpoint. It is required visiting for any student of Frontier War history, and draws tourists from all over the Marches.

The museum contains a flame sculpture memorial to the Imperial and Zhodani undercover agents who died during the Frontier War period, which officially ended when Emperor Strephon ratified the Treaty of Quar") on 000-1110.
