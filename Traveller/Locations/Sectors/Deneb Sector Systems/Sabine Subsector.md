The Sabine subsector contains 27 star systems, all members of the [[Imperium]]. Sixteen of these worlds are part of a jump-1 cluster sprawling across Sabine and Inar, with all of the economic benefits this entails.  Not all these worlds are well developed however and the presence of two interdicted systems does tend to channel jump-1 traffic into local patterns. The remainder of the subsector contains mostly underdeveloped worlds, which provide a jump-2 link to Rhylanor in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] but otherwise are of little importance.

These backwater worlds are of small interest to major economies so long as merchant traffic is not impeded and are of low strategic importance to the [[Imperium]] as a whole. There is thus little regulation of corporate activity in the region and away from the immediate environs of the starport many worlds might as well not be part of | | [[Imperium]] at all. These systems are prone to piracy and raiding, which provokes a response from the subsector fleet and Imperial authorities when it reaches a serious level.

The x-boat route to Rhylanor, by way of Fennec, has long been contentious. A message from Magash to Rhylanor takes a minimum of five weeks; more if it goes by every link on the chain. A link using the existing scout service base at Bevey in the Rhylanor subsector would cut this to three weeks, with messages reaching the naval base at Jae Tellona in two. Funding is not the problem; the cost would not be great. Yet despite endless lobbying, the existing route remains in place for reasons rooted in regional politics.

The 195th Fleet is assigned to Sabine but concentrates most of its efforts on the primary cluster. It has no bases in the backwater region to spinward and maintains only a patchy presence. Operations are often on a 'fire brigade' basis, with task forces concentrated at Thengin then sent into a system to clean it up. This works for a time but is no substitute for a steady, visible presence as it tends to push troubles around instead of eliminating them.

Opinions vary about this approach. It is easy to show, in terms of hard numbers, that securing the main trade lanes justifies tax credits spent on the fleet better than sitting over remote low-population worlds. However, there are those who are adamant the fleet is being kept out of the region to allow illicit business to thrive.
