# I NTRODUCTION


Adventure class ships are defined as sub-2,000 ton
vessels, often but not always affiliated with independent
organisations or individuals, though the line can get
very blurry. In fact, this is a trait of Adventure class
ships, as they are cheap enough to be purchased by
individuals or financed with a mortgage and so can
easily get pressed into any role or service, which may
be a far cry from that for which they were designed.


Having a large selection of these ships is extremely
useful in a Traveller campaign. For the Travellers,
it opens them up to a universe of possibilities when
looking for a ship of their own, especially when they
have a bit of money behind them and can upgrade
from the humble scout/courier or free trader. For the
Referee, it is even better.


No longer restricted to the vessels listed in the Traveller
Core Rulebook, or even High Guard, the Referee will
now have access to many, many ships that can be
inserted into adventures as opponents, victims, targets
for infiltration, or even just background colour. The
universes of Traveller are wide and varied, and now the
choice of ships available reflects that. For example, if
you are currently running the Pirates of Drinax mega-campaign, it is likely that your Travellers are plundering
a lot of merchant vessels – with this book, you can
now provide a much wider variety of potential targets (which is entirely reasonable for a campaign set in the
wildlands of the Trojan Reach), rather than listing the
cargoes of another free trader or subsidised merchant.


This book will give you those ships, over 60 of them in
fact, divided into simple categories covering, amongst
other things, traders, science vessels, corsairs, utility
ships and what happens when rich Travellers get to
design their own craft with very few real limits...


# S HIPS AND THE TRAVELLER


Spacecraft represent a massive expense and require
a serious amount of capital to purchase – a sum far
beyond the reach of the average Traveller. There are,
however, ways to gain ownership of a vessel without
being immensely wealthy to begin with.


Mortgages for ships are a well-known path to
ownership, burying the Traveller in debt for 40 years
as they take increasingly desperate jobs and cargoes
just to make payments. However, standard mortgages
for standard ships are not the only option, and canny
Travellers may be able to convince a bank to loan
them a truly excessive amount in order to purchase the
dream ship they desire, or they might be able to make
a deal with a corporation or government.

#### SHIPS AS BENEFITS


Some Travellers are lucky enough to get their hands on
a spacecraft when they muster out from their careers –
dilapidated, full of quirks and mortgaged to the hilt, but
a vessel ready for adventure. The ship gained depends
on the career followed but there is a huge variety of
spacecraft making their way across Charted Space and
Travellers always like something a little unusual.


Instead of using the ships presented in the Traveller
Core Rulebook, the Referee can instead opt to
substitute them with vessels in High Guard and this
book, using the Ships as Benefits table. Travellers
should note they are likely to be more valuable than the
original ship, and this will mean higher mortgage and
maintenance costs, which are not so easily overcome.

#### WE NEED A BIGGER SHIP


It is in the nature of Travellers to want more – if they
did not want to experience life to the fullest, they would
have retired on some quiet world and not started
exploring the galaxy.


A Traveller who gains a ship as a Benefit may want
to obtain a vessel that is a little more... ambitious. An
ex-broker might be looking for a subsidised merchant
rather than a free trader, while an ex-scientist might
choose a long-range exploration vessel over a lab ship.


This is all possible but it will require the Traveller to put
themselves into a serious amount of debt.


If a Traveller wants a ship as a Benefit that costs
more than MCr70 and is not on the list, then each
time the Benefit is rolled the Traveller will have 10%

of the mortgage paid off rather than the normal 25%.
Ships Shares will pay MCr1 towards the cost of the
ship as normal.


The Referee is the final arbiter of which ship the
Traveller may own in this fashion and two factors
should be kept in mind.
•	 The Referee should limit the cost of the ship in
terms of what the Traveller is actually going to be
able to pay in remaining mortgage costs – no one
is going to lend the Traveller a large sum of money
that cannot be paid back.
•	 The ship should be in some way related to the
original Benefit. No one is going to loan an ex-merchant the money for a warship or corsair vessel
but a larger trading ship might make sense.


Note that ex-scouts cannot use these rules to get a
bigger ship but the Referee might consider a well-regarded scout eligible for a Type SX extended scout
or even the likes of a Donosev survey scout. Use the
Traveller’s final rank, length of service and any relevant
events rolled during their career as a guide for this.

#### SUBSIDISED SHIPS


In some instances, a corporation or government
may be inclined to subsidise the purchase of a ship
in order to further their own ends. However, while
a Traveller may be able to escape paying the vast
majority of the balance, there are some serious
strings attached to a deal like this.


Such contracts are typically made on larger commercial
vessels above 600 tons (the subsidised liner is a very
common example, although the smaller subsidised
merchant is the most famous), with the aim of assuring
consistent trade and passenger services to specific
systems. These are generally in frontier regions where,
left purely to market forces, certain worlds might be
completely overlooked. Military, exploration and other
non-commercial ships can be subsidised, and have
been in the past, but it is exceedingly rare and usually
requires contacts within the corporation or government.


For smaller (sub-1,000 ton) merchants and passenger
vessels, a Traveller may need only to demonstrate
good financial and legal standing, as well as relevant


skills. However, some organisations may be more
demanding, especially if the Traveller is making a pitch
to acquire a larger or non-commercial ship.


Such a pitch will take weeks to put together and
require an Admin, Diplomat or Persuade check. This
will usually be a Difficult (10+) check but Referees
should increase the difficulty for increasingly
outlandish requests.


THE DEAL


Once a subsidised ship has been agreed to in principle,
the corporation or government will impose several
conditions on its use, and free-thinking Travellers will
find them extremely limiting.
•	 The Traveller must make a down payment on
the ship equal to 20% of its cost. The subsidising
organisation will assume all other payments on the
cost of the ship itself.
•	 The ship will be restricted to an area of operations,
typically a subsector or even a single trade route
between a handful of star systems. This may be
a permanent restriction or a certain number of
months in a year.
•	 The Traveller assumes responsibility for all running,
repair and maintenance costs.
•	 The subsidising organisation will take 50% of
all gross receipts (that is, before any costs are
deducted!) generated by the ship.
•	 The Traveller will respond to any emergencies
the subsidising organisation deems necessary
for them to attend. This could be anything from
assisting another ship in the fleet that is in
distress, to taking part in a full blown war (likely
in an auxiliary role; merchants are unlikely to find
themselves on the frontline).


If the Traveller is found in breach of these conditions, the
ship will eventually be removed from their possession (losing the down payment they made) and there might
not be many warnings before action is taken.


However, if the Traveller follows these conditions,
the ship will be passed fully into their possession
after a period of 40 years of service, with nothing
else owed to the subsidising organisation. The one
caveat to this is that if a government was subsidising
the ship, it will be subject to mobilisation in the event
of a major disaster or emergency (which, in Charted
Space, will typically mean war).

### Ships and the Traveller


Regarded as the province of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, many exploration ships nevertheless find their
way into private hands, either through the detached duty programme or simple purchases of older vessels. They
are typified by higher than average jump ranges and specialised equipment which, although usually dedicated to
survey missions, can be repurposed for many different roles.

There is a wide variety of choice among exploration ships, when looking for a new vessel, and beyond the ever-popular Type S scout/courier there is something for all tastes and all budgets. Special builds and roles required by
the IISS result in ships capable of tasks simply not possible for standard vessels.

A dedicated exploration ship is fast and well-equipped, and can be the very best vessel for a group of Travellers to crew.

## EXPLORATION


##### STEALTH SCOUT

The idea of a stealthy scout brings to mind images
of a military reconnaissance craft that prowls the
borders of hostile empires. In fact, the stealth scout
is used primarily by the IISS to conduct survey
missions in systems controlled by civilisations it does

not want to provoke, either because hostilities have
preceded the mission or a policy of non-interference
towards a lower-tech society. That said, the stealth
scout is admirably suited to military missions and has
certainly been employed in that role in the past.

##### EXTENDED SCOUT

A stretched version of the popular Serpent class
scout, this vessel uses the extra tonnage to
accommodate more crew specialists, equipment
and, importantly, a greater jump range. While still
far from being a capable trader for opportunistic


Travellers, the extended scout retains all the features
of the original Serpent class while being able to
cover far greater territory and providing a much more
comfortable environment for its crew.

Known throughout Charted Space as a mercenary
cruiser, the Broadsword is actually highly adaptable,
and one of the most popular variants in frontier space is
the exploration cruiser. Replacing its platoon-handling
capabilities for advanced sensors and analysis facilities,

a single exploration cruiser is capable of conducting
a credible survey of an entire world, given time. Its
cost generally puts it out of the reach of independent
researchers and so it is normally found under the

Merchants and traders are far more than boxes with manoeuvre and jump drives. Different trade routes have
their own challenges and there is a big difference between jumping several parsecs to reach a profitable port and
methodically working a main with speculative cargoes.

For the discerning Traveller, there is a huge array of choices – big and small merchant vessels, traders built for
speed, range or smuggling, and then there are the ships that can carry a decent-sized cargo as well as a massive
punch for any would-be corsairs or privateers.

A well-tuned and well-equipped merchant ship is immensely versatile, infinitely configurable and can be the
very best ship for a group of Travellers to crew.

## MERCHANT SHIPPING


##### ARMED TRADER

When free traders need to work in hostile space
where corsairs are known to prowl, it pays to be
better equipped. The armed trader takes the basic
free trader hull and does what many Travellers
automatically do to their ships – add weapons,

armour and more sophisticated equipment to keep
pirates at bay. While far from a warship, the armed
trader can nonetheless hold its own against a
similarly equipped enemy, at least long enough for
system defence forces to move in and provide aid.

##### FREE SMUGGLER

Whether it is from desperation, spite or a love of
Credits and danger, it occurs to the owners of some
free traders that a great deal more money can be
made by smuggling proscribed items. The best way
of achieving that is to make your free trader look as

#### FREE SMUGGLER TYPE: AC


innocent as possible, while jamming every cubic inch
of hidden space with illegal cargoes. The Type AC is a
conversion of an existing free trader and can operate
quite convincingly as a perfectly legitimate ship – until
the right cargo for the right price appears.

##### VOLITANT

##### FAR TRADER


Superficially very similar to other far traders that
conform to the type A2 specification, the Volitant
class of ships is visually distinct. Capable of far better
atmospheric performance than other trader ships,
the Volitant is sold as the definitive answer to storm-swept planetary starports, although if the suggestion

was made that the vessel’s looks and exterior lines
were a selling point, it might be hard for some owners
to argue. While more expensive with slightly less
capacity than a more standard far trader, the handling
of the Volitant is noticeably smoother with several
quality of life improvements evident on board.

The shadow trader is an extremely specialised
modification to the standard far trader and is almost
never converted from an existing hull, being purpose-built instead. Designed to slip past pirates and hostile
navy craft alike, only governments and criminal


organisations involved in highly lucrative operations
can typically justify its expense. Once purchased,
however, it is fully capable of landing on worlds all
but undetected, to deliver expensive cargoes or
engage in clandestine meetings.

Intended as a competitor to the ubiquitous far
trader hulls, the merchant trader has been criticised
as being less flexible due primarily to its lack of
passenger capacity. However, it is faster, comes
armed as standard, has a larger cargo hold and


possesses much better handling characteristics
in atmospheres. While it has yet to dominate
the independent trading routes, it is becoming a
more common sight in frontier regions where its
advantages gain greater notice.

When a civilisation first discovers there is a whole
universe of empires beyond their homeworld, shock
quickly turns to the desire to make a profit from trade.
Having only just gained access to low-level jump
drive and gravitic technologies, the first commercial
ships to leave their world can be shockingly fragile


and basic but, with enough determination, merchants
can begin bringing goods and Credits back from star
systems once seen only through a telescope. The
amount of space in the cargo hold is impressive,
although that may be of small attraction to Travellers
used to more advanced ships.

Where there are healthy profits to be made in
smuggling cargoes, there will be Credits to build
custom ships to make the process even more
profitable. This ship is an attempt to find the perfect
balance – stealthy enough to avoid detection, fast
enough to outrun followers when detected and
powerful enough to destroy pursuers if they catch


up. Given all of this, the fast smuggler does not
attempt to hide goods on board behind concealed
panels, so its use is generally restricted to starports
where onboard inspections are unlikely. It is far more
likely to be seen making its way past customs ships
to land at a dirt site far from major cities.

There is always a desire amongst ship architects to
tinker with well-trodden and beloved designs, and
it rarely takes time for someone to wonder what a
vessel would be like if it were just bigger. The extended
merchant is a stretched version of the much-trusted


subsidised merchant, using the additional tonnage for a
secure vault, a ship’s boat and, of course, more cargo
space. The ship’s boat is provided with its own hangar,
allowing much easier transfer of cargo and passengers
from the interior of the merchant.

While the majority of independent merchants focus
solely on mains and other regions of great stellar
density, others have found profitable routes between
far-flung star systems that cannot be reached with even
a far trader in a single jump. The long trader sacrifices


cargo space for a larger jump drive and fuel tanks,
allowing it to cross four-parsec gaps in a single voyage.
The reduction in per-trip profitability can be offset by a
canny owner through the trading of specialised goods
that might not otherwise reach the target systems.

Although seen only occasionally on select trade
routes, the Maru is popular with its captains. It
combines a large cargo hold with good jump range
and is very powerfully armed for a merchant. Five
triple turrets are capable of defeating most small-time pirates however, perversely enough, they also


make the Maru a potent choice for corsairs. Beyond
this, the Maru does skimp on capabilities, which is
particularly notable when in the small bridge, but this
serves to make the ship cheap enough to be within
reach of independent merchant budgets.

Balancing capacity with security is something of an
art with merchant vessels and something always has
to be traded for the worse – as the Coveter neatly
demonstrates. The requirement for four-parsec jumps
simply compounds the problems with space and there
is little enough left for cargo and passengers. This
design makes some sense in pirate-prone wilderness


areas but, even there, it can be exceptionally difficult
to run the ship profitably and most end up either
converted into other roles or simply scrapped. Still,
if a group of Travellers can find a use for a high-jump, armoured merchant with at least some spare
cargo space, and they start with a small fortune, the
Coveter lies waiting.

The province of planetary governments and a tiny
number of highly specialised companies, the Iris
armoured packet was designed to get a reasonable
amount of cargo to its destination – no matter how
dangerous the territory may be. With armour thick
enough to match some light warships, the average


opportunistic corsair is going to find their weapons
doing little more than scoring paint, while the return
fire is going to be extremely painful. Given a well-trained crew and plenty of planning, the Iris can
navigate even notorious pirate-laden systems with
some assurance of safe arrival.

Considered the backbone of merchant fleets by
the companies that use them, the Magnadon
provincial merchant is capable of carrying large
amounts of cargo for its size, although there are
few frills for the crews inside. With cargo doors on
each side of the tall lower deck, handling cargo


is much easier than the lack of onboard cranes
and belts might suggest, so long as the starport
is well-equipped. The low jump range restricts the
Magnadon to mains but profits can be great with
the right choice of goods and trade routes.

The reputation of the Trader is one of great versatility
and the capability to operate in almost any trading
environment. For the most part, this is true but it
relies on both cargo and passengers being available
to be properly profitable, so captains tend to stick
to tried and tested trade routes. It is therefore

There is an unfortunate history to these ships. Triad
Lines went bankrupt in 1088, right after the first
block of their namesake vessels were launched.
Built in a vague triangular shape as a marketing


tactic that played on the name of both ship and
company, a few examples can still be seen in the
hands of smaller independent merchant companies
in the Spinward Marches and Trojan Reach.

Before a merchant company grows large enough
to start purchasing massive megafreighters, they
will often build up fleets of ships similar to the
2,000 ton large freighter. Combining a respectable


cargo hold capable of carrying hundreds of tons of
goods with a three-parsec jump range, the large
freighter is economical even when operating away
from mains and clusters.

There is a great deal of crossover between merchant and passenger ships, with many vessels carrying both
cargo and people in an effort to stay profitable. However, a dedicated passenger ship will not only have far more
staterooms, in place of a cavernous hold, but it is also likely to be equipped with all the comforts needed for the
discerning Traveller spending a week or more inside the ship.

Passenger ships are rarely fast, though some are capable of long jumps, but there are examples that are true
palaces in space. Using the finest materials in the staterooms and featuring swimming pools, gourmet kitchens
and huge observation decks to witness spectacular stellar phenomena, simply being on board these vessels can
be a vacation unto itself.

A refined, luxurious passenger ship is capable of being reconfigured for a huge range of roles, while providing
absolute comfort, and can be the very best ship for a group of Travellers to crew.

Typically found serving well-trodden routes on mains
and in clusters, the large liner is on the small side
for passenger ships but has been designed to do
one thing above all else – move as many people
as possible, as cheaply as possible. When regular
routes have been found and established, this ship
can run very profitably. However, the presence of


so many low berths does provide an indication as
to the target market for the service, where average
staterooms are regarded as the ‘luxury’ option.
Extensive safety briefings during transit to the 100
diameter limit are designed to allay fears over the
inevitable jump dimming when the drive is activated.

Found almost solely under the ownership of
corporations and governments, the long liner is
a luxury passenger ship designed to facilitate
meetings, conferences and diplomatic functions as
it travels between star systems. It is well-appointed
and well-equipped, with stewards attending to


every need of passengers who are then able to
concentrate on work and related functions. Far
more than a flying conference centre, the long
liner not only provides briefing rooms and quality
staterooms but also a large hall used for diplomatic
receptions, balls and presentations.

These merchant liners, not an uncommon sight in
any area of civilised space, are an attempt to blend
cargo hauling with passenger capacity. These are
roles the Star merchant liner performs admirably.
There are few creature comforts on board and the
number of low berths installed gives some indication


of the type of passenger the crew will be expecting
to ferry from one system to another – the goal is
very much to pack in as many people and cargo
containers as possible to maximise profits. The result
is decent, if a little spartan, travel.

Designed not so much to transport people from one
system to another, starfaring hotels are almost a
destination unto themselves. Sporting the highest of
luxuries, for those who can afford them, these ships
will tour the most visually stimulating systems so
those on board can gaze in wonder upon nebulae,


colourful gas giants and pulsars – all while sipping
the finest cocktails and sleeping in the comfiest beds.
That said, while the ship can support those travelling
on a budget, they will find the experience less than
completely fulfilling as they are not permitted onto
the higher class decks.

This ship does not even pretend to court the Credits
of ordinary civilians, or do anything as grubby as
handling cargo. It is less about where the luxury
starliner is travelling than simply being seen upon
it. Typically chartered by the wealthiest celebrities
and occasionally governments, there is no amenity


or service lacking on board, and everything desired
by passengers is there for the asking. As for ticket
prices... if you have to ask, you cannot afford it. A
very small number of these ships are purchased by
the very richest of oligarchs, as a sort of ‘end game’
to their demonstration of wealth.

There may be few who give working ships a second look but these vessels are responsible for keeping the
spaceways moving. Repair ships, salvagers, prospectors and customs craft, each is specialised to a narrow range
of functions vital to anyone hoping to make a living in space.

Working ships come in all sizes and for all budgets, but are likely equipped in a manner different from every other
type of vessel, due to their often highly specialised nature. Because of this, there is a massive variety between
ships, featuring equipment, fittings and options not seen on more mainstream hulls.

A working ship is likely to be solidly built and capable of performing roles no other ship can attempt, and may be the
very best ship for a group of Travellers to crew.

The modular cutter and heavy cutter are known
for their sheer versatility born of the swappable
modules they employ, allowing a massive range of
configurability. It did not take long for someone to
appreciate these small craft and begin wondering
whether it could be improved upon. The result was


the jump cutter, a ship that could not only use four
standard modules but was also jump-capable,
allowing it to constantly change its configuration
at any well-supplied starport to perform any task
assigned to it, from cargo runs, to fuel-skimming, to
exploration, to fighter support.

While the x-boat network functions extremely
well on jump-4 technology, sometimes messages
and packages need to travel faster – that is
where the long range courier comes in. Such
missions are often secretive and the courier is
built to accomplish them quickly and quietly. If it


is intercepted enroute, then something very wrong
has occurred and likely not down to the courier
or its crew. The IISS maintains a small fleet of
these ships in most frontier sectors but they are
more likely to be found in the service of large
corporations and megacorporations.

Beyond the borders of empires, advanced medical
care can get exceptionally hard to find. The hospice
boat is best utilised for transporting the sick and
injured to permanent medical facilities but in the
absence of nearby civilisation, this ship can be the


difference between life and death. Jumping into
systems to assist with pandemics, natural disasters,
after-battle casualties and other tragedies that
overwhelm local hospitals, the crews of these ships
are often lauded as life-saving saints.

While many worlds have prison facilities, there
are those who prefer (or are required) to use the
services of the infamous prison planets. Transporting
many prisoners at once across the stars is an
inherently risky task, and purpose bred craft such as
the prison ferry are employed whenever possible.
Amenities on board are spartan but extremely


secure and the ship trades sublight speed for high
jump-capability, meaning it can reach its prison
world destination in the least amount of time with the
least number of jumps. This gives few opportunities
for any attempted interception and if that somehow
does not work, the close escort normally assigned to
protect it surely will.

Belters have a reputation for piloting run down
junkers of ships, kept barely flying from one foray
into an asteroid belt to the next with whatever
Credits they manage to pull together from rocks with
traces of minerals barely worth anything. However,
there are always those who buck the trend and the
more successful will trade up from their basic seeker

The craft used by planetary customs agencies are
varied, with many being repurposed vessels built
for other tasks. However, this customs patrol cutter
was designed for the role from the outset and is
typical of those deployed by wealthy governments.


With the best technology commonly available, and
outsizing almost all pirate vessels it may come
across, the customs patrol cutter is a nightmare for
any crew jumping in-system with nefarious intent, be
it smuggling or outright piracy.

This is a highly specialised vessel, dispatched
to rescue ships that cannot make it to a starport
on their own. Small ships can be brought into the
hangar for transport to a shipyard, while larger


vessels are repaired on site. A few repair ships
are used on a freelance basis, either charging
high fees for a rescue or using their tools to
salvage and strip down wrecks.

In a way the opposite of the repair ship, the salvage
hauler is not intended to recover ships so they can be
repaired but instead to strip them down for parts and
materials. It can do this in the field, or take a couple
of smaller ships back to a base for more thorough
disassembly. Often operating with paper-thin legality,


salvage haulers can often be found on the outskirts
of a warzone ready to dive in and strip stricken craft.
There is a good reason they are often referred to as
‘vultures’. Given the ship is fully capable of hauling
away three wrecked free traders or their equivalents
simultaneously, this may be well-founded.

The term ‘military ship’ does a lot of heavy lifting in this chapter, for while some of the vessels listed here are indeed
official naval designs, it is hard to argue that others were specifically built or modified for pirates. Military ships are
characterised by their resilient builds, general performance and, of course, high-powered weaponry.

Many Travellers will be attracted to the latter but attaching multiple turrets and weapons bays to a ship capable of
high acceleration and long jumps has a powerful negative effect on other areas, such as cargo space. This may be
of relatively little concern to groups long past the ‘poor-trader’ stage of their post-career lives.

A powerful military ship is designed to survive the most hostile of encounters and can be the very best ship for a
group of Travellers to crew.

## THE MILITARY


There is little to disguise the fact that the strike
scout is a modification of the traditional Type S
design, intended purely for pirates. With a double-jump capability, the strike scout is specifically
designed to jump into a system, force a merchant
vessel to surrender and abscond with its most

valuable cargo before jumping out ahead of any
response from the system defence boats. Once back
in friendlier territory, there is nothing to distinguish
this ship from any other workaday Type S scout/
courier, allowing the pirates to sell their ill-gotten
gains before word follows of their attack.

##### SHIP

Before committing squadrons of warships to a
system, it is a good idea to scout out the territory for
hostile forces and other dangers. This is where the
Light Reconnaissance Ship comes in – small but
well-equipped, this vessel is intended to jump into
a system, conduct a preliminary reconnaissance of


defences and enemy shipping, and then depart with
valuable information. The length of stay in a system
will vary and long-term scouting missions are not
really in this ship’s remit but as a forward pair of eyes
roving ahead of the main fleet, it can be vital.

There comes a time in the career of every pirate
and privateer when the realisation dawns that a
single ship can be evaded by a fast merchant, no
matter how experienced the attackers. At that point,
a pirate carrier may be considered a good upgrade.
Small and relatively cheap, the 300 ton pirate carrier
clamps 10 light fighters to its hull, which can readily


detach, chase down and surround any trading ship
flying, forcing it to surrender. Once the swarm of
fighters has pacified a target, it is a simple matter
for the carrier to close range and launch a boarding
action. The fighters can be swapped for any small
craft up to 30 tons but the carrier’s performance will
be significantly affected if it is carrying larger craft.

and, occasionally, aggressive customs inspections.
It features the armour needed to shrug off hits from
low-powered pirate vessels and enough to speed
to run any starship down before deploying enough
marines to overwhelm it.

Built for planetary governments and pocket empires
who wish to field a vessel that provides a strong
backbone to system defence yet also has the
ability to project power, the Valour is a potent force
wrapped into a 400-ton hull. Constructed as a
private venture by a conglomerate of companies,


sales are theoretically limited by Imperial law. In
practice, this becomes more relaxed the further from
the borders of the Imperium the end user lies. Such
customers also play fast and loose with conventions
of placing nuclear warheads on the missiles carried
on board the corvette.

Designed to quietly jump into a system and hold
station until a valuable target is located, the ambush
frigate is bought by planetary governments looking
to hassle hostile powers... and pirates. As a gunship,
the ambush frigate is a formidable opponent, capable
of overwhelming both merchant vessels and any light
escort ships in very short order. The usual response

**CLASS:**


when an ambush frigate appears is therefore to
simply surrender. While most pirates will depart a
system after an attack, some more organised bands
will retreat to the outer system where a waiting ship
will take on stolen cargo, allowing the ambush frigate
to return in-system and continue hunting.

The epitome of vessels for the one-ship pirate
band, the brigand is a rare sight that is built in only
a few select shipyards beyond the reach of the
Imperium. However, it is fast, powerful and the
mere sight of one can cause even large merchant
ships to surrender – which, given that only the

**CLASS:**

Regarded as a sister ship to the legendary
Broadsword mercenary cruiser, this vessel was
originally offered to planetary governments for use as
a small escort carrier to protect merchant convoys.
However, it rapidly gained the interest of mercenary


companies specialising in fighter support, both in
space and planetside. With a hangar capable of
handling a full squadron plus support craft, of a
variety of types, it has great configurability, permitting
mercenaries to accept a wide range of tickets.

Travellers are a breed apart. Whereas others might come to the end of their careers and think about retirement or,
at least, a more peaceful working life, Travellers have a wanderlust that becomes a passion to explore the stars –
and to do that, they will need a starship.

While Travellers will usually start their new life in the ubiquitous free trader or scout/courier, the successful ones will
soon start thinking about their own custom ship... and that is where the stars truly are the limit. The ships in this
chapter are all vessels designed and used by Travellers to fulfil their own very special (and often unique) criteria. To
this end, this chapter is full of highly specialised ships that would not be found in the hands of anyone else.

A ship designed by Travellers, built by Travellers, and flown by Travellers can be the very best ship for a group of
Travellers to crew.

Built to the specification of bounty hunter guilds
throughout the Marches and Reach, the Huntress
is designed for a single pilot to operate, though
it can accommodate a small group. Its exterior is
non-descript by intention, allowing the Huntress to


slip into starports where its owner can apprehend a
target and then bring them back safely to collect the
bounty. There are more sophisticated ships available
for bounty hunting missions but none other that can
be operated by a single operative.

The purpose of the blockade runner is to get an
amount of cargo through hostile space and deliver
it to either high-paying customers or those in
desperate need. By preference, this is by guile and
anonymity but if the blockade runner is discovered,
it is extremely capable of breaking through even


military cordons to reach its destination. Cargo space
is more limited than on an equivalent subsidised
merchant but the blockade runner can make
deliveries to systems that the merchant would not
even think about going near.

If a group of Travellers becomes very rich and they
consider themselves to be the greatest rock band
in the galaxy... this is the ship they will build. Both
luxury transport and the core of an outdoor arena
for their concerts, the touring ship travels from world
to world, bringing the music of its owners with it. A


massive cargo door folds out from one side of the
ship, forming the stage and meaning that Travellers
need few other facilities to hold a concert even on the
meanest frontier worlds. So long as the atmosphere
is breathable, this ship can bring a raw, live music
experience to any system.

When Travellers truly make it big, they are not likely
to be content with a simple well-specced ship – they
will want a truly, one-off custom design to suit their
own particular needs. The Starborn Wanderer is an
example of this idea, a 1,000-ton vessel that can,


in theory, attempt almost any role with a degree
of success. Big enough to haul speculative cargo,
powerful enough to fight a small war, versatile
enough to go exploring, all while transporting its
owners in luxury.

The Aslan have a very... direct view of ships. Most are capable of at least some credible form of combat, while
others are outright warships going by a civilian name. These vessels can be very easy to operate, built as they are
for Aslan warriors, but they are no less advanced than most other ships they encounter.

Just the sight of an Aslan ship can make a pirate or customs official think twice, for Aslan are notoriously
belligerent, and the renowned ihatei can become outright violent if they believe their honour has been impugned.
This can be extremely useful for the crew of any other species who do not want to be overly troubled when jumping
into an unfamiliar system.

A solid Aslan vessel can fight any similarly-sized ship no matter its actual role, and can be the very best ship for a
group of Travellers to crew.

##### SCOUT

While other Aslan scout vessels can at least pass
as exploration craft, the Stayaow does not even try

- it is a full-blown, no-compromises combat scout.
During hostilities, it is the role of the Stayaow to rove
ahead of any squadron it is attached to, hunting
down enemy positions and, given the Aslan proclivity

However, less is spoken about how many have met

###### CLASS: AIHAIYO

The Aihaiyo is the Aslan version of the human
safari ship but, in typical Aslan fashion, it is usually
much more heavily armed. Found in the hands of
rich Aslan nobles, expeditions may range far and
wide, requiring many jumps to reach the world of a
particularly renowned (and dangerous) beast. Upon


arrival, the ship will set down on the planet’s surface
or dispatch its ship’s boat, and the air/raft will serve
as a hunting platform. Once the hunt has been
completed successfully, an onboard trophy room
awaits the placing of souvenirs of which the noble
can then regale visitors with tales.

The Sword Worlds have similar technologies as those of other empires but they are not as advanced as those of
their immediate neighbours. This leads to ships that can be quite familiar and yet take a slightly different route to
achieve their roles, the ship architects of the Sword Worlds finding solutions both ingenious and pragmatic in an
attempt to keep pace with the ship market.

Ships from the Sword Worlds can therefore surprise any who have a tendency to think them primitive compared
to the mighty vessels of the Imperium and Consulate, but they are capable enough and their crews willingly match
themselves against any other.

A ship built in the Sword Worlds is always a solid choice, capable of every task it is expected to perform, and can
be the very best ship for a group of Travellers to crew.

The Sleipnir is an older vessel that once formed
the backbone of system patrol fleets of more minor
worlds and even now can be found in service.
However, hulls are starting to appear on the
surplus market and a canny buyer might be able to


pick up a very well-used ship (with all its foibles)
for a reasonable price, with its core functionality
intact. Although it is far from able to handle

A relatively rare ship within the Sword Worlds
Confederation, the Surtr is designed to avoid
close engagement with enemy vessels and
instead bombard them at great ranges while being
screened by the rest of their fleet. Caught alone,
a Surtr will be quickly destroyed by a much lighter


ship (despite the single Turunmaa fighter it carries)
but, used in numbers, a squadron can deliver
telling damage to destroyers and light cruisers.
While carrying prodigious amounts of ammunition
and warheads, the Surtr must remain well-supplied
during wartime to remain effective.

Along trade routes and space lanes, Vargr have a terrible reputation. Upon merely seeing a Vargr ship, an
inexperienced captain may immediately turn and flee at full burn, presuming they have just witnessed a pirate ship.
Unfortunately for the Vargr, this is not all they are – only a tiny fraction are actually pirates and corsairs.

However, Vargr have a very flexible attitude to political borders and so their ships can be found throughout Charted
Space. Underneath the typically garish colours on their hulls, these ships can be as sophisticated as any other,
matching or exceeding those from the Aslan, Sword Worlds and, in many cases, the Imperium. They may do things
differently but it is a fool who underestimates a Vargr ship and its crew.

A Vargr-built vessel will be extremely capable in its role, marking its owners as thinking beyond normal conventions,
and can be the very best ship for a group of Travellers to crew.

Built for a cunning combination of stealth and speed,
the Rokkghiok is used by governments, adventurers
and, yes, corsairs. It is adept at slipping small cargoes
past customs ships and, if spotted, the Rokkghiok’s
blistering acceleration will boost it far from any


pursuer. When used in packs, the stealth runner
becomes an excellent light strike ship, slipping past
blockades and orbital defences to destroy selected
targets before fading from sight. It is not a comfortable
ship to crew but can certainly be an exciting one.

With a level of armour usually seen only on military
vessels, the Nguksu is built to ply trade across the
rambunctious Vargr Extents. It has enough armour
plating to take a pounding while entering hostile
systems and what it cannot survive repeated hits from,


it can easily outrun. The downside to this survivability
is a relatively small cargo hold when compared to
the traders of other civilisations. However, Nguksu
owners will no doubt point out it is better to transport
less if you are guaranteed to get there alive.

The Extents can be a chaotic place and not every
captain can lay their hands on a ship befitting their
dreams. This is where the Vargr tradition of the
junker comes in – ships cobbled together out of
old hulls, spare parts and a decent degree of faith
in engineering. Obviously patched together, no


matter how the hull is brightly painted, the junker
will constantly attract derision but an impassioned
captain and motivated crew will make these ships
perform seemingly beyond their limits. Such crews
may begin developing a perverse pride in their ship,
brooking no insult to their beloved vessel.

Although featuring relatively less advanced
technology than many of its peers, the Sorrgheg
carries a lot more firepower and boarding troops than
equivalent corsairs. It is capable of overwhelming
smaller ships with its missile bay and, once halted
in space, a target will have little chance against


two dozen dedicated boarders. Fully capable of
atmospheric operations, the Sorrgheg carries four
gravitic speeders for mobility but its limited cargo
space means crews have to be very discerning about
the value of the cargo they take.
