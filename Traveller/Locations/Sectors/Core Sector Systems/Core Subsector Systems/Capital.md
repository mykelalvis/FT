[[Capital]] is the seat of government of the Third Imperium and home to both the Emperor – who resides at the Grand Palace of Arbellatra – and members of the peerage, who assemble at the Moot Spire.

[[Capital]] is a pleasant world with a varied climate, oceans that cover almost two thirds of its surfaceand a dense atmosphere of a suitable oxygen-nitrogen mix. The residents of [[Capital]] have gotten used to the density of its air over time but the atmospheric pressure at high levels of elevation are more comfortable for un-adapted humans. The world has five continents and many large islands and archipelagos. Its system primary is Zan Ki Ond, a type-G2 main sequence star, nearly identical to that of Terra in size and luminosity. However, Capital's slightly closer proximity to the star has made the world marginally hotter, giving it a large temperate zone with immense rainforests and river valleys. Its subtle 18o axial tilt results in consistent weather. The interaction of its dense atmosphere and star produces some extreme weather effects including strong inland storms and hurricanes along the coasts. Technology is used to mitigate meteorological effects to ensure a pleasant and fruitful stay for visitors to the world. [[Capital]] has two small moons, neither of which are near enough to create significant tidal forces. Despite its middling size, [[Capital]] has higher-than-expected gravity at 0.69G due to its thin mantle and larger-than-normal nickel-iron core.

The world's 20 billion inhabitants are well-distributed among its land masses and oceans, with residential arcologies located mostly in the coastal regions, but several cities are in its ountain ranges and oceans as well. Cleon's residential zones are home to 450 million people, which does not take into account the  millions of visiting dignitaries, diplomats, business people and tourists who are present at any given time.  Travellers may be surprised to discover that Intell is actually Capital's largest city with a total population of 562 million citizens living within its urban sprawl. The city of Intell is where Capital's primary administrative centres and light industry are located. It is often said that while the heart of [[Capital]] is Cleon, its mind is at Intell. Despite the fact that [[Capital]] has 20 billion sophonts living on its surface and orbital habitats, judicious use has been made of its available land. Large expanses of territory have been restored to their original states, including millions of hectares of jungle, open plains and mountains. Most of these regions have been inhabited at one point or another during Capital's long history but have been painstakingly returned to their original condition.

[[Capital]] was once known as Sylea and has been inhabited by humans for hundreds of thousands of years. The Syleans, a human Minor Race, were seeded on the world by the Ancients. After thousands of years of intermixing with Vilani, Solomani and other human subspecies, there are few genetically pure Syleans remaining. However, there are some Sylean populations that have preserved their genetic and cultural identities, mostly those who maintained an isolated existence in the mountain ranges of its third-largest continent. Nevertheless, one will find billions of people on [[Capital]] who claim Sylean heritage, many of whom proudly participate in cultural events, traditions and religious rituals that were practiced by their ancestors.

[[Capital]] is well defended with three full BatRons present in the system at all times. The planet is also defended by squadrons of smaller system-defense spacecraft, dozens of orbital batteries of lasers and missiles, particle weapons, ground-based aerial defenses and deep-site meson guns. [[Capital]] makes more of an effort than most worlds to conceal its defenses. While the Imperium wants its capital to be safe, it does not want to project the image that it is a militarised bunker anticipating attack.

The most popular destinations on [[Capital]] are in Cleon, where tourists go to see its many museums, shopping districts, the Grand Plaza of Heroes and the palace grounds where they can see the lofty Moot Spire, Cleon's Tomb, the Crescent Lake (where the second Imperial Palace crash landed during the Civil War) and of course the Grand Palace of Arbellatra itself and its attending structures: Paulo's Annex, Tomutov's Palace and the Trinary Consortium. Visitors of a more academic bent go to the Imperial Archives where thousands of original documents and scholarly works are on display. There are many more popular destinations throughout the world and elsewhere in the system. War history aficionados make pilgrimages to the gas giant Zhimaway where retired capital ships perform re-enactments of Arbellatra's famous battle for control of the planet.

#### The Grand Palace of Arbellatra

The Grand Palace is a grandiose structure, a tribute to the magnificence and power of the Imperium. At 39-million tons and one kilometer in diameter, the sheer enormity of the palace never ceases to amaze visitors. The palace was completed in 633 after four years of construction. It is suspended half a kilometer from the surface of [[Capital]] by a ring of gravitic suspensors emplaced below the grounds of the Imperial Park. The palace itself has backup gravitic drives within its hull but should they ever be required, they have limited power and can only keep it aloft for a short period of time before they must gently set it down.

Defences include four deep meson bays, eight particle accelerator bays, eight missile launcher bays and eight point-defense lasers. The palace is also protected with a thick layer of bonded superdense armor, nuclear dampers, meson screens and radiation shielding. To top it off, the entire structure is psionicly shielded to prevent any form of telepathic intrusion. The airspace within 100km of the palace is strictly controlled by security technicians within the palace and in subterranean control structures below the grounds. This impressive array of defenses is concealed from public view. It is of the utmost importance that the seat of Imperial power not be seen as a fortified bunker. Shields and weapons – while necessary – show trepidation. The Emperor strives to convey confidence and power. The palace does all that and more.

The central shaft of the palace contains the Imperial Gardens and aquarium, each of which are approximately 400 meters deep and contain flora and fauna from places throughout the Imperium. Along the equator is a 25-meter wide promenade that encircles the entire palace sphere. The promenade has walkways, a tram and a narrow highway for small vehicles. Its inner wall is adorned with scenes from Imperial history. Speaking of history, the current Emperor has access to the Hall of Wisdom, where he may speak with artificially intelligent simulations of all previous Emperors.

The throne room of the Grand Palace is a spacious octagonal room that is adjacent to the Imperial Residence. The Emperor entertains his most esteemed visitors in this room. The  allowed Iridium Throne was built by Cleon Zhunastu himself and is one of the few surviving artefacts from the first palace.

The Grand Palace of Arbellatra is attended by several smaller floating gravitic structures, including the following: the Consortium Trinary, which is a trio of small spheres, each of which contains a museum with exhibits dedicated to the three Imperiums; Paulo's Annex, a pleasure palace that contains all sorts of entertainments and is often used for sporting events; and Tomutov's Palace, which is used to house esteemed guests of the Emperor.
