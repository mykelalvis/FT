The adventurers’ timely arrival may mean the difference between life and death for a group of persecuted minorities.

## Overview
A lost little boy latches onto the heroes. When they return him to his people, the Askala, they’re asked to meet with the band’s elders. A spacelift of nomads resulted in one of their ships being left behind on a hostile world. They hire the PCs to learn of its fate. The group finds they have maybe just enough time to prevent a slaughter of the Askala group by government troops.

Theatre of Operations is a one-page, no-frills adventure for tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds. The PCs must have a starship. 
To determine the number of enemies during indicated portions of the adventure, a formula is used with n representing the number of PCs. Example: n+3 is the number of PCs plus three Monetary values are given in dollars ($). The referee should substitute the currency of the chosen game world. 

## Background
After years of mounting intolerance to anyone unlike themselves, the government of l'jad has passed the tipping point into state sponsored bigotry. Most of their ire is aimed at the Askala, a nomadic people who were among the first explorers and settlers of the subsector. Over time, mainly due to misperceptions of their culture, they’ve become a persecuted minority. Despite open prejudice and organized pogroms, they have thrived and settled on several worlds, including l'jad. The ultraconservative government, succumbing to fear, has decided that the Askala must be dealt with, and has instituted a pogrom against them. 
The Askala have requested massive spacelifts from their stargoing brethren. But as the government presses them wherever they’re found, a discreet withdrawal has become a discordant rout. 
## Players’ Information
While conducting business on a world one parsec from I’jad, the adventurers notice a bedraggled-looking child following them. The little boy is wary, but hunger seems to be overcoming his fear. If they take pity on the boy, they learn he’s a member of the Askala, who’ll no doubt be looking for him. The boy’s people occupy a refugee camp just outside of Startown. There the heroes encounter a tired, disheveled — but nonetheless grateful — group. During the adventurers’ visit, a delegation of the camp’s leaders asks to speak with them privately on an urgent business matter. Explaining the basic situation (see Background above), the elders ask for the party’s help. The nomads were part of a caravan of several battered ships escaping the hostilities. The caravan delayed its takeoff by several days to take on supplies and as many fellow Askala as they could, but a week later emerged from hyperspace to find one of their number missing. The Askala waited a week to see if the ship was merely delayed, to no avail. Unfortunately, word has trickled in of massacres occurring on I’jad, and the elders are concerned. Deeming it far too dangerous to go back and investigate the others’ fate, the elders want to hire the PCs — individuals far more capable of handling themselves in dire straits — to travel to I’jad, learn the fate of the missing Askala ship, and rescue any survivors they can. 
The elders can’t spare much hard currency, but offer $10,000 in cash and up to $10,000 in trade goods. In addition, they can spread the word among the Askala that has the effect of granting the team hospitality anywhere the nomads are gathered. The elders can up the payment if the PCs are in a haggling mood, but not by much. 
If the terms are agreeable, the leaders give the adventurers basic descriptions of the missing Askala leaders and their ship, and small objects to present as proof that the larger Askala group sent them. 
## Referee’s Information
The adventurers must have a starship in order to complete their mission. If they don’t own or otherwise have access to one, the Askala loans them one of theirs on 8+. 
The missing Askala ship suffered a drive failure just before transition to FTL flight. Unable to alert the rest of the caravan, the ship’s captain decided to risk returning to I’jad. They quickly learned the depths of the natives’ hatred of Askala. The nomads were accused of espionage, theft, spreading disease, stealing jobs, and any other reason the racist I’jadi could think of as an excuse to harass them. Forced to keep moving, the caravan found temporary refuge in some badlands, but not before suffering several casualties. And it’s only a question of time before they’re located again. 
The referee should prepare a map of a section of badlands (real life maps can serve). The planetary environment isn’t important, as long as the atmosphere is breathable. The Askala currently number 50; breaking down as 15 men, 25 women, and 10 children. They’re holed up in a cave system, but need first aid, food, and water, and armed only with small melee weapons. 
Several elements of the I’jadi military have formed into hunter killer units. They’re armed and equipped to the planetary Tech Level–1, including heavy weapons; they’re not about to waste state of the art military hardware on Askala scum. 2D6+2 units numbering n(4) each are combing the badlands looking for the nomads.
By the time the team arrives in orbit, several I’jadi units are converging on the Askalas’ position. Almost as soon as the soldiers find them, they’ll commence a slaughter. 
The team must first locate the Askala. The easiest way is to use the ship’s sensors to first locate the downed Askala ship from orbit. This takes 1D6+3 orbits; each orbit takes 1.5 hours (11+, electronics or sensor skills.) Failure adds another 1.5 hours and requires another success throw. Once the ship is found, the direction the Askala headed can be deduced (8+ (tactical or hunting/tracking skills.) 
Once the Askalas' location is pinpointed, the clock begins ticking in earnest. The team has 10D6 minutes until their arrival. The soldiers locate the Askala and begin the killing spree in 10D6 minutes. Note the difference in times; this is how many minutes the heroes have either to pick up the Askala and flee the area or they’re late getting there. Every five minutes the group doesn’t show up costs the Askala 1D6 in casualties. 
When the heroes’ ship shows up, throw morale for the combating troops: (5+ to stand and fight; 7+ if the ship’s arrival is especially violent or dramatic — for example, the heroes arrive weapons blazing.) If the soldiers break morale, they flee in the most direct escape route and stay gone for 5D6 minutes. Soldiers that stand fire on the starship; this is with heavy weapons on 7+. Note that the interstellar government takes a dim view of firing on armed troops from a starship without a clear declaration of war or otherwise official approval.

## SPECIAL PROJECT LASER WEAPON

![[GRA1-IitR-357.jpg|100]]
Built around the standard high-energy laser cartridge, this concealable handgun is used by intelligence operatives in the service of Neubayern. The weapon takes the form of a short rod that resembles nothing more than a bulky pen, complete with pocket clip. It is in no way a ‘body pistol’ however; the metallic construction and internal electronics will be detected by quite basic instruments, though the device might not be immediately recognised as a weapon.

Triggering the firing stud releases energy from the cartridge, delivering a powerful one-shot laser attack which has a very short range due to the difficulty of collimating a beam in such a small device. The cartridge can be replaced by unscrewing the rear of the weapon but this is not practical in combat. This weapon is not intended for that role; it is a last-ditch means of defence or assassination tool.
