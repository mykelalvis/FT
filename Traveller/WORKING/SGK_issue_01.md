**Dagudashaag**

The name derives from the Old High Vilani
“Dakhukhuga Gulike Dushaage”, meaning “Rimward
Galactic Province” - this in itself indicates just how
long the sector has been settled. Systems in this sector
bear the traces of many waves of settlement and
occupation in the life of the Galaxy. Sites have been
unearthed in Remnants subsector, which have provided
artefacts dating back more than 40 million years.
Although the mysterious Ancients were not as active in
Dagudashaag as in the Deneb Domain, several sites
have been found, including one in this very subsector -
Anomaly/Argi.

The S'mrii, a reptilian race native to the coreward/
spinward regions of this sector, achieved spaceflight
some twenty-seven thousand years ago, and despite a
number of setbacks, they had a thriving interstellar
federation by the time they were contacted by the
Vilani ten thousand years ago.

Subsequent settlement by the Solomani has created a
strong economic “axis” to the sector, roughly along a
line between Mimu, Medurma and Argi, and
Dagudashaag now exports a fair quantity of its output
to the less-developed sectors of Gushemege and
Zarushagar. The sector is the industrial center of Vland
Domain, and its GSP (Gross Sector Product) exceeds
that of Vland Sector.

The picture many newcomers have of the sector is of a
grey, featureless expanse of factory systems filled with
grey, humourless Vilani. Nothing could be further from
the truth. Dagudashaag is a sector of contrasts, from
the soaring, fusion-carved mountains and glittering
city-warrens of Medurma, to the floating dreamworlds
of Ushra, to the sulphur volcanoes of Lenashuuk, the
macroengineering of GateWay's beanstalk, and
Kaurga's unspoilt plains.

The social structure of Dagudashaag is equally varied.
Arrive at any starport, and you will encounter the
sibilant speech of S'mrii, the strangely striped visages
of Ziadd, the penetrating gazes of Scanians, and the
towering, richly-robed figures of Aslan merchants.
Ancient tensions and rivalries between these groups,
dating to the Vilani Consolidation Wars and before,
give this sector the complex social map it has today.

```
The advent of the Rebellion has struck Dagudashaag
hard, bringing death to some and hardship to many. A
settled, industrial center has become the battleground
for two of the greatest starfleets the Galaxy has ever
seen. Entire planets have been laid waste -- others
have tried to seal themselves off from the Universe in
the hope of riding out the storm. Sector Duchess Karyn
Viisarikaa, pursuing an idealistic course of neutrality,
tries to preserve the principles of liberty and
civilisation in the few systems she still controls. Her
followers search for ways to strike back at the
murderer Lucan and the Usurper Dulinor, who
destroyed their sector. Outside a few havens of
stability, the sector is a lawless frontier, the province
of roving bands of pirates, and worse. Welcome to the
civilised Imperial Core!
```
##### ARGI

**AMBER ALERT:**

```
The Argi subsector is currently controlled by the Ilelish
forces with the exception of Akiva and Gateway which
have been declared neutral. This was after a treaty
made in 1116 in which the Scanians granted Dulinor's
forces the Naval base at Ha-Nasi (which had been
mysteriously been vacated of all equipment six months
before) and promised to remain neutral in the Lucan/
Dulinor conflict. At this point in time, there are still
occasional conflicts within the Gateway system but the
rest of the subsector has been relatively untouched by
the conflict and has returned to "business as usual".
The only difference is that the main contractor is now
the Ilelish Fleet!
```
**The Rebellion Effect**

```
In 1116 as Hiirinanan's forces withdraw from central
portion of Argi subsector and Dulinor's forces advanced
to fill the gap. Lenashuuk was retaken by Ilelish fleet
after fierce battles with National fleets. Dulinor then
broke through into the Sapphyre subsector in 145-without encountering any resistance due to the fleet
already having fled. Core and Ilelish fleets met in
Pact and Sapphyre. Argi subsector is virtually
untouched.

PHYSIOLOGY



```
Scanians were genetically engineered by a Solomani
geneering company from normal human stock in order
to allow colonisation of high gravity, water worlds. A
Scanian male will average 1.8m in height and weights
approximately 80 kilograms. A Female averages about
1.6m and 68 kilograms. Height-to-weight ratio for
males is 45 kg per meter thereby increasing muscular
capacity. The Solomani geneers decided to use a
planet in the Dagudashaag sector [0935], which they
called Gaea, for their experimentation. To endure the
intense cold, high gravity and effects of the sea they
altered the colonists' genes to create the following
mutations:
```
- Polarised membrane covering the entire cornea
    of the eye to protect against sun, wind, dust and
    spray. This gives Scanians an overall white eye
    apparently devoid of iris or pupil which darkens
    to a light grey colour under intense light. Most
    unadapted humans feel that this gives the
    Scanian an inscrutable expression. The
    membrane increases near sight but at the cost of
    decreased long sight.
- Elongated eyelashes to protect the membrane
    from flying dust or salt particles.
- A pressure-sensitive membrane within the inner
    ear to protect the ear drum. This membrane is
    thin enough not to affect sound but hardens
    under pressure to form a shield. This obviously
    means that at great pressure the Scanian is
    rendered almost totally deaf but retains normal
    balance.
- Membrane-like filters within the nasal passages
    allows free flow of gases but prevents flooding by
    fluids.
- Secondary layer of subcutaneous fat under the
    skin to increase resistance against the cold and
    to increase frontal buoyancy. This means that
    Scanian males float face up like females rather
    than face down.
- Controllable melanin pigment under the skin
    allows the Scanian body to adapt to increased
    ultra-violet radiation. A Scanian's tan will darken
    or fade within 24 hours dependent on the amount
    of sunlight to which the body is subjected.
- Skin excretion of a waterproof oil which
    completely covers the skin to the depth of 1
    micron. This enables the Scanian to remain
    absolutely dry even when swimming.
- Increased circulatory system to maintain blood
    flow under higher gravity.
- Bones altered so that they are composed of an
    internal honeycombed structure to increase
    weight-bearing capacity without increased
    weight.
- Increased muscle structure to enable Scanians to

```
cope with higher gravity without hindering work
ability.
```
- Small breasts in females to prevent excessive
    drag due to increased gravity and to better
    streamline the figure.

APPEARANCE



```
Scanians tend towards apparently fragile features, long
eyelashes, white to grey featureless eyes, a crop of
white course hair on the head and a lack of body hair
on the rest of the physique. The Scanian male is tall,
usually olive skinned, well muscled with an ease of
movement that belays the high gravities of the worlds
they usually frequent. Females are generally tall, with
long white hair, full lips with a deceptive slimness.
```
AQUAN PHYSIOLOGY



```
Aquans are Scanian's that have been fully adapted for
amphibious living in oxygen-bearing oceans. They are
descended from one of the early geneering
experiments and are considered by many almost a
separate race from the Scanians. The further
alterations carried out by the geneers consists of:
```
- Valve placed deep in the trachea which is
    formed from 3 leaf-like cusps of a thin but
    fibrous tissue which can be voluntarily closed by
    reflex action to prevent flooding of the lungs.
- At the rear of the throat near the oropharynx is
    a gill. This extracts oxygen from the water
    entering the mouth by using the genetically
    strengthened muscles of the oropharynx to force
    water through the gill.
- The extracted oxygen is passed to specialised
    alveoli in the chest cavity while the excess
    carbon dioxide is used to expel the
    deoxygenated water through the Aquan's blow
    hole at the rear of the neck.

## CONTACT: THE SCANIACONTACT: THE SCANIACONTACT: THE SCANIACONTACT: THE SCANIA

A major disadvantage of this adaptation was the total
loss of speech. To compensate the Aquans have
evolved a complex sign language which they use in the
place of a spoken one as a result.

In addition Aquans' have an extremely streamlined
body structure with retractable genitalia in the males.
The fingers and toes have elongated and a thin fibrous
webbing was formed between the digits to increase
swimming ability.

Aquans have been known to have reached depths of 1
kilometer without ill effects.

When on the surface the Aquan's gill closes and the
trachea valve opens to allow air to enter the lungs.
The Aquans, while extremely graceful in the water are
rendered relatively clumsy as a result of the limb
alterations, on land.

AQUAN APPEARANCE



Aquans are similar in appearance to surface-dwelling
Scanians apart from the obvious physical differences;
the blow hole at the rear of the neck and the
elongated and webbed fingers and toes. To prevent
blockage of the blow-hole while swimming all Aquans,
male and female, wear their hair either short, tied up
or in a mohawk crest. They are also less modest than
Scanians, frequently only wearing sufficient clothes to
cover the genitalia slits.

REPRODUCTION



The genetic adaptations recorded above were
permanently grafted into the Scanian male's DNA.
While interbreeding between unadapted humans and
Scanians or Aquans is possible, Scanian/Aquan
offspring will only be born if the male partner is a
Scanian or Aquan. Although the alterations are
relatively stable in Scanian pairings there is a 1 in a
million chance of a throwback to unaltered human and
a 1 in 500,000 chance of a Sport. Sports generally carry
partial adaptations and are usually sterile. These odds
increase to 1 in a hundred chance of a throwback with
a Scanian or Aquan male/ unadapted female pairing.
Scanian females have a gestation period of only seven
months in comparison to the normal 9 month period.

As a result there is a possibility that an unadapted
male/Scanian female pairing will result in a
miscarriage since such offspring are always unadapted.
While pairings between Scanians and unadapted
humans do occur, it is extremely rare for pairings
between Aquans and surface dwellers, even Scanians.
This is believed to be because Aquans find air-breathers movement in the water extremely clumsy
and ungraceful. That, coupled with the strong
possibility of such a pairing resulting in unadapted or
Sport offspring makes such a relationship unlikely.

PSYCHOL0GY

Scanians were originally intended to be dispersed

```
throughout the Imperium. As such, as many volunteers
as were willing for their offspring to be born with such
alterations, were gathered from any healthy, suitable
source. Any binding culture was non-existent at first.
Then the Long Night threatened and the project's
funding was completely withdrawn. Although supplies
and equipment were left behind, the lack of outside
contact and the severe planetary conditions took its
toll. Several segments of the colonists, in particular
the more exotic or specialised adaptations, completely
died out in the intermediate period of isolation. The
Scanians would have probably remained as little more
than warring tribes on the road to extinction were it
not for the actions of the first Scanian prophet,
Benjamin Scania. The remaining people were bound
together as one people by his teachings. He taught the
vital importance of tradition and the power of
knowledge. From his teaching (known as the Path) the
Scanians learned to work together as a people, to learn
from the past to prepare for the future and to work
towards the perfection of the Scanian ideal. Over the
centuries his teachings have created an almost unique
culture. The physical adaptations and the emphasis
placed on logical deduction has resulted in a strong
sense-oriented realism. They believe work must be
carried out to the best of a person's ability and that
good workmanship is a source of pleasure. This desire
to give of their best may also be responsible for the
almost total lack of dishonesty exhibited by this
culture. They can be devious but not untruthful. This
work ethic is even to be found in the Scanian
recreation. Most spend their spare time as part of
voluntary study groups examining and cross-examining
various matters. The subject isn't important. That the
conclusion reached is both original and/or logical is.
Free expression is encouraged and nurtured among the
children. The main Scanian holiday period is an
extension of that - the Yarhei Kel'a (see below). There
is very little sexual discrimination except in several
small, variant sects to be found in Scanian
communities. Males and females fight in the military
together, can enter the Sanhedri or even become a
member of the Twin Pillars.
```
```
Scanians have strong privacy customs yet they rarely
abuse them. The Scanians have a social distance of 2
meters in comparison to the Imperial average of 1.
Aquans usually expect a minimum of 3 meters and
Rabbinic learn to cope with 1.5 meters. In addition
Scanians are generally very modest and will generally
wear clothes concealing most of the body. This varies
though. Aquans will usually restrict clothing in their
own colonies to sufficient to cover the genitals while
Rabbani and mercantile Nehutei wear long robes with
hoods that conceal their entire bodies. Despite this
there are no modesty taboos to be found within any
mainstream Scanian settlement. Scanians have a strong
belief in the value of sentient life and although believe
that war may be necessary to protect their cultural
existence all other killing, including execution for
murder, is wrong. Scanians have a strong conservation
outlook and, although not vegetarians by any means
will do everything they can to protect natural wildlife.
It is believed that the blatant disregard for the local
```

environment by Imperial mining consortiums was as
much to blame for the second Scanian riots as the
cruelty of Shaida Gakushuu (see 'History' section).
Scanians' strong work ethic reflects in their
punctuality in meeting schedules but visitor's can be
dismayed to discover this does not carry over into any
other aspect of Scanian life. A Rabbani may turn up
several hours late and a study group may work far into
the night if they are discussing an involved concept.

**“There are only two things to fear in 'The Business',
an Anpanaarian judge or a Scanian Customs
officer...”**
Old Smuggler's Saying in Dagudashaag

TRADITION



Like the Vilani, the Scanians believe that tradition is
the solid foundation upon which a stable society is
built. Unlike the Vilani, Scanians believe in exploring
the very limits of their imagination and talents. There
is no aristocracy as such. Instead scholars, regardless
of background, are revered and honoured. They
study the past, but only so that they may
better prepare for the future. Scanian scholars (Rab'an) may spend centuries dissecting and
cross examining the most absurd of concepts,
in the belief that should such a concept
become reality the Scanian people will be
prepared to cope with the consequences of its
existence without delay. Scanians' view it thus;
the matter has already been discussed and the
true path chosen. Why hesitate?

The present, in the Scanian mind, is the time
for action and preparation for tomorrow. This
philosophy was clearly verified by the Psionic
suppressions. Although the decisions reached
may not always be the most racially beneficial
in hindsight, the Scanian are always ready, and
prepared, to react to any situation. To help
with the cross-examination of decisions, all
Scanian are expected to spend a period of 30
days every year (known as Yarhei Kel'a or "Time of
Testing") at a Scanian center of Knowledge evaluating
and cross-examining the thoughts of the local Rab'ani.
This concept of cross-examination is known as Ve'Ima
Iphka which translates as "Perhaps the opposite holds
true...” Probably the best known trait of the Scanian,
as far as Imperial society is concerned, is the Ve'dtok
or "Path of True Seeing". Each Scanian is trained to
constantly examine their surroundings so they can read
the "truth" in all circumstances. Scanians have an
exceptional capacity for logical deduction. This,
coupled with their intense observational abilities (the
magnifying abilities of the Scanian cornea membrane
makes even the slightest movement noticeable) and
knowledge of human and in some cases, alien body
language, has given them the almost uncanny ability to
read people like a book. There is an old smuggler's
saying in Dagudashaag which states: “There are only
two things to fear in 'The Business', an Anpanaarian
judge or a Scanian customs officer”.

HISTORY



```
“History is always repeating itself, but each time
the price goes up.”
Unknown
```
```
The system was first surveyed by Vilani scouts in -4,
but was left uncolonised until -2,053 when Solomanis
attempted to set up a supply base on the surface. This
proved unviable due to the excessive gravity and
hostile environment and the base was moved to Abbayi
in -1,994. Gaea (Akiva) was later colonized in -1,953 by
a Solomani company dealing in genetic engineering.
Several different approaches were apparently tried but
only two have survived through to this day; Scanians
and Aquans. These adaptations were carried out on the
DNA of frozen embryos and once that adaptation
proved stable the geneers altered that breed of DNA
even further. The original base was sited at what is
now known as Genesis, deep within the rock face.
Whether any attempts were made to transport adapted
humans to other sites is unknown. What is
known is that in -1,793 the company left Gaea
never to return. Behind them they left
centuries of adapted people who did not wish to
return to Sol. The company left behind a great
deal of supplies, data tapes and equipment,
possibly intending to return for them at a later
date. Whatever the reason, they never returned
and most of the equipment remained hidden
within their underground base. Over the next
two centuries, the various races of Gaea fell
back to tech 2 and stabilised. Most of the more
exotic adaptations died off or were killed by
roaming bands of pirates who terrorised the
various small communities. During this time the
Aquans remained deep beneath the sea, a
stable tech 1 society who completely avoided
the more violent surface-dwellers. Over the
years they became little more than a myth to
the surface dwellers. In -895 the various tribes
were on a steep path to total extinction. There
was no co-operation between the various tribes and
everyone's hand was against everyone else's. It was in
this year that Benjamin Ra'Scania was born.
```
```
Legend has it that he was almost drowned as a child
because of his small stature. Little is known of him
prior to -862 when he stumbled upon the Geneer's
supply base on Genesis. Others of his age would have
wrecked the place looking for loot. Scania was of a
totally different nature. He gathered together the data
tapes and over the next few months figured out how to
make them work. He was fascinated by all the
knowledge even although he didn't, at that time,
understand it. Over the next two years Scania gathered
together supplies and gradually made Genesis a fit
place to live. Then he withdrew to his data tapes and
books. It was 22 years before he saw another human
being. He immersed himself in the knowledge, learning
how the technology worked, learning the history of his
people for the first time. In -838 Scania reappeared.
```
```

```

He taught the benefits of knowledge and learning at
various local population centres but was invariably
chased away. Despite this, over the next two years, he
gathered together a small nucleus of disciples who he
trained at Genesis. They were trained to study, to use
the knowledge of the past to understand the future. It
was in -831 that he made his first move. His disciples,
armed with grav-belts and lasers, kidnapped the eldest
son of each tribal leader and brought them to Genesis
in secret. There they were brainwashed into learning.
Next Scania informed the various tribal leaders that
their sons were alive and that if they attended a
meeting at Skal point they would be returned alive.
The leaders came to do battle, proud and defiant.
They left shattered men.

```
“To everyone's surprise he, Benjamin Ra'Scania,
stated that under no circumstances was any planet
or city to be named after him...”
Holo-Recording made in -
```
The display of rebuilt technology cowered them into
submission. They expected Scania to enslave them.
Instead he asked only that each of their children be
sent to Genesis for a period of three years at the end
of which they would be returned. Slowly Gaean society
was altered from within. As well as raising the
technology he taught principles of civilisation.
According to legend Scania is supposed to have lived
until -698. Before he died he called together his
disciples, his sons of knowledge (Ba-Rab'i), and formed
the first council of knowledge (Sanhedra). Rather than
have his mortal remains become a religious symbol he
ordered that his body be disposed of at sea without

ceremony. It took a further 500 years before Gaea was
fully united as a people. At the first united council
held in -187 a holo-recording of Scania was played. In
this recording, made in -837, Scania expounded his
doctrines and stated that the planet was to be
renamed to record forever in the minds of the people
this momentous occasion. To everyone's surprise he

```
stated that under no circumstances was any planet or
city to be named after him. Instead he suggested the
name "Akiva" (the Spirit of Co-operation). Centres of
learning were set up and the people, now a single
racial type, studied the Path of Scania. In -79 the
Sanhedra Ben Hakhamim hypothesised the existence of
the Aquan race. In -54 they (correctly) predicted the
location of their ocean settlements. In -53 Scanians
ventured down to the Aquan settlement of Atlantis and
made peaceful contact with their cousins. By -
Aquans were represented on the Sanhedra Ben
Hakhamim and in -11 Sameii Dachaaus, an Aquan
representative on the Sanhedra was elected the first
Aquan Nasii (twin ruler) and the Path of Scania was
studied by every living sentient on the planet. Not
blindly, learning by rote, but questioning and probing
the very depths of available knowledge (at present the
position of Nasii is held by an Aquan female Melissa Sa-Badasas). It was in this period that R. Hasseim
succeeded in proving the existence of psionic ability
and testing, and consequently training, began in
earnest. Contact with other sentient races had begun
in -306 with passing Aslani traders. Scanians travelled
with Aslani ships throughout the sector and ship's were
purchased which were systematically dissected to
better understand the principles. I n - 2 8 5 Akiva was
"visited" by representatives of the Aakhri Empire based
at Argi. The Empire was a Vilani settlement hat had
taken to enslaving the other local races which had
been reduced to pre-space flight during the Long
Night. An initial attempt to enslave various Scanian
clans on Akiva failed. In part this was due to the
intense gravity and extreme weather conditions, in
part due to the difficulty in enslaving or controlling a
seagoing community, but mostly it was the Scanian
mentality which refused to be enslaved. In -283 The
Aakhri gave up its futile attempts to enslave the
Scanians and settled for a treaty allowing them to
build a military base in the system sited on Ha-Nasi.
When the Empire fell in 40 under the weight of its own
caste-ridden structure the base reverted to the
Scanian people. By 71 the Scanians had risen rapidly to
tech level 10 and had a small fleet of jump-2 ship's.
The newly formed Third Imperium on its first contact
with the Scanian thought it had found another major
race until the Scanian council explained. To begin with
the Scanians rejected offers of membership in the
Imperium but decided to accept membership in 75
when it became plain that the Imperium was willing to
move in force on non-aligned worlds. Thus Akiva
escaped the worst of the Vilani Pacification Campaign
and was able to begin seeding colonies of Scanians
throughout the Sector. In most cases, the Scanians
were willing to share their settlements with others and
only in cases such as Gateway/Argi (1331) where the
environment was suitable for Scanian occupation but
hostile to unadapted races were full colonies created.
In 235 Scanians discovered several major
breakthroughs in psionic testing and training and this
knowledge was exported throughout the Core. Scanian
psionic teachers were to be found in almost every
major psionic institute in civilised space. The Study
supported psionic training extremely well. In 480
Zhodani diplomats were invited to Akiva to expound on
```

their psionic training. This cemented a strong bond
with the Zhodani consulate which continued right up to
the Crisis of 799. In 659 a newly elected Rabban named
Hale Shagraa suggested the possibility of a psionic
suppression by the Imperium. Although it was
considered a very slight possibility at that time, it led
to the seeding of major aspects of Scanian culture to
the Scanian colonies. The system of Nehutei (Messenger/Traders) was established so that each
center would be able to retain free lines of
communication and to prevent any of the various
colonies from falling away from the Study and Path due
to ignorance. In 787 it became clear to the Sanhedra
that R. Shagraa's hypothesis was about to become
reality. Rather than abandon the psionic teachings that
had become so much a part of the Scanian way they
elected to fight. The scattering of Scanian settlements
were accelerated and all such settlements were
instructed to put aside psionic training so that they
would not become targets of repression. Links with the
Zhodani Consulate were strengthened. Although they
were prepared for war they did not expect the
Imperium to strike so hard. The Imperium on the other
hand was determined to decimate the Scanian
Institute. In 800 Imperial forces took Akiva and
successfully held it for 28 days but the combined
problems of high gravity and the Sanheichiir (Scanian
psionic commandos) attacks forced the troops to
return to a high orbit siege. Even there the Imperial
fleet were not safe from attack. True, no ship could
leave port safely and the Scanian planetary defenses
were limited but shuttles full of Sanheichiir were
teleporting onboard the battle cruisers and had
successfully taken six out of commission. Eventually,
on instructions from [[Capital]] the fleet settled in for a
total siege. This lasted for 22 years until the Scanian
forces were sufficiently weak to be no longer able to
prevent another invasion. Akiva was totally decimated.
Troops killed thousands of known psionics over the
next six month period. A holovideo of the Empress
Paula II was placed in the Shrine of Creation at Genesis
against the cultural belief's of the people. This led to
the first riots in 824 in which the Governor Riium was
assassinated. The Imperium replied by promoting
Riium's aide to Governor and granting him a free hand.
Governor Shaida Gakushuu, known in Scanian history as
"The Butcher" celebrated his new fortune by burning
the University city of Gamala to the ground with all
inhabitants inside.

Four million people were believed killed. Next he
authorised the slaughter of every Rabban and their
family on planet. Over the next 6 months it is believed
that a further 12.5 million people died as a result of
his acts. Other Imperials were sickened by his cruelty
and by hi s sadistic banquets of death.

Report after report were sent to [[Capital]] but they were
apparently ignored for 15 months. Instead Imperial
mining interests entered the system and began to use
Scanian slave labour to strip-mine Akiva. On 132-The Butcher was assassinated by Sanheichiir as he took
part in another of his infamous banquets. His body was
internally exploded by several top telekenetics who

```
had survived the earlier persecutions. This was the
signal to start the rebellion. The Imperial's fled from
the naked terror of a race gutted by torture and
injustice. Once more the imperial's retreated to their
Naval base on Ha-Nasi and awaited orders. On 305-a meeting was held at Rehin port on Rachel between
the Sanhedra Ben Hakhamim and the Imperial forces.
Due to the direct intervention of the Sector Duke,
Davin Viisarikaa a compromise was agreed. This
agreement placed the Akiva system-under martial law
and restricted traffic entering or leaving the system to
```
```
imperial ships and imperial citizens. Akiva was posted
as a red zone but it placed Akiva, Yosua and Rachel
back into Scanian hands. The agreement stated further
that the practice of psionics must cease immediately
and a Governor would be based at Genesis to oversee
the Scanian government. It was a "marriage of
convenience". Both sides knew it and agreed to it.
```
```
Imperial interests were allowed to return to Akiva but
only on the understanding that a fair price would be
paid to the Scanians and that a more ecologically
sound method of extraction would be used. Akiva was
apparently fully isolated. In 854 Ba'ko-ba (Akiva's
secondary star) started experiencing extreme solar
activity which completely messed up sensors trying to
track ship activity but ground forces on Akiva claimed
```

nothing unusual was occurring. In reality the Scanians
were using the cyclic flare activity to cover the coming
and going of a secret merchant fleet which was trading
Scanian minerals for technology. At the same tine.
Nehutei were using the situation to keep information
flowing throughout the Scanian colonies. How the
Scanians managed to amass such a large merchant
fleet and how they managed to keep it completely
secret from Imperial forces for over a hundred years is
unknown. What is known is that Twin Lines, using
unadapted Scanians, successfully negotiated several
supply contracts, including the supply contract to and
from Akiva. On Akiva the Scanians successfully turned
from psionics, totally eradicating it from the Path and
Study. In 1021 Akiva successfully negotiated for
readmission into the Imperium.

This attempt was successful mainly because of then
current Duke Viisarikaa's tireless efforts petitioning the
Moot on their behalf. It is said that the Scanians never
forget a debt, their loyalty has been to the Viisarikaa
family ever since. Akiva still retained an Imperial
Governor and the Naval base at Ha-Nasi would remain
but Akiva could freely trade with the outside world. At
the Liberation ceremony it was revealed that Twin
Lines were Scanian owned. The new Governor is
believed to have immediately asked for the seclusion
policy to be reinstated. Akiva successfully maintained
its independence. At the time of the Second Survey
Akiva was given the UPP A98A859-D but as a silent
protest the Sanhedra Ben Hakhamim demanded, and
got, the Government code changed to 6 - A captive
government. In 1115 representatives petitioned
Emperor Strephon for full rights. After examining the
facts, this was agreed and a ten year withdrawal
period was agreed to allow Imperial forces and mining
interests to leave. This was acceptable to the Scanian
people and power was slowly handed back to the
planet. After the Emperor's assassination, the Scanians
were among the first of the planets to back Karyn's
stand.

SCANIAN CULTURE



Scanians believe in the acquisition of knowledge as
the only true aristocracy. Scholars are respected
above all and a broad knowledge is respected most of
all. Knowledge of the Teachings of Scania are not a
prime requisite and, while the majority does believe
in a divine creator, belief is not a prime requirement
of their culture. They are not ready a religion so
much as a way of life. The Scanian Government
consists of people participation at all levels, at the
Top is the Twin Pillars or rulers; the Nasii (Military
and Governmental ruler) who is chosen by election of
the populous from the Sanhedra Ben Hakhamim (Council of Scholars), and the Avi'Di (Law Giver)
chosen by the Sanhedra Ben Hakhamim from the
people. Their advisors are the Sanhedra Ben
Hakhamim, who are made up of the scholars who
have proven their mental ability in the testing, and
the Savo'raim (Scholars of the Path, the "high priests"
of Scanian teaching). Beneath them is a massive

```
bureaucracy which runs the world. The military
consists of a conscripted force known as the Purifiers
```
```
and a paramilitary segment known as the Regulators.
Advising the Avi'Di on legal matters and acting as a
court of appeal is the Sanhedra Ket'ana which consists
of 23 Judges. The local police force are known as
Gatekeepers and legal matters are dealt with by
three separate and distinct legal courts known as
Gates. The Gate Bakamaa deals with all monetary
matters, The Gate Bah'ezi deals with contract law
including marriage contracts. The Gate Babha'ti deals
with governmental law. Criminal law is dealt with by
the Court of judgement which consists of trial by
three judges. In minor matters a person can elect to
have his case heard by Hedyo't. This consists of any
three Scanians who are totally impartial and any
judgement reached is considered legal. Appeal is to
the Court of judgement in all cases where the
decision of the Hedyo't is not considered satisfactory.
and the complainant must pay the full legal costs in
such a case. Since a single case can easily run into
several thousand credits even for a simple legal
matter, the decision of the Hedyo't is generally
adhered to.
```
```
Marriage is considered a legal agreement and a
contract must be made prior to pairing, laying down
the terms and conditions of the marriage and the
conditions of divorce. Before divorce can be granted
the exact sum in hard cash must be presented to the
other partner. This tradition even extends to a one
night stand and standard contracts are available at all
hotels.
```
```
The distribution of wealth is fairly evenly spread with
less than 1% classed as rich and only 2% considered
poor. These are relative terms. The poor of Akiva
would be classed as moderately well off on most other
planets. Lack of wealth is not considered an obstacle
to rising in Scanian society since intellect not money
decides one's status.
```
```
Every Scanian, whether genetically pure or not, is
entitled to a 30 day period known as Yarhei Kel'a
when they attend the local Sanhedra and debate with
the gathered Rabbani. This policy of cross-examination extends to all aspects of Scanian life and
Government officials and judges frequently face
cross-examination of their decisions by mere
members of the public.
```

It should be noted that the Ve'Ima Iphka must be
original and show logic or the interrupter may find
themselves in jail for "Ignorant or abusive
interruption".

REFEREE'S ONLY

1. The Scanians have not rejected psionics. In 799 a
second Psionics Institute was established at Abbayi. The
Scanian colony there is extremely small and new
trainees arrived dressed in the dark cloaks of the
Nehutei and trained psionics left in their place so the
population at Ma'kot remained stable. Only Rabban who
had achieved the rank of Sanhedra Rabbai were tested
and only those who would not be missed were sent. In
addition the Scanian's have a large population of non-adapted followers that the Imperial's seem to forget are
totally Scanian in mind and ideal. Once the Centre was
established, training of the Sanheichiir (Little Knives of
the Mind) resumed in eamest. Each Scanian Sanhedra
tests for psionic potential and those found trustworthy
are sent to the Centre for further testing. In addition,
selective breeding programs at several off-planet
colonies have built up a sizable army of Sanheichiir
ready to fight.
    2. The reason the Imperial
    Navy never caught on to the
    Twin Line merchant fleet's
    coming and going's is the fact
    that each ship is secretly
    equipped with a black globe.
    The technology was "bought"
    from Medurman naval forces
    and duplicated on Akiva.
    There were originally ten
    ship's so equipped, serviced
    by a single Medurman
    engineer. When he died the
    Scanian's kept the devices as
    well maintained as possible
    but currently only three are
    in full working order with
    another two working
    occasionally. Akiva is
    currently petitioning Karyn
    for a crew to repair the black
    globes.
3. Karyn has been informed of the existence of the black
globe equipped ships and that Sanheichiir troops exist.
She does not know where the Institute is hidden though
a select group of 4 Scanian sanheichiir have been sent as
a personal bodyguard. This action didn't go down well
with Karyn's personal guard, Dunbar's Dragons. This,
coupled with Karyn's own prejudice against psionics has
resulted in the Sanheichiir being kept at a distance. This
alienation has resulted in the Scanians going about their
appointed task in a rather unorthodox manner. Karl
Ragoul, an unadapted Scanian has even formed close
bonds with several Alikasch street gangs. In particular
the Eihkiylreakhu gang are in very close contact with
Karl and act as his eyes and ears on Medurma. Karyn has
appointed Carl Tarrant to liase with the Scanian
Sanhedra at this time.

STARPORT PROCEDURE



A visit to an Akivan port can be an experience never to
be forgotten, particularly if your cargo is not totally
legal or your paperwork is not completely satisfactory.
Scanian officials are extremely thorough in their
examination and the Bwap obsession with the proper
order of paperwork can be extremely frustrating.

**Landing Pattern** - Ships arriving in system must first
wait at high orbit (900 km) until they receive clearance
to proceed insystem. This may take up to 30 minutes
before they are instructed to either dock at Ma'Dakt
Orbital or if a planetary landing is desired to proceed
to low orbit (190 km) and await a window and landing
berth location. Once landed, the ship remains in

```
quarantine until its received Inward Clearance by the
Port Authorities. Usually ship's can expect to wait no
longer than 30 minutes before inspection. The
Clearance party consists of a Port warden, health
officer, customs official, immigration official (generally a Bwap), port engineer and their
subordinates. Given the high value Scanian's place on
honesty any attempt to bribe an official will be dealt
with very severely. The best advice is - keep your nose
clean and play the game. Scanian officials will be
totally impartial and extremely efficient.
```
```
Starport Facilities - Akiva lacks any extrality. Scanian
laws are in force throughout the system. A minimum of
50 Berths and runways are available on all planetary
ports. Ma'Dakt has 120 berths. Traffic is currently 112%
so expect delays in being assigned a berth. Starship
and spaceship construction, maintenance and repair
facilities are available and are extremely efficient.
INDISS has given Akivan port facilities a full 4 star
rating. Search and rescue facilities cover the entire
system and are believed to be amongst the most
advanced and effective in the Sector. Full starship
facilities and amenities are available. Although free
unrefined fuel is available from the sea the excessive
mineral concentrate may damage the ship's purifiers.
```
```
Port Costs - Refined Fuel Cr.300, Unrefined Fuel (with
minerals extracted) Cr.50, Berthing Costs Cr. 125 for
the first 6 days, Cr.150 per additional day.
Warehousing Costs Cr.15 per tonne per week. Security
Costs Cr.50 flat tax per week. Shuttle fees - Cargo Cr.
per tonne, Passengers Cr.50.
```
```
Portside Facilities - All ports boast TAS facilities and
Traveller mission Hostels. Despite the lack of extrality
most pleasures and entertainments are available
except blood sports and illegal drugs. It can truly be
said that Akiva lacks a black market. Crime is
extremely rare and dealt with extremely harshly by
means of fines and indenture. The best lodging is to be
had at the Makhiir-Hilton's which rate 5 stars though
most crews prefer to spend their stay at either the
Devil's Bowl or Tetrachyal Inn's (3 stars each). Security
is provided by Scanian police who are equipped with
tasers. Undersea Monorail's connect each city and port
with each other and the cost of a week's unlimited
travel is a mere 50 credits.
```
```
Scanians are famous for their food. expect to pay
between Cr.5 to 15 per meal. Speciality of Akiva has to
be Zhoam Blue plate with Bawyati kebabs and Haurm
garnish. Expect to pay about Cr.35 per person though.
Try the Tr'akhi wine at Cr.45 per bottle. Argian bhair is
available in most localities for Cr.3 a glass.

A VISITOR'S GUIDE

**Exos** - Due to the extreme cold and gravity most
visitors find it necessary to wear Environment suits
during their stay. These suits increase body
temperature to species normal while giving support
against the effects of gravity and water. These suits,
known as 'Exos' can be hired from the starport or from
your hotel. Cost is generally about Cr.3 per day.

**Skal Point** - A land of force and grandeur. Feel the
pure power of nature as the 30 meter high waves crash
against the thousands of dwellings clinging to the sheer
cliff-face of the island pinnacles. A common sport at
Skal is Wave Riding. This sport consists of surfing on
top of these gigantic waves in 2 meter length fragile
self-righting trimarans, using only the twin internal
rudders to avoid crashing into the rocks surrounding
the islands. Be warned, the islanders have a natural
skill and it is not as easy as they make it seem.
Thousands of visitors each year suffer severe injuries
trying out this sport. The buildings of Skal, like many
buildings on Akiva, are ancient. Many date back to the
constitution. On Skal they are formed of Ironite clay
sealed with Sketra to form a hard, strong resin that is
totally waterproof. The buildings are layered onto the
cliffs and their rainbow colouring is due to the effect
of centuries of sea, wind and smoke.

**Places to visit on Skal - Barnacle Inn**. Experience the
raw joy of the environment at sea level. Enjoy true
Scanian cuisine at its best. Scanian cooking is
renowned throughout the Imperium. Only on Akiva are
all the famous spices and minerals freshly available.
Try Zhoam Steaks with a fresh Sketra salad.

```
Immortality Bay. Where the Zhoam come to die.
Zhoam are 12 meter long predatory shark-like
creatures that have earned themselves the nickname
of Coven Fish due to their schools always consisting of
13 adults. Zhoam are extremely vicious creatures,
killing other vertebrates over twice their size. Those
not culled by the Scanian's as food live for a life span
of 25 cycles. When they reach that age they head for
Immortality bay where they ground themselves in their
thousands on the beach. They then lay their eggs and
die. The bones of the Zhoam contain an extremely
powerful enzyme which is only released as the bones
start to decay. This enzyme seeps into the sand and
activate the newly hatched worm-like Zhoam. They
then undergo an almost immediate transformation
doubling in body weight in minutes. These then escape
into the sea and slowly over the next two months alter
into miniature Zhoam. Scientists have discovered that
the Zhoam enzyme is an extremely powerful growth
agent and can be used to increase animal growth to
the species maximum. Unfortunately this enzyme is
only really powerful in naturally dying Zhoam and the
Scanian Government has refused exploitation of the
Bay's reserve on the grounds that exploitation may lead
to the eventual extinction of the species. Attempts to
try and catch live Zhoam to breed have proved totally
unsuccessful. It has been estimated that over 12 billion
Zhoam have died on Immortality bay...
```
```
Genesis - Home of the Scanian Culture. Most of the
city is situated beneath the ground leaving the surface
an island paradise.
```
```
Places to visit include the Sanhedra and a Yarhei
Kel'a Study Centre. Visit the shrine where the first
Scanians were genetically created. At the Butcher's
Folly see holotapes of the Butcher's famous orgies and
death feasts and see the original holo of Empress Paula
II which sparked the bloody rebellion. The entire city is
heated by an extensive network of hot underground
springs. These bubble to the surface at Hela and it's
claimed that the mineral is diluted within have a
benevolent effect on a person's health. Visit the Bwap
colony at Tree. These magnificent tree dwellings have
been crafted out of ceramics to create an identical
haven to Marhaban with a floating landscape and
populated with animal species from Marhaban itself.
```
```
Gamala - Scanian university city totally devoted to
learning and study. The original city was destroyed by
```

the Butcher. The current city is a majestic paradise of
tall ceramic spires and crystal buildings that crowd the
existing land space of the Gamala archipelago and the
surrounding bays. The lagoons are totally safe due to
the giant tidal ducks that surround the islands turning
the constant waves into electricity. Gamala is famous
not so much for its islands as for its house boat
population. Over 75% of Gamala's population live on
the sea. Many live their entire lives on these boats.
Scanian house boats are designed on a trimaran design
with self-righting cabin roofs. They naturally link
together to form massive islands of several acres. The
roof space is considered free market spaces and entire
businesses are based there. Possibly the most valuable
souvenir to take back from your visit to Gamala is a
copy of the 'Teachings' and a mooring post hand
carved by Scanian craftsmen.

**Places to visit - The Bay of Paryala**. A year round wine
festival where everyone must be masked and any non-criminal behaviour is acceptable. For those without
sexual codes a visit the Barge of pleasure is a must.

**The Batalu Sagasso** is a gigantic forest of Halacuo
fern, home of the only non-aquatic life on Akiva, the
Bawyati. The Bawyati are a type of insect with triple
3cm wings that live on the fern. The Bawyati life cycle
is of considerable interest since they begin life as krill
feeding on the carcasses of their parents. Growing and
undergoing four moults the creatures crawl out of the
seaweed and change into grubs. These grubs are the
favorite food, not just of Scanian chef's, but also of
the bhari snail and the 85 meter long grag fish. Almost
80% of the grubs fail to survive this period of their
existence. After 3 months they crawl up to the
underside of the fern and enter the chrysalis stage.
This lasts for 300 days, and when they emerge they
have changed into flying Bawyati, where upon they live
on the wing for a period of three months. mate and
land to lay their eggs amidst the seaweed. Due to their
lack of legs they are unable to take off and drown,
thereby providing food for their hatching offspring.

**Atlantis** - First city of the Aquans. Atlantis is located at
a depth of 600 meters and consists of thousands of
circular homes surrounded by forest. Most Aquan
homes follow a certain pattern; several circular 3

```
meter high walls without a roof which forms the main
living area of the family, with deep caves carved
underneath which are the main sleeping quarters.
```
```
Places to visit include the Union parks where vast
plantations of Haurm tree are grown. These parks are
used by courting couples and many Aqua-villes have
Haurm planted around the sleeping caves to encourage
a romantic mood.
```
```
The Golden Spire is the cultural center of Atlantis and
is the Governmental home "under the sea". The Ghari
reservation on the outskirts is the most famous aquatic
zoological reserve in the Imperium and several species,
now extinct in their home worlds, are to be found in
the park.
```
```
Visitors to any Aquan city can elect to stay at special
hotels set aside for oxygen breathers or experience
sleeping underwater at an Aquan Inn. All visitors are
fully trained to use rebreathing equipment before
```
```
departing the mono-terminal and are recommended to
hire an Aquan guide for the duration of their stay.
```
```
TIPPING - Not expected but a flat Cr.5 tip will
encourage continued good service.
```
```
Remember, do not ask a Scanian to help you obtain
illegal goods. Dishonesty is totally against their
principles and they will feet no hesitation in turning
you in to the local authorities.
```

It had been a bad week for the crew of the Andrea
Fionna. War was proving bad for trade. What cargoes
that were available left little margin for profit. Money
was getting tight. The navigator had put out the word
on the dataNet that the ship was available for charter,
anything considered. Now they waited. The Tetrachyal
Inn was a spacer's bar, a good place to hang out and
listen for information. As they sat in their booth a tall
dark-haired man approached. "I hear you are looking
for 'employment'. I have a job for you. I want you to
capture a fish. A dying Zhoam. I will pay CR.25,000 for
one in the right condition.."
```
```
THE JOB


```
```
The stranger wants the team to capture either a
freshly dead Zhoam from Immortality Bay or one just
about to die of natural causes so they can extract the
growth hormone and try to artificially replicate it. The
Zhoam is to be smuggled into orbit where it will be
transferred to another ship for transport out of the
system.

**AKIVA: Medical Procedures**

Traveller's to Akiva/Argi should be aware that pro-longed exposure to the high gravity environment
can cause severe muscular and cardiovascular
strain, and increase the risk and severity of acci-dents.

Although gravity-compensating exosuits are avail-able many find these bulky and restrictive, and
prefer to experience Akiva's environment “at first
hand”. If you intend to do this, we advise that you
consult your general practitioner prior to depar-ture for a full medical check up - a high gravity
acclimatisation course, consisting of a regimen of
physical exercise in gradually increased gravity,
and lasting some two or three weeks, is also rec-ommended. Many starlines operating services to
Akiva offer such courses.

Once on Akiva, hire a wrist biomonitor, which con-tinuously checks the condition of your cardiovascu-lar system.

“Booster” drugs to lessen fatigue are available on
Akiva. Although legal, we suggest that they only
be taken under strict medical supervision, as tem-porary loss of co-ordination can result in certain
individuals.

Following these few, simple measures will help
make your stay on Akiva a safe and pleasant one.

### GONE FISHINGGONE FISHINGGONE FISHINGGONE FISHING

Roll 1D and read them the results of the following
table:

1. A Vilani captain is being sentenced tomorrow for
attempting to take a Zhoam from Immortality Bay.
True: Attending his court case will reveal that he used
plastisteel drag nets but got caught by the
Protectorate whereupon he tried to bribe them. He is
charged with breaking the conservation laws and
bribery.
2. Your patron is working for the Protectorate.
False: He is currently being followed by the
Protectorate because he has been indiscreet with his
offers. Further probing will reveal that this rumour is
based on the fact that known Protectorate official's
have been seen tailing him on several occasions.
Another official is now following the characters. At
some point in the adventure the characters will need
to confront this character or lose him. Should they
disappear suspiciously he will issue a 'stop and detain'
order. If after two days there has been no suspicious
activity he will stop following them.
3. Only Zhoam yearlings are supposed to be caught but
rumour has it that the Government is secretly culling
Zhoam from Immortality Bay.
True: but only a limited number are taken each year
and each fish must be accounted for. Talking to the
guards at Immortality Bay will reveal their method of
using two fast hydrofoils with a plastisteel net dragged
between to capture Zhoam (this is a well-known fact).
The players could decide to and steal a Zhoam from
Protectorate laboratories at Vedo'kr. The security etc.
is left up to the referee to detail.
4. Zhoam can be pacified by spraying chlorine into
water.
Note: Chlorine irritates their eyes and induces a raging
fury. Chlorine is used not to pacify but to identify a
naturally dying Zhoam. These excrete minor amounts
of the enzyme into the water which reacts with the
chlorine turning it purple.
5. The Protectorate has been using disguised subs to
get close to Zhoam schools without inciting them.
True: The smooth shape of the sub's are disguised with
modelling foam and the engine quietened by using a
larger propeller and a deregulator to the turbine to
randomise the engine pattern.
6. Due to the recent treaty only Dulinor's fleet are on
system protection duty. They are bribable.
True: Scanian law is limited to the surface of the
planet and their moons. If the characters can take off
with the Zhoam then even if they are intercepted by
Dulinor's men they will only be interested in offences
that affect fleet or system security.

**ZHOAM FISH**

IMORTALITY BAY


```
```
The bay is in reality the center of an extinct volcano.
The northern cliff-face collapsed-in several millennia
ago. The surrounding sides protect the bay against the
elements. The beach is composed of black volcanic ash
and the decayed fragments of Zhoam bodies. Tourists
can visit the Bay but are restricted to top of the
volcanic walls where they can use coin-operated
telescopes to observe the Zhoam. No-one (except
Protectorate) is allowed down to beach itself. The site
is only open to the public during daytime hours and the
bay is patrolled by two guards. During the day at least
6D of tourists will present and any attempt to climb
down will result the Protectorate being informed. The
bay is patrolled by 1D6 hydrofoils armed with lasers,
and radio-linked back to base. Each boat holds four
Scanian officials, each armed with laser pistols. Aquans
avoid the area due to the danger of attack by dying
Zhoam. At night the guard doubles.
```
```
Note: All guards and NPCs should be generated
according to the quick NPC guide on P.43 of the
Referee's Manual.
```
```
There are two possibilities for capturing a fish,
catching it at sea or steal a freshly dead specimen
from the beach. 1n order to ensure a dying specimen
from the water the PCs will need to head into the Bay
where you risk an increased chance of being spotted.
In addition, healthy Zhoam schools may attack. It's
```

assumed that all attempts will be made at night. Any
attempts made in daylight will be automatically
spotted within 30 mins and Protectorate sent to
investigate. On the beach the PCs must avoid dying
Zhoam and find a newly dead fish.

Note: at any one time there will be 2D dying Zhoam on
the beach at Immortality Bay and a further 1D in the
water.

Zhoam can take several hours to die out of water.
They seem to enter a type of suspended animation and
only waken out of it when intruded upon. Beached
Zhoam are just as dangerous as those in the water.

**To identify death in a Zhoam:**
Difficult, Medical, Biology, Hunting, Int, 1 min (uncertain, fateful)
Referee: If the result of the uncertain task is - No Truth:
The characters are in combat with the Zhoam. Some
Truth: The players must roll their Dex or higher on 2D
to escape or they will be in combat. Total Truth: The
Zhoam is dead.

**To determine enzyme level of the dead Zhoam:**
Difficult, Biology, Chemistry, Edu, 5 min.
Referee: The character must have access to the proper
equipment to perform this task successfully. This task
will determine whether the Zhoam has excreted its
enzyme yet. The characters must decide on a method
for transporting the Zhoam away from the beach
without being interrupted by the guards and
Conservation Protectorate boats...

If the characters decide to try and intercept a Zhoam
on the way to Immortality Bay.

**To identify a dying Zhoam in open water (more than
25km from the Bay):**
Impossible, Hunting, Int, 3 hours (uncertain,
hazardous)
Referee: If the result of the uncertain task is - No
Truth: the characters boat will be actively attacked by
a full school of adult Zhoam. Some Truth: the
characters have found a solitary male but it will turn
out to be scouting rather than dying and therefore
useless. This will only be discovered after analysis of
the carcass. Full Truth: The characters have discovered
a Zhoam heading for Immortality Bay. Again this will
only be revealed after analysis.

**To identify a dying Zhoam within 25km of
Immortality Bay:**
Difficult. Hunting, Int. 10 min (uncertain. hazardous)
Referee: See task above.

**METHODS OF CATCHING**

Weapons: Akiva has an extremely high law level and
attempting to buy or smuggle heavy enough weaponry
to perform the job will result in almost immediate
arrest. Even if they escape they will be wanted
characters. Explosives; while it's possible to buy
explosives the noise it makes will arouse Protectorate

```
boats and the Zhoam will be totally destroyed.
Speargun; The chances of penetrating a Zhoam's
armour are extremely low, that coupled with the fact
that they then have to try and land a furious Zhoam
bent on revenge for the pain it has just suffered should
rule out this method. Net; Providing the net is made of
a strong compound which has a minimum of 1,000 kg
breaking strain and is hard to cut then they should be
able eventually to catch a Zhoam. Winches will be
needed to lift the Zhoam onboard. How the characters
pacify such a creature is left up to them to decide.
```
```
To land a Zhoam by net:
Difficult, Hunting, Str, 1 min (uncertain, hazardous,
unskilled OK)
Referee: This task assumes that the characters are
using a net that is strong enough and cannot be cut by
the Zhoam's horn. If the net being used does not satisfy
these criteria increase the task to impossible. This task
must be rolled at least twice... Once to snare the fish
and again to land It. It the result of the uncertain task
is - No Truth: The fish has escaped from the net. Some
Truth: The fish is partially snared but can still thrash
out at the characters and boat causing full damage.
Total Truth: The fish is snared and eventually
entrapped.
```
```
If the fish manages to avoid capture for three
successive attempts then it will be considered to
have escaped.
```
```
To by-pass Scanian Protectorate boats:
Difficulty, Off=Sensor Ops, Def=range, 3 min (confrontation)
Referee: Use the most favorable sensor scan difficulty
level from among the unit's UCP. Use the range from
the sensing unit to the target unit as a negative DM.
Optionally the character may use his Computer skill in
place of sensor op s. Evaluate the results of this task as
-Extreme failure: The scan failed and the characters
are totally unaware of the Protectorate boat's
location. Failure: An unknown target identified but
unable to pinpoint location. Success: Target and
direction identified but range not known. Extreme
success: Target's identity and exact location
pinpointed.
```

official.

**To successfully lie to a Scanian:**
Formidable, liaison, skill (confrontation, uncertain)
Referee: The unnamed skill is some skill appropriate
to the lie (Admin, Trader, etc.) If the Scanian is an
adept the task becomes impossible. Familiar aliens
such as Vargr or Aslan treat at a lower difficulty level.
Totally inhuman or lesser known aliens treat as a
simple task. If the result of the uncertain task is - No
Truth: The Scanian will confront the character with his
lie. Some Truth: The Scanian is uncertain and will ask
more questions (re-roll task) to confirm his suspicions.
Total Truth: The Scanian is completely fooled as long
as the players don't do anything suspicious.

Once the fish is captured it must be smuggled onboard
their ship and hidden until they are out of the system.

Cargoes available to ship out of system include;
Radioactives, Cubed fish paste in kilolitre containers,
Wood, various chemicals in sealed containers, live fish
in amassive cold storage facility.

It is left to the characters and referee to decide on the
method of getting the Zhoam onboard and passed
customs. It should be noted that the customs are
extremely efficient. Attempts to takeoff and land

```
outside of a port will be treated extremely suspiciously
and a team of marines and customs officers (including
an engineer) will be dispatched to any ship in minutes
of landing. Once in space the characters need only dial
a local communet number for the Siian to arrange an
interception within an hour for the cargo to be
transported.
```
```
Final note:
```
```
The Sii will be unable to synthesise the enzyme and
will ask the PCs to supply them with a regular supply of
dying fish at Cr.30,000 a carcass. It's up to the players
whether they accept this offer... the crew of the
Andrea Fionna didn't.
```

ABSTRACT



This document will set out (in my usual rambling
fashion ) my views on psionics, and the 'variant' which
I use in my campaign. That is, it will attempt to
rationalise this highly contentious area of the Traveller
rules, putting psionics on a pseudoVscientific basis,
rather than a mystical one.

PSIONICS: JUST THE FACTS!

The problem here is that there is absolutely no
information in the Traveller literature as to how
psionics actually work. This can lead to some sticky
situations (as referees will, no doubt, have found).
Some questions I have come across are:

```
Is psionics instantaneous, or speed-of-light?
Can clairvoyance be used on a dark room?
Is it safe to teleport through a superdense/bulkhead?
Can psionics be used through a black globe?
```
Some or all of these questions will (hopefully) be
resolved by this document. It should be emphasised
that this is a variant; it has no official standing -
rather, it is merely the system I use (and will continue
to use, regardless of official pronouncements!)

PSIONICS: SOME RIDICULOUS ASSUMPTIONS

To be able to put psionics on a “pseudo-scientific”
basis, we need to be able to make some general
statements about the way it works, in order to provide
a framework for more detailed comments. Well, here
goes...!

By late TL8, it is known that fundamental particles fall
into two categories, quarks and leptons. There are
found to be six varieties of quark (termed up, down,
strange, charmed, top, and bottom), and six varieties
of lepton (the electron, muon, and tau lepton, and
their corresponding neutrinos). TL8 physics also knows
of four “virtual bosons”, or force-exchange particles:
the photon, graviton, gluon, and weakon. (Still with
me? Abandon hope, all ye who read on. That was the
last piece of solid science in this whole document!).

Developments in supersymmetry theories early in TL
suggest that there should be two further virtual
bosons, for a total of six. The four already known fall
into two categories: spin 1 particles, and spin 2

```
particles. Spin 1 virtual bosons (the photon, gluon. and
weakon) give rise to repulsive forces between similar
particles - that's why like electrical charges repel. Spin
2 virtual bosons (the graviton) give rise to attractive
forces between like particles - that's the fundamental
reason why gravity can only be an attractive force.
```
```
“In a very few cases, it is found that some lifeforms
can control, subconsciously or consciously, this particle
emission. These lifeforms are termed psionic...”
```
```
The fifth virtual boson, discovered early in TL9, is
termed the “omegon”. The omegon is a spin 1 particle,
similar to the graviton, but more massive, and thus
shorter-ranged (its range is less than 50,000 km). The
omegon is the fundamental basis of "anti-gravity". The
sixth virtual boson is an extremely elusive particle,
only discovered early in TL16. What truly astonishes
the researchers are the circumstances under which
these particles are produced. These particles, called
psions, are radiated during specific electron transitions
in biological molecules. Neurotransmitter reactions in
an organism's brain are identified as an important
source of these unusual particles.
```
```
In short, it is found that all organic lifeforms emit
psions in a random, uncontrolled manner. However, in
a very few cases, it is found that some lifeforms can
control, subconsciously or consciously, this particle
emission. These lifeforms are termed psionic...
```
PSIONICS: THE PSION

```
The psion is an extremely unusual particle. It has a
near-zero mass, which means that it can travel very
close to the speed of light. How a psion interacts with
matter depends upon its energy - simply put, the more
“effort” a psionic puts into a psion-related activity,
the more energy the psions will have. Psions can also
exist in more than one state; these are termed
"resonance states", and there are four currently
known, the p-, k-, t-, and c-psion.
```
```
A couple of comments in the Players' Manual are
worth noting. These are that “psionic activity, at the
ranges given, is effectively instantaneous”, and that
psionics is “not affected by intervening matter in most
cases”. Note the use of “effectively”, and “in most
cases”. I would argue that a liberal interpretation of
these statements can make for more interesting
psionics, and enlivened play.
```
```
For instance, light-speed communication over a range
of 5,000km (Planetary), has a signal lag of 0.
seconds, which I would call “effectively
instantaneous”, from a human point of view anyway.
```
#### YES, BUT WHAT ARE PSYES, BUT WHAT ARE PSYES, BUT WHAT ARE PSIONICS, EXACTLY?YES, BUT WHAT ARE PSIONICS, EXACTLY?IONICS, EXACTLY?IONICS, EXACTLY?

THE PSIONIC BACKGROUND



Psions are not just emitted by biological reactions.
Other sources, such as cosmic-ray interactions, and the
radioactive decay of elements in rocks, cause a certain
amount of psionic “background interference”. This can
limit the range of psionic talents.

PSIONICS: SPECIFIC TALENTS

This section will attempt to take the general
assumptions already made about psionics, and apply
them to the individual psionic talents, in order to shed
some light upon them. Taking the psionic talents in
order, from the Player's Manual.

1) Telepathy

Telepathy is reasonably straightforward. Life Detection
involves the psionic detecting p-psions radiated by all
organic lifeforms. Telepathic communication involves
the psionic emitting a more powerful, directed beam
of p-psions, towards the target. When the psions
impinge on the target's brain, they interact with
neurotransmitter molecules (the reverse of the original
emission process). The target “hears voices in his
head”, because his auditory centres are stimulated
directly. Reception of the target's thoughts involves
picking up, and deciphering the weak p-psion signal
from a non-psionic.

A psionic probe involves the direction of a very finely-defined beam of p-psions at a target's brain. These p-psions stimulate individual synapses in the target.
Secondary signals will then be generated in adjacent
synapses (in a kind of “cascade effect”). The psionic
then studies the p-psions produced by these secondary
signals, to gain information.

P-psions do interact with ordinary matter, but only
slightly. The effect of ordinary walls is slight, but p-psions suffer more significant scattering and absorption
when passing through superdense materials. Telepathy
may sometimes be “fuzzy” through starship bulkheads.

All telepathy suffers from a light-speed signal lag.

2) Clairvoyance

This one is tough. Remote sensing of an area through
solid matter. What can pass through solid matter?
Mesons, neutrinos, fast neutrons, gamma rays? Ick.
Whatever clairvoyance relies on, it isn't
“conventional”. So, we have to fall back on the trusty
old psion. It has already been stated that psions are
radiated by natural processes. However, the psion flux
thus produced is far too low to be used as a form of
imaging system. This means that clairvoyance has to
be “active”, rather than passive. For clairvoyance, the
psionic produces an intense beam of c-psions of
carefully defined energy. The energy of a c-psion
determines how far it travels before it interacts with
matter (sort of like mesons). When a c-psion interacts

```
with matter, it is “reflected” as a p-psion, which the
psionic detects. “Clairaudience” involves a similar
technique, sensing of the movements of air molecules (ick).
```
```
The energy of the c-psions produced during
clairvoyance can never be perfectly defined; also, c-psions can interact spontaneously with matter,
regardless of the distance travelled. This means again,
that superdense materials can sometimes make
clairvoyance “fuzzy”.
```
```
Since clairvoyance is an “active” process, this leads us
to an obvious conclusion If there is a psionic in the
area being scanned, he should be allowed a roll to
detect the flux of c-psions permeating the area. If he
succeeds, he will know the direction, and distance (from the c-psion energy) of the “clairvoyant”. It is
then a relatively simple task to send a telepathic
assault up the incoming beam of c-psions ( Ha! Try to
spy on me, would you? I'll fry your brains, sucker!!).
Yes, I know Players' Manual says that psionics can't
detect clairvoyance attempts, but that makes the
talent too powerful. Sorry.
```
```
The reflected p-psions may affect non-psionics in the
area being scanned ( "I have this terrible feeling we're
being watched...").
```
```
Again, since clairvoyance is an "active" process, it can
be used totally independently of the amount of
available light in the area being scanned. The
"clairvoyant" can still "see" if the area is pitch black. All
clairvoyance suffers from a light-speed signal lag.
```
```
3) Telekinesis
```
```
This one is also fairly tough. Exert force at a
distance...? Ok, here goes! Telekinesis involves the
emission of an intense beam of k-psions, of carefully-defined energy. AS with c-psions, the energy
determines how far a psion may travel before
interacting with matter. K-psions have a complex
interaction with matter - when a beam of k-psions
strikes an object, it creates a rapidly-oscillating
electromagnetic field around the object. This
oscillating field them emits omegons - essentially, the
object is suspended in an anti-gravity field. ( A similar
oscillating field is produced by standard null-grav
modules ).
```
```
The oscillating field may be detected by certain
sensors. See Sensors And Stuff for further information.
```
```
4) Awareness
This simply postulates a conscious ability to control the
autonomous central nervous system, and the endocrine
system From the point of view of this variant,
Awareness is not particularly interesting.
```
```
Mind over matter.
```

5) Teleportation

Ah, the really interesting one! This psionics “variant”
incorporates all the standard rules on conservation of
momentum and energy, so I would advise you to
consult the relevant literature before reading further.

Teleportation is remarkable among psionic talents,
because it is the only one which can effectively exceed
light-speed. Sounds good? Well, it isn't. Read on. What
happens when a psionic teleports? Well, it's a little
complicated...

First of all, the psionic sends an intense string of pulses
of p-psions of varying energies and speeds towards his
intended target point. This string of pulses provides a
“reference grid”, so that the teleporter can re-orientate himself on the molecular level, when he re-emerges.

Next, the teleporter begins radiating t-psions. This
causes an electromagnetic field to build up around
him. In a similar manner to a starship entering
jumpspace, the fabric of space-time “unweaves”
around him, and he enters an alternate space (akin to
jumpspace), called p-space. The process of entering p-space, or “popping out”, is effectively instantaneous.
The time spent in p-space is independent of distance
travelled, and is about 0.1 milliseconds.

Leaving p-space at the target point, or “popping in”, is
a somewhat more involved process, taking up to 1.5
seconds. The teleporter needs to be able to pick up his
“reference beam” that he transmitted as he “popped
out”. Since the reference beam travels at a maximum
of lightspeed, it is possible for the teleporter to
“outrun” it, and arrive at the target point before the
beam of psions does.

If the teleporter does not outrun the reference beam (i.e. teleports less than about 4 km), them there are
no problems. Pop! You're there!

If the teleporter does outrun the reference beam, then
he has to receive it within the 1.5 seconds of “popping
in”. Receiving the reference beam part way through
“popping in” causes temporary disorientation. If the
teleporter does not receive the reference beam, or the
beam is scrambled, then he'd better check his life
insurance policy, because the results are messily
lethal. The result of this restriction is that
teleportation is restricted to distances less than
'roughly 1.5 light-seconds (about 450,000 km). Another
restriction - remember that psions can sometimes
interact with matter when you don't want them to.
This can give rise to a very small, but definite chance
of superdense material scrambling or absorbing the
reference beam. Think carefully before
you to teleport onboard a ship! (Yuk! Anyone cot a
spatula?)

A psionic shield will block the reference beam
completely - see Shields and Stuff later. Remember
that, in addition to the restrictions on energy and

```
momentum, if the exit and entry points are at
different atmospheric pressures, teleportation is not
silent. That's why it's called “popping”!
```
```
Last word on teleportation; given the rules on
conservation of energy, how did the Zhodani manage
to teleport to orbit? That's what I'd like to know!
```
```
6) SpecialV
```
```
This is obviously far too big a category to discuss in any
detail in this document. However, I will take this
opportunity to list a few unusual psionic talents I've
thought up, or come across in campaigns, or dredged
up from other role-playing games.
```
```
Use of Awareness to heal/enhance other.
Teleport other object (does this include a foe's
vital organs?).
Pyrokinesis. Careful with this one. I lost a very
good NPC this way. Insist on a vulnerable
combustion source (such as a pool of oil), and
excess oxygen.
Electronic field control. Implies the ability to
cause electricity to “arc”. The psionic can affect/
destroy circuitry. Again, careful - this one is open
to abuse.
“Premonitions” - the ability to see a short period
into the future - I don't like this one, not least
because of what it does to the principle of
causality.
Seeing into the past - the ability to know whether
a significant event has happened where the
psionic is standing. “Sensitivity to psionic
impressions”. This one is probably OK for
Traveller.
“Possession”/“Suggestion” - the ability to
influence, or even gain control of another
sophont's mind Never, ever let a PC have this
talent, if you want to keep your campaign. But
then, I don't need to tell you that, do I? It could
be OK for an NPC. though...
```
SHIELDS AND STUFF



```
A naturally-generated psionic shield involves both
passive and active defence. The shield adjusts the
```

psionic radiation emitted by the psionic to background
levels. Also, the psionic is able to absorb incoming
psions. Both these activities are unconscious in a
trained psionic.

An electromechanical psionic shield is a conducting
network, which emits an electromagnetic “white
noise” signal. Actually, it is remarkable that the
psionic shield helmet works at all, since psion
interactions are not yet understood at TL12! Contrary
to what is believed at TL12, the white noise signal
does not protect the wearer's mind directly - rather,
the charged conducting network absorbs psions
travelling in either direction through the shield.

Since the electromechanical shield is known to be
effective, one question which is often asked is - is it
possible to “shield” larger volumes, such as rooms,
buildings, or vehicles? I would say, yes, but it's usually
prohibitively expensive to do so. Multiply the helmet's
Cr.4,000 price, by the relative increase in size involved
in shielding a vehicle, and you have rather a lot of
money. A paranoid millionaire might find it
worthwhile...

Supplemental: This one is entirely optional (ever more
optional than the variant as a whole!), but can be
amusing when used at just the right (or wrong)
moment for the players.

With only a very slight alteration, it is possible for an
engineer to “bleed” a small amount of power (about
10-20 kilowatts) from the power plant, into a starship's
Jump field network. Once charged, the hull acts as a
reasonably effective psionic Shield. The crew can have
a great time sending the cleaning 'bots round to clear
up the Zhodani commandos who tried to teleport
aboard ... Hours of fun! Now, to clear up the question
about black globes. A black globe is essentially a
volume of “rotated space”. Imagine drawing a circle
on a piece of graph paper, cutting it out, then
replacing it in a slightly rotated position. The lines
don't match up any more, right? Since all particles and
radiation have to travel along the lines, they're
blocked when they reach the black globe, and that
includes all psions. You can still teleport inside a black
globe, but you wouldn't make it in one piece...

SENSORS AND STUFF



In this section, we discuss that most mysterious of
sensors, the Neural Activity Sensor. I would argue, that
at TL15 and below, a NAS is primarily a highly-sensitive
magnetometer - detecting the weak electromagnetic
fields produced by a sentient's brainwaves. This would
mean that the range of the NAS is vary limited at low
TL's, and the NAS is also vulnerable. Operating a NAS
during a thunderstorm, or near electrical machinery is
asking for trouble.

It should be noted that a lifeform's muscles also create
weak electromagnetic fields, so a NAS should really
also be a MAS, or Myoelectric Activity Sensor.

```
Hmm...how does a psionic screen the activity from his
muscles? Stand still?
```
```
At TL16 and above, with the knowledge of psion
interactions, a NAS becomes a hybrid magnetometer/
psion detector, resulting in vastly increased range.
This is one great argument. against having
instantaneous psionics. If this is so, as soon as you have
an understanding of psion interactions, it should be
possible to construct a psion-based FTL
communications system, and the central precept of
```
```
Traveller comes crashing down. (This problem was first
noted by David Lai.)
```
```
Any use of psionics should produce pretty fireworks on
a psion-based NAS. Any use of telekinesis will cause
the object being telekinsed to register on a
magnetometer-based NAS. This should cause more than
one nervous breakdown! (“I tell you that tree was
waving at me! Look, it's showing 'complex, unknown'

RANDOM THOUGHTS



```
The example of the Ancient Artifact possessed by the
Zhodani is often touted as an example of
“instantaneous psionics”. I'm suffering from the
handicap of not having the Zhodani Alien Module to
hand, but I would argue that only the “output stage”
of the artifact is psion-based (similar to a cathodeVray
tube on a modern device). The artifact is actually a
tachyon receiver.
```
```
Ancient teleporters could work on the same principles
as psionic teleportation, except that the “reference
beam” is tachyonic, rather than psionic. This means
that tachyonic FTL communication is a prerequisite for
instantaneous teleportation (that is, it would probably
arise a TL earlier).

SUMMARY



This scenario revolves around a group involved in some
industrial espionage after being a near-witness to a
murder. The action is centred on the world of Argi (1431 A330ACC-F), the largest technical equipment
manufacturer in the sector. The Players are given the
task of infiltrating Gravatics Technologies Limited to
uncover technical details of a new grav speeder for a
rival company.

REFEREE'S INTRODUCTION

The Gravatics Technologies Ltd (Gravatic's or GTL)
“Tansui” grav speeder has been the center of recent
interest and speculation by the grav industry. The
rumour mill that operates within the grav vehicle trade
has begun to spread quiet words about a new high-tech
demonstration speeder (the “Tansui”) that Gravatic's
are due to launch at the industries premier trade fair
on Argi in three months time.

**CRAFT ID:** “Tansui” experimental grav speeder, TL 16;

**Accom:** Crew =1 (operator), Seats =2 (Roomy).
**Other:** Fuel = 0.9k1, Cargo = 0.8 kl, Obj Size = Small,
EM Level = Faint.

This vehicle was designed to demonstrate the new
breakthroughs in technology that is emerging on Argi.
Built by Gravatics Technologies Ltd in late 1120, it has
been given the name “Tansui” after a mythical winged
creature believed to existed on Gateway in the distant
past. Its official designation is the APR 363CX. GTL
have kept the vehicle a closely guarded secret in order
to stay ahead of their competitors. There has been
strong interest by certain military officials attached to
Dulinor's forces for the vehicles development as a
recon/attack speeder. The armoured hull allows the
“Tansui” to make prolonged sub-orbital and sub-surface “covert” flights (top sub-surface speed = 100
kmph).

```
The trade is a multi-billion credit business with all the
various companies big and small trying all manner of
tricks (some legal, some not) to hold and increase their
share of the market. To this end security is all
important in maintaining an edge over the competitors
and GTL are no exception.
```
```
The “Tansui” has been hidden within GTL's Research
and Development site 300km outside of Innesville (Argi's capital) well out of sight of interested parties.
Access is strictly controlled, all visitors have to make
an application for a visit two months in advance of the
intended date. On arrival they are screened for
weapons/explosives and recording devices to prevent
sabotage or industrial espionage. Visitors are escorted
everywhere and kept away from the most sensitive
areas.
```
PLAYER'S INTRODUCTION

```
The players are in a starport bar watching the local
holovision while waiting for a passage out-system.
Suddenly the sound of gunfire can be heard in the
street. People start to move outside. Following the
crowd to the scene you can see an air-raft speeding
away leaving a prostrate figure lying in an ever-V
widening pool of blood.
```
```
To notice the licence number of the air-raft:
Difficult, Stealth, Int, 5 sec (absolute, unskilled OK)
Referee: the vehicle can be traced to its owner but
was reported stolen two hours prior to the incident.
```
```
The crowd circle the body, stunned by the violence
that's intruded upon their quiet lives. If one of the PCs
does not approach the body then the figure will call
```
## CAR WARSCAR WARSCAR WARSCAR WARS

out in a hoarse whisper and beckon the nearest
character to him. When the PC reaches him he/she will
see that the man is riddled with gunshot wounds -
death is but a few seconds away. He points to his belt
pouch and mutters: “Take it! Take it to Devrin!” With
this he silently dies.

A quick search of the body will reveal an identity card
showing the victim to be one Anatholy Commis, a
mechanics operative of Gravatics Technologies Ltd. A
search of his pouch will reveal a small holocrystal and
a slip of paper with a ten digit number.

**To avoid notice when taking any items:**
Routine, Intrusion, Dex, 5 sec (absolute)
Referee: A failure means that a member of the crowd
will notice the 'theft' and call the police. A rough
description of the group will be circulated. Patrols will
be stepped up in an attempt to solve the murder
quickly and the PCs will be wanted for questioning
about the incident whether anyone noticed the theft
or not.

**To avoid police patrols:**
Difficult, Stealth, Int, 20 sec (absolute, fateful)
Referee: Failure means the characters will be stopped
and taken for questioning but will be released in 1D
hours. If they are also wanted for the theft they will
be kept in a cell overnight and next morning will be
brought before a judge for a preliminary hearing of the
case. If you so desire this hearing can be prolonged
with various legal tasks made ball is achieved. The
characters will be searched in all cases. This task
assumes that the characters have been recognised or
at least the police believe they recognise the group
who were near the body.

ENTER MS. DEVRIN

The number on the slip of paper is the communet
number of a vidcom registered to Alyas Devrin. The
characters will have to guess its meaning unless you
the referee preparesa (routine) task for it.

Once the players have related the Commis incident to
Devrin she will agree to meet them at a nearby hotel
restaurant. In addition she will advise them to keep
out of the way of the police.

If the players decide to view the holocrystal
beforehand they will be disappointed - it is encrypted.
The original holocorder was retuned to record at an
unusual wavelength and can only played on a 'corder
tuned to the same frequency (which Devrin has).

On meeting the group (show the illustration if you
wish) she will thank each one individually. She will be
exceptionally delighted if the group have mentioned
the crystal and hand it over. She will give them Cr.200
each for their trouble and tells them “not to hesitate
in calling her if they are in need of help while on
Argi”. Devrin will ask the PCs to be discrete and not
mention her or 'his meeting to anyone. She will not say

```
why or shed any light on the death of Commis about
which she seems detached and unconcerned.
```
```
ALYAS DEVRIN:
UPP 8A489A, Age: 32, Height: 1.9m.
College degree: Business Studies, 1 term Merchant, 1
term Bureaucrat.
Skills: Persuasion-2, Bribery-2, Liaison-1, Legal-1,
Streetwise-1, Gravitics-1
She has been in her present position for 6 years.
```
“I'M INNOCENT HONEST!”

```
Shortly after leaving the restaurant the group will notice
a lot of police activity. Sooner or later the group will be
stopped and taken to the central police station for
questioning. This can be played out with a number of
close shaves or chases but guns should not be involved.
Remind the players of the seriousness of confronting the
police with weapons. At the police station the characters
will be interrogated individually.
```
```
Here the referee can worry the players by asking them a
set of questions about the Commis incident to each in
private, or alternatively give the players a set of the
questions on a card which they each must answer without
conferring. Hassle the players over any discrepancies.
```
```
To avoid revealing any past or current criminal activity:
Routine, Legal, Streetwise, Liaison or Int, hour (fateful)
Referee; Depending on the level of the mishap detain
each character who fails pending further enquiries.
Superficial - release after a couple of hours; Minor - 1D+1
hours; Major – Overnight; Destroyed - 1D days. In all
cases the PCs will be instructed not to leave Argi until the
police are satisfied with their stories (2D days).
```
```
If the players insist on a phone call and contact Devrin
she wi ll send a lawyer who will manage to have them
released within an hour. The lawyer will have an air-taxi
to take the to Devrin's office.
```

THE PROBLEM



Whether the group contact Devrin immediately or not,
engineer a chance meeting after their release at an
appropriate location - i.e. within the business district
of Innesville and she will invite the PCs to her office
with an offer of work.

On arrival the group will be quickly ushered into
Devrin's office (small but plush). Besides Devrin there
sits a middle-aged man of Vilani descent who Devrin
introduces as Serali Hamuusham. Both Devrin and
Hamuusham greet the characters warmly.

Devrin informs them that her associate (Hamuusham)
and herself are Argian representatives of Ikensaag
Gravity Industries (IGI), a large company based on Sh'si (1635 A354476-F). IGI are second only in size to GTL
within the Bolivar/Argi/Sapphyre subsectors. Devrin's
main job on Argi is to keep a close eye on GTL and pass
any useful information on to head office.
Unfortunately the death of Commis was a tragic
escalation of the cat-and-mouse snooping that both
sides engage in. She has asked the players to her office
to offer them some simple, routine and safe
surveillance work.

THE PROPOSITION



If the players are interested
Devrin will ask them to
swear that any details that
they are about to hear
should not go beyond those
present in the room. The
referee should hint strongly
enough to persuade the PCs
that breaking the promise
and betraying Devrin's trust
will have very serious
consequences (after all a
big company like IGI or GTL
will not worry about the
elimination of
troublemakers and those
that threaten their
company operations). Also
make the point that co-operation will be very
profitable. Devrin will tell the group of the general
struggle to stay ahead of one's competitors and in
certain cases the boundaries of the law are “stepped
over”.

In the case of Commis, Devrin recruited him to obtain
as much information as he possibly could without
arousing too many suspicions. Embittered at being
passed over for promotion and tempted by offers of
easy money, Commis was a willing pawn, useful but
limited in his abilities. If the characters commit
themselves Devrin will ask for a brief resume of their
experience and skills before continuing with her
proposal. She has it on good authority that in two days
time a small group of journalists from Rashiki (1235

```
A678455-C) will arrive on Argi for a guided tour of
GTL's R&D site. The group is exactly the same size as
the players and Devrin has planned the abduction of
the journalists and their replacement by non-Argian's;
the characters would be ideal. The GTL staff do not
know what the journalists look like (the visit was only
arranged 3 weeks ago by the Rashiki branch of GTL's
PR department, about a third of the required to
prepare for a visit and no proper vetting has been able
to be carried out). GTL believe the visit has been
arranged in sufficient secrecy that they're secure from
outside intrusion.
```
```
Devrin informs the group of the scanning procedure
and instructs the PCs not to jeopardise the mission by
taking weapons or recording devices along. She tells
the characters to keep both eyes and ears open for any
snippet of information that may be useful. The primary
goal is to obtain technical data on a new experimental
grav speeder coded APR 363CX. The group will not be
given access to any facilities or information regarding
this vehicle. Its up to them to figure away for a couple
of PCs at the most to try and slip their escorts and do a
little research on their own. She states that she
realises how unlikely this will be but she's desperate to
obtain information on the speeder and will try
anything.
```
```
Hamuusham speaks up at
this point and tells them
that there is one piece of
equipment that they can
give the group to help them
with the mission. He puts his
hand inside his pocket and
pulls out a small, thin,
cylindrical object; “This
ladies and gentlemen is a
fountain pen. A primitive
device used for the
transcription of written
symbols onto a non-electronic recording
medium.” At this stage he
pulls a white sheet of paper
from the desk, unscrews the
cap and begins to write on
the paper. “This device is much loved amongst
journalists however anachronistic in our technical age!
This supply of staining fluid is kept in a refillable
reservoir in the barrel. But this is no ordinary pen for it
has a second smaller barrel concealed within the fast
which contains a tranquillising agent. Twist the lower
half of the barrel a quarter turn, point at your
intended victim and press the butt. The aerosol will
spray to a distance of 30 cm and should bring about an
immediate loss of consciousness. The effects last for
only ten to twenty minutes with the victim
remembering nothing about the incident. It has been
designed to evade most scanners so you should be safe
smuggling them into the GTL site.” There are two of
the special pens available plus a selection of normal
pens and note pads for all (to complete the “look”).
```
```
"When you Need the power: Gravitics!" -
GTL Advertising Slogan
```

```
Devrin and Hamuusham will give the PCs a primer on
GTL and the grav industry. This is easier if any
characters have extensive grav skills.
```
THE TOUR



```
When the day comes the abduction goes smoothly as
the journalists are apprehended at the starport and
the characters take their place. There is a courtesy car
waiting outside to take the group to the site. On
arrival they are met by a PR officer and a security
guard. The characters will have to pass through the
scanners but should face no problems providing they
have followed Devrin's advice.
```
```
All guards should be generated according to the NPC
guide on P. 43 of the Referee's Manual. They will be
armed with snub revolvers with tranq rounds. They do
not wear armour. The group will be shown into a
seminar room where they will be given light
refreshments and shown a holovid about the company,
its work and in particular, the role of the research and
development site.
```
```
In all, this will last for about 90 minutes. Then the PR
officer (who introduces himself as “Marik”) begins the
guided tour of the facility. The group will always be in
the company of Marik and the security guard.
```
```
It's up to the individual referee to detail the inner
details of the complex using the rough outline of the
site as a guide. There are a few points to remember;
```
1. This is a working environment and therefore
    there will be people moving around as the
    characters go round the site.
2. There are a number of holovid cameras around
    for general security.
3. Within the complex there should be a number of
    laboratories, test areas, monitoring rooms,
    offices and storage rooms. Vehicles and
    components/miscellaneous equipment will be
    undergoing tests and evaluations for stress/metal
    fatigue, reliability, crash protection etc.
4. Argi is a vacuum environment. Attempting to go
    outside without a vacc suit will be hazardous to
    the character's health.

```
To slip away from the party without being noticed by
either Marik or the security guard:
Formidable, Stealth, Intrusion, 5 sec (absolute,
fateful)
Referee: any failed attempt will result in a polite but
firm caution. Persistent transgressors will be escorted
back to the seminar room by another guard for the
remaining portion of the visit. The alternative to
slipping away unnoticed is to use the tranq-pens. The
best place would be in one of the lifts where there are
no holovid cameras to monitor (let the players work
this out for themselves).
```
```
To successfully spray the pens into a victim's face:
Routine, Dex, Instant (fateful)
```
```
Referee: on success the victim will slump forward
immediately and remain unconscious for 3d+7 minutes (the referee should roll and keep the time secret. It's
up to the Players to be back before they awaken or a
general alert will be issued). On a failure, roll for a
mishap. Superficial/minor - missed the victim. Major -
sprayed into the face of the nearest person to the
victim's right or left (roll randomly). Destroyed -
sprayed tranquilliser into own face, roll for time
unconscious as above.
```
```
There are plenty of items that can be used to bind and
gag a victim if required. If and when they get away
from their minders they can look for information by
either examining rooms barred to them or break into
the computer system. Unoccupied rooms will be
locked.
```
```
To break into a locked room:
Difficult, Electronics, Intrusion, 5 sec (uncertain,
fateful)
Referee: If a major mishap is rolled the silent alert
system will activate and two armed guards will appear
after 1d minutes.
```
```
To locate useful information:
Difficult, Grav Vehicles or Gravitics, Edu, 10 mins (absolute)
Referee: Hasty and cautious task modifiers apply. On
exceptional success reward the Players with a hard
copy technical readout of the APR 363CX.
```
```
To break into the computer network and bypass the
alarm:
Formidable, Computer, Edu, 1 min (fateful)
Referee: use hasty or cautious modifiers as above. On
all mishaps greater than minor the silent alarm system
will activate and guards will appear in 1d minutes.
```
```
To locate appropriate computer files:
Difficult, Computer, Edu, 1 min.
Referee: on success give some minor technical
information. On exceptional success give the vehicle
data sheet.
```
```
The PCs could have the computer print out a hard-copy
of the data, record the information on a holocrystal or
copy the data into their note pads manually. If the
players are caught in the act of anything illegal they
will be held at the site for “questioning” after which
they will be taken to a local police station where they
can expect a tough time. But that's another story!
```
DEPARTURE



```
For the PCs to make their way to the exit/reception
area:
Routine, Hunting, Int, 2 min (uncertain)
Referee: any sort of success will get the players to the
reception area. Any failure and the players will be lost.
A new task must be attempted at a higher task level to
duplicate the players' apparent confusion.
Every ten minutes roll 1-3 on 1d for an employee to
```

```
walk around the corner and bump into the group
whether they are trying to leave the site or searching
for information. Without their guides the PCs will be
stopped if seen and unless a convincing explanation is
given guards will be summoned.
```
```
Make the players give you a rough explanation and
construct a task based on the plausibility of their
story; the more unlikely the story in your mind the
more difficult you should make the task. On success,
the group be allowed to go unhindered about their
task. If the group 'borrowed' Marik and the guard's
clothes then they will only interrupted if they are
acting suspiciously or the employee notices that the
uniform doesn't fit. In addition its up to the referee to
detail a task for the unconscious bodies of Marik and
the guard to remain undiscovered based on the hiding
place chosen for them.
```
```
To get past the reception area (always a guard present
remember) the story must be re-told. If the characters
retrieve Mark and the guard before they wake up then
they will be escorted out without any problem by the
confused pair otherwise as long as the characters
remain calm they should achieve success and a
courtesy air-raft will arrive in 1d minutes to take them
back to the capital. Play on the characters nerves by
having the (male) receptionist keep looking at them
strangely. The group will not be screened on the way
out and should be safe unless they act too suspiciously.
The alarm will only be raised once they are back at
Innesville unless they were extremely careless.
```
```
A JOB WELL DONE


```
Devrin will congratulate the group on their good work,
assuming they managed to obtain some information. She
will give each PC Cr.5,000 in cash and an open Middle
passage voucher. If the group managed to get the full
technical readouts to the “Tansui” APR 363CX grav
speeder Devrin will give each character Cr.10,000. She
knows that GTL suspect her of organising the 'raid' but
they do not have any proof, are unsure what
information was actually obtained and anyway would
not like the incident to become public knowledge. The
real journalists will be released once the PCs have
returned. Questioning of them by the police will not
shed any light on the incident. If the players stay around
for a day or two the police will give them authority to
leave. Staying around for more than a couple of days
could result in GTL catching up with them.

STARPORT PROCEDURE



Orbital facilities are classified as a Freeport and
several reasons exist for using Gateway as a stopover
point. Gateway itself is classified as a typical Scanian
port and care should be taken about ensuring that
cargoes intended for the surface are correct and
properly documented.

**Landing Pattern** - Ship's arriving in system are
contacted re needed facilities. Ship's transferring
cargoes are directed to the orbital warehouse facilities
and once unloaded are directed to dock at either
Stargate Control or the Highway. Due to the extensive
system traffic arriving ship's-are requested to follow
docking procedures exactly or to transfer control over
to the System's docking computer, Hermes. All
clearance procedures are carried out in orbit and
actual landing on Gateway is restricted. Clearance
will arrive within an hour and consists of a port

```
Warden, health official, port engineer and their
parties. Customs and immigration are only required
for cargoes and/or passengers going down to Gateway
or travelling on to Argi. While Stargate Control is an
Argian settlement, the Highway is a joint Argian!
Scanian enterprise and its recommended that
extreme honesty is practised while onboard, the only
possible exception is Highway Three. Outgoing
cargoes are loaded from the warehouse facilities
immediately prior to leaving the system.
```
```
Starport Facilities - Orbital facilities are classed as a
Freeport and no taxes are payable. Illegal cargoes (psi drugs, stolen articles etc.) however, are not
welcome and ship's found to be carrying such items
will be dealt with harshly (ship's found to have
knowingly carried such cargo are exploded and the
insurance disqualified). Highway has 200 berths and
Stargate Control 50. Traffic is currently 146% but only
4 0 % stay for more than 1 day before continuing their
journey. Starship/spaceship construction,
maintenance and repair facilities are available and
have been rated 3 stars by INDISS.
```
```
Port Costs - Refined fuel is free as is oxygen. These
are considered a by-product of the Highway and are
supplied from the Tower without cost. Berthing costs
Cr.200 for the first six days and Cr.50 per day
thereafter. Warehousing for goods intended for Argi
or Gateway are supplied free of charge, intermediate
warehousing costs Cr.5 per tonne per day. Shuttle
fees - Cargo Cr.5 per tonne, Passengers Cr. 1 0 0.
Transport by the Tower costs Cr. t per tonne and
passengers pay Cr.25 per day's travel.
```
```
Portside Facilities - All orbital ports have TAS hotels
and Traveller Mission Hostels. Most crews stay at the
"Pussy Posse" or the "Hot Tin Roof" while on Stargate
control or at any of the many entertainment centres
on 220/245 (Highway Three). The most popular, and
most expensive, is MacKhan's. Highway Three is
renowned for its liberal attitudes and anything can be
bought within the 220/201 to 2201205 sector known

HISTORY



Originally an Argian settlement the fierce waves,
,extensive volcanic activity and lack of land prevented
planetary habitation though minimal settlements were
made on Luuashegakhu and Gateway s two moons, Shir
and Lishashukh. With the amount of agriculture passing
through the system extensive orbital facilities were
built around Gateway arc these gradually extended
into the massive L5 station now known as Stargate
Control. Massive cargo storage units were started in

300. The system now has over 30 million tonnes of
cargo facilities in orbit in the sky above Gateway.
Gateway itself remained uncolonised until 350 when
members of the Khaarkhi cult built several cities on
the landmasses. Within 35 years the entire settlement
was completely destroyed and thousands of colonists
were dead as a result of volcanic activity which caused
the city of Rhula to sink, (visitors to Gateway can hire
guides to sail them over the seaweed-bannered towers
_of_ the city now encrusted with multi-hued corals and
inhabited only with the silent denizens of the sea.) At
the same time the continent of Yakor rose to within 2
meters of the surface forming the massive seaweed
covered shallow sea. The volcanic mountains of Bhaki
erupted burying the entire region under many meters
of grey volcanic dust. A whole new continent rose up
out of the Glass Sea (so called because the waves
rarely grow above 10 meters) and then sank again 32
years later. Its place is marked only by the dangerous
shoals of White Water Pass. The surviving Khaarkhi fled
and Gateway was once more uninhabited.

In 568 a deal was struck with the Scanians which gave
them control of the planet in return for extracted
minerals. During the rebellion years the Scanian
colonists apparently stopped, voluntarily, all contact
with Akiva though they were one of the first worlds to
sign trade agreements with the Twin Line merchant
fleet. In 924 Gateway's Scanians proposed a plan to
build an orbital tower designed to siphon off large
amounts of the planet' s water and provide more land
for development. The money for the project was
obtained from the Argian government and the Scanian
Traveller's Aid Fund (STAF). The Scanians of Gateway
never suffered severe persecution and have built up a
reputation for extremely high quality workmanship.

A VISITOR'S GUIDE

**Highway** - The tower is the only one of its kind in the
sector and acts both as a means of transport and as a
massive solar still. The base of the tower is moored
deep within the planetary crust 6 kilometers below

which is apparently the only stable point on the
whole planet. The tower itself, which is a sheath of
foamed plastisteel covering hundreds of
monofilaments, is divided into two main sections; the
Still which covers the tower surface to a depth of
three meters. This siphons water in continually
through the base of the tower and uses suction to
keep the flow up the tower. Within the center are the
vertical grav-lifts which supplies transport to each of
the orbital platforms. The main Aquan settlements
are based around the siphon ducts (known as Deep 1
to 6) and the tower itself has an entire settlement
contained within the spine. The tower tapers from 15
kilometers across at the base to 3 kilometers at sea
level... From here the tower becomes a mere 2 0 0
meters across as it stretches to the next major
settlement, at Sky. This platform is 500 meters across
and 300 meters high and is based five kilometers
above sea level. The view of the world from its glass
bottomed floor is breathtaking. From here the tower
is purely a siphon and transport system and tapers to
a mere 100 meter diameter. This continues to the
first orbital platform, Highway One at a distance of
2 0 , 0 0 0 km up. Here the tower (known as the
Highway) has been extended by using derelict Argian
orbital stations to create a ring of living
accommodation. This marks the point of the towers
extrality and apart from extensive living quarters,
shopping centres etc., the city have extensive docks,
engineering facilities, communications as well as the
Tower Travel terminus Centre (T3c). From that point
until Highway Two is reached (at 28,000 km) the
entire Highway skin is designated as a massive solar
still which is used to separate the water into gases
and extracted minerals. In addition, heat exchangers
turn the excess heat into electrical power. By
Highway Two the entire cargo of sea water has been
separated and the waste products, mainly helium and
salt crystals, expelled into orbit. Over the years these
have formed a massive doughnut shape round the
planet known as the “Halo”. Due to solar ionisation the
combination of crystals and helium gas sparkles like a
circular rainbow.
```
```
At 32,500 km the tower expands into Highway Three
where massive maser units have been built to beam
excess energy to the receiver satellites at the Argian
stargate. At 55,050 km the fuel depot and Highway
port is reached. The end of the tower is tethered to a
hollowed out asteroid known as Anchor's End situated
another 200 km out. As a result of the tower the sea
level on Gateway has gone down by 78 meters since
the tower was opened and any ship visiting can obtain
free oxygen and refined fuel courtesy of the planet.
Each Highway city revolves round the tower to provide
a cheap, effective gravity. Inhabitants of the city use
the lift level as their city designation thus Highway one
is known as 90/1 to 90/300 depending on which level
they live on and Highway Three, a freeport with a
reputation for wildness unique among Scanians is
known locally as 220/1 to 220/500.

handling facilities. The system acts as a trans-shipment
point for the dozens of multi-kiloton agroproduct bulk
carriers travelling weekly from the agricultural worlds
of Sii (0932 Argi), Shidka (1032 Argi), Liikiir (1029 The
Remnants) and Akigir (1129 The Remnants) to Argi
itself.

**The Stargate** - A relatively recent invention consisting
of a series of satellites orbiting the planet at the
leading and trailing Trojan positions absorbing solar
energy which are then transferred via couplers to
starships fitted with external power couplings. These
satellites are supplemented by additional power
beamed from the Highway. The Stargate is currently
only to be found on Gateway and Argi with other gates
planned for Gigi, Ashmasa and Akiva. Specially
designed ships are required to benefit from the 'Gate.

For further information see the Article “Stargates
& Jumpsails - Altemative Jump Drives”.

**Gateway** - Much of the planet has yet to be explored
and the majority of current settlements are sited
around the Tower complex. Gateway is a tourist's
dream; the hedonistic pleasures of the Highway (particularly Highway Three) and the pure, unspoiled
paradise of the surface. The weather conditions are
extreme with severe tidal conditions, especially round
the equatorial regions where 160 meter waves are
common. Despite this there are several places worth
visiting. The ring of undersea volcanic mountains
illuminates the sea around the Bhaki archipelago. The
islands themselves are covered in several meters of
grey ash and are totally without life. Visit the
excavated Khaarkhi settlements on Bhaki Prime. The
islands themselves are still active volcanoes and care
must be taken when visiting. Visit the Lava rivers of
S'mulla where the fire-resistant Takai lizard resides.
This lizard can live in temperatures up to 300ºC and
can grow to a length of 30 cm. Visit Hajaan Major to
the North of the Glass Sea, the only occupied
landmass. Here the living area has been extended to
Scanian houseboat colonies which exist, sheltered
within the eight 25 kilometer lagoons made by the

```
massive tidal ducks used to control the tides around
the islands. All other non-tower residences on Gateway
are floating because of the current instability but
several major terraforming experiments are currently
underway which should help to tame the wild magma
heart of the planet. Visit the polar base of Hades and
take a trip in a heat-resistant sub through the magma-filled caverns of Hkarha. Visit the submerged city of
Rhula and dive amidst the sunken streets.
```
```
Gateway is a naturalist's dream and wildlife includes
the 900 meter length Hades worm and the aquatic
Seachimp. Because of the potential damage to existing
ecologies by the constant draining of the ocean,
several massive reservations have been built
surrounded by plastisteel walls which jut out of the
water by 100 meters. These reservations are up to 100
kilometers across and show the oceans of Gateway as
they once were. The rest of the ocean has been
extensively cultivated and the planet is self-sufficient
in Aquaculture. Animals worth seeing are the polar
Hades worms. These creatures dwell near undersea
volcanoes absorbing heat through their skin. They are
about 50 meters diameter and covered in hair-like
spines filled with an extremely poisonous toxin. The
mouth has up to 18 sets of teeth which curve inwards
thus preventing a prey from escaping once it's been
caught. The creatures are extremely fast and have
been recorded at speeds of 13 kph when chasing prey.
The Seachimp is an aquatic mermammal which grows
to a length of 1 meter from head to tail. The head is
remarkably human-like and the body covered in fine
spine-like scales which taper off towards the fish tail.
The creatures have a limited intelligence and can be
taught to obey simple commands. They are extremely
mischievous and are constantly getting into trouble.
They form strong family attachments but will leave
clan for the constant companionship of a human or
Aquan. Seachimps cannot be made into pets as such
since they have to choose their own owners. Seachimps
taken away from their clan by an unchosen sentient
quickly pine away and die.
```
```
Holowood - Perhaps the most famous export of
Gateway is the crystallised seaweed known as
Holowood. Holowood is fossilised into an amber state
which is extremely light-receptive. Holowood is only
found in the constant dark of the seabed and exposure
to light results in the crystallised structure absorbing
the resulting view like a natural holograph. Holowood
is therefore mined and, occasionally, carved in total
darkness then exposed to an image or scene. If the
crystallised fragment is exposed correctly its possible
for a holomovie of up to 5 seconds can be made.
Unexposed Holowood are exported throughout the
Imperium but the purest exposures are made only on
Gateway. Possibly the most famous Holowood carving
is the “Teardrop” by Simeon Gradruula which shows
the Princess Ciencia Iphegenia and Lady Isis, daughter
of Archduke Dulinor smiling and giggling together at
their seventeenth birthday celebration. The Holowood
was carved into a gigantic teardrop in total darkness
and took 3 months. The teardrop is on display at the
Ducal palace museum on Medurma.

The Scanian row reads mostly neutral because “The

They have, however, built up an excellent working
relationship with the Bwaps. The Solomani antipathy
towards Scanians is part due to emotional reasons and
part their xenophobia. Emotionally Solomani feel ill at
ease because “Those eyes... You can never tell what

fact that although directly descended from them, the
Scanian have become a separate species within the

at the University of Ushra, 234-936. The lecturer
was Professor Akaka Ugusmid, Head of the
Hydrophysics and Hydrography Departments. The
Professor was a consultant for the Gateway Tower
Project regarding environmental considerations.
```
```
We join the lecture as the Professor begins his
discussion on the evaluation of the Tower's design.
```
```
“.. and so the research vessel sank! As I said, water
worlds are not the idyllic paradises they are popularly
considered to be and Gateway was no exception. I
would like to go into further depth on this matter.
```
```
“As any secondary student knows, or at least should
know, whenever a differential exists within a system,
that system will try and correct it by moving to a new
point of equilibrium. It is from this basic physical
concept that the weather patterns of any planet can be
modelled and analysed.
```
```
“I stated weather patterns would be examined because
these are the most important influences on the ocean
surface waves. This proves especially true for water
worlds.
```
```
“The major cause of change in a global weather system
is? That's right, temperature. Due to differing distances
from the system's star, the various parts arc
atmosphere of a world will be at different
temperatures This disparity sets up a global atmosphere
circulation, as shown in even the most basic application
of the Jocastan global atmosphere model. From these
we see that cyclonic and anit-cyclonic pseudo-bodies
will arise. Within these pseudo-bodies, pressure
differences will occur, again as shown by Jocasta, and
thus winds occur.
```
```
“Even a basic Bernoulli analysis will show this wind will
set up motions in the fluid beneath it. The resulting
wave size depends very heavily on the wind velocity.
```
```
“So what? Does this not apply equally to planets with
land as well as water worlds? Yes, but to investigate we
must look at the exact mechanisms by which wind is
generated. Don't worry, I won't go into the full details
otherwise we'd still be here until Holiday! If you want
more details then sign up for my course next semester.
Back to the matter at hand, waves. A major limitation
on their size on wet worlds is the presence of land.
Even worlds like Terra, which are over 70% water,
never saw waves of great magnitude because of this.
Land and shelf boundaries inhibit the occurrence of
fully-developed waves. In most cases, this limitation on
wave development does not exist on water worlds.
They therefore become fully developed. This fact is of
```
### FIRE & WATERFIRE & WATERFIRE & WATERFIRE & WATER

immense importance. When we apply the TocrediV-Oaiylrieatow-Anderson equations and criteria to these
figures we get some very interesting results; whereas
on wet worlds 30 meter waves are the exception, on
water worlds 50 meter waves become commonplace.

“Now the Gateway Tower, because of its extra-V
atmospheric nature, had to be designed to full Imperial
Design Regulations. Because of the unique nature of
this structure and the novel and creative use of the
regulations, it would make a Memorial Lecture in
itself, if you could find someone willing to tell the true
story! But I digress. The wave design requisite that the
tower had to be built to, was for a 1,000 year wave.
That is, the most powerful wave that could
theoretically occur within a 1,000 year span. Due to
the location of the tower, on the equator, it would be
vulnerable to hurricanes. Thus we could expect to
regularly see waves as strong as 100 kph. By applying
the T-O-A equations we can see that the Tower would
regularly encounter waves of 150 meters. As an aside,
were it not for the world's inhabitants being of Scanian
origin and thus immune to motion sickness, these
waves would prevent any use of surface transport
through user incapability even without looking at the
transport design.

“So, you can see from this computer-generated model,
that a water world's distinctive wave patterns will
heavily influence the design of any structure that
penetrates the ocean surface.

“Now let's discuss the second part of this lecture, fire.
As I mentioned at the beginning, Gateway is prone to
extreme volcanism. Indeed, it was this factor that led
to the Tower being required in the first place. As
chance would have it, the only stable point on the
planet was at the equator. Thus the tower is not going
to disappear down a newly erupting volcano or be split
asunder by an earthquake. However volcanic action
will still effect a fluid environment. Why? Because of
the excellent vibration-propagation qualities of fluids.
So, while a land volcano will cause only an immediate
locality effect, an island or sub-surface volcano will
effect much larger areas. This is because they
generate tidal waves, or more correctly, tsunami.
These are products of the initial shock wave emitted
by the erupting volcano. The size of tsunami can reach
mythological proportions; the largest on record was
1,000 meters high and had already travelled a distance
of 1,500 km! Gateway, itself, has seen 600 meter
tsunami. No wonder the Solomani legend of Atlantis
tell of a continent disappearing overnight.

“Despite their size and effect, or perhaps because of
it, tsunami magnitudes and occurrence are incredibly
notorious to predict. Even with detailed mantle and
core samplings it is difficult to put ball park figures to
their size. This data is rare even for old, highly
populated worlds. The last set of measurements on
Vland were carried out in the 800's and are not
expected to be retaken until the 1200's.(*1) However,
if suitable safety factors are used, we can still use the
data to give as a reasonably accurate guesstimate.

```
Unfortunately this data was not yet available for
Gateway. So, thanks to the pioneering work of my
colleagues here at UU, namely Dr. Jane Yoshida from
the Geology Department, working figures were
obtained. Dr. Yoshida's theories propose an empirical
relationship for tsunami intensity. In computer
simulation it proved to be an amazing 98.5% accurate
and these figures, with suitable safety figures added,
were applied to the structure.(*2)
```
```
“At this moment, due to the careful analysis applied to
the design, the construction of the Tower is well on
schedule. Barring major mishaps, Gateway will have its
highway to the stars completed on time.” (*3)
```
```
1) In 1104 a highly effective and quick method of
generating mantle and core data, the Dolosov
Probe, was developed. Now these samples are
checked every year.
2) The Yoshida Relationship is now considered the
standard method for evaluating tsunami.
Subsequent modelling and comparison with
actual data has shown the actual accuracy to be
99.97%.
3) This is believed to be the first recorded
reference to the Tower as the “Highway”.

ABSTRACT



A rough calculation of the amount of energy required
by a starship's Jump net in order to enter Jumpspace.
Using this information, alternative methods of
providing the energy needed to Jump are discussed --
namely, solar-thermal (JumpSail) and solarVelectric (StarGate) power sources.

INTRODUCTION



The idea of using a power source other than a high-output fusion plant to charge a Jump net has an
excellent pedigree. Adventure 1, _Annic Nova_ discusses
a craft fitted with a device called a “solar collector”.
However, the concept seems to have fallen into
disfavor - in fact, I have it on good authority that
Marc regards _Annic Nova_ as “unofficial”.

So, you may well come across arm-waving arguments
about zuchai crystal discharge rates which say that
only fusion plants are suitable to power Jump drives.
Don't believe it. Electricity is electricity is electricity -
and if you can generate enough of it safely, then you
can enter Jump, and it doesn't matter how you
generate it.

External Power: After a thorough reading of Starship
Operator's Manual, I have found nothing which says
that the means of generating the energy to charge the
zuchai crystals has to be inside the Jump net. The
Jump fusion power plant consumes its allotted fuel
supply over a period of 10-20 minutes, as it charges
the energy sinks. After this, the plant is superfluous,
_so why have it inside the hull at all?_ Sure, it has the
advantage of being able to "go anywhere", without
needing insystem installations. However, it also has
plenty of disadvantages - Jump fusion plants are
expensive, difficult to maintain, and temperamental.

So, it makes sense that in settled, peaceful areas,
(such as the imperial Core) where insystem
installations can be reliably maintained, governments
and corporations would examine alternative Jump
systems, if only on grounds of cost.

For the purposes of this article, I will refer to
conventional starships as “internal power” J um p
craft, and those which mount the J u m p power plant
outside the hull net as “external power” craft.

BASIC CONSTRUCTION



Naturally, external power craft omit a fair proportion
of the standard Jump Drive and all of the Jump fuel
supply. However, they require a secondary or “trickle”

```
power plant which supplies power to the Jump systems
while the craft is in Jumpspace:
```
```
“Trickle” Power Plant :
15 MW per 100 displacement tons, plus sufficient fuel
for 7 standard days.
```
```
Power couplings :
Superconducting power connections on the hull permit
connection to an external power source. They cost
Cr.5,000 per displacement ton, but occupy no volume.
```
```
Jump Power Consumption:
```
```
A Tech 15 standard power plant displacing 14+
kilolitres produces 18 MW per kl, and consumes 0.009
k l of fuel per kl per hour.
```
```
This works out to an energy content of 7.2 x 10^12 J/
kilolitre, if fused in a conventional plant [Only one part
in 900,000 of the fuel's mass is converted to energy.
The true figure for proton-proton fusion is one part in
```
150. Oh well, who said this game was realistic?!].

```
If our “standard ship” is a 1.000-ton, Jump-1 craft, it
needs 1350 kilolitres of fuel, with an energy of 9.72 x
1015 J.
```
```
Assume that a “high-yield” Jump power plant is 0.3
times as efficient as a standard power plant. This gives
a Jump fuel energy content of 2.916 x 10^15 J for our
standard ship. This is the amount of energy needed for
the ship to enter Jumpspace.
```
```
This fuel is consumed over a period of approximately
20 minutes. The average power developed by the
reactor is 2.43 x 10^12 W, or 243 million MW. Shows how
much of an IR and neutrino beacon a ship entering
Jumpspace is!
```
SOLAR-THERMAL POWER

```
The solar-thermal external power generation system
relies on a large neomylar reflector (usually in the
shape of a truncated cone) which focusses solar
radiation onto a thermal conversion system, which
generates energy. The reflector (or JumpSail) is
unfurled by computer control before charging begins.
Automatic cable cutters jettison the Sail immediately
prior to Jump. Once jettisoned, the Sail can be
salvaged and re-used.
```
```
“1 Sol” Solar energy/unit area at 1 A.U.: 1400 W/sq.
m e t r e Neomylar reflectivity, 9 9 percent.
```
## STARGATES & JUMPSAILSSTARGATES & JUMPSAILSSTARGATES & JUMPSAILS STARGATES & JUMPSAILS

Thermal conversion unit:

High-temperature reservoir: Pressurised gas at 3000K.
Low-temperature reservoir; Liquid Hydrogen at 12K.
Carnot efficiency between these two reservoirs: 0.996.
Assume 95 percent of ideal (Carnot) efficiency: 0.9462.

Thus, useful energy per unit area = 1400 x 0.99 x
0.9462 = 1311 W/sq. meter.

To generate 2.43 million MW, we need 1.85 x 109 sq.
meters of reflector. A typical sail design would be an
annulus, outer radius 24.5 kilometers, inner radius 3
kilometers. Naturally. the JumpSail is also an efficient
solar sail, and would be used for maneuvering in
realspace prior to Jump.

Neomylar (produced by zero-G vacuum deposition, and
50 times lighter than contemporary mylar) weighs 0.1
grams per square meter. The JumpSail for our standard
ship would weigh 185 tons, plus probably 25 tons for
monofilament cabling. Assuming highly efficient
packing techniques, the Sail could probably displace
250 tons including cabling if carried as internal cargo.
With mass production of neomylar, the Sail would
probably cost less than MCr.0.75, and could be re-used
many times. Clearly, carrying a “spare” for the return
trip makes the design noticeably less efficient than a
standard ship, but this is not really the intention of the
design. I conceived the design for one of two roles.
Firstly, a one-way colonisation vessel for a civilisation
lacking advanced fusion technology. Secondly, a vessel
serving heavily-settled areas, where pre-packed Sails
could be attached externally at orbital installations.

I leave it to you to speculate on Traveller variants
where the JumpSail is the sole method of FTL travel.

```
Thermal c o n v e r si on u ni t : Displaces and weighs one
V-quarter and costs one-third of the equivalent Jump
Drive. Cable controls - 75 KCr. 0.15 MW per 100
displacement tons.
```
SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER



```
With the ready access to space which a culture
achieves as it reaches TL9, it is common for solar
energy to be harnessed by satellite solar power
systems in stationary orbit, or at a Trojan point, and
beamed to a planet's surface by microwave. Some or
all of the output of such a powersat could be diverted
for the necessary 20 minutes or so to charge, the
zuchai crystals of a starship. Diagram 2 shows a
powersat which has been designed with such an
application in mind. The six solar arrays surround a
hexagonal “core” of truss beams, on which are
mounted hydraulic arms carrying the superconducting
cabling necessary to connect with the starship's jump
net. Such powersats are usually known as “StarGates”.
```
```
StarGates are usually positioned at the leading and
trailing Trojan positions of a planet's or moon's orbit, to
ensure that they lie outside the 100-diameter limit.
```
```
Before we examine the figures for such a system, there
are a couple of points in the Referee's Manual
treatment of solar cells which need to be clarified.
```
```
Irregular structures have far more surface area in
relation to their volume than other configurations.
Irregular structures may mount up to five times the two-thirds power of their volume of solar cells. The surface
area of a hull is determined by the two-thirds power (NOT the square root) of its volume. That is, surface
area equals the cube root of the square of the volume.
MegaTraveller Referee's Manual is incorrect in this
respect.
```
```
Craft which are only capable of low acceleration may
mount solar cells on extended arrays, with minimal
structural bracing. A craft which can only accelerate at
one-half gravity may mount up to twenty times the two-thirds if its volume of solar cells - these consume only
one-tenth of the volume of standard solar cells. The
configuration is automatically USL.
```
```
The output of solar cells is dependent on the light
energy falling upon them. Multiply the output figure
given by the luminosity of the primary (in sols), and
divide by the square of the distance from the primary (in A.U.). The maximum possible multiple is the square
of the TL divided by 10; thus, TL8 cells can give up to
6.4 times their rated output before burning out.
```
```
The StarGate:
```
```
The power output of MegaTraveller solar cells seems to
increase as a geometric progression with the tech level
The editors seem to have lost sight of the fact that
there is a fundamental limit to the output of solar cells
```
- namely, the amount of light energy failing on a unit

area (0.0014 MW per square meter, for one sol at 1
A.U.). Contemporary gallium arsenide solar cells are
about 40% efficient. The TL12 solar cells given produce
_fifty-eight times_ more energy than they receive. This
is clearly impossible.

However, we have to use the figures we are given. To
generate 243 million MW using TL12 solar cells, we
need 30 million square meters of solar cells. The
StarGate illustrated would need six solar arrays, each
one kilometer by five kilometers. The solar cells alone
would cost MCr.60,000 - however, I feel that the price
figures for solar cells are outrageously high. Taking
into account mass production in orbit, a more
reasonable figure would be Cr.100 per square meter,
bringing the cost down to MCr.3,000 for the solar cells,
or probably MCr.5,000 including the structure and cost
of assembly. For this, we get a facility able to launch
one 1,000-ton ship every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day,
and sufficient power to supply most of a planet.

Additional features are possible, such as mounting
microwave rectennas on starships, allowing the
StarGate to broadcast power to a starship within
Planetary range. However, the additional cost and
complexity of this would probably not be worthwhile.

**Jump net:** A StarGate starship requires only external
power couplings (see above), plus the Jump net and
basic control gear. This displaces and weighs one-tenth, and costs one-quarter of the equivalent Jump
drive.

aside, and sits down at your table. He introduces
himself as Dr. Gani Garamshiir, a marine biologist.

Action: Dr. Garamshiir sets out the terms of his job
offer. He begins by saying that he has formulated
certain theories about the fauna on Gateway, and no
needs a team to go “into the field” to gather data for
him. The mission involves a twelve-day voyage in a
gravitic submersible, and the placement of a number
of automated sonar buoys. The teams will be required
to make holorecordings of a number of aquatic
species “at close quarters”. Dr. Garamshiir would
have been making the trip himself, but for “certain
medical reasons, you know...”. The total mission
length will be 14 to 16 days, including preparation,
and transfer to the north polar region (the voyage is
along latitude 62ºN, from 0ºWto 120ºW). Payment is
Cr.8,500 per person on completion, plus an
unspecified bonus for any interesting holorecordings
obtained.

If the players ask about his theories, Dr. Garamshiir
appears deeply troubled. After a pause, he explains
that he believes the suction created by Highway
operation is beginning to alter deep ocean currents
all around the planet. Migrating sea creatures follow
these currents, and so this could have important
consequences for the whole planet's biosphere. The
Highway Authority refused to listen to his ideas, and
would not provide the resources for this follow-up
mission, so he has had to fund it privately.

If the players try to negotiate for higher pay, Dr. ,s
unreceptive (increase task difficulty one level), but
will go to a maximum of Cr. 11,000 per person. If the
players press too hard, the droid will intervene and ask
them to desist.

Nugget 2 covers any investigation of Dr. Garamshiir's
credentials. Nugget 3 covers the meeting with Highway
bureaucracy, and the departure for the polar regions.

2.SUSPICIOUS?

The PCs search for information about their patron.

Scene: Data flashes up on the terminal in front of you,
as you search for information on Dr. Garamshiir

Action: A routine data search requires the following
task:

**To gain information on Garamshiir:**
Routine, Computer, Edu, 1 min
Referee: On success, the PCs learn that Dr. Garamshiir
is indeed an emeritus professor of marine biology from
the University of Bolivar. He is apparently perfectly
genuine. Players with Int 8+ will be able to extract the
information about his theories given in Nugget 1, from
copies of his scientific papers on the net.

3. HIGHWAY ROBBERY

```
The players encounter obstructive Highway
bureaucracy
```
```
Scene: The cavernous vehicle hay in the heart of the
Highway Surface Structure echoes with your footsteps
as you approach the cargolifter along a narrow access
bridge. Just then, you see a Bwap in Highway Authority
uniform and two Scanian security troopers standing at
the other end of the bridge. The 'lifter crew are
standing by their vehicle, and seem impatient and
annoyed.
```
```
Action: The Bwap approaches the PCs brandishing a
sheaf of papers. “Are you the reprethentatithe of Dr.
Gani Garamthiir?” he demands. (The presence of the
Scanians should persuade them to tell the truth). He
continues, “The thubmerthible aboard thith vehicle
hath been found to have inadequate thatety
thertification under Thtatute 491-8 of the GateWay
Vehicle Regithtration Code, and ith therfore
impounded...”
```
```
Encourage the players to roleplay this to the full.
Conspiracy theories should abound, but in fact the
Bwap is just missing some paperwork. If the players try
to 'phone Garamshiir, he is unavailable.
```
```
If they wish, the players may attempt the following
task.
```
```
To Persuade the Bwap to release the submersible:
Formidable, Admin, Int, 3 min
Referee: Any mishap will result in the Bwap stalking
of, saying “I WILL conthult with my thuperlorth...”.
```
```
After ten minutes, the 'lifter crew will slouch off in
search of a drink They will ignore PCs attempts to
persuade them to stay.
```
```
Eventually, one of the PCs may think of checking out
the submersible themselves. The Bwap, Mwam'elappu,
will allow one person on board, provided he is
accompanied by a guard.
```
```
To search the sub for safety documentation:
Routine, Int, 30 sec (uncertain)
Referee: This tack may be repeated as necessary, but
the PCs won't find anything... But then, in a high-tech
world, you shouldn't just look for hard-copy
documentation...
```
```
To power to the sub's computer:
Simple, Computer, Instant
```
```
To search on the computer for safety
documentation:
Routine, Computer, Int, 30 sec (safe)
Success! The sub was given safety clearance when it
was imported via GateWay Prima, but no-one thought
to give the Highway Authority a hardcopy. These things
happen... Armed with a printout, the PCs can approach
the Bwap again. The negotiation task above becomes
```

Routine, safe. Now all they have to do is find the
'lifter crew again. Carousing tasks, anyone?

4.ABOARD THE 'JULES VERNE'

The PCs familiarise themselves with the submersible.

Scene: Holodynamic panels bleep, and flash on-line as
you power up the sub's internal systems. Judging from
the readouts, everything seems to be working fine.

Action: The 'Jules Verne' is a 4-man minisub
manufactured by GTL (Argi) for small-scale exploratory
and repair work. It has gravitic propulsion - direction
control is provided by auxiliary vectored thrust fans.
Cruising speed is 30 kph, though the sub is capable of
'sprints' of 40 kph. The crew positions are:- pilot,
navigator/sonar ops, engineer, and remote systems
operator (camera, robot arms, etc.)

The 'Jules Verne' has twelve imaging sonar buoys slung
in external cradles along its sides. The mission calls for
the deployment of these buoys at 24-hour intervals
during the sub's voyage. Each buoy consists of three
components linked by a cable - the first is anchored to
the sea bed, the second, which floats above it, houses
the imaging sonar and, the third, which floats slightly
below the surface houses low-frequency (LF) radio and
blue-green laser satellite data links.

The 'Jules Verne' also mounts LF radio and laser
communication links - the laser is limited to 1 km
range underwater, so a close approach to the surface
is required.

_(lf desired, a MegaTraveller design may be
produced for this vehicle using the 'Hass'
minisub_ in ' _101 Vehicle' as a model.)_

5. IN THE DRINK

The PCs begin their mission with a splash!

Scene: The grey, forbidding sea opens out below you as
the 'lifter breaks through a low cloud bank. Drizzle
mists the 'lifter's forward screen as it loses altitude.
Glancing at the nav displays, you suddenly gain a sense
of the majestic scale of Gateway's oceans The 'ripples'
you can see below are huge waves, fully 40 meters
high!

The pilot leans across and grins; “ETA at Pallisar Circle
ten minutes. You guys had better get ready.”

Action; The players move into the aft cargo
compartment, enter the 'Jules Verne', and begin me
power-up sequence.

```
To power up the submersible:
Routine, Grav Vehicle, Computer, 30 secs (uncertain)
Referee: System crosschecks may be performed by
declaring a Cautious attempt - otherwise, implement a
'warning light' event on Some Truth.
```
```
The 'lifter comes to a hover over Pallisar Circle, a
calm-water lagoon used as a repair and replenishment
center for vessels serving the north polar platforms.
The PCs can see waves breaking over the opposite
seawall (fully sixty meters high), which brings home to
them the violence of Gateway's climate. The 'lifter
pilot signals ready to 'unlatch'.
```
```
To notice a problem:
Routine, Int, Instant.
```
```
Wait a minute, aren't we supposed to be closer to the
water? Too late. A sickening sensation of falling, and
the sub hits the surface of the water from a height of
about six feet. Once the PCs have cursed the 'lifter
pilot in several Galactic dialects, they begin checking
the sub for signs of damage.
```
```
To diagnose damage:
Difficult. Grav Vehicle, Computer, 2 min (uncertain)
```
```
Whether or not the 'Jules Verne' is damaged, (or if the
effects of any damage only appear later) is entirely up
to the referee. A stopover at Pallisar while minor
damage is fixed, would give the PCs an opportunity to
talk to Subsea workers about their mission.
```
```
Once the 'Jules Verne' has cleared the sealocks in the
sea wall of Pallisar Circle, the PCs are finally in the
open ocean. Onwards!
```
6. RANDOM NUGGETS

```
Brief encounters in the oceans of Gateway Icebergs:
The area ahead is blocked by icebergs calving from the
north polar cap. The PCs will have to go through (risking being trapped) or round them (adding to their
journey time) to get to their destination.
```
```
Blipperfish: The sub is surrounded by a shoal of blue-green fish, each emitting high-pitched chirps as a
mating signal. The resulting cacophony is blinding the
sub's passive and active sonar, and vision is also
impaired. The PCs will have to stop dead and wait for
the fish to go away. Trying to outrun them will
probably result in them running into a rock outcrop.
```
```
Net: The sub runs into a drift net being trailed (Illegally) by another sub How the PCs resolve this is up
to them.
```
```
Quake: The sub is travelling along a subsea valley,
when a tremor triggers a collapse in one of the walls.
Task rolls are necessary to escape damage.
```
```
Wreck: A wrecked grav vehicle/spacecraft is
discovered on the seabed. The site may be marked by
a sonar beacon. If the crash was recent, a recovery
```

operation may be in operation.

7. MONKEY BUSINESS

The PCs encounter seachimps.

```
Scene: You are cruising low
over the weed-choked
seabed, having just deployed
one of your sonar beacons,
when your navigator turns to
you.
```
```
“Eight ...no...ten traces.
Bearing oh-eight-five to one-Vthree-zero and closing
slowly.”
```
Straining your eyes, you
begin to make out vague
shapes ahead of you. With rising excitement, you
realise that these are wild Seachimps, and you instruct
your computer to ready the external holocamera.

Action: Seachimps (proper name: _Filssa Oceanus
Parasimian_ ) are naturally inquisitive and mischievous
creatures. They will lead the PCs a merry dance,
swimming round and round the sub, and playing
'chicken' with the whirling thrust fans.

**To take holos of the Seachimps:**
(Difficulty), Sensor Ops, Edu, 1 min.
Referee: The player may choose the _difficulty_ of this
task - the more difficult the task, the more valuable
the resulting holo is if he succeeds.

**To manoeuvre the sub Mills filming the Seachimps:**
Difficult, Grav vehicle, Dex, I min. (hazardous)
Referee: A failure on this task indicates that the sub
has become snagged on the weeds which blanket the
seabed. A serious mishap means that a thrust fan had
become an impromptu chimp-slicer, seriously
damaging itself in the process _(Yuk!.)_

These weeds have the tensile strength of plasteel
cables, so someone will have to go outside and cut the
sub free. Attempts to manoeuvre the sub out of the
weed will just result in it becoming more tangled.

**To cut the sub free:**
Difficult, Vacc suit, Mechanical, 3 min.
The grav-augmented pressure suits on board the 'Jules
Verne' are sufficiently close to vacc suits that that skill
will serve in place of Diving skill.

8. MINE! ALL MINE!

The PCs trespass on an undersea mining facility.

Scene: The sub has just crested a ridge-line, and you
head down into the basin beyond, preparing to deploy
the next sonar buoy. Ahead, you think you can begin to
make out vague glows and linear shapes on the seabed.
The navigator reports that there are strong sonar

```
returns from that area.
```
```
Suddenly, a menacing, inhuman shape appears atop
the rock outcrop directly in front of you. It extends a
skeletal arm. and a dazzling whitish light springs from
its tip.
```
```
Action: The PCs have stumbled on a seabed mining
operation owned by Drach-Kehlsen N.V. Their map
data is out of date - it shows this area as a featureless
expanse of seabed. They have encountered a general-purpose mining robot, which is currently attempting to
hail them by laser.
```
```
To notice the communication attempt:
Routine. Computer, Commo, Instant.
```
```
All the players will get is an string of binary - a
corporate ID code. The waiting for the countersign. If
the PCs respond if any way, the 'bot will inform them
that they are trespassing, and order them to remain
where they are. If they attempt to escape, a second
robot appears, and will attempt to grapple with the
sub to hold it stationary. If the PCs persist, the robot
will try to cripple the sub's propulsion systems with
plasma torches.
```
```
After five minutes, two Aquans will appear, armed
with blue-green spectrum laser rifles. They signal for
the sub to move (or be dragged) to the central habitat.
Once inside the habitat, the PCs will have some
explaining to do about how they come to be
trespassing on corporate property. lf they come up
with a reasonable story (select an appropriate
interpersonal task), the mining crew will be quite
apologetic, explaining that they have had border
violations by rival mining corporations, and have
perhaps been a trifle trigger-happy. Any necessary
repairs can be dealt with quickly by the automated
systems at the mining base.
```
9. THE GATE TO HADES

```
The PCs encounter the awesome power of the Hades
Worm, and attempt to avert a tragedy.
```
```
Scene: Almost finished! The
entrance to the Carsalin Valley, a
subsea fissure, is coming up on the
sonar, and a little way beyond the
other end, some 40 km to the
south, is the site for the final sonar
beacon. The ConAm drilling
platform there will be able to radio
the 'lifter to come and pick you up,
and..
```
```
Suddenly, there is a yammering
alarm on the sensor board. The
navigator begins relaying the
readings, “Bearing zero-nine-three,
almost due North. I'm picking up a lot of turbulent
water, like a shock wave. There's something inside
it.... Can't make it cut clearly.. Very large. Range...
```

Uh... three point four kilometers.. speed twelve point
five klicks per hour, directly towards us!”. The
navigator looks at you anxiously.

Action: It couldn't possibly.. but it is! A Hades Worn, -
only a small one mind, a little over six hundred and
sixty five meters long and massing close on eighteen
hundred tonnes. The PCs have sixteen and a halt
minutes to decide to do something **,** before their cute
little submarine gives it a mild case of indigestion.

If they haven't done their homework on Gateway
fauna, the PCs may want to scan the approaching
monster..

**To perform a pinpoint active sonar scan:**
Routine, Sensor Ops, Edu, 20 Sec (Uncertain)
Referee: **This task** becomes simple at Distant (2 km)
or less. **Rut would** the PCs want to wait?!

The Hades Worm will actually swerve and slow slightly
under the effect of the intense sonar beam.

**To notice the Hades Worm slowing:**
Difficult, Int, Instant
Referee: All crew members may roll.

This should give smart players a clue as to what to do.

**To boost sonar output power:**
Difficult, Sensor Op's, Computer or Electronics, 30 Sec (Hazardous)
Referee: Any mishap is applied as damage to the sonar
system. (Gee! Betcha can spell those burnt-out
components already!). A major mishap indicates a
complete electrical shutdown in the sub.. Meaning no
manoeuvre power.

**To fire the home-made stub gun:**
Routine, Sensor Ops. Dex, 20 sec (Hazardous) Referee:
Marginal success means the worm slows, but keeps
coming. Exceptional success means the worm swerved
out of the way, and swims away to the West.

If the PCs fail at the above tasks, or if they do not
think of that course of action, the Worm will continue
to approach the mouth of the Carsalin Valley,
threatening the inhabited ConAm drilling platform at
the other end of the valley. Other courses of action
include approaching the surface and beaming a
warning by laser, heading down the valley in front of
the Worm at top speed to give the platform an
advance warning, and getting out of the way and
letting the worm collide with the rig (shame!). Useful
tasks are shown below.

**To approach the surface:**
Difficult, Grav Vehicle, Dex (1 min)
Referee: Failure indicates the sub is still too deep to
establish a comlink. A mishap indicates damage to the
sub by Gateway's huge waves.

**To establish a laser comlink:**
Difficult, Commo, Int. I min.

```
To pilot the sub at “sprint” (35 kph) speeds:
Routine, Grav Vehicle, Dex.
```
```
Epilogue:
Dr. Garamshiir will pay Or 1,000 to Cr.3,000 in bonuses
to each PC for good quality holo's obtained (You didn't
have the camera running when the worm was
attacking? How sad!), and will give them a letter of
introduction, which will assist them in getting similar
academic research work in the future.
```
```
Any action taken by ConAm Minerals LIC is up to the
referee..

Library Data
Planet's divided into two
continents. One polar and
desolate, the other
sparsely populated and
covered with jungles and
thick rainforests. The
deserted eastern side of
the continent holds several
vast, mostly automated
open-cast mines. There are
very high quality
radioactives to be found in
the rock under the seabed,
and a number of deep sea
mining installations have
been developed specifically
to mine them. The
southwestern jungles
support the Jala'Lak; an
indigenous native race.
which is subject to some
controversy. The Jala'Lak
are peaceful and live in
harmony with the jungle.
they are a race of large
simians. The forests they
live in are filled with
temples, apparently to their
various gods and the University of Ushra
maintains a base there in order to better study
this fascinating Neolithic race. The JaLa'lak
can also be found on Giirakh/Zeda 0325 (B86768-C) but for an as yet inexplicable
reason, their temper is vastly different - much
more savage, even cannibalistic. Clearly they
are not native to Giirakh and consequently are
the subject of much debate.

PHYSIOLOGY



Height & Weight
The average male stands 2.2m high in a semi-erect stance and weighs in at 80.2kg. The

```
average female is slightly shorter at 1.98m but
weighs 85kg. The additional weight is located in
an extra fat layer on the chest.
```
APPEARANCE



```
Jala'Lak are the slow-moving giants of the forest.
They are believed to be descended from
brachiator primates but have adapted to their
Larger size by becoming bipeds. They manipulate
with arm-like appendages but can also grasp hold
with their small, thick prehensile tail. The mouth
in,encased within a hard beak
and the eyes are located at
the front of the face. They do
have external ears but they
are hidden under the head fur.
The entire body is covered in
several layers of thick, curly
fur which varies in colour from
white to a dark grey. The feet
are broad and circular with
five toes while the hands
consist of two fingers and an
opposing thumb and two
striking claws. The sex organs
are retracted in both sexes.
On first impressions the
Jala'Lak of Uaam may look
extremely fierce: but are
normally very passive.
```
DIET



```
Jala'Lak are gatherers and are
classed as omnivorous. Their
normal diet consists of
insects. larvae, vegetation
and roots but are not averse
to fresh raw meat but. will
rarely hunt for it preferring freshly killed carrion.
They are particularly fond of the Jhawa bud
which makes up about 45% of their diet. The tack
of activity of the Jala'Lak is actually an
adaptation to high concentrations of toxic
compounds that are manufactured by the Jhawa
buds as a defence against herbivores. By coupling
minimal activity with a low metabolic rate and an
extremely dense coat they can substantially
reduce their food requirements and consequently
their intake of toxic chemicals. Jala'Lak on
Giirakh or raised in captivity on a different diet
are fast, agile creatures. Research has found that
the Jhawa bud extract can be refined into a
superior quality fast drug. Fortunately the
Government, because of the plant's 'importance

Yetiforme]
```

to the Jala'Lak diet, its relative rarity and
inability to grow under cultivation, has expressly
forbidden harvesting.
Jala'Lak will rarely take tong rests preferring
several short naps spread throughout the day.
The males wilt always sleep at different times so
that one adult male is always awake. The rest of
the clan will usually enter a deep sleep during
the midnight and midday period and are most
likely to be active in the dawn and twilight
periods when they do most of their gathering.

REPRODUCTION



Jala'Lak still retain breeding seasons and females
not currently nursing a pup will enter a receptive
stage lasting 22 Local days every local year. At
this time the female becomes agitated and
extremely active. The anal fur changes to a dark
blue colour as a indication of the females current
readiness. They will endeavor to present
themselves to any adult male at every
opportunity and are extremely promiscuous.
Males are strongly attracted to the females
behaviour and anal fur colour change and will
line up patiently waiting their turn in the mating
queue. Even strangers can join as Long as they
leave the clan's territory immediately afterwards.
It should be noted that the
males are not particularly
fertile and as such the
female will only become
pregnant occasionally despite
its promiscuous behaviour
during the entire period.
Fertilised females will
generally only have a single
pup after a gestation period
of 300 local days. For the first two years of its life
the pup is totally defenceless and remains both
blind and deaf. It will remain with the mother
being nursed for a total period of five years. The
onset of milk production also releases an pseudo-oestrogene-like compound into the body that
delays the onset of the female season. Fit five the
mother will wean the pup and the protoVoestrogen
enzyme will stop production so that the female
will once more become liable for seasons.

Jala'Lak have frontal, binocular vision. They have
a light-reflecting layer at the rear of the eye
called the tapetum lucidum which increases visual
acuity by reflecting weak incoming Light back onto
the retina enabling the Jala'Lak to utilise every
scrap of light that enters their eyes. This
adaptation has meant that they are colour blind.
Their hearing is excellent and they are capable of
hearing much higher pitch that humans, up to
65,000 cycles per second in comparison to the
human maximum of 20,000 cycles. They have an
extremely poor sense of smell but they have
compensated for this by very sensitive taste buds
on the tongue. For this reason Jala'Lak will

```
generally put strange items into their beaks in
order to “taste” their scent.
```
ANATOMY



```
Jala'Lak are vertebrate mammalian primates.
Originally using all four limbs for movement.
through the trees they have increased in size and
become bipeds. They have adapted to the extreme
climate by developing thick curly layers of
insulating fur that allows it to stay warm during
the bitter winters by trapping several pockets of
warm air between the layers, in addition, their
blood contains an anti-clotting agent that acts
Like an antifreeze preventing both blood and
organs from freezing up. This same fluid is also
excreted through the tear ducts protecting the
eyes. In summer the fur flattens and acts as a
mere coat. The brain, like most mammals and
pseudo-mammals is cased within the head cavity.
The mouth and nasal organs are housed within a
beak formed of calcified nail which protects the
organs from damage. The jaw is mostly adapted to
the vegetarian diet with sharp cutting teeth to the
front and grinding teeth to the rear with the
exception of two large canines in the males. These
canines are only bared during territorial disputes
or to tear at carrion which is then chewed to
soften it before regurgitating
it for consumption by the
females and pups. The
prehensile tail has shortened
and thickened to act as a
counterweight to assist with
bipedal mobility but still
retains its prehensile ability
with over 300 bones and
many powerful muscles
housed there. The leg joints bend backwards and
end in circular, padded feet with five toes, three
to the front and two to the rear. The broad,
circular pads allow the Jala'Lak to safety navigate
the many marshes that exist within the jungles.
When running they adopt a digitgrade gait,
running on the toes rather than the full foot. The
hands also contain five digits but two of them
have regressed and calcified into mobile claws
which are usually folded against the wrist. The
other three are extremely flexible with one
forming an opposing thumb to allow 3 powerful
grip. They are not very dexterous and small or
delicate manipulation i5 beyond their abilities.
```
CULTURE



```
History: Archaeologists believe the Jala'Lak are
descended from a common ancestor with the
dwarf Hala'aak since it is the only other known
arboreal species on Uaam with a prehensile tail.
Unfortunately due to the carnivorous nature of
most of Uaam fauna there are no known fossil
deposits containing the remains of mammals until
```

relatively recent times. They apparently
developed sentience about 200.000 years ago as
the forests of the North died and
forced the pre-Jala'Lak to flee
southwards. There they found a
comfortable niche at the top of the
food chain and stopped evolving.
Recent studies seem to point towards
the Jala'Lak addiction for the Jhawa
bud which seems to cause a mild
euphoria as a possible cause. They have
never evolved any culture beyond small packs and
their highest evolutionary achievements has been
the ability to produce crude stone tools and to
make fire using flint chippings. The Jala'Lak were
discovered several centuries after Uaam was
colonised and given their relatively small numbers
and near extinct nature permission was given for
the colony to remain.

Social Structures
The Jala'Lak live in small family clans consisting of
3 adult: males, 9 - 12 females and about 6 pups.
They are territorially nomadic moving around
within a 50km area that the females mark out with
their urine. They dwelt in weaved huts made from
dead branches which they refurbish once they
return to that particular area. The Jala'Lak of
Uaam are extremely passive, avoiding fights at all,
costs.

Territorial disputes are settled by displays of
aggression rather than
aggression itself and
consist of the males
displaying their canines and
striking claws. They are a
shy yet inquisitive race
much given to mimicry.
They appear to have
primitive rites which
center around the 250+
“temples” spread
throughout the forest. In
fact out of 342 known
words in their vocabulary it
is believed that over 124
make reference to these
rites. These temples are perhaps the greatest
mystery of the race - each is identical: two 0.5
tonne Myer stone pillars from the Northern Atlas
mountain range 2,500km distant are set at a slant
facing inwards, exactly 5.32m apart. A single 1
tonne blue stone pillar is set in the middle of the
mound in an upright position. The two Myer pillars
have been cut into a rectangular shape with the
central pillar tapering slightly towards the top.
Incisions have been carved into the inner faces of
the Myer pillars of three intersecting circles.
These _temples_ can also be found on among the
Giirakh Jala'Lak where local stones from a
mountain range 560km distant were used. How the
race were able to Vtransport the stones such a
distance, how they _measured_ the settings, how the

```
incisions were made and why are still mysteries. A
basic translation of their Language has discovered
that the race identifies the temples
with an entity best translated as the
“God-Creature”. There is also the
mystery of how such a primitive race
was transported to another planet
many subsectors away. Both sub-races
practice a form of crisis monotheism
centred on the temples. Intensive
LanSat searches of both planets have
revealed no signs of any other settlements,
advanced technology or manipulation by the
ancients. The Giirakh Jala'Lak have developed
differently from the homeworld race; they are
fast and agile, are extremely savage and feral
with cannibalistic tendencies. All attempts to
contact the Giirakh tribes to date have met with
extreme hostility, in addition the race has begun
to adapt to the longer summers and milder
winters by shedding several layers of fur. They
have also exhibited a tendency to decorate their
head fur with small twigs and bones. Some tribes
also dye the fur of their paws a deep purple or
red. Archaeologists believe that the race has
only been on Giirakh for about 3 to 4,000 years
at most. How they arrived there and why remain
a total mystery.
```
```
Locality
Jala'Lak could not normally survive the bitter
weather of Uaam were it not for the many hot
springs found throughout
the forest that raise the
temperature of their
natural habitat above
freezing most of the year
round. That, coupled with
the heat reflecting quality
of the dense forest
vegetation, prevents any
of the heat from being lost
and in addition protects
against the long bitter
winds that further reduce

Duchy Capital: Argi

Argi subsector is an important industrial center, and communications link - the Dagudashaag
Main covers the trailward half of the region, and the waystation at Lenashuuk/Argi handles a
great deal of traffic between Dagudashaag and Zarushagar. All of the more highly-populated sys-tems in the trailward region were settled during the rule of the First Imperium. The Dagudashaag
Main, having been heavily settled for such a long time, is a technologically-advanced region -
most of the systems between Gateway/Argi and Durgaruur/Sapphyre are at or above TL13.

The coreward tip of the Nimluin cluster, part of which part of in Argi subsector, is a rich agri-cultural region.

**Abbayi 0936 C682343-8 Lo Ni 804 Im K2 V M0 D**

A cold, dismal world with a mean surface
temperature of -74ºC and a gravity of 0.69g. Some
heat is provided by the several active volcanoes in
the habitable zone. Abbayi is primarily a mined-out
world. The planet's currently best known for it's
settlement by several religions including the
Scanians, Vargr Church of the Chosen Ones, The
Church of the Stellar Divinity and the Khaarkhi Cult
who have established a center for religious discussion
on the planet.

**Adakhem 1134 C434214-D Lo Ni 103 Im M5 V**

The history of Adakhem is one of a rich Lanthanum
strike back in the First Imperium. Then the Long
Night struck and the miners found themselves
stranded. Slowly they adapted to their new home
and when the Aakhri Empire conquered them they
had reverted to a tribal Tech 1 culture. They were
enslaved and brutally exploited. With the collapse of
the Empire the Adakhemians
placed severe restrictions on
visitors to the planet. It is only
in the last 300 years that the
deep lanthanum mines were
rediscovered but the
Adakhemians refused to allow
exploitation. Then in 787 all
contact with Adakhem stopped
and visitors to the planet
discovered only the dead bodies
of the weak and elderly. Of the
younger tribesmen nothing is
known. The current theory is
that the original settlers had been dying out due to
inbreeding and the younger tribesmen decided to
journey into the mountain regions to search for
other tribes. Extensive searches have revealed no
clues to account for their sudden disappearance and
within the last hundred years the planet has been
sold to SUSAG who are currently strip-mining the
lanthanum.

**Aiish 1535 C201458-E S Ni Va Ic 604 Im K3 V**

A Gas giant satellite, the planet is controlled by the
Technocratic “Rulers of the Eye” who govern the city

```
```
Conditions on this world are both harsh and baffling.
The planet as a whole appears to have been distorted
into an ellipsoidal shape in the geologically recent
past. What is more puzzling Is that there is no nearby
moon or gas giant which could have caused the
distortion, and there is no
```
```
indication of a recent impact on the surface. The
planetary crust has been shattered, and measurements
indicate cataclysmic tremors on the surface as the planet
“relaxes” to a spherical shape through its own self-gravity.
Orbital surveys also show unusual density anomalies.
```
```
Since the system is In a little-travelled side branch of the
Dagudashaag Main, it is only since the mid-700's that the
IISS has made any significant effort to investigate the
planet. The Scouts also provide technical support (in a
somewhat half-hearted fashion) to the several Droyne
oytripin present insystem. Some of the Droyne research
the planet, whilst others undertake small-scale mining
insystem. The IISS have only lust begun to realise the
significance of the system. An expedition to the planet's
surface in 1112 made an astonishing discovery - an array of
“cables” some 1700 km long, buried in the planetary crust
at a depth of about 4m. The cables are composed of
monadium, the same material as was found at the Ancient

Aquan's are Scanians that have been fully adapted for
amphibious living in oxygen-bearing oceans. They are
descended from an early geneering experiment carried out
before -1,793 and are considered by many almost a
separate race. The Aquan is able to breathe on the surface
as well as underwater but the adaptions resulted in a loss
of speech. To compensate, the Aquans have evolved a

```
Gas Giant satellite, Argi has been extensively
colonised with vast underground city complexes (known as Pellucidar). The planet was originally
colonised by Vilani nobles during the First Imperium
and retained much of their technology during the
Long Night. This evolved into the Aakhri Empire
which perverted the Vilani caste system into a slave-based republic. The Empire used its technology to
```

enslave much of Argi and Sapphyre subsectors. Over
the centuries they became dependent on their slaves
for every aspect of their life, including military
service. At the time of their collapse the planetary
population was composed mainly of slaves ruled over
by a small, decedent master class. The revolt when
it occurred was quick and bloody. The surviving
Aakhri families were forbidden to ever again hold
property or position. Most Argian's are descendants
of the freed slaves and the few remaining Aakhrian's
are only to be found in menial positions or acting as
“Servicians” - prostitutes. Aakhrian's can only leave
Argi if they supply a MCr.1 bond to “re-pay” the
Argian people for their historical suffering. Most
Argian's (except Aakhrian's) wear silver torcs
encoded with their clan, occupation and status using
an eight band colour code, as a reminder of their
origins. Argi is the largest manufacturer of technical
equipment within the sector.

**Arlu 1339 AA8A520-D N Ni Wa 404 Im M3 V**

A Bwap colony specialising in crystal production.
Most of the cities (pods) are built upon floating
islands of a coral-like substance and a symbiotic
relationship has developed between the Bwap's and
the island ecology. The Bwaps provide fertiliser for
the many plants that grow within the coral and
protection from the large ocean predators that like
the soft coral underside. In return the ecology
supplies food and protection. Each city dweller rubs
itself in the islands sap thereby identifying
themselves to the various natural island defences so
they remain inert while they pass through.

Although each Bwap community is generally classed
as a “Religious Dictatorship”, Arlu has been
classified differently because each city or pod sends
a chosen representative to a common council who
then make all planetary decisions. In addition, the
planetary law level refers to the openly accessible
areas of the planet and not the extremely high law
levels of the pods which are off-limits to any but
those born there.

```
Originally established by Vilani zealots fleeing
religious persecution, the colonists were obviously
influenced by alien artifacts found on planet during
the period of the Long Night. By the time they were
```

re-contacted they have evolved a strong dictatorship
whereby the ruler is a mysterious character chosen by
the people at maturity and then cloistered within the
Pearl Tower at Tralaarwi. The monarch never appears
in public again nor does he leave the Tower.
Audiences are granted from behind a screen of
translucentVpearl behind which sits the ruler. Only his
outline is seen and even his voice is only heard by the
First Prelate who repeats his words for all to hear.
This system was apparently established to allow
decisions to be made on an objective basis and
protects the ruler from both foes and would-be

large granite blocks cut exactly to shape and size so
that not even a needle can be inserted between the

attributed to them right up to present day. The last
major act that could be traced to the Red Eagles,
was the attack on the University of Ushra's surface
base at Shabamiir which resulted in the death of 100
personnel. The Red Eagles claimed this attack was
because Ushra had “sold out” the Solomani ideal.
Red Eagles are also believed to have claimed
responsibility for the death of Duke Raegis Viisarikaa
in 1114. In 1115 a co-ordinated ambush was carried
out on a terrorist base on Sharaa which is believed
to have wiped out the core of the group. Nothing has

protected by a polarised membrane which given
Scanian's the appearance of an overall white eye
apparently devoid of iris or pupil. Membranes in the
ears and nose prevent drowning or pressure
problems. Bones have been altered and muscle
structure increased to cope with high gravity. The
Scanian adaptation is also the ancestor of the Aquan
which developed from Scanian stock. Today the term
Scanian also refers to those who follow the teachings

Planet's divided into two continents. One polar and
desolate, the other sparsely populated and covered
with jungles and thick rainforests. The deserted
eastern side of the continent holds several vast,
mostly automated openVcast mines. There are very
high quality radioactives to be found in the rock
under the seabed, and a number of deep sea mining
installations have been developed specifically to mine
them. The southwestern jungles support the Jala'Lak;
an indigenous native race, which is subject to some
controversy. The Jala'Lak are peaceful and live in
harmony with the jungle, they are a race of large
primates. The forests they live in are fill with
temples, apparently to their various gods and the
University of Ushra maintains a base there in order to
better study this fascinating neolithic race. The
Jala'Lak can also be found on Giirakh/Zeda 0325 (886768-C) but for an as yet inexplicable reason, their
temper is vastly different - much more savage, even
cannibalistic. Clearly they are not native to Giirakh
and consequently are the subject of much debate.

**FOR YOUR EYES ONLY ... REFEREE'S INFORMATION**

**Abbayi:**
In 799 the Scanians established a secret Psionics
Institute on the planet which has continued its
training up to the present day. Only unadapted
Scanian's and Sanhedra Rab'ani who would not be
missed are tested and sent Once trained they return
to their communities and teach the chosen how to
become Sanheichiir.

**Anomaly:**
The Ancient's originally intended to transport
Anomaly via Jumpspace to the Medurma/Pact system,
where it would have formed part of a three world
rosette. The experiments were interrupted by the
Final war and the distortion of the planetary crust
was caused by the “arcing” of jump energy from the
field cables implanted in the crust. TL16 high
penetration densitometer readings have shown a
number of artificial voids at about a 20km depth, but
this information has not been made public.

**Lenashuuk:**
Sector Duke Raegis Viisarikaa IV was assassinated by
agents of Archduke Dulinor of Llelesh, who wished to
destabilise the Sector in preparation for his bid for
the Imperial throne. Karyn Viisarikaa is unaware of
this fact.

**Miir:**
The Gaerkh are not an intelligent species, merely tool
using. Clubs are only used for hunting, not migration.
(Those Gaarkh seen with clubs were on a hunt prior to
attempting their seasonal migration, which leads
them directly through the Scanian/ Bwap cities.) Only
the deep jungle hunters are aware that Gaarkh have
always used clubs, but they have never felt the need
to report it.

**Sanheichiir:**
The Sanheichiir have not died out. In addition to
training on Abbayi there are several selective
breeding programs underway on non-Akivan soil and
in this way a sizeable army has been created.

**Twin Lines:**
The reason that the Imperial Navy never caught on to
the fleets coming and goings is the fact that each of
the ten original ship's were equipped with a black
globe. Currently only three of the ship's have fully
functional devices with another two working
occassionally.

The Rebellion in Argi Subsector 1116 to 1120

This is the first in a series of articles that will seek to
illustrate the ongoing conflict in Dagudashaag sector.
These articles will deal with a single subsector in turn
and will be concentrating on the naval conflicts that
are taking place. Even though a subsector is a rela-tively small area of space, due to the period of time
that is being examined, the individual battles in the
systems will not be discussed in detail. Instead, the
'grand picture' will be under the microscope. So
then, to begin.

1116

The war came early to Argi subsector. This was due to
its close proximity to Ilelish, bastion of Dulinor. With
Bolivar subsector aligning itself with the Archduke,
this put Argi to the front line. Argi subsector is heav-ily industrialized and much of this of high technology.
This makes the subsector a useful conquest. At first
there was a subsector wide crash at the news of the
assassination of Strephon and the expectancy of civil
war. This ended in the wake of the news that the
Duchess Karyn intended to keep Dagudashaag out of
the war. Unfortunately for Argi Dulinor and Lucan did-n't hear, or didn't want to hear, Karyn's message.
The first battle involving the Argi fleet (the 159th)
took place on 259-1116 in Arlu (1339) against the 83rd
fleet, which had declared for Dulinor. This fleet was
bound for Lenashuuk, a high population world that
also served as a communication nexus. The 83rd
brushed aside the few squadrons deployed at Arlu and
arrived at Lenashuuk, where covert forces had al-ready captured the way station. Two major battles
later on 299, the 83rd fleet had been beaten off after
expected reinforcements had failed to arrive and they
had been outnumbered by the combined 169th and
1817th reserve fleets under Admiral Beth Hiirinanan.
The remainder of the year was spent in skirmishes at
the spinward subsector boundary. Thus the year had
ended on a high note for the Argi fleets. They had
seen battle for the first time in nearly 1000 years and
had won. However, the Loyal Fleet
was being mustered as the last message from the 83rd
fleet at Lenashuuk served as a reminder: “We'll be
back.”

1117

The Loyal Fleet entered Dagudashaag on 009-1117
and after picking up the remnants of the 83rd, were
soon on their way into Argi. They first attacked at
Akiva, where Hiirinanan had mustered the main
strength of her forces. Against the huge forces ar-rayed against her, it was only through her deft skill

```
that the military base on Akiva and the majority of
her forces escaped. With the magazines of Akiva
empty, Dulinor's forces had to wait to bring up suffi-cient supplies. In the interim, Hiirinanan based her
forces at Rashiki. Additional time was lost by Duli-nor's fleet trying to fight the Scanian's on a fierce
water world with excessive gravity. So successfully
were the Scanian attacks that within a year Dulinor
had agreed to a treaty allowing the Scanian people
self government in return for neutrality. He gained
Naval bases but the planets of Akiva and Gateway
were allowed to remain unaligned.
```
```
A second Ilelish attack was launched on 060, and this
was intended to strike at the Ikabi/Enkugush cluster
in Pact subsector. Hiirinanan fought this behemoth as
best she could, but she was always giving ground and
could expect little better with no reinforcements
available. By 110, Hiirinanan had been forced to pull
back to the Gateway corridor to protect Argi's popu-lation. Ilelish forces then rapidly broke through to
Sapphyre subsector on 145. The only resistance en-countered in this drive was at Lenashuuk from the
balkanized world's national fleets. The Loyal Fleet
rear echelon continued a coreward/trailing offensive
in an attempt to give the front line forces engaging
in Pact subsector bases from which to operate. How-ever, by the year's end, the key bases of the Gate-way system, Argi and Gigi had not fallen, despite
much effort and high casualties on both sides. This
failure certainly hampered the Loyal Fleet's efforts
against Medurman and Lucan forces in the battles to
secure Ikabi.
```
```
The year had seen a massive reversal in fortunes for
Argi. The massed Ilelish forces had removed the
early optimizm. Several worlds were now under di-rect Ilelish rule, and many others had sworn alle-giance and neutrality in the conflict rather than be
'persuaded' by the Loyal Fleet.
```
```
1118
```
```
1118 started much the way of 1117 finished off. The
Loyal Fleet continued their advance towards Pact
subsector. Gradually Gateway, Argi, Gigi and the
other remaining worlds in Argi subsector that were
members of the Free Medurman Federation (FMF)
were taken by Dulinor. Little of the 159th and
1817th fleets remained. Some fled to Pact, but some
remained In Argi under the command of Hiirinanan
to act as raiders against Dulinor and as a contact
group for those worlds that were covert members of
the FMF. This force remained in action until mid-1120 when FMF forces, in the wake of the successful
Lucan offensive, reclaimed many of the worlds in
Argi for Medurma.
```
## WAR ZONE: ARGIWAR ZONE: ARGIWAR ZONE: ARGIWAR ZONE: ARGI

At the end of 1118, Argi was under the yoke of Ilel-ish. Fortunately, unlike the rule of Lucan, the Ilelish
occupation forces were under orders to treat the
population well, so the acts of barbarism so often
seen to trailing were very rare. Also, the free rem-nants of the 159th were available to offer relief, and
much effort was spent, and wasted, by Ilelish forces
to track them down.

1119

Apart from Hiirinanan's fleet and other small raiding
and privateering forces, Argi saw little conflict. The
exception to this was the Gateway system. Gateway
was a stop off for Dulinor's forces as they fled from
the slugfest that had smashed the main element of
the Loyal Fleet in Pact and The Remnants. Gateway
saw several rear action and counter attacks as Ilelish
forces sought to regroup to spinward. Although Duli-nor respected his neutrality policy with the
Scanian's, Lucan did not. In fact, he was so sure that
the policy was a trick to allow Dulinor to maintain a
secret base that he ordered a nuclear strike but for
some unexplained reason the ship exploded before it
could carry out its grim task. Fortunately for Dulinor
these rear action battles and the state of the Venge-ance Fleet after previous battles meant that this
regrouping could take place. The fault for this fail-ure by the larger Vengeance Fleet could be laid on
Lucan, who was personally in command of the Impe-rial forces. His lack of knowledge of strategy turned
the war from one of manoeuvre, into one of attri-tion. The Loyal Fleet lost, but the victory was pyr-rhic. In private, many imperial admirals were making
poor comparisons with Terra's first world war (this
was characterised by many pointless attacks that
resulted in huge casualties on both sides). At the
end of 1119, Argi remained in the hands of Dulinor.
However, he was now on the defensive against Lu-can. Already Imperial scouting forces had penetrated
Argi from Sapphyre subsector. Doubtless, this was in
preparation for a major offensive.

1120

The offensive that everybody knew was going to hap-pen happened. Like previous attacks launched by
Lucan, it was characterised by its complete lack of
strategic knowledge. Firstly it was launched against
Dulinor's salient, the spinward. Secondly, no sub-tlety at all was employed. Tabloid editors with re-corded IQ's of under 80 successfully predicted Lu-can's targets. Successes came, but only through su-perior numbers and at huge cost. In addition to these
tactics (or rather the lack of them), Lucan was willing
to accept victory at any cost. Many worlds that were
regarded to difficult to take or defend had already
been devastated by the Vengeance Fleet. In Argi sev-eral worlds were devastated by nuclear missiles: Shu-lasgu, Mishu, Liishuga, Shidka and Ashmara were
among those worlds to be so attacked. This combina-tion of planetary destruction and attrition warfare

```
forced back Dulinor's fleet until the only world in Argi
that could be described as loyal was Uaam. Only a
few worlds in Argi were actually occupied by Lucan
for use as supply points for his fleets. Those remain-ing worlds became reconnected with the FMF. Impe-rial admirals were happy to let this happen, as FMF
forces assisting ravaged worlds could not attack Impe-rial forces elsewhere. However, it did give the Free
Medurman Navy (FMN) many potential bases from
which to strike. Argi is again in the front line. Lucan's
concept of warfare virtually ensures that this will re-main so as his diminished fleets combat Dulinor's
equally reduced units. Both sides are heading for ex-haustion. Indeed, in Dagudashaag, the next few years
of the rebellion would see the front line advance by
only 10 parsecs. Argi will remain the battle ground for
what remains of the largest fleets in existence since
the interstellar wars. What lies in the future? Cer-tainly it will be a long time before it returns to its
position of the industrial heart to the Imperium.

Subject: First Thoughts on Dagudashaag

Sector (Revision V.2.1) By J Duncan Law-Green

This document is being prepared as a counterpart to
David Lai's work 'Gushemege - Random Notes and
Questions'. Acknowledgements to Clayton R. Bush and
Karl Gaarsoe for additional information and feedback.

How much do we know? What do we know about
Dagudashaag Sector? Hardly anything at all, which, on
the face of it would tend to make my job as a Sector
Analyst easier, since I'm starting from a clean sheet,
and all that. However, a few things do spring to mind:-

1) This sector would originally have been settled by
Vilani during the rule of the Grand Empire of Stars, at
about -8,300. This is given by the timeline in Imperial
Encyclopaedia, plus the information given in
'Gushemege - Random Notes and Questions (GRN)'.
Settlement of this sector could have been delayed
somewhat by the fact that it is isolated from the Wand
Main, the Jump-1 route which passes through much of
Vland and Gushemege sectors (see “Astrography”
later).

2) The sector would, to some extent, have been
influenced by the Loeskalth civilisation, which
acquired Jump technology at about -6,000. This
assumes that the Loeskalth were located in subsector D
of Gushemege, adjoining Dagudashaag (see GRN page
3). If this is indeed the case, then the Loeskalth would
probably have had some significant impact on the
coreward-spinward portion of Dagudashaag between
about -5,500 and -4,100. Just how much impact is a
question which is worth further consideration.

3) The sector, like neighbouring Gushemege, was
extensively affected, by the Vilani Pacification
Campaign (76-120), in which the various petty states
which had arisen in this region were subdued, and
incorporated into the expanding Third Imperium. In all,
eight subsectors were affected [inside front - cover].

4) Subsector A of Dagudashaag sector falls within the
boundaries of the Lancian Cultural Region. (For a fuller
discussion of Lancian culture, see the document 'What
is the Lancian Culture?' by David Lai).

5) There appear to be no general discussions of
Dagudashaag in the Traveller literature, but one
specific piece is worth reading; the account of the
blockade of Duumur (2529 Dagudashaag C5299BB-E) by
Lucan's forces (Rebellion Sourcebook, p.24).

Astrography

```
Following the format of GRN, we now examine the
sector map of Dagudashaag in Atlas of Imperium
```
```
1) There is one, moderately extensive Jump-1 main in
the sector' the “Medurma Main”, which runs from 0412
to coreward/spinward to 2440 to rimward/trailward. It
covers subsectors E, F, I, J, K, L, N and O. The
remainder of the sector appears to be broken up into
relatively small clusters. The only other astrographical
formation of note is the Eraki “mini-Vmain” in
subsectors G, H and L.
```
```
This is an extension of the Sylea ( or [[Capital]] ) Main,
which covers much of [[Core sector]] . Eraki could
therefore represent the Third Imperium's first point of
contact in Dagudashaag Sector. This system would have
become very prosperous as a trade gateway with
Dagudashaag Sector. The systems of Mimu, Akimu,
Upag, Unishpiir, Zuiar, and Bolivar lie on the Vland
Main. This jump-1 route represents the first point of
entry by Vilani scouts into the sector.
```
```
It should be noted that the interior of this sector is
isolated (from Jump-1 travel, at least) from Vland and
Gushemege sectors.
```
```
2) There are no class-X starports in this sector (at
least, I couldn't find any). Conclusion: the Mature
system generation table (Referee's Manual, p.24) was
used to generate this sector. An interesting aside,
according to this criterion, the following sectors are
mature: Vland, Lishun, Dagudashaag, Core, Ilelish,
Zarushagar and Massilia. This astrographical region may
represent the core of the First Imperium.
```
```
This would suggest that the sector has had a very long
and civilised history - all of the alien minor races in
this sector have been contacted by the I.I.S.S. and
assimilated into Imperial culture. It seems that there
are few wildernesses remaining in Dagudashaag.
```
```
3) There is, of course, the small matter of how we
actually spell the name of this sector - GDW is
inconsistent on this (compare Atlas and RS), so for the
sake of consistency, I have, and will continue to spell
it with a double-a (Dagudashaag).
```
```
4) The sector capital, Medurma (Dagudashaag 2124)
appears to have been slightly misplaced by Rebellion
Sourcebook - RS places it in subsector O when it is in
fact in subsectorK (who drew these maps anyway? ).
One notable effect of this is to place Medurma outside
the area of major battles or clashes in 1117 shown by
Rebellion Sourcebook. My guess is that Lucan manages (or at least tries) to use Medurma as a supply base and
stronghold from which to launch his assaults on
```

Dulinor. There would be a very significant force
concentration of Lucan's ships in this area, but his
strategy appears to suffer some setback, judging by
the way the borders look in 1118. Additional
information: See HIWG Pub 032.02, “Oh No, Not
Again!” The situation I have postulated, is that Lucan's
forces initially try to launch a direct assault on the
Medurma region, but because of Ilelish thrusts in the
Argi and Ushra subsectors, and increasing opposition
from Dagudashaag fleet fragments congregating in that
region, the attack is “wrongfooted”. The Imperial
forces retreat to a rather less satisfactory base
immediately to trailing.

A number of months later, another assault on Medurma
is launched, under the direct initiative of Emperor
Lucan himself. An
invasion force achieves
a foothold on the
planet, after a fake
diplomatic mission to
the Sector Duchess.
Although great progress
is made in the first few
weeks by the ground
troops (leading Admiral
Wainfrost to state that
“the planet is securely
under our control”),
local conditions, the
planetary tech level of
16, and stiffening
opposition from native
forces and the
population turn the
tide. Within a matter
of a few weeks, the
invasion force has been
“mopped up”, and
Imperial squadrons
forced to retreat to the
outer margins of the
system. Medurma (and
later Dipa) remain
independent until
further notice!
Whether Lucan blames
this defeat on
Wainfrost, and strips him of his Starburst remains to be
seen...

5) Looking at the Atlas maps, there appear to be
concentrations of Imperial Scout bases in subsector I (just to spinward of the Zeda system, Dagudashaag
0721), and subsectorN (around 1538). There is also a
fair-sized cluster of Naval bases in subsector L, in the
region between Khusgulur (2525) and Shea (2927),
specifically, at 2725, 2727, 2526, 2827 and 2828. This
grouping could well be related, by its proximity, to
Depot/Dagudashaag (3121 A310244-D).

6) The best-quality (type A & B) starports seem to be
reasonably randomly distributed, although there is a
fair cluster of A's around Eraki and Depot. I envisage

```
this Eraki region as being a high-tech industrial
grouping (possibly a TL16 world here – we'll just have
to wait for Second Survey until we can find out). The
region between 1821 and Medurma is also well-developed - this may be one of the older centres of
civilisation in the sector.
```
```
7) The place names in this sector are predominantly
Vilani, perhaps to a greater extent than in Viand sector
itself!) - this fits well with its long history. It seems to
me that most of the Hi Pop worlds lie in a band running
from coreward/spinward to rimward/trailward. This
may well represent the original course of the
colonisation wave from Vland, branching off from the
Vland Main as it enters Gushemege. Second Survey may
show this 'band' as being a major trade route. The
map of the Fist
Imperium in Travellers
Digest #5 shows a
diagonal “mixed
control” passageway in
this area. Could this
have been the
Anshulam Bilanidin, the
original “Imperial
Starlane”? Bolivar (Dagudashaag 0240) is
a Solomani name with
interesting
possibilities. Only wish
I knew more Solomani
history...
```
```
8) The “Droyne” Alien
Module shows a Droyne
colony world in
subsector N. The first
draft of the Second
Survey data lists it as:
1633 C9E7366-C S LO NI
FL DR G


```
```
The temptation to call
this an important
Ancient site is almost
too strong to resist! It
certainly is an
interesting place! For
further information, see David Lai's document, “The
Droyne and the Rebellion”.
```
Background Notes

```
That concludes the overview of the published
information on Dagudashaag Sector. Now comes the
difficult part - piecing the info together jigsaw fashion (personally, I always start at the corners..!).
```
```
Firstly, my feeling is that Dagudashaag has a very long
history - a history of which it can be justifiably proud.
I'd really like to give the sector some kind of culture
prior to the Vilani colonization wave at about -8,600.
To this end, I've come up with the S'mrii (pronounced
```

```
roughly as “Smurree”), an intelligent minor race of
hexapedal reptiles native to Mimu (Dagudashaag 0208).
The S'mrii are naturally long-Vlived (around 260
standard years), and consequently take a rather
conservative view of life. Their technological
development as a race was unusually slow, and was
slowed still further as a result of a holocaust suffered
26 millennia ago. This holocaust had a shattering
effect on the S'mrii collective psyche - the race is
generally held by neighbouring humans to be pacifistic.
They will, however, fight fiercely in their own defence
```
- this was proved conclusively in the Rebellion (and to
a much lesser extent, in the Vilani Pacification
Campaign).

```
A recurring theme in S'mrii literature is
“Kakh'*chiatkr”, broadly translated as “what might
have been”. A significant number of influential S'mrii
regard their race as being of almost major status - if
only their Holocaust had not occurred, then they would
have developed J-Drive millennia before the first Vilani
experiments. Humans regard this attitude with
amusement at best, and prejudice at worst. It took the
S'mrii many painful millennia to recover their previous
TL of 6, but by about -13,000 they regained the
technology of spaceflight.
```
```
[In fact one of the oldest, non-Ancient manufactured
articles still in reasonably functional condition is a
S'mrii TL6 planetary resources satellite. c. -25,920,
```
```
now on dry display at the Museum of Sector History,
Meduma/Dagudashaag].
```
```
Sublight interstellar vessels were developed a number
of centuries later, and the S'mrii set about colonising
the surrounding systems in their typically slow and
methodical manner. The S'mrii were in fact the first to
contact the Loeskalth, around a thousand years before
the Vilani arrived on the scene - but the unfortunate
S'mrii colonists were wiped out, by the belligerent
Loeskalth, and by human viral strains to which they
then had no immunity. Loeskalth/S'mrii relations were
never better than frosty as a result of that first
contact.
```
```
The S'mrii ConSentiency falls within the borders of the
Lancian Cultural Region, and it seems likely to me that
the Lancian culture has been “coloured” to some
extent by their alien way of thinking. Obviously, this
needs further development in another document, but I
envision that neurotechnology (NAS sensors, psi shield
helmets, neurocouplers) is a S'mrii speciality - see
“What is the Lancian Culture?”, page 3.

The S'mrii would best be described as “neoV
sophontists”, and this explains why the ConSentiency (covering a sizeable chunk of subsector A), sides on
bloc with the “Real” Strephon in 1113. For additional
information, see the HIWG Pub “Contact: The S'mrii”.

Finally here are a few additions to the timeline presented in GRN:-
```
c. -1.6 million S'mrii evolve to intelligence on Mimu (Dagudashaag 0208 )
c. -26,000 S'mrii progress to TL6. Primitive spaceflight.
-25,790 “Day of Dying” - global nuclear war triggers nuclear winter, and new dark ages.
c. -13.000 S'mrii again reach TL6.
-12,500 S'mrii colonise other planets in own system.
-12,050 Sublight ships launched to neighbouring star systems,

Union. Other petty states join in the fray.
75 The Imperium steps in “to protect its interests”. Vilani Pacification Campaign

698 Jan Viisarikaa I becomes Sector Duke.

sector now is it? The cluster of Scout bases around
Zeda (Dagudashaag 0721), suggested the idea of an
interesting human minor race, the Ziadd. I feel a case
of Grand Census coming on...

The Duke of Ushra: Rebellion Sourcebook p.50 states
that “The most visible leader of the Brothers of Varian
is Duke Simalr of Ushra. Shortly after being placed
under arrest on his estates on Capital, he fled. No
specific leader controls the Varian faction.

Q 1) Is this Ushra the same Ushra Dagudashaag 1016?
Q 2) If so, does the Duke flee towards his home
system? Unlikely, I would have thought.
Q 3) Is there any significant strength of feeling for the
Varian faction in this region?
Q 4) Would the Varian faction establish a base of
operations here? There must be better places.
Q5) Would the Varian faction actually have such a
thing as a base Of operations?

Well, now I've gone to the trouble of asking these
questions, I'll provide a few of the thoughts I've had
about them!

1) Well, it's a choice between Dagudashaag 1016 and
Core 1016 (How's that for a coincidence!). The Ushra
in Dagudashaag seems to be a more important place,
so that's the one I would choose.

2) It is at least possible that the Duke flees towards
Dagudashaag - he may not head for Ushra itself;
indeed, he may have holdings elsewhere in the sector.

3) There would be popular support for the Duke in his
home subsector. He may be able to use this to his
advantage...

4)/5) The Brothers of Varian would, by their nature,
tend to avoid such things as established bases of
operations. However, alliances between the Brothers,
and other organisations in Dagudashaag with similar
aims are at least possible (and certainly desirable), so
how would these organisations establish points of
contact with the Brothers?

The Sector Duchess of Dagudashaag: (See previous
section on Medurma.) A possible explanation for
Lucan's failure to secure Medurma as a stronghold and
supply base against Dulinor, could be a massive civil
rebellion against Lucan's forces, following the removal
of the highly popular Sector Duchess, Karyn Viisarikaa,
when she refused to sanction what Lucan was doing to
her sector. That is, Karyn is abducted by Office of
Internal Security (OIS) personnel during the confusion
of the ground invasion of Medurma I envision her
subsequent escape from Lucan's clutches, with the
help of the S'mrii, to re-emerge later in the Rebellion.

For additional information, see the HIWG Pub
“Personality: Karyn Dea Viisarikaa”.

Planned Documents on Dagudashaag

```
i) Thoughts on Dagudashaag. This document will take
the draft Sector Survey data for the sector and
attempt to pick out any consistent patterns on a
subsector and sector-wide scale. In addition, it will
pick out certain systems, and develop general library
data suggestions for them. This will lead (hopefully) to
a number of other documents:
```
```
ii) Dagudashaag: An Astrographical Analysis.
```
```
iii) Library Data of Dagudashaag.
```
```
iv ) History of Dagudashaag.
```
```
Subject: Thoughts on Dagudashaag Sector 2:
To: Ed Edwards, Chairsophont
David Lai: Vland Domain Analyst, HIWG(UK) Chief
This document will hopefully fulfil a variety of aims.
```
```
Firstly, it is a catch-all, intended to deal with some of
the points l failed to address in “First Thoughts”.
Secondly, since the “Second Survey” data for the
sector has now been released in draft form, the
document will examine that data and attempt to pick
out any consistent patterns on a subsector-wide and
sector-wide scale. Thirdly, it will pick out certain
systems, and develop general library data suggestions
for them.
```
```
Most of the comments made in this document will be
broad, sweeping generalisations. It's my feeling that
it's better to develop an outline of the whole sector in
very broad terms, before addressing specific points.
Besides, it's easier to charge later if it turns out to be
blatantly wrong..!
```
Miscellany

```
1) DAGUDASHAAG (dah-guh-dah-SHARG) is a corruption
and contraction of the Old High Vilani Dakhukuga
Gulike Dushaage which means “Rimward Galactic
Province”. This term refers to the sector's
astrographical position, relative to Vland.
```
```
The first recorded usage of “Da'Gu'Dushaage” is in
documentation relating to the formation of a life V
support systems company on Unishpiir (0311), at about
-7,710.
```
```
2) Supplement to the information contained in “First
Thoughts”, p.5, Duke Simalr of Ushra is a native of
Dagudashaag. A personality article will follow when
time permits.

Too Ten TPI's:
The Traveller Power Index system allows a relatively
quick determination of the relative economic and
political influence of systems within a particular area.
To that end, I have compiled a list of the ten highest
Traveller Power Indices in Dagudashaag Sector.
```

System TPI Comments

1 Argi (1431) 11,200 Duchy Capital
2= Medurma (2124) 11,088 Sector Capital
2= Ushra (1016) 11,088 Duchy Capital
4 Bolivar (0240) 10,080 Duchy Capital
5= Iiradu (3008) 9,600 Duchy Capital
5= Khandi (2119) 9,600 Duchy Capital

10 Uumirsa (3032) 7,560 Duchy Capital

The implications of these TPI values will be discussed
later in this
document. It should
be noted, however,
that the nature of
Argi's political
structure must be
considered carefully,
because of the wide V
ranging implications
this has on the
politics and
economics of the
sector as a whole.

Sector

Astrography

The “physical
astrography” (that is,
the positions of
systems) of
Dagudashaag Sector
has already been
discussed in some
detail in “'First
Thoughts”'. This
discussion was
primarily based on
the sector map in
Atlas of the
Imperium.

With the availability of Second Survey data, it becomes
possible to discuss the “economic and political
astrography” of the systems of Dagudashaag. Below is
a list of thematic sector maps, which I have, or will be
intending to prepare, and which I consider instructive.

i) A colour-coded map showing worlds with tech levels
13 and above.

ii) A map highlighting worlds with type-A starports.

iii) An “agrocombine map”. This involves plotting the
agricultural worlds of the sector, and then linking
them by Jump-3 (and occasionally Jump-4) routes to
the nearest Hi population worlds. “Zones of influence”

```
are then drawn around the nearest agricultural worlds
to a particular Hi Pop world. I would envisage that
these “zones of influence” correspond to
agrocombines, or trading associations intended to aid
the flow of agroproducts from producer to market.
iv) A map showing the links between Poor Worlds, Rich
worlds, and Industrial worlds.
```
Sector Description by Subsector

```
Subsector A: MIMU (ConSentiency Trailward)
Duchy [[Capital]] - Mimu (0208 A583AC9-F)
```
```
Mimu subsector is
heavily agricultural (there are seven
agricultural worlds in
the subsector). The
five major
agrocombines in the
Coreward-Spinward
region (Akimu, Zuiar,
Mimu, Upag and
Unishpiir) export raw
and processed
foodstuffs to
surrounding regions in
Corridor, Vland and
Gushemege.
```
```
The subsector is now
dominated by the
S'mrii ConSentiency,
an economic union
covering Dagudashaag
A, and parts of
Gushemege D, which
had its roots in the
autonomous state
formed by the S'mrii
at the beginning of
the Long Night.
```
```
The S'mrii of Mimu (0208) had already
created a thriving interstellar state of almost a dozen
star systems, linked by efficient sublight ships by about
-11,000, First contact with the Vilani took place in
3,090, at a Naarsirka prospecting case on Karrana'ch (0302).
```
```
The majority of the systems in this subsector lie on the
Vland Jump-1 Main.
```
```
0108 Zukchurukh C582867-8 RI IM G
The name for this system can best be translated as
“Navigational Error”. When the first S'mrii sublight
colonisation vessel arrived here in -11,914, one of the
crew quipped that the world was so Mimu-like, that
the ship must have flown round in a circle, and the
name stuck.
```

0208 Mimu A583AC9-F HI IM G
The S'mrii homeworld. For further information, see
“Contact: The S'mrii”.

0803 Chiauk A231557-G NI PO IM G
The S'mrii ConSentiency PanPhylum Research Facility.
Phyla working in different disciplines are able to co-ordinate their efforts, in order to produce new
technological breakthroughs. The ConSentiency
government generates additional income, by allowing
human corporations to use the research facilities, on a
“first come, first served” basis.

U'Chakzii SIA: A major shipbuilding corporation based
on Mimu (0208): U'Chakzii's “trading sphere” covers
more than a sector. One of the corporation's particular
specialties is the high-efficiency fusion rocket - several
models of fast cargo shuttles (capable of at least 12-G)
are produced.

The Fifth Fleet: Imperial Numbered Fleets 1-4 are
based in [[Core sector]] , around [[Capital]]. The Imperial 5th
Fleet is based in Dagudashaag A. Why? It could easily
be argued that the numbering sequence has little
significance, but I feel that the sequence gives rise to
interesting possibilities. Two of these are discussed
below:- The first possibility is that the 5th Fleet was
originally assigned to Dagudashaag A on a “flag-flying”"
exercise during the Kiakh'iee controversy ( see
“Contact: The S'mrii”).

The second possibility is that the 5th Fleet is composed
of elite S'mrii naval forces. The S'mrii ConSentiency
was among the first Dagudashaag states to join the
Third Imperium and would have aided Imperial forces
in the pacification of surrounding areas. Since then, as
Ed Edwards states,
S'mrii have supported the Third Imperium in wars both
foreign and domestic with spacecraft and ground
troops. The prestigious designation of Imperial 5th.
Fleet would be fitting recognition of this.

Additional: Why don't Corridor O & P have a Numbered
Fleet? Which Numbered Fleet has
responsibility for patrolling this area?

Subsector B: OLD SUNS
Duchy [[Capital]] - Kimalad (1506 A7859C8-E)

A technological backwater. Only four systems in the
entire subsector are at or above tech level 13. The
subsector suffered a significant blow in 1062, when the
I.I.S.S. regional headquarters for Dagudashaag were
moved from Kimalad, to Diishalum/Shallows (0714), in
order to improve communications.

1004 A5A4304-F N LO NI FL IM
The site of Aldiss-Vincent Weapons Test Centre, a
major Imperial naval weapons testing and development
facility. The base has a permanent population in
excess of 4,000, and also has shipbuilding and drydock
installations serving the bulk of the Imperial 186th
Fleet.

```
Subsector C: ARNAKHISH
Duchy Capital: Likhukam (2204 8200953-F)
```
```
Heavily Vilani in nature, this subsector was first
colonised by the Ziru Sirka at about -8,490 - the
Palaeotechnological Department of the University of
Mimu has investigated First Imperium sites on 1904 and
2402.
1904 C25359A-C C2 NI PO IM G
This world was the site of a massive “artifact rush” in
967, when rumours spread of a massive find of Ancient
Artifacts at a small Ling-Standard Products titanium
mining installation. The rumours were lent credence
by the fact that the planet has a sizeable population of
Chirpers.
```
```
For some eight or nine months, the areas around the
mines were thronged with those seeking a quick
fortune. The subsector administration eventually
called in the I.I.S.S., and they, together with staff
from the University of Mimu carried out a complete
investigation. To everyone's disappointment, the
artifacts were found to be of First Imperium vintage.
Everyone, that is, except the mine installation's
management, which had happily been selling off 100-meter-square plots of unproductive land at grossly-inflated prices to prospective artefact hunters...
```
```
Since then, the planet has returned to being a sleepy
backwater, with only a trickle of tourists, and
sophontologists doing holo-documentaries about the
Chirpers.
```
```
1910 Sadiikashe E7C48BE-3 FL IM A G
This world is currently in the throes of technological
regression, following a devastating plague in 912.
Sadiikashe no longer has the technology to maintain its
environment systems against the insidious atmosphere,
and according to I.I.S.S. experts, it is only a matter of
time before a major disaster happens. The President of
Sadiikashe has reacted in a typically blinkered fashion,
restricting personal freedoms, in order to minimise the
risk to the remaining life-support systems. Any
technical personnel left on the planet are desperate to
leave.
```
```
The President's actions have also decimated out-system trade, thus causing a crippling economic crisis.
The only thing holding back major civil unrest is the
fear of the consequences, in terms of environmental
collapse. The President's policy is to prey on the
populace's fears, in order to keep them in line.
```
```
The Duke of Arnakhish's lack of positive action in this
crisis has given rise to rumours of corruption, but most
attribute it to sheer incompetence.
```
```
Subsector D: IIRADU, Sector Duchy - Iiradu (3008
A542A9A-F)
```
```
A relatively high-technology subsector (at least,
compared with Old Suns) - there are five systems at
tech level 15. The area is predominantly industrial,
```

and is an agricultural desert, as there are only two
agricultural worlds within the borders of the Duchy.

This subsector is also fairly heavily Vilani in sympathy,
and it is in this region that much of the opposition to
Sector Duchess Karyn Viisarikaa's policies of economic
deregulation has been encountered.

2603 A685202-F LO NI IM G
A personal fief of the Duke of liradu, ceded by the
Viisarikaa family in 727. A terraforming project
conducted by Con-Amalagamated WorldTechnologies of
[[Core sector]]  was pronounced complete in 1031, and
major settlement efforts began the year after.

Subsector E: SHALLOWS, Duchy [[Capital]] - Diishalum (0714 B120988-F)

This area is important from the point of view of
communications, as the most direct link between the
Vland Main and the Medurma Main is the Jump-2 link
between 0412 and Unishpiir (0311). The system of
Diishalum has relatively little influence within the
subsector - the region is effectively overshadowed by
the more powerful areas of Mimu and Ushra. In recent
years, the subsector's economic center of gravity has
shifted to the Upag/Unishpiir region, as these worlds
have prospered under increased trade with the
ConSentiency. The subsector is influenced significantly
by the Zeda cluster, a Jump-1 astrographical formation
immediately to spinward of Zeda/Zeda (0721). The
world of 0619 has a majority population of Ziadd (q.v.)
and several other worlds have sizeable minorities.

0111 Upag A210A76-F HI NA IM G
Among the nations of this world is A'mr, an influential
nation of 1.6 billion S'mrii. A'mr owns one of the four
major orbital starport complexes - billions of credits
worth of agroproducts pass yearly through these port
facilities from the neighbouring worlds of 0109, 0113
and 0212.

0614 B9D5102-E N LO NI FL IM
The orbital starport in this system was originally
established in 699 by a consortium of Dagudashaag
firms, including Hias'deaaq (TransMain Zeda) as an
important refuelling point on the Dagudashaag main.
Almost all activity is concentrated in orbit, because of
hostile surface conditions, and because densitometer
surveys have shown the planet to be commercially
worthless.

In recent years, investment in the system has been
increased (the starport was upgraded to type-B in
878), and warehousing, naval, and shipbuilding
facilities have been added in stationary orbit. As of
1109, the starport has a total population of almost
12,000, working eight to fourteen-month tours of duty.

The “mainworld” itself has an ecosphere, which is both
hostile and scientifically interesting. The world has a
Dense, High atmosphere - the pressure at sea level is
in excess of 70 atmospheres. There is little

```
documented life on the planet, although tantalisingly,
the crude vertebrate forms that do exist, seem to get
more advanced, the deeper one ventures. Several
scientific expeditions (mostly commerciallyV
sponsored) have been undertaken. The most recent of
these, the Hayes-Rydell expedition of 1112, brought
back evidence of extensive crystalline formations on
some coastal plains. These formations only remain
stable under high pressures. and their composition
currently defies analysis.
```
```
The only permanent inhabitants of this system are
small numbers of planetary scientists, and Imperial
Naval researchers working on new equipment for use in
hostile environments.

This world is mostly inhabited by Ziadd, who sought to
escape from the military rule of Zeda/Zeda (0721).
which was instituted in 874. They have established a,
thriving economy based on family/clan firms.
```
```
Subsector F: USHRA
Duchy [[Capital]] - Ushra (1016 A625943-G)
```
```
Individually, the system of Ushra is important having
had a major effect on the political structure of
Dagudashaag since the middle of the Long Night - at its
height (at about -300 to -120) the Ushran Empire
covered two-thirds of the present Duchy plus part of
neighbouring Zeda subsector. The subsector as a whole
is now important, as a communications link between
Medurma and the subsectors of Mimu and Zeda.
```
```
1016 Ushra A625943-G N HI IN IM G
Ushra is the only tech level-16 Industrial world in
Dagudashaag sector, and so occupies an important
position in the sector's economy. Interestingly, the
democratic nature of Ushra's government, has meant
that TL16 technology has reached the general
population far sooner than might otherwise be
expected (the highest levels of technology are often
monopolised by the military in many systems). The
standard of living enjoyed by the population is second
to none.
```
```
Eden Orbital Naval Complex is a large facility devoted
to shipbuilding and repair of naval vessels. A great deal
of development work is done at the complex, directed
towards the production of prototype TL-16 naval
vessels. Several successful designs have been produced
so far, the largest of these being the 40,000-ton strike
cruiser Alexander Brayden.
```
```
Other research work is carried out at Naval
installations elsewhere in the system. Reports that the
Navy has established an antimatter production and
containment facility insystem have been consistently
denied.
```
```
1118 Kaurga D686411-4 S NI IM G
Kaurga is wholly owned by the Kaurga Agroproduce
Combine (usually known as “KaurCorp”). The company
```

was established in the last years of the Ziru Sirka, with
the purpose of producing furs and high-quality
agroproducts for off-world markets. With the onset of
the Long Night, the population became introverted,
and lost much of its technology. With the pleasant
conditions on Kaurga, the inhabitants found that they
were content with a lower level of technology.
Although the planetary government retains its
corporate nature, off-world trading has only just
resumed, and is still at a low level. Because of their
exclusive nature, Kaurgan products can command an
extremely high price.

The Ushran government has expressed an interest in
building class-B orbital starport facilities around
Kaurga, as the system forms a “gap” in the
Dagudashaag Main. The pressure for migration of
population from Ushra to Earth-like Kaurga has been
growing, but KaurCorp has successfully resisted, so far.

The Simalr Family:
The title of Duke of Ushra is held by members of the
Simalr family. This family has had a long and
distinguished history - the majority of the rulers of the
Ushran Empire were Simalr's unusual for a ruling
family to survive the transition from petty state to
imperial Duchy). The Simalrs traditionally claim
descent from the Amsadege family, which is
documented as settling in the region at about –5,900,
and which gave the area at least two Vilani provincial
governors (although it should be noted that this claim
is now generally discredited).

Although the Simalr claim noble Vilani descent, they
are of mixed lineage, and are unashamedly sophontist.
Ushra itself still bears many signs of the original
colonisation by the Solomani. They are skilled
administrators, who show genuine concern for their
subjects. One of the Simalrs' most noted policies is
that of persuading surrounding systems to adopt a
liberal, democratic style of government. This gradual,
voluntary process (totally unlike that proposed by
Archduke Dulinor) has so far given the subsector ten
democratic systems (Ushra, 0914, 0920, 1007, 1011,
1017, 1114, 1115, 1117, 1314 ).

These enlightened policies, together with distinguished
Naval service, have earned the current incumbent,
Duke Edward Amekaa Simalr (41), a prestigious seat on
the Imperial Moot. He is noted throughout much of the
Imperium for his campaigns for sophont rights.

(See the HIWG Pub “Personality: Edward Amekaa
Simalr”)

Another notable member of the Simalr clan is Jianik-Anne Simalr (32). Edward's sister, and chief
Dagudashaag representative to the Grand Council of
the Vland Domain.

Arkayne LIC.
Originally a collaborative venture between Kugmika
Arkuukhumlar, a Vilani noble and industrialist, and Dr.
William David Kayne, a prize-winning gravitics

```
scientist, in 412, Arkayne has since grown until its
trading sphere covers much of Dagudashaag and Core
Sectors. Arkayne's primary products are gravitics and
inertial compensator systems, and the company has
become a major supplier to the Imperial Navy. The
company maintains a reputation for innovation and
superlative quality.
```
```
Subsector G: KHANDI
Duchy [[Capital]] - Khandi (2119 A222A87-F)
```
```
Khandi is a subsector which has experienced many
ebbs and flows of power. The system of Khandi was
declared regional capital of Dagudashaag at about –
4,000, but the colonisation wave by the Solomani
during the Second Imperium shifted emphasis towards
Medurma, Ushra and Zeda. The fact that Khandi is
isolated from Jump-1 travel effectively prohibited it
from forming a petty interstellar state during the Long
Night.
```
```
The subsector is taking a long time to recover Khandi's
rapidly-growing population, together with its lack of a
native agricultural capacity, creates a great need for
imported Agroproduce, which the nearby worlds
cannot fulfil
```
```
1712 C7AA886-C S FL WA IM G (Home to an unusual alien minor race. Details later)
```
```
Subsector H: KURIISHE
Duchy [[Capital]] - Sivvista (3120 A4288BA-E)
```
```
This subsector has seen many political intrigues. The
Duchy capital was originally at Eraki (the capital of the
Kuriishe Eraki, the petty state which dominated this
region during the Long Night). However, in a scandal in
710 (the precise details of which have never been
revealed), Duke Imlagaklus was stripped of his rank by
Empress Margaret I, and Count St.John of Sivvista was
elevated to the Duchy.
```
```
The move was unpopular with many, to say the least.
Much of the population would like to see the change
reversed, even though the St.John family have proven
highly competent administrators. No-one is more
anxious for change than Baron Niesma Imlagaklus of
Eraki - but the faith that the populace has in him is
sadly misplaced. In many ways he is a reincarnation of
his infamous ancestor: he is ambitious, totally without
scruples, a liar, and a hedonist to boot. He should go
far in Lucan's Imperium...
```
```
Subsector I: ZEDA, Duchy [[Capital]] - Zeda (0721 8873967-E)
```
```
This region is a victim of arbitrary subsector divisions.
The Duchy capital was sited at Zeda, largely because
that is the homeworld of the Ziadd, an influential
human minor race. However, the arbitrary layout of
the Duchy boundaries has meant that much of the Zeda
cluster, with its population of Ziadd, falls within
Shallows subsector. Several appeals for the boundaries
```

to be redrawn have been made, and a boundary
change was originally scheduled to be made in 1127.

0230 Dudin B9CA9CE-F HI FL WA IM
The population of Dudin is generally hostile towards
Ziadd, because they feel, that they have robbed Dudin
of the prosperity it would otherwise have had as
subsector capital.
0823 Urgu EAEA9DG-8 HI WA IM G
A backwater world (no pun intended!) with a rather
nasty form of religious dictatorship, based on worship
of the ocean.

Ziadd:
A human minor race originating on Zeda/Zeda (0721
8873967-E). When they were first contacted by the
Vilani, the Ziadd were at about TL6, but showed little
interest in space exploration. At first, the Ziadd were
receptive, and even enthusiastic towards Vilani
contact, but matters rapidly turned sour. When the
Ziadd discovered that the Vilani were not about to
explain the mysteries of Jump travel to them, and that
they were not to be permitted to explore and trade
freely (and set up their own empire), they rejected the
Vilani violently. After two scoutships were destroyed
by nuclear weapons, the Vilani decided that the Ziadd
were better left alone.

Contact was again attempted when the Solomani took
over the sector. After an initial period of mutual
mistrust, the Ziadd were given Jump technology, and
accepted into the interstellar community.

Hias' deaaq (TransMain Zeda):
A merchant line covering some twelve subsectors of
Dagudashaag Sector. Hias'deaaq's homeport is Zeda/
Zeda (0721 B873967-E). Much of the company's trade is
in medium-to-high-value cargoes such as manufactured
goods, as the bulk cargo/low value trade is still heavily
monopolised by Tukera Lines.

The deregulation of corporate activities by Raegis
Viisarikaa, and later by Karyn, has given a significant
boost to Hias'deaaq, and the company has been
undergoing an extensive scheme of modernisation and
re-equipment. The 2,500-ton Freespace Gateway-class
freighter (manufactured by Medurma AstroTech, and
licensed to U'Chakzii SIA) now forms the backbone of
the company fleet.

Subsector J: THE REMNANTS
Duchy [[Capital]] – D'Artur (0924 AAE7443-F)

As its name suggests, this subsector has, perhaps, the
last remnants of sparsely populated border-style
wilderness in what is otherwise a heavily settled and
civilised sector. It is a region of stark contrasts - the
high-tech orbital complex of the Ducal palace at
D'Artur is only three parsecs away from the TL4 world
of 1021.

The most important astrographical formation in this
area is the “Mainbridge”, a Jump-1 string of stars, the

```
portion of the Dagudashaag Main between Urgu and
Dam The Mainbridge carries a great volume of jump-1
trade. With the advent of higher jump however, the
primary communications route between Medurma and
Ushra now goes directly from 1722/Pact to 1420/
Ushra, thus bypassing the subsector completely, and
the region has suffered.

1032 B564588-8 CO AG Ni RI IM 4 G
This world has been afflicted by civil unrest following
the construction of a class-B startport, in a joint
venture between the planetary government and
outside industry. The population resents the prospect
of an imminent influx of tourists, as they only wish to
keep themselves to themselves improved
communications with the rest of the sector have also
brought to light the dwindling population of Chirpers.
A number of outsystem environmentalist groups have
persuaded the government to pass stringent legislation
protecting the Chirpers. The populace regard them as
pests, and are angered at the infringements of their
personal freedoms.
```
```
Interstellar Petrochemical Processing LIC.:
In many ways, The Remnants is a company subsector,
because the largest single landowner (outside of the
Imperial Government) in the subsector is IPP. The
company specialises in the extraction of valuable
organic chemicals from exotic or corrosive planetary
atmospheres. IPP owns outright, and has active
manufacturing operations on 0929, 0930, and 1323,
and the company headquarters are situated on the
prime real estate of 1433/Argi (A693214-E).
```
```
Note: IPP installations are notoriously lawless.
“Anything goes” would be a good way of describing it.
The company has claimed that their small corporate
security detachments are highly-trained, and sufficient
to cope with the size of workforce they have. They
aren't - budget restraints (and possibly internal
corruption) would be a better explanation. (Remember
Outland? It's like that, only worse!)
```
```
Subsector K: PACT
Duchy [[Capital]] - Medurma (2124 A9D7954-G)
```
```
Pact subsector is the most densely populated and
techologically-advanced of all the subsectors in
Dagudashaag. As one Imperial economist once stated,
“the Dashi-Khusgulur-Argi triangle is a true industrial
powerhouse”. As befits such a region, it is a
communications hub, and the majority of the traffic
between Core and Gushemege passes through this
area. The subsector is named after the Medurma Pact,
a petty state which dominated this region between
about -500 and -10.
```
```
The open trading policies of the Medurman government
have allowed high technology to spill over into
surrounding systems - most of the systems between
1772/Pact and Dipa/Pact are at or above TL13.
```

2124 Medurma A9D7954-G HI IM G
Medurma, the capital of Dagudashaag was originally
the subject of a major effort by the Solomani at about
-2,099, during the Rule of Man.

Although there had been a few exploratory mining
installations set up on the world by the Ziru Sirka,
Medurma had been largely neglected by the Vilani.
Almost immediately, the colonists made a startling
discovery - extensive ruins indicated that Medurma had
been home to a human minor race as recently as -
19,000. The “Medurman” civilisation had apparently
reached TL3 or 4 at its height, and there is no clue as
to the reason for its disappearance.

Now, the planet is extensively settled - the largest
cities are sited inside mountain peaks, whilst high
technology maximises the agricultural yield from the
few high-altitude plateaux. At lower levels (the area
between 0m and 2,000m. elevation is termed
“DeepLevel”), conditions are harsh, as the
temperature hovers at about 80ºC - 95ºC, and the
pressure is about 5.5 atmospheres. Mining operations
are extensive and advanced at DeepLevel, as is the
cultivation of the unusual “Symmonds Tree”. The
Symmonds Tree was first discovered in 311, and was
found to be an excellent source of protein and
carbohydrate, suitable for human consumption.
Biochemically, the Symmonds Tree is an enigma, as it
is considerably more advanced than other plant forms
at the same altitude.

Several independent companies (including DeepLevel
Harvesting LIC., and Symmonds XenoCulture Inc.)
compete to cultivate and harvest this remarkable
plant. Medurma is now more or less self-sufficient in
staple foods.

Symmonds XenoCulture Inc.:
Founded by Frederick Maximillian Symmonds in 316,
SXC has since expanded to form a major agroproduct
harvesting and shipping company in Pact subsector. In
recent years, the company has been plagued by
rumours of financial mismanagement. Its position as
leader of the domestic Medurman market no longer
looks secure, as newer companies such as DeepLevel
Harvesting LIC. are now more productive and
innovative.

Subsector L: INSHAAM
Duchy [[Capital]] - Collette (2725 A342644-F)

Astrographically, this unremarkable subsector is a
collection of small clusters. The most notable feature
of this area is the large number of Imperial Naval cases
between Shea (2927) and Khusgulur (1525). Originally
established because of a serious problem with piracy
and privateering in this region during the early years of
the Imperium, these bases new serve as marshalling
areas for naval exercises and for fleets travelling to or
from Depot/Inshaam (3121). Since a fair amount of
shipbuilding/repair capacity is concentrated at Depot,
the Navy has announced plans to “consolidate”' the

```
bases in this area, upgrading some, and closing others.

```
```
2923 Anpanaar C343531-7 NI PO IM G
This system looks innocent enough, your average run-of-the-mill backwater dirtball. It isn't. Anpanaar
suffers from what the I.I.S.S. sophontology experts call
a “pathologically misstructured culture”. There are
many things “wrong” with the Anpanaari culture but
the most important is its view of human life. On the
'Aspects of Culture: Value of Human Life' Table in
TD#16, Anpanaar is rated as killing equal or lower
classes OK, slavery allowed.
```
```
At the time the Imperial Second Survey was being
compiled, the government of Collette had intervened
militarily in the affairs of Anpanaar some fifteen years
previously, “persuading” the planet's (all-male) ruling
council to adopt more enlightened policies, and
replacing those members who dissented. The I.I.S.S.
judged the situation to be stable, and designated the
system Travel Zone Green.
```
```
The population of Medurma is remarkably cosmopolitan (there is a sizeable community of Aslan, for instance).
Imperial sociologists find Medurma particularly
interesting, as the population tends to be socially
stratified by altitude - the deeper-level areas are
populated by lower classes.
```
```
It lasted just five more years. A string of assassinations
in 1067 was followed by the announcement that the
old order had been restored. The system is now rated
Travel Zone Amber. The events caused the downfall of
the elected government on Collette, and the present
administration does not sanction further interference
```
```
Subsector M: B O L I V A R
Duchy [[Capital]] - Bolivar (0240 A78699D-F)
```
```
This subsector is very sparsely-populated with stars -
the interior of the subsector is dominated by the
Dudin-Bolivar Rift, which forces even Jump-2 craft to
take a circuitous route from one system to the other,
via Eddum and the Nimluin cluster. The astrographical
makeup of the region heavily restricted settlement of
the region during the Ziru Sirka.
```
```
The Bolivar system itself was settled by Solomani
during the first years of the Rule of Man. [Reference:
Hutchinson's 20th. Century Encyclopaedia: Simon
Bolivar (1783-1830); South American soldier-statesman,
known as the Liberator], Bolivar subsector is another
agricultural desert - there is only one agricultural
world in the subsector, at 0235. Bolivar system lies on
the Gushemege Jump-1 Main, and the fact that it
obtains much of its agricultural produce from
Gushemege tends to make its people somewhat aloof
from the internal affairs of Dagudashaag. Bolivar is
regarded as rather a troublemaker by the rest of the
sector.
```

0240 Bolivar A78699D-F A HI IM G
Settled by the Camri-La Paz Pan-American Industrial
Consortium (a Solomani mining/manufacturing
concern) in -2,108, Bolivar is a pleasant, Earth-like
planet. Bolivar has seen numerous military coups in its
history, but the most recent of these was some four
centuries ago. The victorious faction was forced to
introduce stringent legislation so as to maintain order.
The planet is now politically stable, and the need for
such legislation is long past, though the government
has difficulty appreciating this. The world is noted for
having several active Solomani Parties.

Subsector N: ARGI
Duchy [[Capital]] - Argi (1431 A330ACC-F)

Argi subsector is an important industrial center, and
communications link - the Dagudashaag Main covers
the trailward half of the region, and the waystation at
Lenashuuk/Argi handles a great deal of traffic between
Dagudashaag and Zarushagar. All of the more highly
populated systems in the trailward region were settled
during the rule of the First Imperium. The Dagudashaag
Main, having been heavily settled for such a long time,
is a technologically advanced region - most of the
systems between 1331/Argi and Durgaruur/Sapphyre
are at or above TL13.

The Coreward tip of the Nimluin cluster, part of which
falls in Argi subsector, is a rich agricultural region.

1331 B98A654-D N NI RI WA IM G
This prosperous system is notable for having massive
orbital warehousing and bulk-cargo handling facilities.
The system acts as a trans-shipment point for the
dozens of multi-kiloton agroproduct bulk carriers
travelling weekly from the agricultural worlds of 0932/
Argi, 1032/Argi, 1029/The Remnants and 1129/The
Remnants to Argi itself.

1533 C9E7366-C S LO NI FL DR G
Conditions on this world are both harsh and baffling.
The planet as a whole appears to have been distorted
into an ellipsoidal shape in the geologically recent
past. What is more puzzling, is that there is no nearby
moon or gas giant which could have caused the
distortion and there is no indication of a recent impact
on the surface. The planetary crust has been shattered
and measurements indicate cataclysmic tremors on the
surface as the planet “relaxes” to a spherical shape
through its own self-gravity. Orbital surveys also snow
unusual density anomalies.

Since the system is in a little-travelled side branch of
the Dagudashaag Main, it is only since the mid-700's
that the I.I.S.S. has made any significant effort to
investigate the planet. The Scouts also provide
technical support (in a somewhat half-hearted fashion)
to the several Droyne oytripin present insystem. Some
of the Droyne research the planet, whilst others
undertake small-scale mining insystem.

The I.I.S.S. have only just begun to realise the

```
significance of the system. An expedition to the
planet's surface in 1112 made an astonishing discovery
```
- an array of “cables” some 1700 km. long, buried in
the planetary crust at a depth of about 4m. The cables
are composed of monadium, the same material as was
found at the Ancient base on Antiquity/Ian, in Corridor
Sector.

```
1640 Lenashuuk A7A8A76-F W HI FL IM A G
Lenashuuk is a hostile world - the tidal influence of a
large moon causes severe seismic disturbances. The
surface of Lenashuuk is covered with oceans of liquid
sulphur, and the atmosphere is composed of nitrogen,
sulphur dioxide, and various hydrocarbons, forcing the
population to live in large, domed habitats.
```
```
The history of Lenashuuk has been one of armed strife.
The world was originally settled by several rival mining
companies, intent on exploiting the world's immense
reserves of titanium and molybdenum. Territorial
disputes over mining rights and transportation routes
have periodically erupted into full-scale warfare. The
culture of Lenashuuk seems not to be able to
understand the concept of compromise.
```
```
Sector Duke Raegis Viisarikaa IV was killed on
Lenashuuk in 1114. When the accidental firing of a
mass-driver artillery weapon ruptured the pressurised
habitat he was visiting, during a visit intended to bring
peace to the troubled world.
```
```
Subsector O: SAPPHYPE
Duchy [[Capital]] - Sapphyre (2137 A977200-D)
```
```
This subsector is relatively sparsely populated - there
is only one high-population world in the subsector (Durgaruur/Sapphyre). The vast majority of the
systems lie on the Dagudashaag Main. Even though the
volume of intersystem trade in this subsector is less
than in, say, Argi or Pact, it is still economically
important, as the only direct Jump-2 point-of-contact
between the Dagudashaag Main and the Sylean Main is
between 2237/Sapphyre and 2437/Sapphyre.
```
```
2137 Sapphyre A977200-D LO NI IM G
The name of this world (and the name of the
subsector), comes from the intense colour produced in
the planet's oceans, caused by vast numbers of micro-organisms which metabolise copper compounds
dissolved in the water.
```
```
2234 8539230-D LO NI IM G
An interesting feature of this system is the orbital
radiotelescope array, some 28 km. across, owned and
operated by the University of Libuka/Zarushagar.
```
```
Subsector P: MIANDA
Duchy [[Capital]] - Uumirsa (3032 B000954-F)
```
```
Mianda subsector is a prime agricultural region (there
are some six agricultural worlds in the subsector).
Much of the region's agroproduct surplus is exported
```

SIGNAL-GK

A distress signal. A cry for help... A cry to adventure!

Welcome to the back pages! For those of you who think this is a weird place to place an editorial - think
about it! The editorial is the last thing written and probably the most boring part... I think I've got it
right. Actually GK {that's the house name} doesn't have a proper editorial - this is the letter page. Obvi-ously because this is the first issue there are no letters to print but I can hope that you'll fill this page (and possibly others as well) in Issue 2.

I thought I'd fill in a little of the background to GK. If you get bored just turn back and read that article
you said you'd read later.. I started with Traveller about 11 or 12 years ago when I bought an original set
of 3 books. From that point on I was hooked. Then about 5 years ago I moved to London and no longer had
any players. That combined with my job's wierd hours meant I ended up giving up Traveller. Then Mega-Traveller came out, I got hold of my first copy of the Digest (issue 9) and I was hooked again. Last ,:ear i
decided to put out a Traveller fanzine probably based in the unaligned worlds to the Rimward of the So -
ward Marches. Then I read Duncan's advert for people in Britain to join HIWG. That was in December of
last year. Before I knew what was going on I'd been passed Dagudashaag to develop. Duncan had put to-gether some fascinating data and I wanted to take all the parts and expand upon them. That was a couple
of months ago. GK is the end product. A Fanzine which will issue by issue combine together to form an in-depth Encyclopaedia Dagudashaag!

Each issue will concentrate on a specific subsector and will detail the worlds and personalities of that
subsector, each article and adventure will be set or relate there. In short each issue is an invaluable aid
to adventuring within the Dagudashaag sector and believe me when I say - You've seen nothing yet!

THE TEAM



Unlike most fanzines GK is very much a team effort. Each member of that team is as valuable as any
other. There are few articles in this issue that has not been improved as a result of another member's
help and assistance. That's what make GK so special - Teamwork!

along the Sylean Main, to markets in [[Core sector]] . The region is fairly densely populated.

Kadushi cluster, in the rimward half of the subsector, is an interesting example of economic co-operation. Kakar (2937), Kadushi (3136), and Shardi (3236) have together formed a government-sponsored shipping company.

competition.
