One of the First Three (New Home, Neubayern and Amondiage; the first worlds settled by the ESA colony mission), Amondiage is a dry world with standard atmosphere. Its settlement pattern is typical; most of the population dwell in high-technology arcologies near abundant water sources, with smaller and less well- developed settlements in remote areas.

Amondiage’s excellent starport is the point of arrival or departure in the Islands for most Imperial shipping headed across the rimward side of the Great Rift. Enough Imperial ships and personnel pass through that the locals – at least around the port region – are not surprised when someone from a species never seen before in the Islands steps off a ship. The Imperium is cosmopolitan and the people of Amondiage are familiar enough with its ways that misunderstandings are rare... provided newcomers are well-behaved.

The port is efficient, clean and well-run, with a bustle of ships and small craft. Most are from Amondiage’s large trade fleet, whose personnel can be distinguished from the independents by smart uniforms and a clean- cut appearance. Indeed, there are uniforms everywhere - port workers, security personnel and private firms all have their own tastefully not-quite-overdone uniforms. The Travellers’ first impression might well be that Amondiage is one giant propaganda exercise, which is not far from the truth.

Amondiage is a high-law dictatorship and one function of all the braid at the starport is to impress upon visitors that they should not step out of line. Wherever they have come from, the Travellers are on Amondiage now and Amondiage plays by its own rules.

Personnel at the port are polite and efficient, but intolerant of nonsense. There is also a faint air of
‘better than you’ about virtually everyone in a position of authority, however minor. No weapons or overt body armour are allowed through starport customs and there are stiff penalties for being caught with a weapon. However, secure storage for baggage and weaponry is free of charge, and handled in a polite and discreet manner.

The Travellers will be expected to answer simple questions when they arrive: name, business on Amondiage, occupation, and so forth. Anyone giving answers that are close to the truth or well-rehearsed will have no problems. Inventing a story off the cuff is more of a problem and requires an Average (8+) Persuade check. Outrageously bogus claims will attract attention, forcing the Traveller to deal with closer questioning and investigation of their identity documents.

Once they have passed the entry point, the Travellers have the run of the very impressive downport. A wide range of entertainment and accommodation facilities are available, along with shops and business premises. The clean and efficient atmosphere of the main concourse is no mere façade; it continues throughout the port and associated city.
