#### Jump Bridges

Jump bridges are deep-space refuelling stations serving commercial traffic. Normally constructed on or close to an ice asteroid or comet, their role is to allow jump-1 ships to cross a gap between mains or clusters. This means making a jump to deep space, which must be very precise to avoid being stranded. Few astrogators like using jump bridges since it means betting the lives of everyone on board on a perfect plot with no random factors to cause variance. In reality, using a jump bridge is only slightly more hazardous than a normal jump, although the stakes are higher and this can be wearing on the nerves over time.

Jump bridges are very similar to any other starport, although they tend to have large docking areas for tankers or shuttles bringing in asteroidal ice for conversion into fuel. Facilities vary from extremely utilitarian to positively luxurious. The bridges located close to Pretoria are showcases of excellence to rival any planetary port; this was quite deliberate, as the Dukes of Pretoria wanted to attract interstellar trade and were prepared to invest heavily in making the experience of using the bridges as pleasant as possible.
Other jump bridges exist elsewhere but are generally of a lower standard.

##### Jumping to a Bridge

It is only possible to use a jump bridge if its position is precisely known and the astrogator must have an extremely accurate set of coordinates. In the case of commercial jump bridges these are available at nearby starports and are constantly updated.

Jumping to a jump bridge requires an extremely tight jump plot, requiring a Difficult (10+) Astrogation check. Most astrogators will offset this difficulty by taking longer over the plot. The alternative is to buy a template jump solution from a nearby starport. Most ports within one jump of the bridge will have them for sale. The usual cost is Cr500 but in some cases the plot is discounted, or even free, to encourage use of the bridge. Using a pre-generated solution still requires finalization but this is a Routine (6+) Astrogation check.

Ideally, ships jump directly to the jump bridge and emerge very close to it. Standard maneuver drives perform very poorly in deep space, so a ship that has to navigate to the bridge after emergence may take some time to get there. Most bridges used manned or robotic tugs to bring in ships that arrive too far out to reach the bridge within a few hours. These tugs are equipped with reaction drives or deep-space manouvring systems to permit efficient operation.

The Effect of the Astrogation check indicates how close to the bridge the vessel arrives.

##### Jump Bridge Variance

|      Effect     |   Result  | Docking Time |
| :-------------: | :-------: | ------------ |
|        6+       |  Perfect  | 4D minutes   |
|       4-5       | Excellent | 2D hours     |
|       2-3       |    Good   | 4D hours     |
|        1        |  Adequate | 1D days      |
|        0        |    Poor   | 2D days      |
| -1 or<br/>worse | Disaster! | See below    |

These times assume a vessel moving under its own power using a standard drive. A vessel towed by tugs or using reaction drives can make the approach in half the time.

A vessel suffering a Disaster does not emerge close to the jump bridge. It may be able to crawl across the intervening gap over a period of weeks or months if its power and supplies do not run out, or be rescued by a reaction-drive ship if one is available. If not, the occupants face a slow death - quite possibly within sensor and comms range of the jump bridge but beyond any hope of rescue.
