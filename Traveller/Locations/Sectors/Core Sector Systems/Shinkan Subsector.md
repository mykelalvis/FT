The flow of interstellar trade and travel does not bestow equal benefits to all the worlds of the Core. Shinkan is a case in point, an important subsector but it has always been a bit of a backwater. Sitting at the nexus of four major Imperial sectors, it has the potential to become a shining pearl of the realm but things simply have not played out that way thus far.

Shinkan was the site of many Vilani 'reserve worlds', planets that – thousands of years ago – were marked for future development. Few of them were even given a proper name other than an alphanumeric designation. For this reason, many worlds in the subsector do not bear Vilani names but instead those of the Terrans, who swept through the subsector as a conquering force during the later stages of the Interstellar Wars. Besides naming them, the Terrans and subsequent Rule of Man did little with these untapped treasures and they were eventually inherited by the Third Imperium who finally began to develop them.

The seat of government for Shinkan is at Ninua, which shows little interest in managing subsector affairs, making its worlds a loose confederation at best. The systems of Shinkan are rarely cooperative, often contentious and in a few cases downright hostile to one another. The aloof Ninuans are constantly struggling with their own internal political problems and generally regarded as a nuisance by their neighbors. Ninua is jokingly referred to as the anshikaam naimiiu saarpuhii , loosely translated as 'the world which looks away'. Indeed it does but Ninua just might find that while its attentions are diverted inward, the remainder of its worlds have moved on without it.

The flow of trade from neighboring Fornast and Antares passes into the Core through Shinkan, which has created a caste of nouveau riche merchants on many of its worlds. An abundance of recently constructed high-tech starports along the Shinkan Main are signs of its burgeoning economy. Ishnuunar, despite appearances, channels more wealth into the Core than any other world in the subsector. Ishnuunar's kleptocratic government, collapsing infrastructure and disastrous Tech Level seem to be signs of a world in freefall but in fact opportunities abound there. The powerful and exorbitantly wealth Ishnuunari merchant guilds run the system like a syndicate of crime families. The guilds have their hands in just about every business venture on the planet and their tendrils have begun to spread to other star systems. The fastidious landed gentry of Gekhuu and Derku have done what they can to stave off guild infiltration but have not proven to be up to the task thus far. The three worlds – which have become known as 'the Triad' – have begun to fight proxy wars on the hapless smaller worlds of the subsector. Most believe that it is only a matter of time before these conflicts spread to the Triad worlds themselves.

The sector-wide Achenaar Antilles line, which dominates shipping in just about every other subsector of the Core, has found it difficult to penetrate the byzantine markets of Shinkan. Their efforts to establish a regional headquarters at Dureija have met with one disaster after another. The regional director of the corporation has accused the Triad of sabotage. The powerful trade line has been lobbying the Imperial bureaucracy for assistance but so far they have received little help. It seems that the Imperium does not want to rock the boat in Shinkan, whether or not the subsector's successes have been achieved by questionable means.

The bulk of the Imperial Navy's 76th fleet is headquartered at Sekwon with squadrons stationed throughout the subsector. The Naval Base on Iidsha includes a training facility and operational center for Imperial Naval Intelligence. While the INI are allegedly there to monitor incoming traffic from Antares and Fornast, they are presumably also keeping a watchful eye on the Triad to make sure that their problems with one another do not boil over into something more serious.
