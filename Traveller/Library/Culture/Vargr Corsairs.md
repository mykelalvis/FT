## VARGR CORSAIRS

Within the Imperium, there is a tendency to characterise the Vargr as an assorted collection of petty states and freebooters, and there is a large body of popular mythology that would have it seem that the Vargr are nothing but pirates and raiders. The myth is as pervasive as distortions of the taming of the American West or the everyday life of a law enforcement officer in much earlier days.

In reality, of course, the corsair bands that operate within the Vargr Extents are nowhere near as pervasive as popular imagery would have us believe. Still, the corsairs remain a major factor in Vargr society – far more common than the occasional pirate encountered within the Imperium, for example. The fragmentation of the Extents is partly to blame for this, amid a welter of small states and independent worlds, it is far easier for a corsair vessel to slip out of reach than is true for a gigantic interstellar state such as the Imperium, where despite local freedoms, the Imperial Navy forms a common, ever-present counterweight to freebooters everywhere.

This is not, however, the sole reason for the presence and continued success of pirate bands within the Vargr Extents. The fact is, corsair bands are symptomatic of the whole Vargr mental outlook. Impulsive, easily talked into independent action by highly charismatic leaders, the Vargr seem to naturally gravitate towards the concept of raiding. As long as there are individuals interested in mounting raids who can attract even a handful of followers, there will be Vargr corsairs, for the Vargr have few checks and balances that could prevent such a leader from doing as they please, when they please.

When we speak of Vargr corsairs, we tend to lump them all into one general category. This is another misconception, for Vargr corsairs are complex and varied. As with so many other aspects of Vargr society, it is difficult to speak in generalities of a race, which is prone to far more variation in virtually every aspect of their culture than even humans. The 'typical' Vargr corsair band is a myth; there is no such organization. Nonetheless, many bands have things in common and it is possible to arrive at a few particular generalizations that will at least be reasonably consistent among corsairs in Vargr space.

### THE CORSAIR BAND

Vargr corsair groups come in all sizes. There are raiders who get together to crew a single ship, go out raiding and disperse when the voyage is done. There are also long-standing organizations who rival small Vargr interstellar governments in scope, power and naval strength. Most fall somewhere between these two extremes.

The small fry/single ship operations that are mostly comprised of 'part- timers' in the business for a quick score can be easily dismissed from consideration. They are nuisances at worst, capturing an occasional merchant ship or raiding a poorly defended world for a comparatively small take. They have no real organization, no permanence and usually fall prey to government forces, larger corsair bands or even, at times, their own victims, in reasonably short order.

It is the larger, better organised groups – and particularly the very widespread and powerful bands at the upper end of the spectrum – that really make up the corsair bands of popular stories. These outfits do have a degree of permanence (as much as any Vargr institution can be said to have, that is) and they are generally very well organised indeed. Each one of the middle-sized bands has a capacity to expand to become one of the major corsair operations, although the outward pull of all Vargr institutions makes it a rare thing for such an event to take place.

As an example of middle and upper range corsair operations, consider the history of one such band, the [[Kforuzeng]] of the [[Firgr subsector]], and its interaction with other bands of comparable size.

The [[Kforuzeng]] have existed for a number of years, originally an amalgamation of small fry who got together to mount a few raids and wound up staying together under the leadership of a highly charismatic ship captain. As success followed success, this first leader built his authority and organised the band along a fairly typical semi-military structure. The Kforuzeng have changed little since that time, although there have been a number of changes of leadership and many shifts in the internal balance of power and authority.

The original Kforuz band had perhaps 10 ships, mostly corsairs and similar vessels. As time went on, they absorbed other independents peacefully, as ship captains and crews were attracted to the Kforuz leaders whose charisma, boosted by success in various endeavors, was getting higher all the time. By the time they had doubled from their original size, the Kforuzeng were a far-ranging organization whose operations spanned the Firgr subsector and some adjacent territories.

By this time, the Kforuz could be reckoned as the strongest – but by no means the only – corsair power in the region. The extent of their operations was now to the point where they had to either continue to grow or collapse under their own weight. This is an important aspect of most corsair operations. Large bands are so subject to the characteristic splintering of Vargr factionalism that the band must continually gain new successes in order to survive. It is a circular process, for the need for new successes requires the band to extend operations further afield, requiring more equipment, new bases of operations, money and personnel. But the increases in economic commitments and added followers require, in turn, even greater successes.

The Kforuzeng solved this as most growing bands do, by recruiting heavily and organising mercenary operations to supplement their raiding. Kforuz mercenary units began serving various governments within their sphere of influence and even found employment within the Imperium upon occasion. Like most corsair groups, the Kforuz offered both ground forces and starships for mercenary service but ships were still at something of a premium. Twenty ships could not properly support operations across three subsectors and parts of others. Nonetheless, the Kforuz leadership displayed ingenuity in making the most of what they had. They ran the Vargr equivalent of a protection racket; by way of example, consider the case of their relations with Tukera Lines, the Imperial megacorporation.

[[Tukera]] ships crossed the Kforuz sphere to travel to the [[Thoengling Empire]], an important trading partner. Kforuz ships staged several raids on Tukera vessels travelling this route, causing unacceptable losses. Shortly thereafter, a representative of the Kforuzeng approached Tukera with the offer to hire out Kforuz ships to escort the Tukera ships. Tukera agreed and now pays a subsidy to the Kforuz in exchange for 'protection' from piracy in the region. Tukera, not being fools, realised that paying the Kforuz off would cost less than adding their own escort vessels to the run, while the Kforuzeng profit by earning about as much money without risk as they would have earned by continuing their raiding.

At this stage, the Kforuz could be considered the foremost of the middle- sized corsair bands on the Imperial-Vargr frontier. Two smaller bands shared the same sphere – the Aegzaeng and the Uekuez. For a time, the Kforuzeng began coordinating operations with these two groups; then, in a ruthless and bloody move, they took over the Uekuez. The takeover was accomplished through an ambush of the Uekuez leadership during negotiations for a joint venture, then was followed by a ruthless purge, which enabled the Kforuzeng to absorb the Uekuez fleet and a few of their lower-echelon personnel. Most Uekuez leaders were either killed or forced to flee with their families out of Kforuz range entirely; many refugees settled on Jesedipere in the Aramis subsector, under the protection of the Imperium.

A few years later, the Aegzaeng were next. This takeover did not even require much bloodshed; the Kforuzeng were planning a takeover and many Aegzaeng pulled out early, joining the Uekuez refugees. Others defected to the Kforuzeng voluntarily, earning a place (albeit lower than they had enjoyed before) in the hierarchy of the expanding Kforuz organization. These two takeovers elevated the Kforuz into the realm of a 'great power' among corsairs.

However, the larger the Kforuzeng got, the more distant leaders were from their followers. This weakened the bonds that normally make corsair bands more stable than governments. The first time the Kforuzeng suffered a major set back, a major shift in organization and power could be expected to inevitably follow. Factions and splinter groups would be sure to emerge.

### ORGANISATION

The usual corsair band is organised along military lines; the larger the band, the more formal the hierarchy. At the height of their power, the Kforuzeng were a far-flung force, with a well-structured organization based on the Imperial model. A close parallel would be the structure of the typical Imperial Marine task force but without some of the more sophisticated elements of these units. This organization was consciously copied by the Kforuzeng because of the flexibility of the force command concept, well suited to the needs of corsair mercenary ground units.

At their peak, the Kforuzeng also had at least 35 starships, ranging from 100 tons to 1,000 tons in size. Most were built along the lines of the 400 ton Ruguelka corsair but there were also merchant vessels, scouts and even two captured military vessels. For a time, Kforuz efforts were concentrated on the construction of a very large warship, the Ozarr, which was to be the core of a true fighting fleet and would have elevated the Kforuzeng to pre-eminent status. The Ozarr was never completed, due to setbacks in the Kforuz plans.

### EQUIPMENT

Equipment for the Kforuzeng was, and is, somewhat more standardised, thanks to their superior economic base, than is generally true of most corsair bands. Still, the Kforuz have acquired equipment from a variety of sources and there are inconsistencies. Combat armor is commonly issued to raiding forces and ship's troops; mercenary combat units are more often equipped with cloth armor. Laser weapons are common but by no means the universal service weapon.

Kforuz mercenaries generally employ g/carriers, air/rafts and grav platforms, while raiding vessels normally include g/carriers and platforms for ground side raids. Other equipment appropriate to the role of the particular unit is almost always available. As a general rule of thumb, the Kforuz are equipped to about TL10-12 (depending on specific circumstances). Vargr corsair forces rarely have sophisticated cavalry or artillery units, relying on speed and surprise rather than combined arms for advantage. Mobility is provided by their ships or lightly armed vehicles; firepower comes from ships or local combat forces (mercenaries). As yet, even the largest Vargr corsair bands are organised as light, mobile infantry.

Single-ship raids are more apt to be aimed at human interlopers or across the Imperial frontier, for a number of reasons. First, there is less competition from the larger rival outfits; secondly, small raiding groups are more apt to be embarked on a 'spur-of-the-moment' raid, and such raids are often stirred up by opportunities (who see easy pickings along the frontier) or the occasional fanatic supporter of Kaenguerradz, the doctrine of Vargr racial superiority.

### FINAL NOTES

Vargr corsairs prey equally on whatever targets present themselves – merchants, undefended planets and even, at times, each other. They know no particular limitations regarding race; Vargr corsairs will attack a Vargr ship as willingly as a human one under most circumstances. However, some smaller corsair bands show decided racial preferences in their targets.

Throughout history, men have shuddered at the coming of raiders and corsairs. Whether it was the barbarian hordes of Attila the Hun, Vikings gliding out of the sea in their longships, fast-moving Barbary xebecs rowing towards a becalmed merchantman, deadly raiding vessels of the Sky Raiders or the Reavers of Reavers' Deep, corsairs have had a place from the fall of the Vilani Imperium to the Fifth Frontier War. They remain a challenge to be met; but to Vargr, they are a symbol of glamour and charisma, a powerful drawing card envied more than hated even by their Vargr victims.
