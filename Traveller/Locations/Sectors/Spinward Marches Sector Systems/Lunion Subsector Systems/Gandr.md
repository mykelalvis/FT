### GANDR
Gandr was almost a boom town system as a result of the discovery of large deposits of superheavy elements in an asteroid cluster deep in the system's main belt. This sparked heavy investment and a rush of prospectors but the find was not repeated. The concentration found at Gandr has never been explained and while many mining firms tried to make a go of it, the belt proved too sparse in other minerals to be worth exploiting. One-by-one the firms packed up, leaving behind a ramshackle mess of infrastructure that expanded too fast then was stripped for what could be quickly sold off. Today, Gandr is a byword for disappointment and economic unviability, although there are still some small-scale operations managing to turn a small profit.
