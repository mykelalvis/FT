# PSIONICS INSTITUTES

Officially, all research into psionics and the teaching and use of psionic talents were prohibited three centuries ago. All overt schools of psionics were closed down, psi-drug corporations forced to end production and psionics use in the Imperium more or less came to an end.

It is an open secret that the Imperium continues to conduct research in order to counter the use of psionic powers by foreign agents (such as the Zhodani) or illegal users. It is also widely believed that psionic skills are still taught in underground psionics institutes.

Exactly what constitutes an institute varies from one case to the next. Some are academic in nature, operating quietly on the fringes of society or under the guise of more legitimate activities. Others are secret societies, crazy old hermits or other oddball characters who teach their skills to an apprentice. All of these 'institutes' have one thing in common â€“ they are illegal and unregulated. There is no guarantee that what appears to be a source of psionic training is not a scam, con, cover for something else, or a genuinely crazy person. It might even be something quite sinister like a cult.

Even where psionics training is genuinely available, it may be flawed or incomplete. Three centuries of underground teaching has resulted in some serious misconceptions and there is no recourse if an individual's quest for training ends badly.

This does not stop individuals seeking such training. Most find nothing or come to the attention of the authorities and are discouraged from continuing. Others land themselves in trouble by poking around in underworlds where they assume an institute can be found, or waste large amounts of time and money visiting obscure places, which are potentially dangerous. It is entirely possible to starve to death or be killed by wildlife searching the outback of a frontier world for an institute that ceased to exist centuries ago.

There are, however, sources of psionic training for those able to find them. Each is very different and the chances of finding one that teaches all disciplines is remote, to say the least. For the psionicist seeking to develop their full potential, the quest for knowledge and teachers is liable to be a lifetime challenge.
