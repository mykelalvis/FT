pack a lot of fire-power for their size; typically less than 5,000 tons.
Also included is an auxiliary starship, a courier vessel produced to
fulfil a specific military role.

Cruisers
This section contains longer-ranged vessels built to carry high-
powered spinal mounted weapons. Ranging between 20,000 and
100,000 tons, these are commonly used as flagships in major task
forces.

Carriers
This section is dedicated to large vessels that were built to carry
squadrons of smaller ships, bringing non-jump capable craft directly
into battle. Most are built to carry hordes of fighters, although
smaller (and cheaper) carriers exist to fill roles where fewer small
craft will be required.

Battleships
Detailing large ships which are more powerful than entire fleets
of smaller craft, battleships are enormous jump-capable warships
often called ‘dreadnoughts’. They are offensive powerhouses
covered in secondary batteries and arrays, making them almost
impervious to small craft and missile fire.

# IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

Whether it is the domination of the Third Imperium of Man or a
free sector of space littered with mercenaries, space is as much a
battleground as any contested planetoid or field of war. Thousands
of crewmen embark on lengthy missions aboard massive war ships
which pack enough fire-power to boil a planet.

This book is a collection of warships found in the _Traveller_ universe,
bringing naval superiority to those who own and operate the largest
and most impressive vessels. Some of these ships will be familiar
to more experienced fans of the setting, some are new renditions of
old designs, and a few are completely new. They were all designed
using the ship design rules found in the _Traveller_ core rulebook and
_Traveller Book 2: High Guard_ , combined with some anti-personnel
weaponry found in _Traveller Book 1: Mercenary_.

The ship sections are divided into the following types:

Small Craft
Carried into battle by starships; these fighters are a threat to larger
vessels when they attack en masse. Filling a wide variety of combat
roles they increase the tactical the options available to any admiral.

Small Starships
Most destroyers are too powerful to be privately owned, but not
large enough to go toe-to-toe with better armed ships. Destroyers

## AUTOMATED ATTACK CRAFT

A light and fast fighter, the automated attack craft is an armored flying wing with a set of gun mountings attached to an intelligent
computer. The AAC is capable of being programmed to fulfil any mission required of it. It is a favorite of planetary navies which, for
whatever reason, are unable to produce their own pilots.

#### CARRIER SUPPORT FIGHTER

The carrier support fighter is a small and fast ship used in the defence of carriers, and to recover damaged fighters requiring help to return
to the parent ship. Using powerful thrusters and a grapnel arm, the support fighter will grab a damaged fighter and land both craft. Also
used for ejected pilot retrieval, the model-7 swivelling turret sandcaster keeps enemy fighters at bay while the belly-opening airlock scoops
up vacc-suited personnel.

#### GROUND ATTACK FIGHTER, BOMBARDIER-CLASS

Large for a fighter, but expensive and useless in a space engagement; the _Bombardier_ ground attack fighter provides close air support for
troops landing on an enemy world. It is atmospheric capable and equipped with defensive measures to survive heavy ground based fire. It
is capable of saturating several square kilometers with its sizeable payload of explosive projectiles before needing to return to its carrier for
refuelling and rearming.

#### SYSTEM DEFENCE FIGHTER, CONSTABLE-CLASS

A saucer-shaped fighter designed to move from planet to planet over several weeks of travel, carrying two crew who pilot the vessel in shifts.
The _Constable_ -class fighter is armed well enough to deal with pirate shuttles and similar craft, but is rarely asked to confront anything more
powerful. When encountering larger hostile vessels its best option is to escape to the nearest fleet carrier and call heavier allies to deal with
the threat.

#### TURRET WING FIGHTER, GYRO-CLASS

A non-atmospheric fighter designed around a spherical cockpit with wing-like struts to enhance pilot-visibility and agility, the _Gyro_ is an
strange but innovative fighter. Two pilots are belted into the central core cockpit, standing back-to-back, each controlling one of the turret-
wing struts. Manoeuvring thrusters are positioned on armored facets over its surface, giving it effectively a full range of directional control
by simply spinning the cockpit to face the direction the ship is to move.

Note: Due to the _Gyro_ -class fighter’s unique shape and design it can ONLY be launched from a ship equipped with Launch Tubes.

## FLEET COURIER COMMUNICATION SHIP

The fleet courier is designed to quickly move from one fleet to the next with a hold full of important communications and messengers in
cryofreeze. It is lightly armed, but few pirates will try to and risk intercepting a jump since the vessel is usually travelling from one naval
fleet to another. The crew is minimal and normally only consists of a pilot (who is also the captain), navigator/gunner, an engineer and a
gunner. Additional crew to fully man the vessel (usually more engineers and gunners) can only be borne on a “hot bunking” basis and is
not recommended for extended operations.

#### AGASHAAM-CLASS DESTROYER

The _Agashaam_ class was rushed into the Imperial order of battle when it was originally produced, with many of its systems untested. However
these ships proved to be reliable and soon became a favorite of the men who served upon them. These ships are fast, agile and used in
squadrons of ten to twenty ships, overwhelming enemy vessels of larger size through numbers and concentration of fire-power.

## ARMORED CRUISER (GHALALK-CLASS)

A front line workhorse in times of war, the Ghalalk -class cruiser is a heavily armed and armored reminder to the universe that the Imperium
is a force to be reckoned with. It can power its way through enemy lines to bring an impressive armament to bear while launching transports
full of troops to board crippled enemy vessels.

#### FRONTIER CRUISER (AZHANTI HIGH LIGHTNING-CLASS)

Now considered obsolete by the Imperial navy, the Azhanti High Lightning -class cruiser was built to fill several different roles, rather than
specialising in one. Its ability to make jump 5 gives it tremendous range, but robs overall fuel efficiency. Many of these ships ended up in
the Scout Service due to their ‘ship-of-many-trades’ design, refurbished to their needs.

#### LIGHT CRUISER (GIONETTI-CLASS)

This fast, triangular warship is used as a flagship for many fleets and dedicated operations. It mounts a powerful meson gun rigged for a
steady stream of attacks rather than rapid-firing versions taking several minutes to recharge between salvoes. Between its main armament
and numerous missile batteries, the _Gionetti_ -class cruiser out guns most other ships its size.

#### STRIKE CRUISER (ARAKOINE-CLASS)

Powerful for its size, the Arakoine -class cruiser is an offensive fleet asset that falls between gunship and light carrier. It has reduced manoeuvrability
and jump capability but can disgorge dozens of heavy fighters and bears a powerful spinal meson cannon. This ship is also a formidable planetary
bombardment asset with a range of missiles, torpedoes and railguns. This capability comes at a cost; only a few shipyards are capable of building and
repairing such an advanced vessel, it carries less crew than equivalent cruisers and is very expensive for its size.

## FLEET CARRIER (ANTIAMA-CLASS)

A huge carrier design, the Antiama class is a key component of the Imperial navy. It is a hulking vessel that tends to stay relatively stationary in
battle, relying on its numerous heavy attack fighters and bombers. That is not to say the Antiama -class carrier is not without its own offensive
capabilities, boasting numerous weapon bays and point-defence systems, but it is not expected to fill a battleship’s role.

#### STRIKE CARRIER (WIND-CLASS)

The Wind -class strike carrier is one of the most common carriers used in the Imperial navy, mixing the offensive power of a strike cruiser
with the ability to ferry eight squadrons of fighters. Its ‘long-necked’ style of launch and recovery areas are not as efficient as those found in
larger, dedicated carriers, but the Wind ’s powerful meson gun mount makes up for any time lost in launching sorties.

## IMPERIAL BATTLE DREADNOUGHT (KOKIRRAK-CLASS)

The Kokirrak dreadnought is the preferred Imperial flagship for fleets due to its superior command facilities, which include intelligence and
communications suites. The dreadnought is capable of commanding a large fleet engagement within a system, as well as holding its own
in most battles; the perfect combination of fleet command and combat capability making it a valuable asset in any campaign.

This class, when originally designed, was built with black globe generators. Over the years, various ships have suffered generator failures
and the devices have not been replaced. When encountered there is a 50% chance the ship will have a functioning black globe (consisting
of three generators).

While the Kokirrak does not usually carry marines, it is possible to fit a modular barracks and sufficient armories for 2,000 troops in the
hold at a cost of 4,400 tons of cargo capacity.

#### IMPERIAL DREADNOUGHT (PLANKWELL-CLASS)

The _Plankwell_ dreadnought is a battleship designed to hold the center of a battleline against several enemy ships, serving as the core of
a major task force. The largely component-based production methods used to build these dreadnoughts allows for a diverse armament
spread and makes best use of the Imperium’s different planetary resources. For example, much of the ship can be built at TL13 or lower,
allowing repairs to be made at more facilities, with high technology components limited to the main spinal mount, some secondary
weapons, screens and electronics.

#### IMPERIAL WAR DREADNOUGHT (TIGRESS-CLASS)

The largest line-of-battle ship in the Imperial navy, the _Tigress-_ class is incredible to behold. It is a starship of starbase proportions. No other
single spacecraft can hope to stand up against its row upon row of weapon bays, nor of its capital-ship shredding meson cannon. A single
_Tigress_ class dreadnought is capable of defeating an entire enemy fleet.
