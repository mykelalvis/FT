## PRISON PLANET

##### INTRODUCTION

the criminal element while trying to make their confinement as
comfortable as possible. There are plenty of politics to dabble in.

As Referee, you can only hope they learn something from their
experiences and be a little more cautious when next breaking
the law.

## GROGNARDS

Those who have been playing Traveller in its various incarnations
for a long time (and by long time, we mean since the Seventies or
Eighties) will likely remember Adventure 8: Prison Planet. You will
find as much familiar here as you will find new.

Given the propensity of players to engage in illicit activities, we felt
this was a suitable adventure to update for the current rules set.
The information presented here assumes Prison Planet is within the
Spinward Marches, as this is where many groups will be playing.
However this book is also suitable for other settings with a minimum
of effort, as an isolated prison on a desert planet could reasonably
be found elsewhere.

## SOURCES FOR INSPIRATION

Like courtroom dramas, prison films and TV shows are a staple of
mainstream viewing, and a keen Referee can gain much from using
them as a measure of the atmosphere he is trying to create.

Alien^3 : Possibly one of the weaker instalments in the Alien series, but
it is a great depiction of a far-future prison built on the remains of a
corporate industrial facility.

The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay: It is an old first
person shooter, but there is a lot of excellent sneaking around and
shiving prisoners in the back.

Prisoner Cell Block H: Well, not really a great deal you can pull
from this, though the Freak works well as a corrupt and capricious
guard.

Oz: Ah, now we are getting there. You will find American prison
dramas to be a rich source of plot lines and characters, and they
feature the precise atmosphere we are looking to create in Prison
Planet. This is not a judgement on the American prison system one
way or another – it is just something we can use for the purpose of
dramatic effect. Believe me, Norwegian prisons just will not cut it
for life or death drama.

# INTRODUCTION

Traveller is an amazing game.

All roleplaying games extol the virtues of player decisions and
freedom of choice. This is what sets them apart from computer
and video games which, by their very nature, operate by a series of
confining rules. In a roleplaying game, the only limits are set by your
imagination (and, okay, your characters abilities).

Another limit, of course, is the poor, over-worked, under-appreciated
Referee. He (or She) Who Toils for the weekly game. Traveller
provided tools for overwhelmed Referees whose players always
seemed to take the left turn at the traffic lights. Or, alternatively, the
lazy Referee who only tended to read half the adventure before the
session starts. Either way, it did not matter – players suddenly jump
into an unexpected system? Simply roll on the encounter tables and,
whoops, space pirates appear. A whole evening of entertainment
right there. Players want to go exploring in the wilderness, search
for jobs in dead end bars on the frontier, try to sell several tonnes of
fabric they ‘picked up’ on the last adventure? No problem. Traveller
already had the mechanisms built in to handle all of it.

Which brings us neatly round to Prison Planet. In a game which allows
such free form play it is, perhaps, inevitable players will skirt on the
wrong side of the law. However, players can only run so far, even in a
galaxy as large as Traveller’s. In the end, the judicial system will (or, at
least, should) catch up with them. It is not the end of the road for their
characters, for their lives must go on. Instead, it is an opportunity for
excitement, betrayal, and inhuman treatment at the hands of sadistic
guardians. All good components for an adventure!

Or perhaps they are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
and got caught up in events and need time to prove their innocence.
Wrongly accused they are sent where they do not belong.

The purpose of Prison Planet is to give the players and Referee a
little more than just declaring ‘down time’ when the players are
caught, sentenced, and imprisoned for whatever infractions they
have racked up (in my gaming group, likely grand larceny, genocide,
and initiating an interstellar war). They will become part of the
prison system, be forced to survive on their own wits, and ingratiate
themselves with prisoners and guards alike.

They may try to escape, and all the information you need to run such
an event is included in this book. However, this is not the only way
to run Prison Planet and it should not necessarily be regarded as the
‘winning’ condition. It is just as viable for characters to serve their
term and instead concentrate on building their contacts among

##### IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

The Shawshank Redemption: Some players may revel in getting to
grips with the concepts of hope and loss, the dynamic of reaching
their character’s lowest ebb, then breaking the chains which bind
them for a final gasp of freedom. The rest of us will take on board
how to get on the good side of the guards and Warden and, maybe,
how to dig a tunnel without discovery.

Cool Hand Luke: At some point, one of your players is likely to adopt
the stoic approach and refuse to be beaten down, no matter what is
heaped upon his shoulders. This is all well and good, but he’ll find
the guards just won’t give a damn, and the other prisoners will be
irritated by anyone rocking their boat.

###### Standards & Assumptions

The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of
this adventure.

Date: All dates herein correspond to the Imperial calendar. The date
for this adventure is 1108: the 1108th year following the founding
of the Third Imperium. The referee should indicate the exact date
based on the local situation. Days within the year are numbered
consecutively from 1 to 365; thus the last day of the year 1108 is
365-1108. Once the adventure begins the referee should allow time
to flow normally.

Place: This adventure takes place on Keanou, which is situated in
the Lanth subsector of the Spinward Marches. It can be moved to
any desert world with only minor changes.

Requires only the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , although the _Spinward
Marches_ sourcebook may also prove useful.

Desirable Skills: No specific skills are called for in this adventure.
The characters may find the following skills to be of some value:
Streetwise, Melee, Athletics, Deception, Persuade and Admin; the
following additional skills are useful in some situations: Gambler,
Medic, Computer, Mechanic, Engineer, Advocate, Stealth and Jack-
of-all-trades.

### REFEREE’S NOTES

The theme of this adventure is the characters’ attempts to get out of
prison. It may take some time before the players realize completely
this will not be an easy task. They will find careful preparation is
as necessary as bold action. They may have to spend several years
in prison before they acquire the right combination of knowledge,
equipment, and opportunity for a successful escape.

In order to run this adventure, the referee must be familiar with
the rest of this booklet. Play begins with The First Week , on page

6. Thereafter, action follows the course outlined in _Running the
Adventure_ , page 55. The characters’ lives will be governed by events,
incidents, encounters with prisoners and guards, and rumors, as
described in those chapters. The prison’s physical layout is described
in the chapter entitled The Prison and its attendant maps.

Surviving or escaping from prison will not be a simple or quick
task. An average game session may cover several weeks or even
months in Tarkwall, depending on the events and incidents rolled.
Characters can spend years of game time behind the sandstone
walls before they finally leave the prison – or perhaps they will be
buried there.

If the characters escape from the prison, the action will be guided
by the chapter entitled Outside, which describes Keanou’s surface
and Circle City. The players will get the most enjoyment out of the
adventure if the referee avoids a dry description of the material
included here. The referee should use this material as a basis;
events, places, and characters should be further embellished by
the referee. It is more effective for the referee to play the role of
other prisoners, guards, and staff members speaking to the player
characters than to merely read off the rumors.

Players may frequently come up with courses of action which are
not covered here. In these cases the referee is free to improvise,
remembering several basic principles: the guards and prison staff
are not fools, and are endlessly suspicious of the prisoners (even
those guards who are completely corrupt), the prisoners themselves
are suspicious, dangerous, and uncommunicative, but very unlikely
to report strange behaviour to the prison authorities, and on the
whole the prison is no picnic.

It is important for the referee to discourage stupid plans of escape
(‘ I’m going to tell the guard I’m sick, and when he comes over to look
at me, I’m going to hit him with a rock and run out into the desert by
myself ’), for this will only lead to the characters’ premature demise,
which is not the point of the adventure. On the other hand, if
the players are not doing anything useful towards bettering their
condition, it may prove worthwhile to give them some hints, perhaps
acting in the guise of an older wiser prisoner, or otherwise prod
the players into some sort of useful action. Finally, remember that
although the adventurers may have been sent here as punishment
for crimes committed elsewhere in a Traveller campaign, it is still
important to reward them for intelligence and timely audacity.

##### INCARCERATED

This adventure is intended for use with a band of travellers who
have transgressed the bounds of the law (or who have at least been
found guilty of transgressions). For most crimes the characters will
be sentenced to several years (see page 174 of the _Traveller_ rulebook)
in prison, as well as having their social standings reduced by one.
Examples of this sort of crime include smuggling, forgery, fraud,
bribing a public official, malicious default (for example, skipping
out on starship payments), harbouring a psionic, entering a red
zone, assault and battery, armed robbery, computer tampering,
commerce in controlled substances, and many others. More serious
crimes may command sentences from twice as long up to life, and
reduce social standing by two. Examples of these include treason,
piracy, murder, hijacking, insurrection, mutiny, arson, kidnapping,
genocide, commerce in body organs, destruction of ecosystems,
and so on. Some worlds also have their own bizarre laws which may
catch unwary travellers – a character might find himself imprisoned
for blasphemy on a world controlled by a religious cult, or discover
the cloned replacement organs he received after severe injuries are
seen as illegal biotechnology on a backwards planet.

Some leniency in sentencing may be expected for first offenders,
and generally sentencing may vary wildly from planet to planet,
depending on local law level and government.

The Imperium operates its own prisons, where those convicted of
crimes in space or crimes against the Imperium are sent. Individual
worlds have their own prison facilities. Tarkwall Prison is both a
local and an Imperial facility – prisoners arrested in any world of the
Spinward Marches within a few parsecs of Keanou might be sent
to Tarkwall. It is a place where prisoners are sent to be forgotten.
Prisoners from half-way across the sector could be condemned to
Tarkwall if they have powerful enemies, or if some bored clerk in a
Bureau presses the wrong key on his computer.

## TARKWALL PRISON

After sentencing, the group discover they are to be sent to the
Tarkwall prison facility on Keanou. This institution has an extremely
unsavory reputation. Rumor has it the prisoners are forced
to work the pitchblende mines in hazardous conditions of high
radioactivity. Safety regulations are not enforced, occasioning a rare
editorial complaint in the Imperial mass media. Many prisoners
are said never to complete their sentences, leaving their bones in
the mines of Keanou. The group is shipped to the Keanou starport
on a converted troop transport and then flown by shuttle to the
prison along with several other new prisoners. The planet is arid
and forbidding. Filter masks are issued on leaving the shuttle, to
enable prisoners to breathe Keanou’s tainted atmosphere. The
surface buildings are bleak grey structures obviously built long ago.
The immediate skyline is dominated by a huge pile of ore, outside
of the tall metal link fence which surrounds the buildings. All of
the prisoners are subjected to a humiliating delousing procedure
before being informed they are to be housed in old mine shafts deep
beneath the surface.

# IINCARCERATEDNCARCERATED

###### Additional Information

This information is to be given to players who have somehow
managed to do some research on the prison. The Keanou
correctional facility has been modified from the mining camp of the
Orion Metallurgy Corporation, which abandoned the facility nearly
100 years ago. The government makes a modest return, as the
prisoners are given only token amounts for their labour and many
safety regulations are ignored, exposing the prisoners to unhealthy
levels of radiation and airborne rock dust.

Security is not up to the level of the ‘best’ Imperial prisons as the
prison site is surrounded by thousands of kilometers of desert,
inhabited only by dangerous animals. There is only one small city on
Keanou: Circle City, site of the class C starport where the ore mined
at the prison is taken to await transhipment by regular commercial
transport. There is a small additional amount of local trade (mainly
skoggie pelts), although the planet also exports a rare dust-spice.

Prisoners who are of political importance (revolutionary leaders,
foreign spies, or criminals with social standings of 13 or above) are
seldom sent to Tarkwall. The Keanou prison is in the backwaters
of both its sector of space and the Imperial budget. The guards are
poorly paid and overworked, the equipment is old, outdated, and
unsafe, and the warden has come under fire for incompetence.

###### Outside Contacts

A player’s Contacts and Allies may stay in touch during the
character’s time in prison. Mail turnaround time is usually two
weeks per parsec distance from Keanou. Those within a few jumps
of Keanou may even visit the prison. More distant Allies may arrange
for a local agent on Keanou such as V7 Abil Lifnuf or V8 Chandra Lo
to provide support.

##### IINCARCERATEDNCARCERATED

Security checks on what is sent to prisoners are normally very good.
It is extremely difficult to send the proverbial ‘hacksaw in a cake’
to an inmate, with all mail being checked prior to it arriving at the
prison and again at Tarkwall itself. It is not impossible to smuggle
items in this way, but the Ally would have to bribe several different
individuals to ensure the item makes it through (and risks ending
up at Tarkwall himself if any bribery attempt fails).

### APPEALS & PAROLE

There are five ways to leave Tarkwall Prison. A character can escape,
or die in prison. He may also leave legally if he successfully appeals
against his sentence, or if he is paroled. Finally, he may also leave if
he completes his sentence.

###### Parole

A character becomes eligible for parole as soon as he has completed
half of his initial sentence, or if nominated by the prison warden
for early release. A parole board consisting of S1 Warden Grice, V
Inspector Borun and a member of the Keanou council reviews the
character’s case; hearings are conducted in Tarkwall Prison once
every six months.

To obtain parole, a character needs to roll 12+ on 2d6, applying DMs
as follows:

- +1 if the character’s Prison Reputation is -10 or less
- +1 if the character is working in the Safe Zone
- +1 per guard or staff member friendly to the character
- +1 per previous parole attempt
- +2 if the prison psychiatrist or chaplain is friendly to the
    character
- +1 if the character has completed at least one Vocational
    Training course
- +2 per member of the parole board friendly to the character
- +the character’s Advocate skill (or the Advocate skill of the
    character’s hired lawyer)
- +the character’s Social Standing DM
- -1 if the character’s Prison Reputation is 0 or more
- -2 if the character’s Prison Reputation is 20 or more
- -2 per guard or staff member hostile to the character
- -2 if the character is working in the Danger Zone
- -2 if the character was arrested by the Imperial authorities or on
    Keanou
- -4 per escape attempt
- -4 if the chaplain, psychologist or assistant warden is hostile to
    the character
       - -4 per member of the parole board hostile to the character
       - +/- 2 for excellent roleplaying

After a failed parole attempt, a character may not apply for parole
again for 1d6 x 6 months. Groups of characters who entered Tarkwall
together may be considered for parole as a group, however modifiers
can cancel one another out in some situations (if a guard is friendly
to one person in a group but hostile to others, for example, there will
be no modifier applied from either relationship).

###### Appeals

Appeals work the same way as parole, but instead of applying
to the Keanou council, the character is attempting to have his
sentence lifted by whatever court sent him to Tarkwall in the first
place. Appeals can be made at any time, but are extremely costly
and slow, assuming the character was not arrested on Keanou. To
make an appeal, the character needs to hire a lawyer on the world
where he was arrested (or in the subsector capital, if the character
was apprehended in space) and request an appeal be lodged. He
will also need an agent on Keanou to carry communications back
and forth.

It takes 1d6 x 1d6 months for an appeal to be heard after it has been
lodged. To determine if an appeal is successful, roll 2d6 and apply
the following DMs:

- +the character’s Advocate skill (or the Advocate skill of the
    character’s hired lawyer)
- +the character’s Social Standing DM
- +/- any new evidence or testimony available to the character
    (DM of 0 to 4, depending on the importance of the evidence).

If the result of the roll is more than 5+the law level of the world in
question, the appeal is successful and the character is released. He
is given transport to the world where the appeal was heard.

###### Leaving Prison

A character who leaves Tarkwall legally (through parole, appeal or
completion of his sentence) has any equipment and money returned
to him, as well as a new suit of clothes. He is given transport to
Circle City (and middle passage to the world where the appeal was
heard, in the case of characters who successfully appealed their
convictions). Those stuck in Circle City will have to find their own
passage off Keanou.

###### Lawyers for Hire

V7 Abil Lifnuf Advocate 1 50 cr/month
V8 Chandra Lo Advocate 2 25 cr/month, worthy cases only
Jamane Cree Advocate 0 50 cr/month
Sanaster Lifnuf Advocate 0 100 cr/month
Falia Borun Advocate 2 200 cr/month
Hari Selmas Advocate 4 1,000 cr/month

##### THE FIRST WEEK

Entrance into Tarkwall is going to be a harsh experience for the
players. Cut off from their money and resource they will have to
rely purely on their own skills and plans. In a way, it is like starting
from scratch.

Their first week will serve to teach them the basic rules (official and
otherwise) of the prison, and give some indication of what their life
will be like for the next few years. Run through the events here,
before moving on to the weekly system described in _Running the
Adventure_.

## ARRIVAL

The adventure begins as the characters approach Tarkwall prison
for the first time, in the prison shuttle flying them from Circle City
to their new lives behind bars. See page 23 for a fuller description of
the prison shuttle.

Read the following to the players.

## REGISTRATION

At the registration desk, all personal items belonging to the
characters – including clothing – is removed and placed in storage,
leaving the characters naked. The exception are cybernetic implants,
which cannot be removed using the primitive technology available
at Tarkwall. Instead, electronic restraints are used to disable the
cybernetic device.

S7 Clerk Luka runs each character through the registration protocol.
He enters each character’s name, age, homeworld and criminal
record into the computer and checks it against the files sent from
Circle City; he also logs their fingerprints, retina, brainwave patterns
and voiceprints into CARL. He then issues a prisoner number and
cellblock assignment to each character. (See page 133 for Luka’s
form).

Read the following to the players.

# TTHEHE F FIRSTIRST W WEEKEEK

Something in the bowels of this ramshackle shuttle’s engine bangs
every few minutes, smashing down with a noise that reminds you of
a judge’s gavel. You’re all in the back of the shuttle, chained to your
seats. The seats are padded with foam cushions; the cushions are
filthy, torn and completely worn away in places, a sullen testament
to the hundreds of prisoners who have gone ahead of you.

Before they loaded you into the shuttle, they carried off a trio of
coffins. Few people return from this prison.

Through a porthole, you can see the terrain below. Hundreds of
kilometers of desert, scorched a chalky white-blue by the sun, without
a single visible road or landmark or even a drop of water. The shuttle
flits over dune after dune, rocking occasionally as a particular strong
thermal buffets it.

Eventually, the shuttle descends towards the prison. You see a
handful of rust-coloured buildings surrounded by chain-link fences.
Some are derelict, looming out of the desert like bleached skeleton,
but the rest of the ugly, squat buildings are still in use. This, then,
is the prison.

The shuttle lands a short distance outside, and the door grinds
open. It is like opening an freezer, as a wall of cold air hammers
you. Masked guards enter and drag you out. You are marched
across the landing pad to a shed. One by one, you are chained to
a chair in front of a desk...

Keanou is not the most advanced world in the Spinward Marches,
but the technology here in Tarkwall is primitive even by those
standards. The clerk’s bony fingers clatter on a dusty keyboard
attached to an antiquated and flickering screen. ‘ Name?,’ he snaps,
‘ birthworld?’ After inputting your personal details, the clerk presses
another key and a camera turns towards you, photographing your
face, your retinal pattern, and your fingerprints. The camera pauses
for a moment, almost as if it is weighing your chances of survival in
this prison, then withdraws into the desk.

The clerk taps another few keys, then grunts. ‘ Your personal
possessions will be stored until you are released or transferred
from Tarkwall Prison. In the event of your death, your possessions
will be returned to your next of kin, minus a handling fee. If no
next of kin are registered, or if the handling fee cannot be paid,
your possessions will become the property of Tarkwall Prison
and will be disposed of at the pleasure of the warden. Remove
your clothes now, or they will be forcibly removed.’

The characters are then dragged off to another shed, shaved and
sprayed with caustic chemicals. Emerging from the stinging
showers, the characters are issued with their bright orange prison
jumpsuits. They are also issued with up to one hundred credits from
their personal accounts, if they have any savings. They will be paid
for their work in the prison, but the bulk of their personal savings
will be frozen while in Tarkwall, although a referee may allow use of
these funds to pay for any legal fees.

##### THE FIRST WEEK

### MEETING THE WARDEN

After the prisoners have been stripped, registered and deloused,
they are funnelled into the prison yard for an introduction with the
Warden. Read the boxed text to the players.

If any of the players are reckless or stupid enough to take the
Warden up on his offer, the same thing will happen to them – a
quick beating and their first week will be spent in the Danger Zone.
Otherwise, the Warden will instruct the guards to carry on, before
disappearing into the Administrative Block.

###### Administration

Assign a serial number to each player character. These numbers can
be whatever you want, as long as the last digits are not in the range
of 01 to 86.

Fill out a Prisoner Record Form (see page 133) and Prisoner Tracker
for each character. These forms will help you track the characters
during their time in prison. Update the Prisoner Tracker for each
character after every week in prison.

### WHAT TO TELL THE PLAYERS

Many of the facts of prison life should become apparent to the
prisoners, and the referee should tell them everything they would
be likely to know. The prison routine and prison regulations should
be explained immediately. Gradually, the players should be made
aware of ways to get around these regulations (bribing guards,
knowing when nobody is looking, useful lies to tell if caught and
so on).

Very early, the players should be informed the other prisoners are
a surly, uncommunicative lot, who dislike answering questions or
having to put up with “new punks”. As the players gain experience
and reputation, the other prisoners will gradually become friendlier
and more cooperative. The players should eventually get some idea
that there is a pecking order in the prison, plus some conception of
other prisoners’ (and their own) places in it.

The referee should slowly make most of the information contained
in the following sections on security and gang structure available to
the players. When a player character is assigned to some particular
work area, or becomes friends with someone who is, or just asks the
right questions at the right time, the player should be given the gist
of the appropriate area description.

Players should gradually be let in on the possibility of bribing the
guards or the prison staff, and how to go about it. Some hints
should also be given as to ways of obtaining money for bribes in
the first place (stealing negotiable items, gambling, finding gems
in the mining areas, informing on their fellow prisoners to the
prison authorities, begging friends and relatives on the outside to
send credits).

As you are led away, you are assaulted with the terrifying shouts,
insults and threats of the prison population. Behind a chain fence
to your right, scores of men shake the thin barrier between you and
them.

“Here, fishy, fishy.”

“New boys, ripe for slaughter!”

“For you have reaped what you have sown!”

“The tall one’s mine!”

“You’ll never leave here alive!”

The guards push you forward and assemble you into a ragged line,
your backs to the baying mob.

A shout from one of the guards instantly silences the prisoners, and
a portly man approaches you. He walks with a slight waddle and is
slightly balding, but the way one of the guards reports to him clearly
shows respect. When he speaks, it is with a loud, confident voice.

“ My name is Warden Grice. You will address me as Warden or
Sir. You will address the guards as Guard or Sir.

“You have been sent to Tarkwall for your crimes against Imperial
Society. You will be given the chance to atone for those crimes.
And you should be grateful for that chance.

“As you spend your days, months and years here, remember
this. You have no rights. None. You do not even have a name
any more, just a number. You will not use your name, only your
number. The only way you will leave this place and get your
name back is by working hard and staying out of trouble. If you
can do that then maybe, maybe you will be returned to honest
society.

From somewhere down the line, you hear a whisper. “ I’ve seen
Regina Hogs thinner than him! ”

Warden Grice is on to the man in an instant. “ Gorod, attend to
that filth! ”

One of the guards strides past you down the line, and out of the
corner of your eye you see him ram his club into the prisoner’s
stomach. Before the man hits the ground, another two guards drag
him back to his feet.

“ Take him to the Danger Zone, ” shouts the Warden. “ Anyone else
got something to say? ”

##### TTHEHE F FIRSTIRST W WEEKEEK

All the above information should be related in as interesting a way
as possible; the best way is to make each revelation part of an event,
encounter, or incident. It is very important to let the players know
when they are doing something stupid, before they go too far.

The referee should feel free to elaborate on existing material when
players ask questions about things not directly covered here, as long
as it is consistent with the rest of the adventure.

The Cellblocks: Your cell is just like dozens of others along this corridor,
differing only by the number stencilled above the door. A domed light on
the ceiling flickers into dim light as the door opens, illuminating a pair of
battered bunk beds and a metal desk. The chemical toilet in the corner
is leaking, and a yellowish stain creeps across the floor towards your feet.
On one wall, you can make out a series of scratches – blocks of four lines
crossed by a fifth. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...twenty-seven
in all.

Twenty-seven years in this room. Twenty-seven years staring at that
same stone ceiling, listening to the insects crawl through the air vents.

The Cafeteria: You line up in the cafeteria behind the other prisoners.
The trays are cheap plastic; so are the knives and forks, and you suspect
the food might be more lethal than the cutlery. A prisoner wearing a
hygienic hair net and smoking a foul-smelling rolled cigarette dumps a
bowl of slop onto your tray, and flicks the ash from his cigarette into your
food for good measure with an insolent twitch of his lip. The ‘food’ is grey,
sticky and cold, but the other prisoners wolf it down, ravenous after a long
day working in the mines.

The Mines: It is hot down here, and dark. The taller among you has to
stoop to avoid bashing your head off the tunnel ceiling. Machinery grinds
away, crushing the ore into smaller rocks. Soot-stained prisoners toil
away too, smashing rocks with picks and hammers. The overwhelming
din echoes through the tunnel, and sets up a vibration in the front of
your skull that will soon develop into a splitting headache. A guard
gestures towards a pick and a pile of ore. Time to get to work...

###### Female Player Characters

Tarkwall is an all-male prison – but its bureaucracy is cripplingly
inefficient and quite often simply incompetent. Therefore, it
is possible for a female character to be sent to Tarkwall. The
warden will complain about this a great deal, and raise all sorts
of fuss with the Circle City bureaucracy, but will still be stuck
with one or more female prisoners for several years.

Such female prisoners will be placed in the privileged prisoner’s
quarters (location 11 on the surface). They will be treated
identically to the other prisoners, although they will never be
placed in the cellblocks – they will only ever be assigned to the
privileged quarters or solitary. They will also have extra guards
watching them for their own protection.

###### Alien Player Characters

99% of the population of Tarkwall Prison is human; however,
there is already one alien prisoner (6974 The Vargr). Alien
prisoners will be mistrusted and feared by the other human
prisoners, but will be treated no differently by the guards and
prison authorities.

### IMPRESSIONS OF TARKWALL

In the first week, the characters will form their initial impressions of
Tarkwall. Use the descriptions below as a guide when showing the
players where their characters are spending the next few years:

The Surface: _The cold hits you in a frigid blast and you have to push
through. The air has the tang of metal and your lungs burn with each
breath. The prison’s surface buildings are grey concrete boils streaked with
rust, barely distinguishable from the ruined buildings on the far side of
the chain-link fence. The only splash of green is the perfectly-manicured
lawn around the warden’s house; your mouth is dry and dusty, but you
can hear the constant sound of the lawn sprinklers fighting a losing battle
against the elements._

_Beyond the prison, a rocky wasteland stretches to the horizon in every
direction._

The Admin Level: _The elevator brings you down to the administration
level. It is heated, a blessed relief from the cold of the surface. Colour-
coded lines on the floor offer guides to the kitchens, the cafeteria, and
other rooms on this level. Guards are everywhere, watching you from
behind their reflective helmets. There is a constant low-level wheezing
noise in the background, as if the prison was dying of silicosis like so
many of the prisoners._

##### THE FIRST WEEK

# TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

The layout of the Imperial prison on Keanou is not very suited
to its purpose. The major advantage is the facility was cheap.
The conversion to prison from commercial mining camp was
accomplished with only those changes absolutely necessary for
security. All the surface buildings are old; the only additions made
are the perimeter fence, the laser towers, and the swimming pool.
All sub-surface levels are converted mine shafts.

There are five levels in the prison: the surface, the administrative
level (together making up the safe area), the cellblock level, the
normal mining level, and the lower mining level (the danger zone).
Each level is explained and mapped below. Numbers in the text
refer to numbers on the maps.

###### The Lift Shafts

The lift shafts, numbered 1 through 4, are the only means of travel
between levels. Lift shaft 1 carries ore to the surface, and lift shaft 2
is the main elevator for the transport of personnel and equipment.
They are both large and capable of transporting tremendous weights.
The lift shafts are always well guarded, and electronic surveillance
is constant. The lifts themselves are controlled from the surface or
by CARL. Both lifts one and two have decontamination areas (19)
immediately adjacent at the surface. They are used to wash any
radioactive dust particles from people and objects brought up from
the mining levels.

Lift shaft 3 only goes down to the administrative level, and functions
as a laundry chute and dumbwaiter. It might have space for one very
cramped passenger.

Lift shaft 4 collapsed long ago and is no longer in use. Someone
might be able to reach the surface through it after many hours of
quiet and careful digging.

Lift 1 reaches the surface every 30 minutes with a load of ore, which is
unloaded mechanically. Lift 2 makes much more frequent trips, with
small numbers of prisoners or loads of equipment. Guards usually
do not ride up and down in the lifts with the prisoners unless there
is some prisoner who needs exceptionally strict guarding. The lift
machinery is not easily accessible from the inside. Lift 3 is operated
on an erratic schedule.

## THE SURFACE

The prison compound is surrounded by a fence, intended as much
to keep native animals out as to keep prisoners in. The warden’s
residence (5) and the armory (6) are in a separate area surrounded
by a much higher electrified fence. The fence’s electrical charge
deals 1d6 damage when first touched, but the charge is ramped up
to 3d6/round if any weight is placed on the fence’s wires. Climbing

these fences requires Athletics (strength) checks with a total Effect
of 5 (or 10 in the case of the higher fences). Failing by a margin of
2 or less means the character can keep clinging to the fence, but
makes no progress that round.

There are several gates in the fence. All gates have two security
cameras watching them, and a guard post. The gate control are
inside the guard post and require the use of a passkey to activate.

A road leads from the west gate to the shuttle landing field, about a
hundred meters from the gate.

A conveyor belt leads from the ore crusher (18) to a large ore stockpile
about 50 meters away.

5. Warden’s Residence: Warden Grice’s residence resembles a
colonial mansion. It is surrounded by a small green lawn of tough
grass, which needs constant gardening and watering to maintain
in the cold of the desert. Inside, the residence is decorated with
naval memorabilia, such as cutlasses, models of starships and
holograms of famous battles. Grice lives here alone, attended by
a serving robot, except when the warden’s lady friend comes out
from Circle City. Frequently, the warden will go to Circle City for long
stretches of time, leaving the day-to-day running of the prison to his
subordinates, which is just as well considering his abilities.

###### Overpressure

As a protection against the poisonous contaminants in Keanou’s
atmosphere, all buildings, elevators, and the administrative and
cellblock levels are kept at a pressure higher than the outside
atmosphere, using compressors which also filter out the
contaminants. Humans may breathe normally without filter
masks in these areas. Whenever a door to the outside is opened,
a wind blows outward.

###### Air Pumps

Small rusted metal boxes, a meter high and a half-meter across,
are scattered around the grounds of the prison. These are air
pumps, drawing in air, purifying it, and pumping it down through
narrow vents into the underground areas of the complex. Many
of these pumps no longer work, and even more have broken
or exhausted filters, so the air in certain sections of the lower
prison tastes of metal and damages health over the long term.

###### Gas Checks

Uranium ore emits radon gas, which is hazardous to human
health. Therefore, all surface buildings and the subsurface mine
levels have small radon detectors monitoring gas levels. If a
zone’s radon level rises to a dangerous amount, the section is
closed and the air pumped out and replaced.

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

##### THE PRISON TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

6. Armory: This building is stocked with shotguns, auto pistols, and
ammunition for them, as well as other standard guard equipment.
There are also mining lasers, a few automatic rifles, replacement
parts for the laser emplacement, a few revolvers, one laser rifle, and
a vast array of miscellaneous small edged weapons, many of them
confiscated from prisoners.

The armory door requires both a passkey and a code number. Only
the passkeys of a warden or senior guard can open the door; the
code number is known by the wardens, senior guards and a number
of other staff. (It is also rumor 63). A security camera overlooks the
door, and the door can be sealed by CARL, overriding the passkey.

7. Guards’ Living Quarters: These are several very drab buildings.
The senior guards have rooms on the upper floor, with en-suite
bathrooms and a private lounge. On the lower floor, the common
guards have rooms which are little better than cells.
8. Staff Quarters: These are marginally better than the guards’
quarters. Each staff member has his own room, and there is
a communal dining area and kitchen. There is also a library and
computer room.
9. Guards’ Recreation: Most of the guards live for the free days on
which they can drink, gamble, and carouse in Circle City, as the
recreation facility for the guards is only marginally superior to those
pathetic diversions allowed the prisoners. The recreation building is
filled with outdated electronic arcade games, a warped pool table,
some canned video equipment, and posters of the current video
idols.

This building also contains spare quarters for visitors, storerooms
for uniforms and other equipment, a conference room (rarely
used except for on-site hearings), and an access stairwell to the
Administrative level (also rarely used).

10. Swimming Pool: Imperial regulations state each prison facility
of this class should have a swimming pool. The present warden,
however, has not seen fit to have any water put in it. The pool is
domed but not pressurized.
11. Privileged Prisoners’ Quarters: This is a medium security
area for privileged prisoners. It is inhabited mainly by informers
who might get killed down below, occasional prisoners with high
social standings, a number of prisoners too old or feeble to do
any effective mining, and a few of the prison trustees who work
on the administrative level or on the surface. Prisoners may apply
for transfer here if they have reputations of - 10 or less, have not
been assigned to the danger zone or solitary for the last 25 weeks,
and must get a favorable reaction from a staff member (8+). Any
infractions while a prisoner is resident here may result in his return
to the cellblock level. Prisoners assigned here lose 3 from their
prison reputations.
    12. Infirmary: The infirmary has a reputation for being short of
    necessary drugs and sympathetic medical attention. Prisoners may
    end up spending time here due to brawls, work injury, or sickness.

The security in the infirmary is moderately tight. The most stringent
examinations a prisoner usually gets are those to determine if he
has a concealed weapon, has been stealing drugs, or is faking an
illness or injury. Most prisoners who do fake illness or injury are
caught, and even many prisoners who actually are sick or hurt get
sent away. The prison doctor and his trustee medics frequently sell
drugs to the prisoners, and in fact dabble in smuggling illegal non-
medical drugs into the prison, and make a tidy profit while doing
so.

Vitamin supplements are handed out grudgingly (sometimes the
medics attempt to extort money for them).

Normal encounters are not rolled for prisoners in the infirmary,
but the doctor and his medics (1217 Talbot Vinge, 0730 Winston
Urmarush, and 1935 Felip Karageorge) may be encountered freely.
There is always at least one guard present to keep track of the
patients, as well as extensive electronic security.

13. Vehicle Storage and Maintenance: Three ATVs are stored here
as well as some ore-moving equipment. More heavy machinery
is parked outside (22). Also stored in the building are tools, fuel,
spare parts, surveying equipment, desert survival gear and other
miscellaneous equipment. Some of the prisoners who work in repair
on the administrative level are brought up to work on the machinery
here, and when they are, security is fairly tight. At other times the
area is not heavily guarded, and a prisoner who could get to the
building without being seen would have a fairly good chance of
stealing an ATV.

Spare parts for the utility and service robots are also stored here.

14. Laundry: The laundry is operated by prisoners selected on a
rotating basis (although some are kept there full-time). The prison
staff frequently changes the rotation and might be persuaded to do
so for some recompense, or by a very favorable reaction. Security
is good here, with at least one guard always keeping an eye on the
laundry workers, in person or by camera.
15. Guards’ Kitchen: Only very trusted prisoners are allowed to
cook here, and are housed in the privileged prisoners’ quarters. The
guards eat here in shifts, and the food is significantly better than the
slop served to the prisoners.
16. Materials Storage: This building is the initial destination of all
supplies brought to the prison by shuttle from orbit or from Circle
City. Most of it is packaged in crates, and prisoners are occasionally
brought up to move them around. When this happens, security is
tight; at other times the area is locked, but not heavily guarded.

##### TTHEHE P PRISONRISON THE PRISON

17. Quarantine: New prisoners are kept here for a few hours while
they are deloused, checked for infectious diseases, and issued with
prison uniforms.
18. Ore Crusher: Ore is brought up to here in lift shaft 1, crushed to
a uniform size, and transferred by conveyer belt to the ore stockpile.
The ore crusher can be used to dispose of bodies – a person stuffed
into the crusher takes 4d6 damage per round until dead and will be
unable to escape without the machinery being turned off.
19. Decontamination: In these two stations, personnel and
equipment coming up from the mining levels can be washed free
of any radioactive dust they may be carrying. The decontamination
station uses a chemical spray. Officially, prisoners are supposed to
be scanned by a Geiger counter to ensure they have not received a
dangerous dose, but this protocol is rarely observed.
20. Communications Towers: These two towers are radio antennas
for communication with Circle City and ships in orbit.
21. Guard Tower: This tower keeps watch on the prisoners’ recreation
yard; from here, searchlights and machineguns may be trained on
any part of the yard. The searchlights can be controlled manually or
by CARL.
22. Outdoor Vehicle Storage: Mining equipment which will not fit
into building 13 is stored here. Most of this equipment has not been
used in years, and is heavily weathered and non-functional. Under
a plastic tarpaulin are three heavy-duty mining robots which were
bought by the prison from the mining corporation, with the intent of
using the robots to expand the mine or deal with a cave-in.
23. Prisoners’ Recreation Yard: This area is surrounded by a high
electrified fence. Prisoners are sometimes allowed to come here
during their free period, in the evening if it is not too cold outside.
The guards watch only to see the prisoners do not attempt to get
over the fence, leaving them mostly to themselves. The lack of
attention on the part of the guards makes it a good place to talk to
other prisoners or to be knifed by one’s enemies. The area is always
kept well-lit, and is under surveillance from the guard tower.
24. Abandoned Buildings: These are several broken-down buildings,
relics of the old Orion Metallurgy Corporation. They have been
partially cleared away but some parts of the buildings are still
standing. Prisoners are occasionally sent into the ruined buildings
to retrieve building supplies and spare parts. Lift #4 can be accessed
from one of these buildings – the lift is broken, but it is possible
to get from the surface to the Administrative level via the partially-
collapsed shaft.

There are also two access stairs to the lower level in the ruined
buildings. V2 Monte Cristo regularly sleeps in these buildings.

25. Wall: This is a low, earthen construction between the shuttle
landing field and the compound.
26. Laser Emplacement: This is equivalent to a ship’s triple beam
laser turret, and commands the landing field and the surrounding
countryside, as well as providing defence against aerial attack.
27. Fuel Storage: This is a tank holding liquid hydrogen for the
shuttles.
28. Solar Power Farm: These old solar panels, another legacy from
the Orion Corporation days, provide power to the prison. The panels
work automatically, but must be cleared of dust after a storm.
29. Ore stockpile: Ore is carried along the conveyor belt from the
crusher and dropped into a huge metal ore container, a box some six
meters long and three meters square. If the container is full excess
ore overflows and falls to the ground, prisoners are then expected to
go out and gather the loose ore.

The container is collected every few weeks by the ore shuttle, which
drops off a fresh, empty container to replace the full one.

30. Skoggie Kennel: The guards keep a number of desert skoggies
chained up in a kennel on the edge of the desert. The vicious skoggies
make good hunters and guard beasts, but are not an official part of
the prison complement.

##### THE PRISON TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

### THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL

This is the level on which most of the staff and trustees work. Sliding
doors, controlled from the main guard station, can be closed and
locked to isolate any area.

1. Guard Station: The main guard station is located here as the
surface is too distant from most of the prison activity. Usually
2D6 guards can be found here as well as the four who, along with
CARL, monitor the electronic surveillance system. Gas masks and
extra equipment for the guards are stored here. Prisoners are never
allowed in this area for any reason.
2. Administration: The administration area contains the offices of
the prison staff members. Prisoners are only allowed here one at a
time, under heavy guard. There is also a lounge for the prison staff
in this area.

2a. At the back of this area is a locked door leading to a stairwell
leading to the surface (location #9).

3. Computer: This area contains the prison’s main computer,
CARL, which runs the surveillance program as well as various
prison bookkeeping functions. Prisoners are usually not allowed
in this area.

CARL’s main processor is in a secure room. To get to the core,
you have to pass through an airlock (to keep out dust particles)
and use a passcard to open the internal blast door. No-one in
the prison is remotely qualified to repair CARL if it breaks down.
Fortunately, the computer is made up of redundant cores and is
capable of self-repair, cannibalising its own back-up systems to
keep functioning.

4. Records: This area is the domain of the prison clerk. A number of
favored prisoners work here, but security is not overly heavy. The
records department is responsible for all routine bookkeeping and
record keeping functions. Prisoners who work here have access to
computer terminals, but a security program keeps all but the most
clever from being able to interfere with the computer programming.
A Hard (-4) Computers check is needed to bypass the security check;
if the character fails by a margin of 3 or more, the attempt has been
detected, and the prisoner is likely to be punished with the loss of
the easy job as a clerk and an assignment to mining in the danger
zone for the next four weeks.
5. Kitchen: The kitchen is mainly run by prisoners, with fairly tight
camera surveillance. There are few sharp or pointed kitchen utensils
present, and all of these are carefully kept track of. Food, however,
is fairly easy to steal, as it is so bad no one really cares; water
containers could also be stolen by a careful thief.
    6. Cafeteria/Movie Room: The prisoners eat here, with guards
    usually observing from a safe point near lift shaft 2. Prisoners are
    pretty much left to their own devices, although they must turn in
    their plastic utensils before they leave. Prisoners are sometimes
    allowed to watch old movies here during the free time period.
    7. Repair Shop: The repair shop is mainly concerned with the repair
    and maintenance of mining equipment. Trusted prisoners do most
    of the work, under constant surveillance from at least one guard and
    the ever watchful electronic security system.

The repair shop is filled with a large array of useful tools and even
more useful equipment. There is a large amount of broken equipment
present, which is being cannibalized for spare parts. Some of the
smaller pieces of broken equipment might well be stolen with a
reduced risk of detection. A prisoner with Mechanic, Engineering,
or Jack-Of-All-Trades may be able to repair these items. The repair
shop is connected to the vocational rehabilitation area.

8. Vocational Rehabilitation: This area is another sop to Imperial
regulations. Prisoners are occasionally rotated to this area, sometimes
seemingly at the whim of the rehabilitation counsellor. The prisoners
are allowed to take short courses in carpentry, painting, vehicle
repair, industrial safety, appliance repair, food preparation, and so
on. In reality the equipment is old and inadequate, the instruction
is indifferent, and the prisoners’ time is frequently pre-empted to do
woodworking for the warden’s residence. Security is tight, because
even some of the worst prisoners are sometimes allowed into the
vocational rehabilitation program.
9. Storage: These sections of the old mining facility once contained
more mining and refining equipment, but are now used solely for
storage. The doors into this section are kept locked at all times, and
all except the door from the repair shop have been welded shut. The
guards sometimes use the storage section to conduct beatings or
criminal activity out of sight of the cameras. The storage section has
little in the way of useful equipment – it’s a maze of empty rooms,
smashed machinery and dust.

9a. Sealed Stairs: This stair leads up to the abandoned buildings
(location #24 on the surface). The door at the top of the stairs
is kept locked shut; the key is kept in the guard’s station on the
Administrative level. V2 Monte Cristo has made a copy of this key.

9b. Rickety Stairs: The stairs here lead to the abandoned buildings
above, but a leaking water cistern on the surface has sent water
cascading down and the frame of the stairwell is now extremely
rusty. Putting any weight on the stairs may cause it to give way; a
character must make a Difficult (-2) Athletics (dexterity) check to
use the stairs. If this check is failed, the character falls and suffers
2d6 damage.

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

### THE CELLBLOCK LEVEL

The cellblock level is divided into four cellblocks. The player
characters will be placed into one of the first three cellblocks. The
cells in cellblock 4 are used for solitary confinement of prisoners
being punished. Each cellblock operates on a slightly different
schedule for meals, free time, and lockup. This spreads out the load
on the lift capacity, and thus prisoners from different cellblocks
would only meet in work areas. Each cellblock is essentially similar,
with a secure area for the guards near the only open entrance to
the lift shaft corridor. There are heavy doors between the cellblocks
which are always closed when not in use. Security is always heavy,
guards never go anywhere alone, and the security program is always
running when the prisoners are out of the cells.

Each cellblock contains sixty cells, thirty on either side. Each cell
contains two prisoners, except in block 4.

###### The Cell

All the cells in the prison are nearly identical. Three of the walls are stone, cut out of the rock by mining robots, while the fourth wall is
a set of steel bars with a magnetically locked door. In the event of a power failure, a deadlock bolt automatically falls and locks the door
shut. Forcing a door open is virtually impossible (an Athletics (strength) check with a -8 DM).

The floor is covered with rubber matting in some cells; in most, the rubber matting has rotted or been torn up.

A pair of bunk beds stands against one wall. Each bed consists of a metal frame with a plastic mattress glued to it. The pillow is part of
the mattress and cannot be removed. Each prisoner is also issued with a thin grey blanket.

On the far wall from the bunk beds is a chemical toilet and sink. These units must be cleared out on a weekly basis, and regularly jam or
overflow. The chemical toilets contain sniffers which detect signs of drug use, disease or blood. Most cells also have a single table and
chair. Also on this wall is a pair of lockers with, clear plastic doors and no locks, for storage of personal effects.

At the top of the middle wall is fifteen-centimeter air vent. These vents connect to air pumps on the surface.

On the ceiling is a sealed hemisphere containing both the light and the camera for the cell. Theoretically, any tampering to get at the
camera should also damage the light, so the guards can easily check for malfunctioning cameras by turning off all the cell lights. The
camera looks straight down at the cell below through a wide-angle lens.

Hiding Places: There are several potential hiding places for small objects in a prison cell, but the guards know all of them. If a character
tries to hide an object in his cell, and the cell is searched, roll 2d6+the guard’s Investigate skill to determine which places are searched.
All locations with a value equal to or lower than the total rolled are searched by the guards.

##### TTHEHE P PRISONRISON THE PRISON

##### THE PRISON TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

1. Cellblock 1. Cellblock 1 is in the worst condition of any of the
blocks. Several of the cells on the north side are no longer in use
because their ceilings are collapsing; others back onto the ruined
tunnels of the older mines. These latter cells are checked every few
months to ensure the metal walls are still intact.

Cellblock 1 is under the control of 7057 Big Rolf and his gang.
Nothing happens in Cellblock 1 without them noticing, and anyone
assigned to the block will be confronted by the gang and made to
knuckle under or be beaten.

2. Cellblock 2. Cellblock 2 is the busiest and most populated of the
three main blocks. It is also in the best repair. Cellblock 2 has no
ruling gang, but is divided between 2076 Etienne Lalaji and 2977
Anton Kugazur’s nascent gang, the drug dealers, and by the big
gangs from the other two cellblocks.
3. Cellblock 3. Unlike the other cellblocks, cellblock 3’s cells are
all on one side, and the main corridor is considerably narrower. A
yellow stripe on the floor warns the guards to stay clear of the cells,
to ensure they are not grabbed. Cellblock 3 is run by 6866 Gerard
Benezech’s gang.
4. Cellblock 4. The solitary cellblock is the most heavily patrolled of
the four blocks. The guards use serving robots for many tasks here,
to avoid attack by violent prisoners.
5. Bath: Prisoners go to the shower areas once a day after work in
small groups. The corridor past the shower areas, the lift shafts, and
the library is heavily guarded, and only small groups of prisoners are
allowed to move along it at any one time.
6. Library/Commons: Prisoners who are not assigned to the
lower mining level are allowed to visit the library/commons area
during their free time. Library files are stored on CARL, and can
be downloaded to library terminals or portable readers. Access
to a portable reader is a minor perk for trusted prisoners. CARL’s
library is mostly official Imperium publications, old novels, technical
manuals for the Vocational Rehabilitation courses, very, very out-
of-date JTAS issues, and a random selection of other books. More
recent publications and news are occasionally brought in from
Circle City.

Certain types of material cannot be obtained at all, such as books on
demolitions, locksmithing, and so on. The commons is a good area
to talk, although it has not been unknown for guards to listen in at
times through hidden microphones.

### UPPER MINING LEVEL

Most prisoners work on the upper (or main) mining level. The ore
veins on this level are mostly worked out, and much of the work
here involves breaking up the ore mined on the lower level.

Prisoners usually must use picks and shovels in the most primitive
fashion, although the main shafts are driven by heavy equipment

which is controlled and powered from area 2 on this level. If a prisoner
returns without the assigned equipment severe punishments may
be inflicted, and searches may be made for the missing equipment.
On rare occasion the mining engineer comes down and does some
blasting, but all prisoners are kept well away at those times.

When prisoners are assigned to the upper mining level, as all
new prisoners are, throw 1D6 to determine the specific area of
assignment.

1. Area A: This is an old shaft, and has partially collapsed. Ore is
stored here frequently, and prisoners assigned here often are
involved in breaking up the chunks of ore. There used to be another
lift shaft at the end of this area but it collapsed and was abandoned
long ago, although with some careful work it might be possible to
open a small passage through it.
2. Area B: This is the area for equipment storage, and is the guards’
secure area. Prisoners assigned here are usually sent out to bring in
loads of ore from mining areas further away, and are not allowed in
the secure area itself.
3. Area C: This is another area mainly devoted to the storage of ore,
and any prisoners assigned here are usually set to work bringing in
ore from other areas and breaking it up.
4. Area D: This is a shaft which is still being worked for ore, although
it is mainly worked out and the ore is of poor quality. Guards
frequently do not bother to patrol this area. Prisoners or groups of
prisoners are usually assigned quotas of ore for the day and left
to work with relative lack of supervision. Failure to meet quotas
may result in loss of privileges and beatings by the guards, who are
themselves assigned quotas to meet.
5. Area E: This is similar to area 4.
6. Area F: This is also similar to area 4, but connects to area 7 of the
lower mining level.

###### Guard’s Stations

Each guard station follows the same basic layout. There is a
control console controlling all locks and other security measures
in that section of the prison, as well as a bank of monitors
displaying a feed of images from that zone. The console is linked
into the main guard station on the administrative level, and can
be used to access the prison computer network. Underneath the
console is a panic button; there are also panic bars on the walls
within easy reach of the guards.

A secure locker in one wall contains emergency supplies,
including gas grenades and extra weapons. Most guard’s
stations also have another table with cards, entertainment holos,
newspapers and other luxuries.

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

### LOWER MINING LEVEL (THE

### DANGER ZONE)

Most of the economically worthwhile ore comes from this level.
Health and safety conditions are worse than on the upper mining
level, and this level is also known as the danger zone. It is general
policy to send prisoners here for real or imagined violations of prison
rules, and indeed some prisoners feel the guards may have a “quota”
of prisoners which must be sent down here in a week, so there will
be enough miners on this level. Guards patrol this level only rarely,
and then only in large trigger-happy groups; they generally stay put
in the area where equipment is stored, and near the two lift shafts.
A quota system is also in effect on this level, and guards are very,
very careful when handing out tools to the more violent population
of prisoners on this level. Quotas on this level are higher than on
the upper level, and prisoners sometimes steal from and fight each
other in order to make their quotas.

When a prisoner is sent to this level, throw 2D6 to determine his
area of assignment.

1. The Hole: This is a ten-meter-deep shaft with steep sides that
are impossible to climb. Prisoners who have crossed the guards

are sometimes dumped into the hole for a week. The hole is highly
radioactive, and spending too long here is a death sentence.

###### The Mines

A character working in the mine will be assigned a role based on his skills. There are several special work assignments available, each
of which is available only to the character with the highest appropriate skill.

Mechanic 2 or more: Repairing machinery and equipment. This gives the character ample opportunity to steal parts and tools.

Engineering 2 or more: Assistant to the mining engineer. The character works with S9 Alvin Sebriesk as an aide, overseeing the expansion
of the mining works. This is a good opportunity for the character to befriend Sebriesk.

Explosives 2 or more: The character is placed in charge of the explosives for the mine. A guard watches over the character all the time,
ensuring no explosives go missing.

If the character has no suitable skills, or if the cushy work assignments are already filled, then the character must work in the mine as a
common labourer, cutting ore out of the rock face or pushing carts of stone back and forth to the lift. A character working as a common
labourer must make an Endurance check each day, with a +1 DM if the character is taking vitamin supplements; if this check is failed,
the character is exhausted at the end of the day and suffers a -1DM to all rolls until he rests.

Hiding Places: Like the cells, there are several hiding places in the mines. If a character tries to hide an object in the mines, and the
mines are searched, roll 2d6+the guard’s Investigate skill to determine which places are searched. All locations with a value equal to or
lower than the total rolled are searched by the guards.

8 In a crevice or hole in the upper mines*
9 Under rocks in the lower mines

###### Condemned to the Hole

A character in The Hole must make an Endurance check (+1 if the
character has vitamin supplements, -2 if the character is without
a water supply) each day. If this check is failed, the character
loses one Endurance. A character reduced to 0 Endurance in the
Hole is in danger of dying; roll 8+ to avoid dying each day, using
the same modifiers as above.

2. Area Q: This is largely worked out tunnel.
3. Area I: This area is labelled as an extremely radioactive danger
area, but it is actually fairly clean. It is used as a meeting place by
the prisoners, since guards never come here.
4. Area M: This area has a concealed entrance to a system of natural
caves. Several prisoners know the location of the connection, but
none of them have sufficiently explored the caves to have found
any other exit. Cave bats and other small creatures occasionally
find their way into the mine from the cave, and this shows there

must be a natural entrance somewhere, or these creatures would
not have been able to obtain food in the first place. Rumors have it
a number of prisoners have gone into the cave system, never to be
seen again; whether they escaped or were lost forever in the depths
is unknown.

5. Area K: This is an area in which active mining of a rich vein of ore
takes place.
6. Area J: This is similar to area 5.
7. Area G: This is similar to areas 5 and 6, but there is a ramped
connection to area 6 on the upper mining level. This connection is
not usually used for anything important as the lifts are usually closer
and more efficient. The connection is closed off by a strong metal
door, but a determined assault might succeed in breaching it.
8. Area H: This area has a bad reputation for collapses of rock,
although it may not be much worse than the rest of the level.
9. Area L: This is another area in which active mining is taking
place.
10. Area N: This is an older, worked out mining area.
11. Area O: This is another largely worked out tunnel, which is
frequently used by the prisoners as a hiding place for contraband
items.
12. Area P: This area is labelled as extremely radioactive, and
deserves its reputation. Prisoners are usually assigned to this area
only for one week before being sent to a different area.
13. Equipment Storage: Some mining equipment is stored in this
area. This is also the guards’ safe area; prisoners are never allowed
inside, and the guards on this level seldom venture out.

### THE NATURAL CAVE SYSTEM

There is a natural limestone cave system connected to the lower
mining level, area M, by a narrow passage. The cave was formed
eons ago by slowly dripping ground water that has since mostly
dried up. The guards do not know about the cave, although rumors
of cave animals present in the mine have reached their ears.

A limited amount of exploration has been conducted by the
prisoners, some of whom have vanished into the depths. The
ceiling varies from 1 to 3 meters in height, as marked on the map.
Movement through the cave is extremely slow, and some source of
light is necessary for any movement whatsoever. Passages marked
on the map by dotted lines may be located only with a successful
Intelligence check or by previous knowledge.

There are a few small life-forms in the caves (such as cave bats)
which may be eaten if captured, as well as a few remaining trickles
of water. The natural entrance is within view of the prison during
the day; a Routine (+2) Stealth check is needed to avoid be seen
when exiting, since guards seldom look in that direction. At night
there should be no difficulty. The area outside the prison is never
searched unless prisoners are known to have escaped to the outside
within the last few weeks.

Roll 2D6 for an encounter on the table below each time the prisoners
pass through the caves.

RollRoll Cave EncounterCave Encounter
2 Falling Rocks – roll Recon to avoid taking 3d6

###### The Alien Outpost

Optionally, an alien outpost may exist beneath the prison – see
Alien Legacy, page 99 for details. This outpost may be discovered
at the Referee’s discretion, or on a roll of 12 on the cave encounter
table.

##### THE PRISON THE PRISON

##### THE PRISON TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

### PRISON VEHICLES

Most of the vehicles in use in Tarkwall date back to the Orion
Metallurgy era, and are barely functional rust-buckets which spend
more time in the repair shed than on the road. The warden’s flyer
is the only modern vehicle regularly seen in the prison. Most of the
vehicles were built in the nearby system of Treece (TL8), although
the robots were imported from Dinom (TL10).

###### ATV

The prison has three ATVs, stored in surface location 13.

The all-terrain vehicles are half-tracked transports. The driver’s
compartment at the front has space for up to three passengers,
including one riding shotgun at the roof hatch. There is a small
cabin behind the driver’s compartment, containing a fold-out bunk
bed and a hot plate as well as supply lockers. The flatbed at the
rear of the ATV can be covered with a canvas shade or loaded up
with cargo. Another four people can fit in the ATV in comfort; when
packed, it can carry up to ten in the rear compartment.

The ATV’s engine is adapted for use in the desert, and includes sand
baffles and extra radiators to keep it cool. The vehicle has a limited
water recycling capacity.

Stealing an ATV: The ATVs have both an ignition key and a swipe
reader for the guard’s keycards; one or the other is needed to activate
the vehicle. Alternatively, the ignition system can be bypassed with
a Very Difficult (-4) Mechanic or Streetwise check or a Difficult (-2)
Engineering (electronics) check. ATVs use the Drive (tracked) skill.

Sneaking onto an ATV: If the ATV is not carrying passengers in the
rear, then it is easy enough (Routine Stealth check) to hide amid the
cargo at the back of the vehicle. If the ATV is carrying passengers,
it is almost impossible (Very Difficult). The prison ATVs rarely go
more than a few kilometers from Tarkwall.

###### Ore Shuttle

The Orion corporation’s ore shuttle is a flying brick, little more than
a small cockpit atop a huge cargo bay, with a barely adequate anti-
gravity generator powered by a small fusion reactor keeping the
whole thing in the air. Stubby wings and variable-direction thrusters
give the vehicle a modicum of control in the air. Theoretically, the
shuttle is rated to reach orbit, but even getting to Circle City with a
full load of ore taxes the engines to their limits, and the shuttle has
not broken the atmosphere in decades. Another two ore shuttles sit
in a back yard at the Circle City spaceport; one is being cannibalised
for parts, and the second’s anti-grav is so badly shot it could fall out
of the air at any moment.

The ‘cargo bay’ has three docking clamps for carrying the huge ore
containers, but two containers are now permanently welded onto
the shuttle. The middle clamp is still free, and is used to pick up the
ore containers from the prison. The port container is used to carry

excess ore, and must be loaded by hand or using the Loading Robot.
The starboard container carries more supplies for the prison. None
of the containers are pressurised or heated.

The shuttle has a crew of three – a pilot, a cargo-master and a
security officer armed with a shotgun. Usually, these are contractors
from Circle City instead of full-time Orion employees.

Stealing the Ore Shuttle: The ore shuttle lands at the prison once
every few weeks. Before it lands, the conveyor belt carrying the
crushed ore is halted and its mobile arm is moved to one side. The
shuttle then drops off an empty cargo container, and then lands
on top of the full ore container. If there is a lot of excess ore lying
around, then the shuttle waits while the extra ore is loaded into the
port container. Prison supplies are unloaded by the guards, or by
trusted prisoners. The pilot stays in the shuttle’s cockpit the whole
time; the cargo-master oversees the loading of the ore, and the
security officer roams around the shuttle, keeping watch. A Very
Difficult (-4) Stealth check is needed to sneak past the security
officer, unless he can be distracted somehow.

The shuttle is activated by a keycode known to the pilot and cargo-
master. It is Very Difficult (-4) to hack the keycode using Electronics
or Computers.

Sneaking Onto The Ore Shuttle: A character can hide in the full ore
container, although there is a good (8+ on 2d6) chance the ore will
be checked by the cargo-master, so the prospective stowaway should
bury himself in the ore. The shifting ore will inflict 2d6 damage on
the character during the flight. A character can also try sneaking
past the security officer to hide in the starboard cargo container with
the prison supplies.

In either case, a character without an oxygen supply must make a
Very Difficult (-4) Endurance check to stay conscious. Unconscious
characters will be captured at Circle City.

###### Prison Shuttle

The prison shuttle is smaller than the ore shuttle, and is in marginally
better conditioning, mainly due to repairs carried out by S8 Corvas
Doll. It is not space-worthy in the slightest, but is perfectly adequate
for hauling prisoners back and forth from Circle City. The passenger
shuttle travels to Circle City two or three times a week.

The two-seater cockpit is located at the front of the shuttle, and
connects to the passenger/cargo section just behind it. This space
can hold up to six passengers, but is normally full of crates of food
and other prison supplies. There is one exit hatch to the exterior
from this room, as well as a heavily reinforced door leading to the
prisoner bay. The prisoners are kept in the rear passenger bay.
There are two entrances to this bay; one from the forward passenger
compartment, and the back wall folds down into a ramp. Up to
twenty prisoners can be carried by this bay, held in four rows of five.
Each row has manacles for the prisoners’ arms and legs. Warning

##### TTHEHE P PRISONRISON

lights above each prisoner seat show whether or not a manacle is
unlocked and whether or not there is a limb in the manacle.

In addition to the manacles, the bay has security cameras watching
the prisoners, as well as a sleep-gas tank which can be activated
from the cockpit.

Stealing the Prisoner Shuttle: Overriding the shuttle’s security
system is Very Difficult (-4) using Electronics or Computers. Corvas
Doll has also installed a second security system, which will only
be found on close examination of the floor of the shuttle’s cockpit.
There is a concealed panel in the floor, which covers an automatic
cut-off switch to the shuttle’s engines. If this switch is not pressed
two minutes after the shuttle takes off, then the security system
will steadily reduce the shuttle’s engine power, forcing it to land.
The shut-off is gradual enough to allow the thief to easily land the
shuttle safely, but ensures the shuttle will be forced down within a
few kilometers of Tarkwall.

Sneaking Onto The Prisoner Shuttle: There are no easy hiding
places in the front half of the shuttle, in the front compartment or
the cockpit. A character could hide in the prisoner bay at the rear, if
the rear ramp was down or he knew the code to the heavy door from
the front compartment.

###### Warden’s Flyer

Warden Grice has a small enclosed flyer, a sporty little g-craft which
was a retirement bonus from the Treece Navy. It is in excellent
condition and spotlessly clean. The flyer can carry up to three people.
It is kept in a garage next to the warden’s house; he sometimes flies
himself to Circle City, but usually takes the prisoner shuttle.

Stealing The Warden’s Flyer: The garage holding the flyer is kept locked,
and the flyer’s activation key is kept in the safe in the warden’s house.

Sneaking Onto The Warden’s Flyer: Next to impossible; there is no
cargo space on the flyer big enough to hide a stowaway.

### PRISON ROBOTS

Tarkwall has a small number of robots, all of which can act
independently or be remotely controlled by the central computer.
Of the robots, only the service robots are regularly encountered by
the prisoners.

###### Loading Robot

The lone loading robot is an automated pocket bulldozer, used
for gathering loose ore and for hauling cargo containers. It has
a pushing blade at one end and a lifting arm at the other, and is
painted a bright yellow now mottled with patches of rust and oil.
The robot is programmed not to go beyond the ore loading area in
the course of its normal operations.

###### Mining Robots

Three mining robots are kept under tarpaulins in location 22 on the
surface. These heavy-duty mining machines are humanoid in shape,
squat and ugly, with hydraulic lines running like thick veins through
their blocky limbs. Each robot is equipped with a mining laser and a
powerful drill, as well as scoops and hammers. The robots can also
have mobile mining shields, allowing them to support the tunnel
roof as they progress through the rock.

###### Service Robots

The prison has a half-dozen serving robots, which are self-propelled
carts with a single robot arm. The serving robots are used to deliver
food or supplies to dangerous prisoners in solitary confinement.
Each robot is equipped with an emergency taser system that stuns
anyone touching the robot.

##### THE PRISON

The various non-player characters of the prison form an important part of the player characters’ environment. The characters listed below
should not be considered to be the entire prison population, only those worthy of note. There are many other prisoners and guards, but
these are faceless spear-carriers as far as the players are concerned.

The non-player characters listed below are given in the standard Traveller format, with additional information to help the referee in playing
their parts.

###### Prisoners

Each prisoner has a four-digit prison number; the first two digits are purely cosmetic, while the last two are significant and are the same as
the prisoner’s die roll on the encounter table (if any). Prisoners are listed below in numerical order, by the last two digits; thus prisoner 0166
would be listed after prisoner 9901. In addition to name, UPP, age, possessions, and skills, each prisoner’s listing gives his prison reputation
and his cellblock/number of cellmate. Comments below give his work assignment (if other than the upper mining level), rumors he knows,
descriptive traits for roleplaying, and any other facts of use to the referee. Listed assignments are what the prisoners have when they first
come into contact with the player characters, and might change as a result of some action taken during the course of the adventure.

Subotai is a drug addict and thug who takes his orders from 1217 Talbot Vinge. The whites of his eyes have turned blue due to extensive use
of Ambrosia. Subotai rarely speaks, and when he does he spits his words with fierce intensity.

Subotai was Vinge’s bodyguard and thug outside of prison, and both were arrested at the same time. Unknown to Subotai, Vinge implanted
several sacs of experimental bioweapons inside Subotai’s lungs; these sacs went undetected by the imperial officers who arrested them,

supporter of the terrorist organization and has been slowly drawing away from his former friend. He has thrown himself into study of the
law, and is a useful resource for characters who plan to mount an appeal against their convictions.

Bobby willingly informs on anyone. He is invariably friendly in an oily sort of way, and would rat on his friends, if he had any. The guards
have given him a commdot, a concealed communicator, but most of the time they do not bother listening to his transmissions. Instead,
they divert his messages to CARL, which is unfortunate – Bobby’s cellmate 6533 Arpad Nisha is a telepath who talks in his sleep, and Bobby

Commander Gant, as he prefers to be called, is one of the few Imperial military commanders ever to be tried and convicted of an atrocity

- during a war with a rebellious border noble, Gant ordered his commandos to board and capture the noble’s flagship. He then programmed
the flagship to crash into the planetary fortress below. Thousands died when the ship smashed into the castle at hundreds of kilometers
an hour. Relations of the dead noble used their influence to ensure Gant was incarcerated at Tarkwall, rather than a more suitable military

Big Rolf is the reigning power in cell block 1, and brooks no rivals. The big man hails from the Sword Worlds, and
was the archetypical spacefaring barbarian until he ran afoul of Imperial naval patrols. Since his incarceration, Rolf
has become the terror of the prison. Assistant Warder Voller believes the best way to keep order in the prison is
to let Rolf dominate the cell block, so Rolf is tacitly permitted to retain his cutlass, a relic of his pirate days. If Rolf
keeps the other inmates in check, then he gets to stay king of his own filthy little domain.

Lately, Rolf’s arrangement with the warder has begun to collapse, as the gang becomes more violent and vicious.
Any gang coming close to challenging Rolf’s authority will be quietly asked if they will observe the same arrangement
as Rolf did. If they refuse, then the guards will be ordered to crack down on the gang. If they accept, then they will

forces operative in the planetary militia of a highly advanced world; his physique is engineered to perfection, and he has several cybernetic
implants. As part of his prison sentence, some of these implants were crudely removed, leaving ghastly scars. Others were embedded too
deeply in Amgi’s cerebral cortex to be removed, so the prisoner was fitted with electronic restraints in Circle City. These restraints take
the form of white plastic attachments to the side of Amgi’s neck and spine. The doctors told him if any of the restraints are removed, the

by Zhodani telepaths, or by aliens, or by the Space Devil, but the truth is Jack is psychologically damaged and should be in a padded cell,
not a prison.

###### 0571 Ashgu the Ape

STR 10 DEX6 END10 INT2 EDU3 SOC2
Age 32 Rep 10 Block 3/4355
Skills: Melee (brawling) 2, Athletics (strength) 2, Recon 1, Stealth 1, Melee (blade) 1, Gun Combat 0, Streetwise 0
Traits: Hairy arms, grunts a lot
Assignment: Danger zone.
Ashgu doesn’t like people. This trait suited him when he was the enforcer for a criminal gang, breaking skulls for pay, but now he is in prison
and has no allies or friends because of his anti-social ways. Ashgu is hated by many in the prison community, and few would mourn if the
Ape met with a convenient ‘accident’ in the Danger Zone. Ashgu reacts at -2 to everybody.

###### 6072 Kahan Tell

STR10 DEX6 END6 INT6 EDU 6 SOC4
Age 37 Rep 0 Block 1/1451
Skills: Melee (blade) 2, Melee (Brawling) 1, Diplomat 2, Zero-G 0, Vacc Suit 1, Battle Dress 2, Gun Combat (energy rifle) 2, Steward 0
Possessions: Cold light lantern Traits: Military Bearing, Very Polite
Assignment: Danger zone. Rumors: 10, 14, 30.
Kahan is almost ridiculously polite, but is easily offended with violent results. Kahan is an ex-marine, and one thing which offends him
instantly is ex-naval personnel. He loathes Warden Grice and 2943 Milovan Gran, and has a cautious friendship with 8046 Satoishi Honig,
but has as yet refused to commit to joining Honig’s planned uprising. Kahan was convicted of selling military secrets to a rival duke. The
ex-marine still has information worth selling, and is occasionally contacted by agents of the duke, who try to persuade him to spill more
secrets in exchange for legal aid.

Assignment: Danger zone. Rumors: 15, 40, 48.
Killer belongs to Gerard Benezech’s gang. His name is something of a misnomer – ‘Killer’ got his name when his nerve broke and he failed
to fire on a police officer. If he had that killer instinct, Basimu would never have been arrested. Since then, Basimu has become much more
bitter and ruthless, and is a terror of cell block 3. He works for 6866 Gerard Bezenech, and has no idea Bezenech is not the real head of the
gang.

###### 7575 Avram Iijima

Possessions: Blade Traits: Tattoos, chants a lot.
Assignment: Danger zone. Rumors: 7, 49.
Avram is an adherent of a weird religious group called the Cult of the Traveller, who believe God is travelling incognito through the universe
in human form. One of the tenets of the Cult is human sacrifice (seen as an attempt to communicate with God), which is why he ended up
here. He attempts to convert other prisoners, but is usually scorned.

Anyone may gain him as a friend by becoming a convert; however, this reduces one’s prison reputation by 5.

###### 2076 Etienne Lalaji

Possessions: Cr100, SMG, 30 rounds of ammo Traits: Nervous, pocked skin
Assignment: Danger zone. Rumors: 3, 10, 1 5, 30, 40, 48, 50.
Etienne and a departed friend (Jan ‘the Blade’ Lintrel) killed a guard and hid his shotgun in the danger zone. The guards increased security
for nearly a year, but didn’t find it. Etienne knows where the gun is buried, but is too scared of losing the weapon to another prisoner to risk
going to retrieve it. At the same time, he worries it will be found if he does not watch over it, so he arranges to get him himself assigned to
the Danger Zone whenever he finishes his current punishment detail – usually by assaulting a guard or another prisoner.

Long exposure to the Danger Zone is sapping Lalaji’s health, and he has started buying vitamin supplements and anti-rad drugs.

Assignment: Danger zone. Rumors: 1 5, 47, 48.
Anton is a ruthless killer and a good friend of 2076 Etienne Lalaji. Together they shake down unwary prisoners. He knows about Lalaji’s
hidden shotgun, but so far Lalaji has not trusted Anton with the weapon’s location. Kugazur was a boxer before getting involved in a
gambling syndicate and is trying to organise a prison boxing tournament with the aid of some of the guards.

A mercenary wanderer far from home, the Vargr is a victim of his unfamiliarity with Imperial law. His true name
is something like Krrcrr, but everyone in the prison just calls him by his species. His teeth have been capped with
plastic to prevent him from using his bite attack on others. These caps also impede the Vargr’s ability to speak,
further isolating him in the prison.

These prisoners are not initially part of the prison population, but arrive later while the characters are inmates at Tarkwall. Their serial

Possessions: Cr100 Traits: Oily, local connections
Trook is a con man and shyster; he knew he was doomed to be sent to Tarkwall months before his case came to trial, so he took steps to
prepare the prison for his arrival. He started bribing guards long before he arrived; he has already hired a lawyer to appeal his case, and set
up a regular schedule of visitors to call on him in prison so he can smuggle goods in and out. Mere weeks after he arrives, Trook establishes
himself as Tarkwall’s pre-eminent fixer.

Age 24 Rep 0 Block 1/9091
Skills: Melee (brawling) 2, Investigate 1, Athletics (strength) 1, Athletics (endurance) 1, Drive 0, Comms 0
Traits: Burly, quiet
A year ago, Zemich was one of the guards at Tarkwall. During a visit to Circle City in the company of his friends G8 Karass, G16 Marushich
and G18 Danessur. Zemich got into a brawl with a trio of skoggie hunters. Two of them died as a result of injuries when a drunken Danessur
pulled a knife. Zemich wrestled the knife off the younger guard. The whole situation threatened to bring down Warden Grice, so he ordered
the other guards to throw Zemich to the wolves. Zemich was painted as a dangerous unstable thug who was on the verge of being fired

Now, he is back in Tarkwall, and already he is hated by the other guards. Zemich is torn between trying to keep his head down and getting
through his sentence, and fighting back against the corrupt system which blamed him for Danessur’s crimes. If anyone befriends Zemich,
they earn the hatred of every guard in Tarkwall and the personal enmity of Warden Grice, but they do get to tap the ex-guard’s knowledge
of Tarkwall security.

Coster is a small-time thief and scrab addict, arrested for stealing goods from the spaceport. He is willing to do anything for cash or drugs.
Unless the characters befriend him and channel his nervous energy to their own ends, he dies a very messy death in the Danger Zone at
the hands of Big Rolf as a punishment for stealing from the gang.

Traits: Skeletally thin, bushy beard Rumors: 12
Noil was a belt miner in a neighboring star system; he was convicted of claim jumping and attempted murder after a dispute with another,
equally ornery miner and sent to Tarkwall. Noil has spent long years in low gravity, and his body has yet to adjust to the stresses of living
dirt-side. The eccentric old miner is also poorly socialised; his friends were little images on the console of his mining ship. If the characters
befriend Noil and protect him from the prison gangs, then the old miner can provide technical expertise and information on the Keanou
system.

Possessions: Cr500, comm Traits: Inquisitive, tattooed
Row is not a prisoner at all, he is a journalist from a news agency based on Dinomn, a world six parsecs spinward of Keanou. He is here
to investigate 2943 Milovan Gant – or, as he is known back on Dinomn, the butcher. Gant was responsible for a vicious attack on civilians
during a territorial dispute on Dinomn, and the people of that world want to know what has become of their hated enemy. The Imperium
would prefer to sweep Gant’s misdeeds under the carpet entirely, so Row has been forced to use unorthodox means – such as getting
himself arrested and bribing clerks to have him sent to Tarkwall.

As soon as Row has gathered enough information about Gant, his news service will arrange for ‘new information’ to come to light,
exonerating the journalist.

STR7 DEX6 END8 INT6 EDU7 SOC5
Age 20 Rep 0 Block 3/9095
Skills: Mechanic 1, Stealth 0
Possessions: Desert map, survival gear Traits: Dark skin, nervous
Friedrich is the younger brother of 6533 Arpad Nisha. He intends to break his sensitive older brother out of prison. He has dumped a cache
of food, water and survival gear on a desert peak north of the prison, and his plan is to sneak Arpad over the fence at night and then head
for the cache. He believes, with luck, they can _walk_ back to Circle City.

### GUARDS

The prison guards are listed in numerical order. Guards 1 through 12 are commonly encountered. Guards 13 through 18 have jobs which put

Rumors: 4, 16. Traits: Sadistic
Fedor is assistant warden Voller’s right hand man, and is in charge when the assistant warden is not around. Fedor is a brute and a sadist,
who enjoys the power he wields, especially when Voller is absent. He is a moderately competent commander of his guards – he has his
inner circle of trusted henchmen (G3, G6, G14, G15 and G18) whom he allows free reign in dealing with problems, but he closely watches
the other guards.

Fedor is known for his sadism; he enjoys making prisoners debase themselves, fight for his entertainment, or suffer in The Hole.

Skills: Gun Combat (slug rifle) 1, Melee (brawling) 2, Admin 0, Investigate 2, Athletics (strength) 2, Computers 2, Engineering 0
Traits: Stickler for protocol
One of the more conscientious guards, Ivan is forever attempting to raise the standard of prison security, and complains vociferously
about the failings of his fellow guards. He will also investigate any allegations of guard brutality, mistreatment or illegal activity, although
Assistant Warden Voller normally ignores Ivan’s reports. Ivan is immune to the lure of bribery - any bribery attempt will land the offender
in the danger zone for 4 weeks.

Traits: Terrifying
Equipment: Subdermal armor (2)
Also known as the Beast, Gorod is Voller’s attack hound and bruiser. The Beast is an ex-soldier who suffered a wound to the head on some
distant battlefield; he is often lost in his hallucinations, seeing Voller as his commanding officer and the prisoners as the enemy, but even
when lucid, Gorod is a tyrannical brute who actively enjoys the sight of blood. He has no friends or even contacts among the prisoners, and
is uniformly feared.

###### G4 Cesmo Wallenstein

STR7 DEX8 END6 INT8 EDU6 SOC5
Skills: Gun Combat (Slug Rifle) 2, Tactics (military) 1, Drive (tracked) 1, Investigate 2, Admin 0, Advocate 1, Computers 0
Rumors: 5,9. Traits: Calm
Cesmo plays Go, and is favorably impressed by any prisoner who will play against him. He is the youngest of the guards, and took the job
in the prison to support his family in Circle City while he studies for his future career. He regularly leaves the prison to visit the city, and is
sometimes willing to carry messages to the starport for prisoners he trusts.

In Cesmo’s quarters, along with his Go board, he keeps a spare communicator, geiger counter and a toolkit. Anyone playing Go with him
has a good chance of being able to steal these items.

###### G5 Emil Patowic

STR6 DEX9 END4 INT7 EDU6 SOC7
Skills: Gun Combat (slug rifle) 2, Streetwise 3, Gambler 2, Stealth 0, Broker 2, Admin 1, Investigate 0
Rumors: 4, 7. Traits: Shyster
For Emil Patowic to be a prison guard is a clear sign the system just does not work, as Emil is a bigger criminal than half the prisoners.
Emil engages in every form of criminal activity from bribery and corruption to drug dealing and smuggling. No roll is necessary for Emil to
actually go through with any smuggling he is bribed into, but he still charges full price.

In addition to smuggling, Emil acts as a messenger and recruiter for criminal groups outside Tarkwall. If a criminal syndicate or gang needs,
say, a shuttle pilot, a gunman and a hacker, then Emil reviews the prison files and identifies prisoners with those skills who are due for
release in a short period. He has also paid for ‘accidents’ to happen to prisoners who have enemies outside in the real world.

###### G6 David Obrenov

STR10 DEX8 END9 INT7 EDU7 SOC7
Skills: Gun Combat (Slug Rifle) 1, Admin 2, Drive (tracked) 1, Computer 1, Investigate 1
Rumors: 16, 26. Traits: Officious
David is very officious and spends his time putting additional black marks on people’s records, but he occasionally loosens up enough to
be approachable. Unsurprisingly, his one friend is G2 Ivan, who often share a bottle of Keanou cactus liquor and complain about the prison
management.

He has a crippling fear of cramped spaces, but has kept this trait a secret from the other guards and staff. When assigned to patrol the
Danger Zone, he tries to swap his shift with another guard; if this fails, he stays in the wider, better lit areas or takes sedative drugs.

###### G7 Karl Ulashan

Skills: Gun Combat (slug rifle) 1, Melee (blade) 1, Engineering (Electronics) 1, Investigate 0, Navigation 0, Stealth 0, Survival 0, Recon 0
Rumors: 14, 28. Traits: Cheerful
Karl is probably the nicest and most helpful of the guards, which is not saying much. He treats the prison as just another job, and while he
sticks to the rules, he is willing to help prisoners who need assistance as long as it does not cost him anything. In his spare time, he goes
hiking in the desert around the prison, exploring the wilderness. His locker in the security building contains survival equipment including
a map box and a desert survival suit.

Rumors: 11. Traits: Clumsy
Alvim is probably the most careless guard about security, and is frequently reprimanded about it. He is overweight
and lazy, and more willing than most guards to use the stunstick setting of his baton to deal with problems.
Assistant Warden Voller despises Karaas, and assigns him the worst jobs in the prison.

Rumors: 2 , 5 , 11 , 1 9 , 28, 29, 32. Traits: Drunkard
Harv is frequently drunk on duty (roll 6+); if drunk when encountered he will spill one of his rumors (referee’s choice). He is often seized by
violent rages, during which he drags random prisoners out of their cells and torments them. He is also an avid hunter, roaming the desert
around the prison on his ATV with a shotgun in one hand and a bottle of cactus juice in the other.

Rumor: 8. Traits: Nervous
Semyon may be bribed for half price; he has large gambling debts, most of which are owed to G14 Paul Hindin, S9 Alvin Sebriesk and 9656
Olex Hishinuma. He has accepted money from 6866 Gerard Benezech to pay previous debts, and now informs on prison activity for the
gang lord. So far, he has drawn the line at supplying equipment or weapons, but has overlooked beatings or smuggling attempts in the
past.

Traits: Sneering
Krane actively loathes the prisoners (automatic reaction of 2 instead of rolling), and goes out of his way to make their lives hell. He spends
most of his time monitoring the computer data and the camera feeds, searching for trouble. He invariably sends prisoners to the Danger
Zone rather than beating them.

Rumors: 28. Traits: Offworlder
Unlike most of the other guards, Donan is not a native of Keanou. He comes from Edenelt in the Trin’s Veil subsector, all the way on the
other side of the Spinward Marches. He was working passage on various tramp traders and freighters, but ended up stuck in a low berth.
On arrival at Keanou, the thawing process went wrong, leaving Donan hospitalised and in debt. He has been stuck working in Tarkwall for
the last four years, and hates it, taking out his frustration on the prisoners. However, he has more in common with many of the inmates
than he does with the guards, some of whom have never been offworld in their lives.

Donan hates psionics (even more than most of the other guards), and reacts at -4 to any psionic encountered, or to anyone in the company
of a psionic.

Skills: Gun Combat (rifle) 2, Drive (tracked) 1, Mechanic 2, Investigate 1, Medic 1, Comms 0, Stealth 0, Navigation 0.
Rumors: 2. Traits: Just
Brandt is usually honest and fair, and attempts to break up fights, but usually isn’t around – his primary responsibility is patrolling the
bounds of the prison and maintaining the solar power farm. He is a quiet man, who prefers solitude and the open desert air to the crowded
subterranean levels of the prison. He frequently argues with G9 Harv Wuckel over the latter’s behaviour.

Skills: Gun Combat (rifle) 2, Gambler 1, Computers 3, Comms 1, Sensors 1, Engineering 0, Investigate 0
Rumors: 4, 49, 51. Traits: Thin and pale
Paul runs the guards’ pool on new prisoners, in which the guards bet on the first of an incoming group to die. He is also in charge of
computer security routines, which means he knows more about the workings of CARL than anyone else in Tarkwall. Paul knows the
computer is behaving oddly, but has no idea how to moderate its behaviour or correct the growing problems, so he has concealed CARL’s
idiosyncrasies from the senior staff out of fear of losing his job.

Traits: Pocked skin
A veteran guard, Thakkar has been moved to light duty due to medical problems. He was once the terror of the lower levels, but long
exposure to the radiation has played havoc with his health. When he can muster the energy, Thakkar is more than willing to break heads,
but most of the time he sits bored in the observation office.

Dan reacts at - 2 to all prisoners.

Reym may be bribed for half price. He is supporting a girl friend in Circle City, who he visits by flyer once or twice a month. He is among
the youngest of the guards, and his impulsive tendences get him into trouble. He carries a holo image of his girlfriend in his pocket at all
times.

His girlfriend, Heydi Kirdal, is an ex-partner of prisoner 2453 Porv Dunikhush. Heydi knows her ex-boyfriend is in the prison, but has not
told Reym about her previous relationship. She is a flighty and self-centred young girl, and is seeing two other men in the periods when
Reym is stuck in Tarkwall.

Equipment: Extra gas grenade, illegal frag grenade, illegal stun grenade, psionic detector
Jorge hates psionics (even more than most of the other guards), and reacts at -4 to any psionic encountered, or anyone in the company of
a psionic. He is deeply paranoid about psionics in the prison, and investigates any allegation or suggestion that there are prisoners with
unidentified psionic powers, or the prisoners are conspiring together in any organised way. S2 Voller keeps Jorge out of the lower levels after
a recent incident when the guard attacked two prisoners for no reason.

He carries a ‘psionics detector’ that he was sold by a merchant who claimed the device comes from Darrian subsector. The gadget is
purported to be a TL16 handheld Neural Activity Detector, but it is just a collection of scrap electronics which occasionally ‘identifies’
psionic activity.

Rumors: 29, 64
Traits: Selfish
Tomas shot 2 prisoners a few years ago for no apparent reason, and there was a minor investigation which came to nothing. This breach in
prison protocol confused many of the other staff, but they do not know Tomas’ secret – his real name is Tomas Grice, and he is the warden’s
nephew. Tomas has been fired from several other jobs, so his uncle arranged for him to get a posting at Tarkwall Prison. (Tomas’ mother
Galia is not only a formidable presence in her own right, she is also a close friend of V1 Maribel Harmosa – see S1 Warden Grice for more
details). Most of the time, Tomas guards the main gate, a job involving sitting in the sun and occasionally pressing a button marked ‘open’
or a button marked ‘close’. To his credit, and to his uncle’s surprise, the boy rarely gets these two buttons mixed up.

Tomas has the ambition to rise through the ranks and take over the warden’s job from his uncle, and the first step is to take over the role
of assistant warden by getting Voller fired.

(Grav) 0
Traits: Eccentric
Equipment: Revolver
Ambin Grice started his career as a naval officer, rising to the exalted
rank of Captain of the Grand Nova , one of the most advanced ships
in the Treece Planetary Navy.

Of course, seeing as the Grand Nova was a rust-bucket System
Defence Boat antiquated even by the standards of the First
Imperium, and Grice’s ship spent more time in drydock than in
space, this is not as impressive a rank as it sounds. One would
never know this from talking to Grice, though – according to his
stories, he was a dashing hero of the spaceways, battling Zhodani
armadas and slaughtering pirates in zero-g sabre duels.

The Grand Nova was scrapped ten years ago to provide parts for
her sister ships, Grand Cosmos and Grand Nebula , and her captain
became the head warden of Tarkwall Prison. The warden’s house at
the prison is a shrine to the star navy in general and the scrapped
Grand Nova in particular – every room contains holos, paintings,
memorabilia and other relics of his naval career. Some rooms are
even decorated just like staterooms on the ship, and the Warden
sometimes wears his uniform around the prison.

Grice takes little real interest in the prison. He conscientiously
reads the printed reports, and has monthly meetings of the prison
board in Circle City, but he rarely actually bothers doing any work or
administration. He delegates almost everything to S2 Malko Voller,
and concentrates on maintaining his image and position in society.
Occasionally, he invites prisoners such as 2943 Milovan Gant to
dine at his house, and any inmate with a naval rank who can hold a
conversation and is not considered dangerous can probably wrangle
such an invitation.

Grice is currently involved with a woman from Circle City named
V1 Maribel Harmosa, a friend of his sister’s. Grice visits Circle
City several times a month to see her, and Harmosa sometimes
visits the prison via her flyer to stay in the Warden’s House. Grice’s
relationship with Harmosa exists at the sufferance of his sister Galia
Dannessur, so he must keep Galia’s son G1 Tomas Dannessur out
of trouble.

Voller hoped to be promoted to her position, but instead Ambrose

world, as the head warden delegates almost all authority to him.

Voller rules the prison with an iron hand. He has no illusions about
the nature of Tarkwall Prison or those who are incarcerated there

- they are all brutal, conscienceless animals, subhuman beasts.
Voller’s duty as he sees it is to _break_ the prisoners, to smash their
wills and their power to resist, and then remake them as _useful_
beasts, beasts of burden who can labour witlessly for the Imperium.
If Voller could lobotomise the prisoners or psionically annihilate
their wills, he would – as it is, he can only use hard labour, suffering
and violence to achieve his goals. Anyone who resists Voller must
be defeated or destroyed.

The assistant warden is utterly corrupt, but only as long as it suits
his own ends. He takes kickbacks from the mining corporation
who processes the ore, from drug companies, from political parties
on Keanou, and from Imperial agents, as well as from the gangs
operating within the prison. However, he has no honor and
attaches no importance to such dealings - a prisoner could pay the
warden a dozen times to be let off a punishment, and each time the
warden would agree, but as soon as the prisoner shows a glimmer
of resistance or independent thought, the assistant warden will have
him shoved into The Hole. Voller plays the various prison factions
off against each other, ensuring no-one can challenge his power.

He has no real friends in the prison, just a collection of henchmen
and cronies who he barely trusts. Voller believes himself to be the
one honest man in Tarkwall, perhaps the only honest man in the
galaxy. Tarkwall is his domain, and he will do his duty there.

computer data and camera images and to look for signs of a
prisoner with a sufficiently interesting psychological problem to be
written up in one of the interstellar psychiatric journals. An inmate
with a compelling history or truly original psychological quirk
could be Rovok’s ticket out of Tarkwall and into a more respected
institution. In his darker moments, the psychologist wonders if
he could engineer such a situation deliberately – there are psionic
experiments and drug trials banned by the Imperium which would
go unnoticed in Tarkwall...

Most of the time though, the psychologist tries to prevent himself
from going mad. He spends his time reading or watching holos in
his rooms in the prison, or wandering the desert, or playing elaborate
practical jokes on the staff. Assistant Warden Voller especially hates
Rovok, and Warden Grice listens to Voller’s advice so Rovok wields
little influence in the prison hierarchy.

The prison chaplain is a sincere fool, who has become hopelessly
depressed over the souls of the prisoners. Thomas is a native of
Keanou, and preaches the local religion, a generic mix of positive
moral commandments and a belief in a universal spirit which created
all life. He emphasises themes like redemption through suffering
and the importance of trust, love and obedience in his sermons,
but few prisoners pay much real attention to the chaplain’s words.
He is a weak-willed man without the charisma or authority to do
any real good work with the inmates. A few of the older or weaker
prisoners do listen to Thomas, and Warden Grice trots the chaplain
out whenever visitors come to Tarkwall so he can give his usual
spiel about the redemptive value of the prison.

Hobber Quint is an ex-convict who served a ten-year term for
attempted hijacking. During his term there, he was trained in
mechanical engineering by the counsellor there, and took a job in
Tarkwall prison as few other places would employ him. He faithfully
tries to teach the prisoners something which will keep them out of
prison, once they get out, but usually doesn’t succeed.

Quint’s background as an ex-con means he knows prison life better
than any of the rest of the staff. If he takes a liking to a prisoner, he
can be a valuable source of advice and help, and has even passed

on weapons or equipment to prisoners who are in danger. He is
not wholly honest, though - G5 Emil Patowic sometimes requests
Quint teach a specific skill to a prisoner who is due for release, in
exchange for a moderate bribe.

Quint loathes the gangs, as he was tormented by similar gangs in
his old prison. If he could arrange for 7057 Big Rolf or 6866 Gerard
Benezach to be overthrown, he would gladly do so.

whose sole vice is his collection of pet lizards. Luca considers CARL
to be an irritatingly unstable and buggy piece of software, and hates
that the prison staff rely on the balky computer so much. If Luca
has his way, then CARL would be scrapped and replaced with a

Omar Blint is a quack who is allowed to practise only because he works for cheap. He leaves most of the work in
the prison infirmary to the antiquated medical robot and prisoners 0730 Winston Urmarush and 1217 Talbot Vinge,
both of whom have much more extensive experience. Blint makes money selling drugs to the prisoners, mostly
mild sedatives and vitamin supplements. Assistant Warden Voller is well aware of this and takes a cut of any deals.
Blint regularly visits Circle City, spending his pay gambling and investing in a series of dodgy real-estate deals and
get-rich-quick schemes.

Blint knows the infirmary job is as good as he is likely to get anywhere on Keanou, so he will cling to his position
with every ounce of strength and guile he can muster. He toadies to Voller, to Hajim Rovok, to Warden Grice and
occasionally even to the prisoners whenever he feels his job is in danger.

Skills: Carouse 2, Drive 0, Comms 0, Diplomat 0
Traits: Kind-hearted
Maribel is S1 Warden Grice’s girlfriend. She is an empty-headed
socialite from Circle City, which is something of an accomplishment

- the city is much too small for any sort of social scene, so Maribel’s
idea of high society is based mainly on holos from more cosmopolitan
worlds. She tries hard to be fashionable and sophisticated, but is
quite clueless. Despite this, Grice is head-over-heels in love with her
and will do anything to keep her happy.

Grice normally visits Maribel in her home in Circle City, but every
few weeks he is too busy to leave the prison and so she must
visit Tarkwall. She is soft-hearted and tries to spend time with the
prisoners whenever she visits the prison. Any prisoner she takes
pity on can expect better treatment from the warden; however,
Grice is extremely paranoid about Maribel’s safety and insists she
be escorted by guards at all times.

The prisoner who now calls himself Monte Cristo is one of the few
men to have successfully escaped from Tarkwall Prison.

He just did not get very far.

Cristo and his cellmate, Kung the Fat, managed to escape from
Tarkwall by tunnelling underneath the fence. Four steps out, Cristo
twisted his ankle and could not run. Kung abandoned him to his
fate and fled into the desert (and turned from Kung the Fat into
Kung the Much Thinner, then Kung the Starved, and finally the late
Kung). Cristo knew the guards would beat him if they found him
outside the fence, so he hid in the abandoned sections of the old
mining facility.

He has been there ever since. Cristo is a ghost in the prison
machinery. He creeps around the surface sections of the prison
at night, stealing food and other supplies. Several of the staff and
guards know about Cristo and take pity on him, leaving him food
and water. Assistant Warden Voller considers him a nuisance not
worth hunting down.

A former police officer, Inspector Borun is the newly-appointed
Keanou State Inspector of Prisons. He is a small, sad-faced man
with weather-beaten skin. He put many of the prisoners in Tarkwall
behind bars in the first place, and now his government has rewarded
him with ensuring they are treated well. Borun appreciates the
irony.

He loathes S1 Warden Ambrose Grice, but knows S2 Voller would be
even worse so he puts little pressure on Grice to resign. He is trying
to thread a middle path between the two to improve conditions in
Tarkwall without handing the prison over to Voller’s reign of terror.
To do this, he will need allies and spies within the prison.

###### Old Crimes

If possible, establish Inspector Borun as a nemesis of the player
characters before they arrive in Tarkwall. He could be one of the
police officers who gives evidence in the trial that sent them
to prison, or be involved in investigating their crimes. A past
association with Borun will colour any dealings with him in an
interesting way.

Ingrun is the representative of the Orion Metallurgy Corporation
which originally built Tarkwall prison. The corporation still processes
the ore from the prison mines, so they still have an interest in the
prison.

The company has an interest; Cala Ingrun does not, to be honest.
Visiting the prison is just one of several extremely dull jobs Cala has
to perform on behalf of Orion. As far as she is concerned, as long
as the prison keeps pumping out the ore according to the preset
quotas, everyone in there can go to hell.

According to the contract signed between the Keanou government
and the Orion Corporation, any future finds of valuable ore or
gemstones are to be split between the two parties. Ingrun therefore
makes regular inspections of the mines under the prison.

as Lifnuf handles their appeals and pleas for clemency. He can be retained as a lawyer for a mere fifty credits a

automated, flooding the Keanou justice system with endless paperwork). Lifnuf will also send messages, sneak
items into prison, provide drugs and deal with other problems such as vengeful guards – all for the right price.
There is nothing the lawyer will not do for money, apart from risk his own neck. He does it all with a cheery wink
and a grin.

the warden that spice gathering should be added to the roster of
jobs performed by the prisoners in Tarkwall. ‘If the dogs can dig
uranium’, reasons the baron, ‘then by the Emperor’s golden
posterior, they can dig spice too!’

For a man officially worth millions of credits, the baron is very
interested in get-rich-quick schemes and black-market trading. The
Konnen estates may possess valuable spice fields, but the baron has
expensive tastes and considerable debts.

Whenever he visits Tarkwall, Konnen brings his bodyguard Crull

this district, so any escaped prisoners are her problem. Magros is
an experienced and cynical law officer, although most of her cases
are just domestic disputes and spice thieves. She logs hundreds of
flight hours in her air/raft every month, flitting from one outlying
settlement to another, and relies on stims to keep going. She knows

Magros, and perhaps even has deeply buried and warped feelings
for her.

during a visit to Tarkwall, she was appalled by the tale of one inmate
who claimed to have been imprisoned unjustly. The young inmate
died before his appeal came though, so Chandra is determined to
help other prisoners in his memory who she believes have been
railroaded by an unjust system.

##### PRISONERS, GUARDS, AND STAFF

Time moves slowly in prison, and prisoners have little free time for
their own activities. Therefore, time is measured in weeks and 52
weeks make a year. Each week, the referee goes through a simple
sequence of play.

First, he rolls for and resolves an event for each group of players.

Second, the players may undertake their own actions: they may
respond to the week’s events, seek out specific non-player characters,
ask questions, steal and hide equipment, and (eventually) stage
escape attempts.

Finally, the referee performs a small amount of bookkeeping: he records
the passage of time, changes in characters’ cellblocks, work assignments,
and prison reputations, and the gaining of friends or enemies.

## EVENTS, ENCOUNTERS & INCIDENTS

###### Encounters

A roll on the event table may also mandate one or two rolls on the
encounter table, which lists the various non-player characters
who may be encountered. Procedure and DMs are the same
as on the event table. Characters are listed in numerical order
starting on page 128. A number preceded by a G stands for a
guard; a number preceded by S stands for a staff member. The
rest are prisoners.

Prisoners may also attempt to encounter specific non-player
characters. Each player character may make one such attempt per
week, roll on the encounter attempt table to determine success.
Prisoners in solitary confinement may not have an encounter or be
encountered. Other than that, players have no restrictions on their
ability to talk to other players.

# RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE

###### Sequence of Play

A. Weekly Events.

1. Roll event on event table.
2. Roll any encounters on encounter table.
3. Optionally, run an incident.
B. Player Activities.
1. Response to event.
2. Attempted encounters with specific non-player characters.
3. Other activities: theft, exploration, making equipment, escape
attempts, etc.
C. Bookkeeping.
1. Record elapsed time.
2. Record changes in reputation
3. Record friends and enemies.

The referee rolls for one event per week for each group of prisoners.
A group is all prisoners in the same cellblock and the same work
area. There are three work areas: the safe area (all non-mining jobs),
the danger zone (the lower mining level, assigned as punishment),
and the main mining area. Events are not rolled for characters in
the infirmary.

To determine an event, roll 1D twice and consult the event table.
There is a DM to the first die roll of -1 if the group is in the safe
area and +1 if they are in the danger zone. There is a DM to the
second die roll of -1 if the group leader (players in each group select
a leader each week) has a prison reputation of -10 or less and +1 if
his reputation is 10 or more. Each entry on the table is a particular
event, events are listed alphabetically beginning on page 61.

##### RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

###### Reactions

Every time a non-player character is encountered, his reaction
is checked on the reaction table. A character whose reaction is
2- becomes an enemy of the player characters; a character whose
reaction is 12+ becomes a friend. The referee may of course choose
a reaction instead of rolling on the reaction table – use the table as
a guide, not an inviolate edict.

###### REACTION TABLE

2 - Enemy
3-5 Hostile
6-8 Neutral
9-11 Amiable
12 + Friend

DMs: Friends react at + 4, enemies at - 4. Some characters have
inherent DMs given in their descriptions. All characters dislike
being bothered, so a DM of -1 applies if the player character has
sought out the encounter. The referee may apply DMs of up to ± 2
if the non-player character has a particular reason to like or dislike
the player character.

A character may also become an enemy of the player characters
if they attack him without provocation, are found stealing
from him, or do anything else the referee deems sufficient to
establish enmity.

An enemy has a reaction DM of -4, and will influence his cellmates
and other associates against the player characters, seek them out
and provoke a confrontation, inform on them to the guards (if
his reputation is negative), and, in extreme cases, even attempt
to kill them.

Hostile: A prisoner will offer to fight (the player character’s options
are given under Brawls and Knife Fights, beginning on page 60). A
guard will threaten to beat the prisoner up; fast talking or grovelling
may save him. A staff member will threaten to send him to the
danger zone.

Neutral: The character is willing to talk, but will not be very helpful.

Amiable: The character will answer questions in a helpful fashion
and may volunteer information (such as rumors he knows). A
guard or staff member will be receptive to bribes and requests.

Friend: The character becomes a permanent friend. A prisoner
will reveal all his rumors, hidden items, and personal secrets. A
guard or staff member will be very helpful, reveal his rumors and
information about the prison, and will even go so far as to ignore or
assist in minor infractions of the rules.

A character may also become a friend of the player characters if
they perform some especially great service for him. Opportunities
for this are very rare. Other ways to gain the friendship of certain
characters are given in their descriptions. A friend has a reaction
DM of +4, will reveal any hidden items or secret information, will
generally aid the player characters in their efforts, and may be willing
to join an escape attempt. He will not, however, act against his own
best interests, the referee must play him as an individual and not as
a tool of the players.

For simplicity, a friend or enemy of one player character is normally
a friend or enemy of all. The referee may choose to record friends
and enemies individually, but should remember an enemy of one
player character will have reason to dislike his friends; conversely,
a friend of one player character will be well-disposed toward the
others.

###### Incidents

Incidents occur when triggered by a roll on the event table or by the
whim of the referee. An incident is a more significant encounter may
have a longer-term effect on the characters or be part of a larger plot
arc. Incidents and plot arcs are described starting on page 70.

_DMs for Prisoners: +_ streetwise, ± one-tenth prison reputation.
_DM for Guards:_ ±one-tenth prison reputation.
_DMs for Staff:_ +admin, + 1 if prison reputation is -10 or less.

###### Effects

The effects of different reactions are given below.
_Enemy:_ The character becomes a permanent enemy. A prisoner will attack
immediately in most situations. A guard will beat the prisoner up. A staff
member will order him sent to the danger zone for being disrespectful.

frequent offenders. Offenders may be transferred to a different
cellblock if judged guilty of gang action.

### WORK ASSIGNMENTS

There are several possible work assignments for a prisoner. Initially,
all new prisoners are assigned to the upper mining level. Incidents
and events may change a character’s assignment to a job in the
safe area (administrative or surface) or condemn him to the Danger
Zone. Each character is paid a nominal fee for their work in the
prison; this money is supposed to be used to buy minor items and
treats, and to teach the prisoners the value of honest work.

- Exhausting Work: The character must make an Endurance check after a day’s work, or suffer a -1 DM to all checks until he rests.

### NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS

The referee should actively play other prisoners, guards, and
prison staff. Enemies may actively seek out a player character or
otherwise provoke trouble. Friends may go out of their way to offer
good advice, as well as actual assistance. Prison staff members may
attempt to rehabilitate the player characters or single them out for
special persecution.

The prison population is full of biases. New prisoners are scorned,
psionics are hated, and any mention of politics will surely cause an
argument. Each prisoner, guard, or staff member is given a short
description which should provide the basis for the referee to flesh
out into a real personality.

##### RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

### PRISON REPUTATION

Every prisoner has a prison reputation, which is a measure of
his position in the unofficial prison hierarchy. A character with a
high reputation is respected by his fellow prisoners, as well as the
guards. A character with a low reputation is scorned by the prisoners
and guards, but the prison staff will consider him a ‘good boy’. A
character’s prison reputation is of paramount importance; daily
comforts, escape possibilities, and even life itself are dependent on
the opinions of the prison populace.

Reputation is gained or lost through interaction with the prison
community, see the effects on reputation table on page 86 and
other notes throughout this book. Reputation has several effects,
but the most important is its effect on the reactions of non-player
characters. The character’s reputation, divided by 10 and rounded
toward zero (down if positive and up if negative) is a ± DM on the
reactions of prisoners and guards. For example, a reputation of 18
would give a DM of + 1; a reputation of 21 would give + 2; 5 or -5
would give 0; -12 would give - 1.

If a character’s reputation is -10 or lower, he receives a DM of +1 on
the reactions of prison staff.

The referee should keep a record of each player character’s prison
reputation; it should never be directly divulged to the player, although
its effects and general magnitude should become apparent. For
example, a character with a negative reputation may get jeered at
and called a ‘dirty informer’.

### GANGS AND OTHER PRISON POWER

### BLOCS

Gangs: Each of the three cell blocks has its own ruling gang.
Cellblock 1 is controlled by 7057 Big Rolf’s gang. He is backed up by
6960 Yussef Shelton, 2803 Enli Shulgidun, 7321 Hari Gordert, and
2167 Dan Amgi. Cellblock 3 is run by 6866 Gerard Benezech’s gang.
His chief lackeys are 2673 “Killer” Basimu, 2365 Seljuk the Knife,
and 8661 Loudon Plauser.

In cellblock 2, 2076 Etienne Lalaji and 2977 Anton Kugazur are
attempting to assert their authority. They have a loose following
among the other inmates. The two dominant gangs in the prison are
Big Rolf’s and Gerard Benezech’s. There have been several fights
between the two gangs, one of which the guards broke up, using
gas. There used to be an even stronger gang, based in cellblock 2,
led by Jan ‘the Blade’ Lintrel.

Escape Committee: Aside from the gangs, there is an escape
committee, which is very secretive and coordinates escape plots.
The members’ names are not generally known; they are 2167 Dan
Amgi in cellblock 1, 2537 Axel Herrmon in cellblock 2 , and 1935 Felip
Karageorge in cellblock 3.

Trustees: Each cellblock also has a chief trustee, who performs
some of the dirty work for the prison administration. They are 7321
Hari Gordert in cellblock 1, 3632 Halse Eisen in cellblock 2, and 1711
Razeem Thonon in cellblock 3.

Drug Dealers: The prison’s chief drug dealers are also quite
influential; they are 1217 Talbot Vinge in cellblock 1 and 0730
Winston Urmarush in cellblock 2. Both work in the infirmary and
are in league with the crooked prison doctor and some of the guards
to smuggle illegal drugs into the prison. Vinge’s henchmen are two
addicts: 0014 Subotai Shanad and 9623 Tsunego Artois. Urmarush
relies on his cellmate 3136 Stiv the Blade and two guards, G5 Emit
Patowic and G8 Alvim Karaas, to provide muscle for his operation.

Warden Grice: S1 Warden Grice takes little interest in the day-to-
day running of the prison, but he still maintains overall authority in
Tarkwall. Among those closely associated with Grice are G18 Tomas
Dannessur and 2943 Milovan Gant.

Assistant Warden Voller: Voller is the true power in the prison
hierarchy. His coterie of thugs, agents and henchmen includes G1
Fedor, G3 Gorod and S6 Doctor Blint. Everyone in the prison fears
and respects Voller.

Dissident Staff: Several members of the prison staff, especially S3
Psychologist Hajim Rovok, oppose Voller’s control over the prison.
They are not organised in any way, but if pressed, they could form
an effective opposition in Tarkwall.

##### RUNNING THE ADVENTURE RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE

### SECURITY

The security regime in Tarkwall is... inconsistent. Officially, every
prisoner is watched twenty-four hours per day by both the prison
computer and by guards monitoring camera feeds, but not even the
most notorious prisoners are under such constant scrutiny.

###### Computer Surveillance

The human guards are heavily supplemented by a computer
surveillance system called CARL (Computer Analysis & Remote
Logging), with cameras set up all around the cellblock level, the
administrative level, and around the lift shafts on the mining
levels. However, there are large blank spaces in the mining areas
themselves and in the structures on the surface.

The computer system dates from the old mining corporation which
built Tarkwall, and uses technology from offworld. No-one in the
prison – or on Keanou, for that matter – really understands how
CARL works. The surveillance software is built on top of an artificial-
intelligence program which has been running continuously for more
than forty years. In this time, CARL has developed all manner of
quirks and bugs, some of which seem almost like an emergent
personality.

The computer program directing the surveillance system will alert
the guards to acts of violence, obvious thefts, and other suspicious
behaviour. It attempts to predict the actions of prisoners by tracking
their movements and activities. However, prisoners with sufficient
cunning will be able to conceal many activities from special notice.
The guards are too busy or in some cases too lazy to investigate
every alarm anyway.

###### Guards

The guards at the main guard station can release tear- or knock-out
gas (filter masks are no defence), can shut and/or lock any door, can
override the controls on the lifts or other equipment in the mining
areas, turn lights on or off, and operate loudspeakers in any of the
areas covered by the electronic security system.

At least one guard is (almost) always on duty in each part of the
administrative level (the repair shop, the vocational rehabilitation
area, and so on). Each level has a central security area, which can
easily be defended by the guards.

In the upper mining level, it is area B; in the lower mining level,
it is the equipment storage area. At all times when prisoners are
present, 1D6 guards will be on duty at each of these areas. They
can easily take cover behind barred doors, through which they have
wide fields of fire if the going gets rough.

On the cellblock level there are four cell-sized areas at the entrances
to the four cellblocks. The areas are completely secure, and there
is always a guard present in each of these when prisoners are
being moved in and out of the cellblocks. The main guard station
on the administrative level is described on page 17; it is absolutely

secure. There are always 2D guards present here, along with extra
equipment and gas masks for the guards. It is from here the guards
monitor the whole security system.

In addition, 2D6 guards, as well as some of the prison staff, will
usually be present on the surface.

###### Guard Patrols

Regular patrols are made on the upper mining level. Prisoners out
of their assigned area for any prolonged period of time must make
average Stealth checks to avoid being captured by a patrol of 1D6+1
guards.

Patrols of the lower mining levels are rare; prisoners need to make
easy (+4) Stealth checks to avoid detection, and never in areas I or P
(which are rumored to be more than normally radioactive).

Prisoners out of their assigned areas on the administrative level
or on the surface must make difficult (-2) Stealth checks to avoid
detection.

Guards and staff members may issue passes to allow prisoners
to leave their assigned areas; blank passes may be stolen and
signatures forged on them. A forged pass will work with a successful
Deception check. Guards are usually somewhat lax about fights
between prisoners, but it goes on their records when someone is
killed during their shift, so they will intervene if someone seems
likely to be killed.

Guards never turn their backs on prisoners. A roll of 12 must be
made to successfully attack a guard with surprise. When a guard
is attacked, 1D6 additional guards will appear fairly quickly in
most cases. If the fight continues, another 1D6 guards will appear
and, if things are going badly, will cover the retreat of the original
group of guards before gassing the area. The guards will give extra
effort to investigating the murder of another guard. If successful in
determining who was responsible, they may very well take justice
into their own hands and throw the perpetrators down the lift shaft
when the lift isn’t there. If a guard is killed, security will be increased
for the next 1D x 4 weeks; see the event Security Increase.

The guards are made suspicious by any group of prisoners larger than
two, and may take action to break up the “crowd” (unless they have
some very high prison reputations). The larger the group, the quicker
and more effective will be the reaction. If a random guard is needed
in some encounter, determine his number by rolling 1D6 twice; the
number is the first roll, plus 6 if the second roll is 4, 5, or 6.

###### Bribery

Many of the guards and prison staff are corrupt. Bribes may originate
from the players inside the prison or from friends operating on the
outside. The guards are not paid especially well, so even small bribes
are frequently accepted, so long as it does not interfere with the
guard’s own safety (a guard will not smuggle laser rifles in for the

##### RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

prisoners!). Anything which might cost the guard or staff member
his job is bound to be very expensive.

Some things guards and staff members may be bribed to do fairly
cheaply (from fifty to a few hundred credits) are looking the other
way when one wants to steal something or beat someone up, not
reporting someone for missing a work shift or being out of his
assigned area, smuggling messages or small pieces of non-weapon
equipment in or out of the prison, protecting the player from attacks
by other prisoners or by guards, allowing a prisoner to meet with
some specific staff member (the warden, for example), or having a
prisoner assigned (or not assigned) to a specific mining area.

It would be somewhat more expensive (perhaps a thousand credits)
to bribe a staff member into assigning the player to a job in the safe
area, since this requires the connivance of a staff member. Actual
aid in an escape attempt would be quite expensive (Cr10,000 or
more). Other prisoners, of course, are frequently bribed for very
little. It is good to remember not everyone can be bribed, and many
will not be bribed in certain situations.

It should also be remembered acceptance of a bribe is no guarantee
a service will be performed. Generally, a guard will perform the
agreed service with an appropriate bribe and a good Persuade roll.
Many factors may alter this; a guard is less likely to follow through
if the service involves a risk of being found out; he will be more
likely to follow through if he is expecting to do business again in the
future. Prisoners are more reliable, being vulnerable to a disgruntled
client’s revenge.

###### Brawls & Knife Fights

If a player character becomes involved in a fight with another
prisoner, his opponent will attack using Melee (brawling) skill (if
he has any) or with a dagger or blade (if he owns one, roll 6+ the
prisoner to use the dagger or blade in a fist fight); a prisoner with
a dagger or blade will use it automatically if his opponent is using
a weapon.

Options: Several basic options may be exercised when a character
is attacked. The referee should try to fit the character’s actions into
one of these categories if possible.

_Grovel:_ The attacker’s reaction is rerolled, with the same
modifications. If the result is greater than 2, the attacker will be
satisfied, but the character loses 3 from his prison reputation.

_Flee:_ Fleeing involves opposed Athletics checks (or in some cases,
Stealth if the fleeing character can find somewhere to hide). If the
attempt to flee fails, the attacker gets a +4 DM to his next attack roll
as he catches his victim.

_Talk Fast:_ A character can try Persuading the attacker to stop; this is
a Very Difficult (-4) Persuade check, modified by prison reputation
divided by 10. A friend of the character, not involved in the fight,
may also intercede in this way.

Edge Away: This does not work, and will only delay the outcome.

Call a Guard: The guards pay attention to brawls and fights in the
prison. A guard will appear on 7+ normally, 4+ if in the safe area;
two guards will appear if in the danger zone, on 10 +.

Calling a guard costs 5 from prison reputation, regardless of whether
a guard appears.

If a guard appears, the assailant will flee. If no guard appears, roll
7+ for another randomly selected prisoner to join the fight to help
beat up the informer.

Fight: Fights are one of the few sources of entertainment available
in the prison, so other prisoners quickly gather to watch, sometimes
the guards just watch too, especially if one of the fighters has a
high prison reputation. The crowd usually dislikes uneven fights
(unless an informer, psionic, or someone with a low reputation is
the victim, or unless the chief attacker has a very high reputation)
and will tend to even the odds: a friend or two may step in and
aid someone who is beset at odds of two or three to one, and a
spectator may lend a blade to an unarmed prisoner being attacked
by an armed prisoner.

Punishments: Fighting may reduce a prisoner’s capacity for work,
and is therefore punished, if only sporadically. If a fight is seen by
guards or cameras, a participating prisoner will be punished on 8

- ; on 6 +, all weapons used will be confiscated; on 3- a character’s
defeated opponent will inform on him (5- if his reputation is - 10

##### RUNNING THE ADVENTURE RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE

or less, never if his reputation is 10 or greater), and the character
will be punished. If the fight occurs out of sight of the guards, the
character will be punished only if his opponent talks. A prisoner
who talks loses 5 from his reputation. Prisoners who are beaten by
a player character without being sent to the infirmary (and without
informing) will roll a new reaction to the character with an additional
DM of + 1.

Wounds: A prisoner who loses a brawl will be sufficiently injured to
spend one week in the infirmary on 10+. The loser of a knife fight
will spend 1D weeks in the infirmary, and the winner, if wounded,
spends 1D-1D weeks there (which may be no time at all).

Resolving Fights: Fights are resolved using the Traveller personal combat
rules. A fight ends when all on one side are unconscious or have run away
(although an enemy may attempt to kill an unconscious player character).

###### Splitting The Party

The player characters are likely to have an advantage over potential enemies within the prison (both guards and fellow prisoners) if they
are all placed within the same cell block, especially if they share cells. If a Referee wishes to make the campaign more challenging he can
split the party, placing them in different blocks. In this case it might even be possible for rival gangs to recruit different characters!

DMs: Use the DMs given for the event table.

### EVENTS

The following pages describe in detail all events given on the event
table. Events are listed below in alphabetical order. Unless specified,
the event happens to the leader of the group. If an event applies to
“one prisoner”, the referee should choose randomly from qualified
members of the group.

Appeal: A letter arrives from one prisoner’s lawyer, stating new
evidence has been discovered which may allow him a new trial.
The legal system moves slowly, so it will be 1-3 years before the
trial takes place, if it ever does. Substantial expenditures on the
part of the lawyer would be necessary for this to occur. If the player
characters are still in prison when the trial date comes up, and
have no real hope of escaping, the referee may wish to allow some
chance of acquittal or reduced sentence. Otherwise this event is just
a diversion to keep the players busy.

Beating: Three prisoners (roll for them on the encounter table or
choose three enemies) attack one prisoner with a negative reputation
(if there are none, ignore the event). He is trapped and may not run,
but may fight back.

Brawl: 1d6+1 prisoners (including at least two notable prisoners; roll
for them on the encounter table) are involved in a very public brawl.
Characters may get caught up in the brawl, or use the distraction to
attack an enemy or perform some other covert action. The brawl is
broken up by the guards after a few minutes. Add one to the reputation
of any character who jumps into the brawl and starts fighting.

Cave Bat: The group has encountered a cave bat. Each player
may attempt to capture it by making a Difficult (-2) Animals
(handling) check. Prisoner 3622 “Batman” will trade favors or
up to Cr50 for an unharmed cave bat. An outright gift of one will
gain him as a friend.

Cave Entrance: The prisoners have located an entrance to a natural
cave system. The entrance is located in the lower mining level,
area M.

Danger Zone: One prisoner is sent to the lower mining level for
work assignment for the next four weeks before being returned
to his previous work area. He has been found guilty of some
infraction purely because the danger zone is short of workers.
This punishment might be averted by appeal to the prison staff,
particularly if the prisoner is friends with a staff member (otherwise
the chances are poor).

The referee should remember to add 1 to the prisoner’s reputation
for being sent to the danger zone.

Escape Committee: The prisoner with the highest prison
reputation receives an offer to join the escape committee.
Accepting the offer adds 5 to his prison reputation; in addition
he learns rumor 32 and the identities of the other committee
members; finally, throw 1D6 to learn one set of rumors from the
Escape Committee rumors.

##### RUNNING THE ADVENTURE RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE

###### ESCAPE COMMITTEE RUMOURS

DieDie RumorsRumors

3 18, 22, 47
4 11, 35, 41
5 40, 44, 50
6 9, 15, 43

If the prisoner with the highest reputation is already a member of
the escape committee, then the position of chairman is available to
him with a difficult (-2) Streetwise check (adding one-tenth prison
reputation). Gaining the post of chairman of the escape committee
is worth an addition of 5 to prison reputation (the gang leaders
know the identities of the committee and afford them a measure of
respect), as well as knowledge of all the rumors listed above.

The escape committee is sometimes more of a debating society than
an actual instrument of action, but its members do have important
information, and may be able to stir other prisoners to action if the
need arises.

Friendly Guard: The leader has the opportunity to make friends
with a guard (determine randomly which one). Successfully making
contact with the guard is a matter of roleplaying, but the referee
should work to give the character every chance to establish friendly
relations with the guard. This guard will alert the leader of impending
searches and can be bribed very cheaply, as well as reliably carrying
out the action agreed upon.

Gamble with Guards: The prisoners may attend a game with some
guards and some other prisoners. The prisoner may bet between Cr
50 and Cr 200 2d6 times; the total pot is the character’s total bet x
the number of bets made. The winner is determined by the highest
Gambler effect. If a prisoner cannot cover losses or is suspected of
cheating, a stay of 1D6 weeks in the infirmary is the likely result.
A guard may not be able to cover debts to a prisoner (throw 10+),
in which case the guard may offer to make it up in favors (throw
6+).

Gamble with Prisoners: The prisoners may attend a game with
other prisoners. The prisoner may bet between Cr 25 and Cr 500 3d6
times; the total pot is the character’s total bet x the number of bets
made. If a prisoner is unable to cover his debts, he will end up in
the infirmary for 1D weeks and lose 1 from his prison reputation. If
a player character is suspected of cheating, a fight with a randomly
selected prisoner may ensue. Non-player prisoners may not be able
to cover debts to a player character (throw 9+ for this to occur), and
will offer to cover the debt with services, owned items, or future

considerations, unless another throw of 9+ is made, in which case
the prisoner will refuse to pay. The player character and any friends
may provoke a fight in this situation with no outside interference
(unless the prisoner has a reputation of 20 or more, in which case
he may receive assistance from friends).

Gem: One prisoner locates a gemstone in the mining area, worth
2D6 x Cr50 inside the prison and 5-10 times as much on the outside.
If the prisoner is working in the upper mining level, he must make a
Routine (+2) Deception check to pocket the gem before the guards
spot it and confiscate it; this does not happen in the lower mining
level. Prisoners who have found gems may deliberately search for
more gems, but may be caught slacking off on the job, or may be
caught out of their assigned work area (some areas in the mining
shafts are very poor areas to look for gemstones). Even then a
prisoner’s chance of finding one by diligent search should be low
(10+ per week spent searching).

Gift: A departing prisoner entrusts the leader with some personal
possessions stolen from the prison authorities. Select 1D6 items at
random from the equipment table.

Good Behaviour: The good behaviour (or successful act) of the
prisoner with the lowest reputation has been noticed. If he is eligible
for parole, it may be gained on 8+ (DM + admin skill). Parole is only
possible if the prisoner has served over half of the given sentence,
and has avoided being sent to the danger zone for the last 50 weeks.
Those with life sentences are usually eligible for parole after 10
years, although some crimes are so heinous as to preclude ever
being paroled.

Grievance Rep: The prisoner with the highest prison reputation is in
contention for the position of prisoner grievance representative. An
Admin or Diplomat roll is needed to gain the position.

Each week there is a grievance on a roll of 8+, which allows the
prisoner access to the assistant warden or to the warden himself
(the prisoner may take this opportunity to offer bribes if so inclined).
If the above roll was 10+ , the grievance is a serious one, and the
prisoner may sell out the other prisoners by aiding in the whitewash,
in return for a reward: roll 1D6; on 1 or 2 he gets a safe area job of his
choice, even if he lacks the requisite skills; on 3-5) he receives 2D x
Cr 100; on a 6 he gets a one year reduction in sentence, which must
however be approved by the warden’s superiors and is received only
on a throw of 8+.

If the prisoner sells out, a difficult (-2) Persuade must be made to
prevent the loss of the grievance representative position due to
prisoner discontent. If this happens the prisoner loses 1D6 from his
prison reputation.

##### RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

If the prisoner refuses to sell out on a serious grievance, the
position may be lost due to dissatisfaction on the part of the prison
administration; make a Difficult (-2) Admin roll to prevent this;
refusing to sell out adds 1D6 to prison reputation. The position is
also lost if the prisoner is sent to the danger zone or to solitary.

Inspection: The characters are inspected by one of the prison staff.
Roll 1d6 to determine the nature of the inspection.

1. ...sent to the medical center for testing for a week.
2. ...interviewed by the prison psychologist.
3. ...given a new aptitude test by the vocational counsellor.
4. ...brought to confession by the prison chaplain.
5. ...visited by an external prison review board representative.
6. ...dragged out to the quarantine shed and hosed down with
chemical spray.

Item Stolen: A randomly chosen item is stolen from one prisoner
by another prisoner (if he has an item to steal). The thief either
picks the character’s pocket, or sneaks into his cell during the day.
Tracking down the thief requires some Investigation. Determine the
thief’s identity by rolling on the encounter table; if a guard or staff
member is the result, then the culprit is prisoner 8144.

Laundry Detail: One prisoner is assigned to a job in the prison
laundry for the next four weeks. This is a safe area job, and the
prisoner is eligible for it even if serving time in the danger zone, but
not if incarcerated in solitary.

Payoff: The prisoner with the highest prison reputation receives a
bribe from some other prisoner for some minor favor. The prisoner
gains 2D6 x Cr10 and adds 1 to his prison reputation.

Power Failure: A power failure in one section of the prison deactivates
the security system and turns out the lights. Roll 1d6 to determine
which level of the prison is affected by the power failure:

RollRoll Affected SectionAffected Section
1 Surface level
2 Administrative level
3 Cellblocks
4 Mines
5 Danger Zone
6 Entire Prison

Cell doors automatically lock mechanically (roll 1d6; on a 1, the
lock mechanism fails and the door can be opened). Guards are
immediately sent to the affected area with portable flashlights and
shotguns to restore order, but the characters have several minutes
of chaos to take advantage of.

Safe Job: All the prisoners in this group are considered for jobs in
the safe area; each player may apply for each job in which he has the
requisite skill. Throw 8+ for a prisoner to be given the job; he may
choose one from all jobs for which the throw is successful. DMs
are + the prisoner’s level of each required skill and + his level of
admin skill. The jobs and required skills are medic (requires Medic

###### Sample Grievances

Minor

- Theft of personal belongings
- Unprovoked attack by another prisoner
- Excessive work
- Radiation poisoning
- Poor conditions, food or equipment
- Dangerous cellmate

Serious

- Unprovoked attack by a guard
- Attempted murder
- Severe radiation poisoning
- Corruption

Health Hazard: One prisoner must make an Endurance check, DM
+1 if he is taking vitamin supplements, to avoid the loss of 1 from
strength or endurance (the player may choose which), due to the
effects of silicosis and excess radiation. Good medical care might
help the player recover from this, but there is no good medical care
available in the prison.

Illness: One prisoner is sent to the infirmary next week. An Endurance
check is needed to recover. The prisoner may attempt to malinger
and stay in the infirmary after recovery by making a Deception check
each week after recovery.

Incident: These events are described in detail in the next chapter.
Each incident is a special event designed to teach the players
something about the workings of the prison. Incidents should be
used in order, each time an incident is rolled, the referee should
present the first incident still unused.

Injury: One prisoner suffers a work-related injury. Roll 1d6 to
determine what happens to the character.

1. Another prisoner accidentally strikes the character with a mining
tool, inflicting 2d6 damage.
2. Rocks fall, causing 2d6 damage.
3. The character shows signs of silicosis, as per the Health Hazard
event.
4. A runaway mining cart strikes the character, dealing 3d6
damage.
5. Rocks fall, causing 4d6 damage.
6. A mining charge goes off in the wrong place, inflicting 6d6
damage on the character.

skill), cook (Steward), clerk (Admin or Computer; count admin only
once as a DM, not twice), maintenance (Mechanic) and repair shop
worker (Mechanic, Engineer, or jack-of-all-trades).

Sandstorm: A sandstorm blows out of the desert and strikes the
prison. The shuttle is grounded for several days, and it becomes
dangers to move between buildings on the surface. Prisoners and
staff are moved to underground areas, causing overcrowding. The
warden’s house and its expensive garden require extensive repairs.

Search: The guards conduct a search for contraband. Roll 1D6 and
consult the corresponding paragraph below. A DM of -2 is applied
to all search rolls if the prisoners have been warned of the search in
advance (which will occur if a guard is their friend).

_1._ The prisoners’ persons, the cell blocks, and all work areas are
searched. Any items hidden in areas I or P in the lower mining level
are not found on any throw.
_2._ As above, except the lower mining level is not searched at all.
_3._ As above, except both mining levels are not searched.
_4._ As above, but only the prisoners’ persons and the cellblocks are
searched.
_5._ As above, but only the prisoners’ persons are searched.
_6._ News of the search is blown to the prison population in general,
and the search is cancelled by the warden.

Prisoners caught with contraband may be sent to the danger zone
or to solitary. Guards may, in many cases, accept bribes not to look
too hard in certain areas.

Security Increase: This week there is a -3 DM to any theft attempt’s
success, and a +3 DM to the chances of being caught when out of
one’s assigned area. Any time a guard or staff member is encountered
this week there will be an additional guard with him, roll 1D6 and
add 12 to determine the number of the additional guard present.

Snoop: One player overhears an official conversation; give the
prisoner a randomly selected rumor from this list: 11, 12, 19, 34, 45
or 54. Add one to the prisoner’s prison reputation for repeating this
rumor to the other prisoners.

Staff Friend: The Player Character with the lowest prison reputation
has the opportunity to gain a member of the prison staff as a friend.
The referee should roleplay this encounter, but give the player
every chance to make a good impression on the staff member.
Throw 1D6 and consult the paragraphs below for the identity of
the staff member.

_1. Prison Doctor:_ The prisoner may malinger (see Illness event)
without getting caught, and may gain one dose of drugs per week
(of a sort available in the infirmary). The player may also gain a job
as a medic, if he has any medical skill.
_2. Prison Clerk:_ The prisoner may look up the confidential records of
other prisoners (skills, UPPs and so on) and may have messages
smuggled in and out of the prison.
_3. Assistant Warden:_ The guards will not attack a friend of the
assistant warden. The prisoner may take any safe area job for which
he has the requisite skills (see the event Safe Job). Assistant Warden
Voller expects the prisoner to inform on events in the prison.
_4. Prison Psychologist:_ The prisoner may have messages smuggled in
and out of the prison. The prison psychologist may be able to prevent
implementation of minor penalties (being sent to the danger zone or
to solitary for 8 weeks or less) on a throw of 7+ , if requested.
_5. Prison Chaplain:_ The prison chaplain functions in the same manner
as the prison psychologist.
_6. Rehabilitation Counsellor:_ The rehabilitation counsellor will also
smuggle messages in and out of the prison, and will assign the
prisoner to the vocational rehabilitation area for any given week
on a throw of 8 + (unless the prisoner is in the danger zone or in
solitary).

Prison staff members may become disappointed in prisoners who
have “taken advantage” of their efforts to rehabilitate them, and
cease to be friendly to these prisoners. Prisoners who attempt to
escape, attack guards, or run up a long string of petty offences will
fall into this category.

Suspicious Guard: One of the guards (determine which guard
randomly, unless the player already has a guard as an enemy, in
which case use that guard) hounds one of the characters all week,
following his every move and making his life hell.

Stowaway: The prisoners have a chance to stow away in the cargo
hold of the ore shuttle. If the attempt is made, a Stealth check is
needed to sneak on board (DM - 1 for each person attempting to stow
away). A Very Difficult (-4) Endurance check is for each person to
avoid unconsciousness from oxygen starvation. If all the stowaways
become unconscious, they will be found, apprehended, and hauled
back to the prison. Otherwise they will get loose in Circle City.

Theft Opportunity: The guards have temporarily left the work area
without surveillance, and the leader may steal any item of equipment
without danger of being caught. At this time, the prisoner may steal
an item which may not normally be stolen. If he chooses, he may
steal one of the extremely difficult items not on the equipment

##### RRUNNINGUNNING THETHE A ADVENTUREDVENTURE

list (oxygen tank, vacc suit, mining laser and so on); however, the
administration keeps careful track of these items, and the absence
of one would be noticed, leading to searches and threats of blanket
punishments if the item is not returned. The referee should caution
players not to attempt such thefts unless escape is imminent.

Trip Outside: Three or four prisoners, including all or some of the
group, are taken outside in an ATV with 3 guards and the mining
engineer. The prisoners are taken along to haul some equipment
around and to do some digging. The prisoners learn rumors 19 and

33. The guards are very alert to their own safety, but might let their
attention slip long enough for a prisoner or two to run off into the
desert, if those prisoners are sneaky enough.

Vocational Rehabilitation: The Imperial prison authorities pay lip
service to the idea of rehabilitation in the form of education and

vocational training. One or more of the prisoners in this group will
be transferred to the vocational rehabilitation area for the next week,
this counts as a safe area job.

Warden’s Friend: The prisoner with the lowest prison reputation,
or the most naval experience, has a chance to ingratiate himself
with the warden. The warden picks the prisoner out of the cells and
speaks to him, giving the player a chance to roleplay though this
encounter. If the warden is won over, the prisoner will automatically
gain parole if the event Good Behaviour comes up. He may also
receive a one-year reduction in sentence on a throw of 8+ (this
takes a while as it must be cleared with the warden’s superiors).
The warden will also allow free communication with the prisoner’s
friends, relatives, and lawyers on the outside. Finally, the prisoner
may have a choice of safe area jobs, even if he does not have the
appropriate skill (see the event Safe Job event).

##### RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

The rumors listed below may all be learned by the players through
conversation with a non-player character who knows the rumor.
The referee should note some of the rumors are contradictory,
misleading, irrelevant, or, in a few cases, completely false. As with
events and encounters, the referee should expand and embellish
these rumors when they are presented to the players.

1. There is a person named Parl Klive who lives on the south side of
Circle City and aids escaped prisoners by providing food, clothing,
and hiding places.
2. The assistant warden and even the warden himself have been
known to take bribes, as long as they were large enough.
3. Jan “the Blade” Lintrel escaped by means of an old caved-in lift
shaft to the surface, and then made his way to Circle City. The lift
shaft connects to the upper mining level in area A, but there is quite
a bit of rubble which would have to be surreptitiously cleared away
to make the passage usable again.
4. If one takes vitamin supplements, some of the bad effects of
radioactivity, unhealthy conditions, and bad food may be lessened.
Vitamin supplements may be obtained in the infirmary, if one can
make a case for needing them.
5. There are teams of geologists exploring Keanou for additional
mineral resources. They occasionally bring their vehicles to the
prison for repair or resupply.
6. Jan “the Blade” Lintrel killed a guard, and threw his body down
the lift shaft. Jan took the guard’s shotgun and hid it. Jan is also the
only person ever to have beaten 7057 Big Rolf in a fight.
7. Three prisoners were killed by a “dragon” two years ago. A dragon
is a long, scaled creature with claws, sharp teeth, and poor eyesight.
The dragon was never killed or captured, and it is unknown what
exactly happened to it. Some say it is still lurking around some
corner, waiting for another meal.
8. 8825 Lucky Severn cheats at cards, but it is unwise to accuse
him of doing so, because his cellmate, 9656 Olex Hishinuma, would
probably help take your head off.
9. 3006 Azax Hamid is a capable forger, and will forge documents
for about Cr400 apiece.
10. This rumor consists of the information on prison drug dealers
from page 58.
11. 1731 Bobby Shakh is an informer. It is known he has visited
the warden’s office, and he has been seen talking to G1 Fedor
Sanseido.

# RRUMOURSUMOURS

12. Keanou’s statistics are C792348-7. There is a gas giant in the
system, and a scout base orbiting it. Keanou has seven small
natural satellites which would make good hiding places for a small
spacecraft. The prison complex has an emplacement on the surface
equivalent to a triple beam laser turret, but the authorities aren’t
really worried about a landing from space, as most of the prison
facility is underground.
13. Prisoners are brought to Keanou infrequently, either by Imperial
transports or shipped as cargo in low berths. A shuttle visits the
starport every few weeks to pick up fresh meat.
14. 6533 Arpad Nisha is a psionic of some sort, and would be better
off dead. There have been a few other psionics sent to this prison,
and some of them have suffered fatal “accidents”.
15. Danger zone area I is not really very radioactive. It is used as a
meeting place by prisoners, because the guards never go there.
16. Jan “the Blade” Lintrel was killed outside the prison during
an escape attempt. 2076 Etienne Lalaji was Lintrel’s cellmate and
closest friend.
17. 7404 Pandit Espartero stole a power pack and has it hidden
somewhere. This is normally a very difficult thing to do. What
exactly Pandit wanted the power pack for is unclear.
18. There is a narrow connection from the upper mining level area A
to an old caved-in lift shaft, which may still connect to the surface.
It has been used for escape attempts before, but last year part of it
collapsed, and it would probably take some work to open up. This
would be tricky because the guards do sometimes patrol area A.
19. The prison is surrounded by desert, with some mountains
to the southwest and west. It is known to rain in the mountains
sometimes.
20. The prison doctor smuggles liquor into the prison for his own
consumption, and sometimes sells it to prisoners.
21. 9047 Rand Gurish has been quietly looking around for someone
with the Astrogation skill.
22. The starport warden at Circle City can be bribed for 2-3 thousand
credits to issue fraudulent clearance papers to a group of people.
23. G5 Emil Patowic has a small-scale smuggling operation going,
and would probably be happy to do some business.
24. Circle City is the only major population center on Keanou. It lies
5,000 kilometers E-NE of the prison. A shuttle based at the prison
regularly carries ore to Circle City for transhipment.

##### RUMOURS

##### RRUMOURSUMOURS

25. 6724 Jaime Giligis has several sets of old guard uniforms stashed
away, which he stole from the prison laundry.
26. G9 Harv Wuckel is frequently drunk while on duty, and gets
rather talkative at times. He sometimes lets information out about
upcoming searches and guard patrols.
27. This rumor consists of the additional information section on
page 4 of _Incarcerated_!
28. Danger zone areas I and P are very radioactive, and should be
avoided at all costs, unless you don’t mind having your hair fall
out.
29. 2977 Jack Shansir is insane, and attacks everyone he encounters,
as long as they don’t have a gun. He killed one of his previous
cellmates for snoring.
30. Aron Hasisto knifed a guard last year and disappeared
shortly thereafter. No one seems to want to talk about Aron’s
whereabouts.
31. There are some desert survival kits in the lockers next to the repair
shop, put there a few years ago when the prison administration was
rearranging some other facilities, and no one remembered to return
them to the proper storage area.
32. A group of 5 prisoners escaped about 4 years ago by overpowering
the guards on the lift shaft, stealing an ATV, driving to Circle City,
and shipping out from there. One of them, 2537 Axel Herrmon, was
recaptured last year and returned here.
33. Thorned sagitta plants may be tapped for water. There are many
of these plants in the desert surrounding the prison. The flesh of
these plants is edible, but doesn’t taste very good.
34. The guards can shut off all the lighting, lifts, ventilation, and
power for any mining equipment from the surface, or from the main
guard station on the administrative level. They may also flood any
area with tear gas or knock-out gas; filter masks are no protection.
35. 1215 Ward Stamboul is very good at repair work, although he
sometimes pretends to know more about some sorts of equipment
than he really does.
36. 6534 Mehmet Romule is a filthy psionic.
    37. 9656 Olex Hishinuma is a past master at unarmed combat. He
    and his cellmate, 8825 Lucky Severn, run the prison numbers racket,
    as well as being involved in other sorts of gambling. Olex is really a
    nice guy if you don’t owe him any money.
    38. About 15 years ago, a ramp collapsed, killing several prisoners. It
    used to connect the cellblock level with the upper mining level.
    39. There is a carefully concealed connection to a natural cave
    system in the danger zone area M. It may connect with the outside,
    although no one is really sure just where it goes.
    40. The guards are lax about sounding out the rock walls when
    searching for contraband. Sometimes they can be bribed to avoid
    searching an area at all.
    41. 1640 Nero Holt cannot keep secrets, and shouldn’t be entrusted
    with any important information.
    42. 8107 Jon Kupishii is adept at dealing with the prison
    administration, and may undertake to aid others in this regard as
    long as they offer at least Cr200.
    43. Most of the population on Keanou lives in Circle City, which
    is a long way away to the north and east. The locals are taciturn
    and surly, but dislike the Imperium intensely. They trade skoggie
    pelts, skoggies being ugly little 25 kg hunters found in areas of heavy
    vegetation in the northern hemisphere. Skoggie hunters are bores,
    and the night life in Circle City is the pits.
    44. Most indigenous life forms on Keanou are edible, with the
    exception of squealers, a type of eight-legged lizard-like creature.
    45. Guard morale is poor, due to poor pay, dangerous conditions,
    lack of entertainment or recreational facilities, long hours, and
    personality conflicts with the warden. The guards sometimes take
    their frustrations out on the prisoners.
    46. There is a small community of escaped prisoners, approximately
    1,500 kilometers to the northeast of the prison. They keep themselves
    hidden, and subsist by agriculture.
    47. 5426 Spiro Taodon is an expert lockpick.
    48. This rumor consists of the information on gangs from
    page 58.

##### RRUMOURSUMOURS

49. G3 Gorod Chihaya is a sadist, and enjoys inflicting pain on
prisoners. He should be avoided at all costs. He’s also got subdermal
armor.
50. G10 Semyon Wainrite can be easily bribed.
51. G11 Vittorio Krane is easily provoked into sending prisoners to
the danger zone for minor offences, like littering or not saying “sir”
to him.
52. 8144 Eneri Shadashi is a rampant kleptomaniac, who probably
would have had his brains beaten in already, except for the fact it is
fairly easy to recover items from him (he doesn’t seem to want them
anymore after he has stolen them). He will probably get his brains
beaten in sometime anyway.
53. The composition of the escape committee is 1935 Felip
Karageorge, 2537 Axel Herrmon, and 2167 Dan Amgi. The escape
committee meets at irregular intervals and discusses plans of
escape. It is a prestigious post to have, although it is uncertain if
they actually accomplish anything. The first escape committee is
reputed to have had all four members escape about thirty years ago,
in a fashion which neither the prison administration or the other
prisoners have been able to figure out.
54. There is an elaborate computer security routine which scans the
prison through cameras and microphones. It is very difficult, if not
impossible, for the prisoners to gain access to the computer. Some
areas of the prison are not covered by cameras, including much of

the lower mining level, some of the surface buildings, and shafts
in the upper mining level which have been dug within the last five
years. Occasionally one of the cameras has malfunctioned and has
not been repaired for quite some time.

55. The prison’s solar cells need to be cleaned and maintained. It’s
hard work out on the surface, but the guards don’t watch closely.
The guard in charge is G13 Brandt – make friends with him and he’ll
sort you out with that work detail.
56. S2 Assistant Warden Voller is the real power in the prison. Cross
him at your peril.
61. There is a deep pit in the Danger Zone called The Hole. If you
really piss off the guards, you go in The Hole for a week.
62. 1215 Ward Stamboul can make weapons using common supplies
in the repair shop.
63. The code to the armory door is either 6713 or 7613.
64. There are spice fields to the south of the prison; the local noble
has slaves who gather the spice and sell it offworld.
65. Dustspice is farmed on several worlds in the Spinward Marches;
the Aslan love the stuff.
66. There is another level of caves beneath the Danger Zone, and
there’s something very strange down there.

##### RUMOURS

##### INCIDENTS

The players may be initially confused by the new environment in
which they find themselves. Incidents are events designed to
illuminate to the players some aspect of prison existence. They are
an indirect way for the players to get an idea of the rules of the game
so they may begin playing it effectively.

A secondary purpose of incidents is to introduce additional colour
to the adventure. The referee should embellish the situations
given below and may create new ones as he sees fit. If prison life
ever enters a dull period, or if players are persistently unable to
understand what they could or should be doing, the referee should
introduce an appropriate incident without waiting for the roll on the
event table.

The incidents should generally be presented in the order given
below, although the referee may alter the order if necessary.

## ADVENTURES

In addition to the basic incidents, there are several more significant
and dangerous adventures can take place in the prison. The referee
should pick two or more of these adventures and run them in parallel.
Each of these adventures consists of a number of incidents affecting
the lives of everyone in the prison. The six adventures are:

- Outbreak: A plague hits the prison, forcing the staff to
    quarantine the prisoners in the tunnels below. Unless the
    true source of the plague is found, everyone in the prison will
    become infected. _Outbreak_ takes place over a few days, so the
    whole adventure is a single incident.
- Kings Of A Small World: One of the prison gangs tries to recruit
    the prisoners, leading to a vicious gang war in Tarkwall. This
    adventure takes place over several months, so it should be run
    alongside other adventures.
- Power Play: Assistant Warden Voller attempts to remove Warden
    Grice and put Tarkwall Prison entirely under his control, using
    the characters as his pawns. This adventure takes place over
    several weeks.
- Machines of Loving Grace: The prison’s computer system,
    CARL, becomes increasingly self-aware, independent – and
    psychotically dangerous. It needs the characters to help it
    achieve freedom.
- Ancient Legacy: An earthquake opens up the deeper cave network,
    uncovering an ancient alien outpost buried beneath the sands for
    millennia. _Ancient Legacy_ takes place over a few weeks.
- Escape!: This adventure covers the likely methods for escaping
    from Tarkwall Prison, and the reactions of the guards and staff.

###### 1. Encounter with a Gang

The prisoners get shaken down for any money or drugs they
possess by the gang in their cellblock. If the prisoners have nothing
or successfully conceal what they do have, then they may be beaten
up. Any guards present pointedly look the other way.

If the prisoners complain to anyone about this rude treatment, they
are told by an older prisoner like 3006 Azax Hamid they should not
cause trouble, they should not ask stupid questions, they definitely
should not go to the guards with anything like this, they should avoid
talking to the wrong people, and they should never bother anyone
with a bad temper (which includes quite a few people around here).
The referee should give a brief description of this cellblock’s gang.

###### 2. A Thief in Action and How to Hide Things

The player character see a prisoner (later identified as 8144 Eneri
Shadashi) steal a small package from another prisoner, who
unsuccessfully gives chase and then storms off, swearing vengeance.
Another prisoner tells them it is unwise to carry anything valuable
on one’s person.

He says the best hiding places are on the lower mining level, for the
guards rarely if ever search there. Failing that, the best places are in
hollowed out crannies in the rock, but it usually takes several weeks
of surreptitious work to make a good one in a cell, and even longer
in a work area; to make a hiding place in one’s cell it is of course
necessary to steal something to scrape with.

Prisoners sometimes steal things from each other, but if one
successfully tracks down and beats up the miscreant, it is not nearly
as likely in the future.

###### 3. Hopes for Legal Release

A prisoner, 3120 Otto Mefoil, was found dead in his cell this morning.
He had apparently hung himself. Otto had served 15 years, and was
due for parole for good behaviour in a month, but parole had been
unexpectedly denied due to a minor legal technicality, and Otto’s
release had been delayed for 10 years. The word going around is the
prison mine is not meeting its quota, so the prison administration is
using underhanded means to keep the prisoners here, and mining.
It is also rumored the warden has received a bad evaluation from
his Imperial superiors and is taking it out on the prisoners.

Otto is buried in an unmarked grave on the surface with no ceremony.
One of the prisoners was called upon to help dig the grave, and so
should be given a description of the surface layout.

# IINCIDENTSNCIDENTS

##### IINCIDENTSNCIDENTS

###### 4. The Pecking Order

The prisoners are eating dinner when an argument erupts between
1470 Jack Shansir and 3305 Billy Imushdi. Jack apparently stole
Billy’s freeze-dried artificial pseudofruit, and Billy complained.
Shansir does not say anything very articulate in defence, but merely
punches Billy out. The area around Billy’s prone form is immediately
vacated, before the arrival of the guards. When Billy comes to, the
guards tell him he is being sent to the danger zone for four weeks as
punishment for starting a fight. No one else says anything. Later the
prisoners learn Billy, who is apparently a new prisoner, collapsed in
the danger zone and was taken to the infirmary, where it was found
his jaw was fractured.

The fight precipitates an argument over who is the meanest prisoner
around. The person who brings it up claims Jack Shansir is, but
several other prisoners chime in and speak in favor of 7057 Big Rolf
and/or 6866 Gerard Benezech. One prisoner makes a claim 9656
Olex Hishinuma could take either of them, and then several other
names are bandied about: 2977 Anton Kugazur, 8152 Peroz Atheling
(who apparently is not well liked), 2365 Seljuk the Knife, 9416 Rod
Maged, 2076 Etienne Lalaji, 2673 “Killer” Basimu, 2167 Dan Amgi,
0571 Ashgu the Ape, 8046 Satoshi Honig, 3632 Halse Eisen, 6960
Yussef Shelton, and 1711 Razeem Thonon. Finally someone says
Jan “the Blade” Lintrel could have beaten any of them, were he still
around, which seems to have settled the argument.

###### 5. A Visit From Outside

The prison is visited by a committee from Circle City, who have
come to review conditions in the cell blocks and work zones. The
committee consists of V3 Inspector Borun, V4 Cala Ingrun and V5
Vilad Konnen, along with a few other clerks and dignitaries. The
committee flies in one morning and spends the day touring the
prison and reviewing records. They then dine with the warden and
senior staff before flying back home at nightfall.

Each visitor has his own reason for coming to Tarkwall. V3
Inspector Borun is looking for more evidence of Warden Grice’s
incompetence, and will be well disposed towards any prisoners who
provide testimony about poor conditions or mistreatment. V4 Cala
Ingrun just wants assurances the mining and ore production will
continue unabated, and will be furious if there is any sign mining
is slowing. V5 Vilad Konnen wants evidence the mines are being
worked out, in the hopes he can ‘borrow’ a few prisoners as slave
labour for his spice plantations in the southern desert. Each player
will be interviewed by a random visitor.

After the visit, the warden may be pleased or furious depending on
the testimony of the prisoners to the visitors. The warden wants

V3 Inspector Borun to go away with nothing (or, better yet, to fall
down a lift shaft and die slowly and painfully), for V4 Cala Ingrun to
be confident in the mine’s productivity, and does not give a damn
about V5 Vilad Konnen.

###### 66. A Crackdown Gives Rise to Theorizing

The warden gives a speech to the prisoners (a rare occurrence).
He claims the prisoners are lazy and unwilling to work towards
redemption, and unless production in the mine increases all
privileges will be suspended. He then goes into some meaningless
drivel about self-improvement. The mood of the prisoners is
uniformly sullen, but the warden is behind a dozen guards with
levelled shotguns, so angry muttering is the limit of resistance.

The next day of mining is very bad. Everyone misses their quotas
and the guards, in a foul mood, beat up several prisoners. Talk about
escape plans runs rampant for several weeks. One of the players is
in on one of the conversations.

A few of the prisoners seem to think a mass uprising would work,
but most are of the opinion it would be a bloodbath with most of the
blood coming from the prisoners themselves, especially considering
the computer security program. A few pessimists seem to believe
the electronic surveillance system is unbeatable, but someone else
argues it has been beaten in the past, by one Attil Raspori, a slick
conman in for computer fraud, who used a position in the prison
clerk’s office and his computer skill to sneak himself out of the
prison.

One old prisoner claims once one is free on the surface, the guards
do not look too hard, because they assume you will soon be dead.
Another prisoner retorts it hardly matters what the guards think, if
you are dead!

The old prisoner, however, is not daunted, and relates several
stories about surviving in the desert, about moving only at night
to avoid the heat, finding water inside certain thorn plants,
and living off several types of edible animals and plants. The
discussion slips into a forum on just how to get to the surface
in the first place. One wag claims bribing the warden is probably
the best way if you have enough credits, for he is certainly a lying,
hypocritical crook.

Other prisoners claim there are abandoned mine shafts leading to
the surface, and one even claims it is possible to escape by going
down through a system of natural caves below the mine, although
he does not seem to know just where the connection is.

##### IINCIDENTSNCIDENTS INCIDENTS

Most seem to think the best method is to acquire a prison job which
involves having access to the surface, and then just sneaking off.
This provokes a comment about “bleaching bones in the desert”.

Someone starts describing a plan for stowing away in the shuttle
which carries ore to Circle City, when someone else interrupts to
propose an attack by friendly space pirates, an idea everyone seems
to approve of. At this point the loudspeaker announces free time is
over and the gathering breaks up.

###### 7. New Cellblock

The electronic lock mechanism on one of the prisoners’ cell doors
shorts out and won’t lock, so he is moved to a different cellblock for
the next 8 weeks. The referee should give the prisoner a rundown on
the prisoners in the new cellblock.

###### 8. Gloom Increases

One prisoner arrives along with several other onlookers just in time
to see a guard ordering several other prisoners to drag a body away.
A prisoner, 4410 Arnie Prunt, has had his hand cut off by a piece
of heavy mining equipment. No one tried to help him as he bled to
death. The prisoner hears one of the other prisoners complaining
several fatal accidents have occurred with no improvement in safety,
and safety regulations are flagrantly ignored. Another prisoner just
laughs and asks “What’s worth living for down here anyway?”
Someone else pipes up and claims if a prisoner was very seriously
injured, he would be transferred to the hospital in Circle City, where
the security is not very tight. The other prisoner laughs again and
says security does not have to be very tight when someone is almost
dead.

###### 9. Local Attitudes toward Psionics

The prisoners see a group of other prisoners deliver a sound beating
to 6533 Arpad Nisha, while referring to him as a “dirty psionic”. The
bystanders seem to be ready to help beat him up, if only there were
enough room. The leader of the mob is 6960 Yussef Shelton. About
20 minutes later, a couple of guards arrive and roughly drag Arpad
off to the infirmary. One of the bystanders tells one of the prisoners
that although the Imperium does not usually send psionics here, a
few occasionally filter in, and he thinks the Imperium really ought
to have them all killed to protect the rest of the populace from
monsters like them.

###### 10. Gang Harassment

The characters are attacked again by the same gang who attacked
them in Incident 1 – Encounter with a Gang. Again, the characters
are shaken down for any credits, drugs or other useful items they
have. If they fail to produce the goods, they are beaten up and told
they have two weeks to get at least 200 credits worth of drugs
or weapons each, or one of the characters will have a very nasty
accident down in the mines.

###### 11. A Change of Scenery

The characters are selected for a new work assignment for one
month. Each morning before dawn, they are loaded onto the
prisoner shuttle and flown south to the spice fields, where they
labour on behalf of V5 Konnen in the searing light of the sun. Spice
gathering is described on page 121. The characters are watched by
armed guards from the prison while working in the fields, but it is a
good chance to escape. This incident takes on a larger significance
if played as part of Power Play.

###### 12. Innocent Merriment

Some prisoners manage to trap G3 Gorod Chihaya between levels in
the lift after having thrown a bucket of very rotten garbage on him.
Apparently they were able to drop some stones into the lift shaft
machinery and stop it. When Gorod gets out, he beats up 3305 Billy
Imushdi, who is entirely innocent. Privileges are suspended and
security is increased for the next four weeks (see the event Security
Increase).

###### 13. Cave-in

The prisoners (only those involved in mining; if none are working on
a mining level, they merely hear about this later) see a cave-in which
traps two other prisoners (roll on the encounter table to determine
their identities, rerolling any guard or staff result). Quick action
could save them, but poking around in the rubble could provoke a
further collapse.

To rescue the trapped prisoners, the characters (or other non-player
characters present) will have to clear the cave-in without triggering a
bigger rock-fall. Clearing the cave-in requires a total of 100 Strength
worth of work (so, one character with Strength 10 working for 10
rounds, or five characters with Strength 5 working for four rounds,
or any combination adding up to Strength 100. Each round of work,

##### INCIDENTS INCIDENTS

roll 2d6, with a +1DM for every four workers (rounding down). On a
12+, there is a second cave-in, inflicting 6d6 damage on all workers
and trapping them.

A successful rescue adds 2 to the prison reputation of each prisoner
involved and gains the friendship of the rescued prisoners.

###### 114. Haute Cuisine

The entire prison population is stricken with food poisoning. Each
prisoner is sent for a visit to the infirmary. Each prisoner may meet
the prison doctor or one of the medics: 1217 Talbot Vinge, 0730
Winston Urmarush, or 1935 Felip Karageorge. Up to 6 doses of
vitamin supplements may be had for the asking, and attempts may
be made to steal other drugs, due to overcrowded conditions which
make it difficult to watch everyone.

Two days after this episode, the prison cafeteria erupts in a free-
for-all food fight, after a prisoner tells the cook the food is terrible,
and he resents being poisoned. Unfortunately the cook at this time
is 9416 Rod Maged, and the new prisoner ends up mopping up the
mess (that is to say, Rod uses him for a mop). Rod, however, receives
quite a few bruises when he personally tries to assault everyone who
cheered when the new prisoner uttered his remarks. The warden
cancels dessert privileges for the next month as punishment for the
fracas, but the prison cafeteria hardly ever serves desserts anyway.

###### 15. A Windfall

One of the prisoners finds 2D6 doses of narcotics ditched in a
corner by another prisoner seeking to avoid a search. The prisoner
may attempt to peddle the drugs, keeping in mind the prison’s other
drug dealers, 1217 Talbot Vinge and 0730 Winston Urmarush have
the market pretty well tied up in cell blocks 1 and 2, respectively.

###### 16. Run for It

If the prisoners are still in prison at this point, their big chance
has come. An accident on the surface has set the shuttle fuel tank
ablaze. It explodes and sets many of the surface buildings on fire.
The guards bring up a gang of prisoners to fight the blaze. A second
explosion and the resulting confusion create a situation where the
prisoners are out of sight of the guards in the vicinity of the vehicle
storage area, which is also empty of other prisoners. The prisoners
have been able to bring nothing with them but their wits, and should
use them before the fire is brought under control.

##### OUTBREAK

_One of the curious things about space, reflected Talbot Vinge, is how
much time one has to consider things. He knew the imperial authorities
were on their way, but their cutter would not arrive at his research
station for another ten hours. He had a shuttle waiting at the axial
dock, but this would only delay his arrest by – he thought for a moment_

_- another six hours, based on the relative accelerations of the shuttle
and the cutter. Mathematics dictated there was no escape._

_Suicide was, of course, an option. If he chose that course, then he had
a wealth of choices. This one laboratory contained hundreds of lethal
compounds, many of which Vinge had himself invented over the last
two years. He could even, if he wished, take the imperial agents to hell
with him – the focus of his research was on plagues which could bypass
filters and bioscanners._

_He made his decision. He touched one control, and the lab flared
blue as plasma incinerated his life’s work. Another control erased the
computer logs completely, wiping then physically destroying the storage
system. There was nothing left of Vinge’s bioweapons research, nothing
but his own memories and the contents of the six pea-sized sample sacs
in the safe._

_He pressed a third control. ‘Subotai, come here. I need you.’_

This adventure takes place over several days in the prison. The key
non-player character is 1217 Talbot Vinge, one of the prison’s drug
dealers and a former scientist. Five years ago, Vinge was arrested
for bioweapons development and condemned to Tarkwall Prison.
His bodyguard and thug 0014 Subotai Shadad was arrested at the
same time.

Before his arrest, Vinge destroyed his lab. The Imperium still had
enough evidence to convict him, but Vinge did receive a lighter
sentence than his persecutors hoped. To preserve his work, Vinge
preserved samples of his plagues in the lungs of Subotai Shahad.
Not even Subotai knows about this - Vinge drugged Subotai before
implanting the sacs.

The sacs should have lasted until both Vinge and Subotai were
released from prison. They are virtually undetectable and perfectly
harmless... unless damaged.

## 1. THE BRAWL

Any characters working in the mines hear an argument break out
between 0014 Subotai Shanad and 3136 Stiv the Blade. The two
are arguing quite openly over a case of painkillers stolen from
the infirmary; each one accuses the other of taking the drugs and

angering the guards. Before anyone can intervene, Stiv swings the
handle of his mining pick into Subotai’s chest, knocking the other
prisoner to the ground. Stiv tries to smash Subotai again, but
Subotai is too quick for him – Subotai leaps up, grabs his own pick,
and starts beating on Stiv.

If the characters do not act, Subotai continues to batter Stiv with
the pick, viciously beating his victim. Stiv is taken by surprise by
the sudden counter-attack and fails to put up much resistance. The
guards show up after a minute and restrain Subotai, shouting he
will go to the Hole for this. G2 Ivan Elishdu drags Stiv to his feet.
Subotai screams insults and death threats at Stiv, then suddenly
bends over and coughs up blood and sputum. Ivan offers to bring
Stiv to the infirmary, but the prisoner insists he is only winded and
is instead brought back to his cell. Subotai is brought down to the
Danger Zone and throw into the Hole.

The patch of blood and vomit spewed up by Subotai is left behind, a
stained reminder of prison brutality.

## 2. FALLING STAR

Around the same time as the attack on Subotai, any characters on the
surface see a shooting star flash across the sky. Meteorites are not
uncommon on Keanou, as its thick and highly ionised atmosphere
gives rise to brilliant light shows when the planet runs through dust
clouds. This shooting star was something much larger, and could
even be a piece of space debris. Warden Grice wants it investigated,
so he orders G13 Brandt Ulmerkim to take one of the ATVs and a
work gang to track down the debris. Any characters in good standing
with the authorities will be assigned to this work gang.

The meteorite landed only a few kilometers away from the prison,
in the rocky hills to the southwest. The old ATV covers the ground
steadily, and the sandy desert gives way to scorched rock. Ahead,
the characters can see a huge dust cloud hanging over the hills. A
Space Science (planetology) roll lets the character guess a meteor
broke up in the atmosphere over Keanou and impacted somewhere
in the hills.

After several hours searching using metal detectors, the characters
find a few metal fragments, still scorching hot from their passage
through the atmosphere. The ‘meteor’ was definitely artificial, but it
could be anything from an old satellite to a ship’s waste pod. Brandt
orders the characters to collect any pieces they can. He runs his
geiger counter over the metal shards, and finds nothing unusual.
Optionally, throw an attack by some of Keanou’s native wildlife at
this point.

##### OUTBREAK

### 3. OUTBREAK

Back in the prison, a plague is spreading. It began when Subotai
coughed up a damaged sac. The initial three victims are Subotai,
Stiv and guard Ivan. Stiv is in his cell, Subotai’s in the hole, and
Ivan is patrolling the mining level. Any characters in the mining level
or Danger Zone will run into Ivan during his patrol. After a while,
Ivan begins to feel ill and heads back to the admin level, where he
collapses in the guard station.

As the guards are examining their fallen comrade, CARL alerts them
to odd behaviour on the mining level. Several prisoners are showing
signs of illness. Characters on the mining level see other prisoners
collapse or break out with other signs of the plague (see sidebar).
Panic spreads through the guard’s station as they realise a plague
is loose in the prison.

In an attempt to contain the situation, the warden orders all prisoners
to return to their cells immediately. If any of the characters are in the
Danger Zone, they are hurried back up to the lifts. Subotai is left in
the Hole, but in the hasty exit, one of the other prisoners drops his
mining pick near the edge of the hole, and it falls in. The guards do
not care, and order the prisoners to leave immediately.

During this stage of the adventure, the characters should be feeling
terrified and powerless. Depending on their work assignments, they
may have no idea about recent events in the prison.

### 4. QUARANTINE

AAlarmed by the growing crisis, Warden Grice orders the lower levels
sealed. The first sign of this isolation is a change in the ever-present
whine of the ventilation fans – more than half of them suddenly shut
down, disconnecting the sublevel’s air recycling and filtering system
from those of the surface buildings. Most of the guards and staff
leave the underground levels before the lifts are shut down.

Only a handful of guards remain, and all of these guards are already
showing signs of being ill.

If the characters are considered trustworthy by the guards, or if they
are not showing any signs of the disease yet, then they are drafted
in as emergency help. G5 Emil visits their cells and informs them the
warden wants a few good men to help out while the staff are sick.

###### Viral Sample X54VI1

The plague released by Subotai is, fortunately, not the most lethal of the diseases hidden in the sacs. It was designed to be extremely
virulent and to penetrate biofilters and other defence systems. Everyone in the prison’s subsurface levels has been exposed to the
plague.

The plague has several stages; the speed of a character’s progress depends on the Endurance score of the victim.

EnduranceEndurance Time In Each StageTime In Each Stage
2 1d6 x 10 minutes
3-5 1d6 x 20 minutes
6-8 1d6 x 30 minutes
9-11 1d6 hours
12+ 2d6 hours

Stage 0: No visible effects. Highly contagious.
Stage 1: Mild dizziness, nausea, feeling of weakness. Highly contagious.; -1 Endurance
Stage 2: Red blotches on face, irritation of mucous membranes. Highly contagious.
Stage 3: Increased nausea and vomiting. Highly contagious. -1 Endurance
Stage 4: Strong fever and hallucinations. Contagious. -1d6 Endurance. See Madness Strikes.
Stage 5: Recovery begins, blotches turn to reddish-purple.
A character who is reduced to Endurance 0 or less by the disease is in danger of death. Roll 2d6 each hour for any character at Endurance
0; he dies on a 7-. A character who receives active medical treatment can be kept alive during this phase and does not need to roll. A
character who gets to stage 5 with a positive Endurance will survive.

###### Divided Groups

It is possible the player characters may find themselves split
between the surface and sub-surface sections of the prison
during the quarantine, in which case the characters on the
surface can be the ones investigating Dr. Talbot and treating the
infected guards, while those on the lower levels are fending off
hallucinating prisoners and hunting Subotai. If possible, arrange
for a comm to fall into the hands of both groups, so they can stay
in touch and advise each other.

##### OOUTBREAKUTBREAK OUTBREAK

If the characters agree to help and, more importantly, don’t try to
escape, then Emil will release them from their cells and give them
a comm so they can receive orders from the surface. Most of these
orders will be from the guards, but the researchers in the infirmary
and the Wardens may also contact them.

The characters’ initial orders during the quarantine period are trivial
ones – prepare food for the prisoners in the cells, run errands for the
guards and so on. As the investigation into the disease continues,
though, the characters may be asked to take blood samples, check
in on prisoners, bring collapsed guards to the lift and even enter
restricted areas to check on records.

The characters’ movements will be tracked as far as possible via
computer surveillance, but this is still a golden opportunity for the
characters to move around the prison unrestricted. More and more
guards leave the subsurface area, until only a skeleton crew is left.

With a Difficult (-2) Medic roll, a character can come up with a semi-
effective course of treatment for the disease using medicinal drugs;
this course of treatment reduces all Endurance losses from the
plague by 1 point per Effect.

With a successful Science roll, a character can analyse the scrap
metal brought back from the hills and discover there is no sign of
any organic material on it – the disease did not come from there.

Other possible sources of infection the players might ask about:

- Who is the most recent arrival? The most recent prisoner to
    arrive at Tarkwall is a young pickpocket called Aral Vilsn; he is
    locked in Cellblock 3. He arrived one week ago. Like everyone
    else in the subsurface levels, Aral is suffering from the plague
    and is terrified he is going to die. If the characters suggest Aral
    is responsible for the plague, then his cellmate Jarak tries to kill
    Aral with a stolen screwdriver.
- Were there any recent deliveries at the prison? Other than the
    usual regular deliveries, there has been no change in the prison
    regime lately.
- What about the caves? There are rumors about caves beneath
    the Danger Zone, and it is possible the prisoners picked up
    some weird native disease down there, perhaps from an animal
    bite.

###### Stiv’s Dead, Baby

One of the first assignments for the characters in the sub-levels is
to check in on the wounded Stiv, who was recently beaten up by
Subotai. Stiv’s cellmate is 0730 Winston Urmarush, so there is no-
one else in the cell with Stiv. When the characters arrive at the cell,
they discover Stiv has rolled out of bed and is lying against the bars,
muttering to himself. The blotches on his face have turned blue, and
he is babbling nonsense about demons and ghosts with very sharp
picks. As he mutters and moans to the characters, he suddenly
starts coughing and then keels over, dead.

Stiv’s death was due to the combination of the wounds inflicted on
him by Subotai, and the disease rampaging through his system, but
paranoid players will leap to the assumption the plague is lethal.

If the characters contact the infirmary and describe Stiv’s appearance
to Talbot Vinge, he will sound worried and ask them to repeat their
description, carefully. He asks several other questions, like ‘ are his
eyes reddened?’ or ‘ check the toilet – has he vomited recently?’ (the
answer to both questions is ‘yes’). Vinge sounds like he knows what
is going on, but refuses to say more.

###### Patient Zero

Clever players may look for the first occurrence of the disease. G2
Ivan is the most advanced case among the guards; he is brought
to the infirmary as soon as he collapses. Stiv is the most advanced

###### Let’s Just Stay In Our Cells

Characters with low prison reps may find themselves stuck in
their cells for much of this adventure. Even the characters who
are freed may just follow the instructions of the guards and not
get involved in solving the mystery of the plague. If so, the plague
will eventually be dealt with by Dr. Talbot, but the characters run
the risk of dying of the plague by waiting too long.

###### Let’s Escape

Ambitious players may take advantage of the chaos in the prison
to try escaping. It is certainly a good time to bypass security, but
the characters will have to deal with the problem of crossing the
desert while sickened by an Endurance-sapping disease.

### 5. INVESTIGATION

While the lower sections of the prison are in quarantine, the
investigation into the mysterious disease and its origins continues in
the infirmary. Talbot Vinge and 0730 Winston Urmarush have taken
the lead in this; S6 Doctor Blint has no idea on how to deal with this
crisis. Any player characters with medical or scientific expertise, or
those who accompanied Talbot does not yet know about the injuries
inflicted on Subotai, and so has not connected the symptoms seen
in the prison with his old experiments.

###### The Disease

Urmarush suspects the disease is related to the meteorite – during
his time in the Scout Service, he encountered several space-bourn
diseases. He initially suggests everyone exposed to the meteorite
be placed in quarantine, but as the disease appears to be affecting
only those in the mines, this suggestion is overruled. Urmarush
hypothesises that perhaps the pathogen was airborne and filtered
down to the mines via the air vents, or it is somehow triggered or
accelerated by conditions in the mines, perhaps by the radiation.

##### OUTBREAK OOUTBREAKUTBREAK

case in the quarantined area. Tracing the progress of the disease
through the prison appears to match the movements of these two
individuals – for example, more guards than staff are sick because
Ivan went to the guard’s station, while Cellblock 2 where Stiv died is
the most infected of the three cellblocks.

If the characters saw the brawl earlier, or ask around, then they can
connect Ivan and Stiv to Subotai. Subotai has been left behind in
The Hole, so the characters have no idea what his condition is.

###### The Records

With access to the administration block, the characters can look into
Subotai’s records. A Routine (+2) Admin roll reveals Subotai and
Talbot Vinge were both arrested for crimes against the Imperium,
specifically the development of ‘weapons banned under the Imperial
Rules of War’. A bit of digging through the records brings up the file
on Talbot’s arrest (see sidebar).

Therefore, characters in the lower mines may be attacked by any
prisoners not restrained in the cells. If they freed anyone earlier in
the scenario, or if there are still guards on the lower levels, or if
some characters are still locked in cells with their cellmates, then
they have to deal with these hostile prisoners. The ravages of the
disease will have lowered the Endurance of their foes, but in a way
this is even more dangerous, as it makes it more likely the characters
will inflict lethal damage on the hallucinating prisoner. (Remember,
anyone reduced to 0 Endurance while infected with the plague has
a chance of dying.)

If any of the characters enter the fourth phase of the disease, they
will begin to suffer from hallucinations themselves. The referee
should initially subtly work these hallucinations into his description
of events. For example, two characters are looking through records
in the administration bloc. One character is in stage three, and
perceives the prison records correctly as a roster of prisoners. The
second character has just entered stage four, and perceives the
prison records as a litany of threats against him, or a warning from
God the first character is trying to kill him. In the later stages of
the fourth phase of the disease, hallucinations may make other
characters appear as monsters, or former enemies of the victim.
For example, a character who was once tortured by Vargr pirates
might see the other prisoners as rabid, hairy, vicious wolf-men or a
character on the run from the mob on his homeworld sees the other
prisoners as mob enforcers and legbreakers.

### 7. DR. TALBOT, I PRESUME?

There are two ways this encounter can be triggered. Ideally, the
characters put together the evidence, connecting the plague,
Subotai, and Talbot’s arrest on charges of bioweapons development
and then confront Talbot themselves. Talbot’s odd reaction to the
description of Stiv’s symptoms is another big clue. Alternatively, if
the players fail to work out what’s going on themselves, then Talbot
can contact them secretly via comm once he realises one of his
creations is loose in the prison.

END TRANSCRIPT

### 6. MADNESS STRIKES

As the disease continues, more and more of those infected will
pass into the fourth and most dangerous stage. In the fourth phase,
the infected individual suffers a severe loss of Endurance, and also
hallucinates wildly. Most of these hallucinations take the form of
violent paranoid delusions, where the patient believes he is under
attack and those around him are trying to murder him, or are alien
monsters trying to eat him which amounts to the same thing.

##### OOUTBREAKUTBREAK

Either way, Talbot prefers to speak to the characters in secret – the
diseases in Subotai’s lungs are worth millions of credits to the
right buyer, for one thing, and Talbot will likely face execution if the
Ministry of Justice discovers the true extent of his crimes. If he can,
he offers them a cut of his drug-smuggling business while in prison
and a cut of the sale price of the bioweapons when he gets out of
prison. In exchange, they need to help him cure the disease and
secure the other plagues.

Talbot tells the characters he can deal with the disease, now he knows
what it is – the plague is a genetically modified variant of a common
virus from a distant sector of the Imperium, and will respond to a
cocktail of common drugs available in Circle City. He can ask Doctor
Blint to fly in enough drugs to cure everyone in a few hours.

The bigger problem is Subotai Shadad. Really, everyone in the prison
was incredibly lucky – if a different disease sac had gotten loose, then
everyone in the prison would be dead. Subotai contains viruses of far
greater lethality than the one released. However, if one disease got
loose, then the other sacs may have been weakened by the brawl too –
Talbot needs Subotai or his body in the infirmary as soon as possible.

If the characters betray Talbot, or take their discoveries directly to
the prison authorities, then Talbot is immediately restrained and
interrogated. The characters still need to hunt down Subotai, as
none of the guards are willing to go close to someone who is a
walking plague bomb. The warden does send down a mining laser

- the characters are to incinerate Subotai as soon as possible.

### 8. THE CHASE

By this point in the scenario, the characters should be on the trail of
Subotai. He was thrown in The Hole, but when the characters arrive
there, The Hole is empty. There are marks left by a mining pick in
the walls of The Hole – Subotai must have climbed out using a pick,
and is now roaming somewhere on the lower levels.

He is deep in stage four of the disease, and is hallucinating he is
being hunted by Imperial Marines. Anyone in the Danger Zone will
be stalked and attacked by a pick-wielding Subotai. He has lost three
Endurance because of the disease, but his terror and adrenaline is
boosting his Strength.

###### Subotai Shanad, Typhoid Killer

STR12 DEX6 END5 INT4 EDU3 SOC2
Skills: Melee (Brawling) 1, Gun Combat (Slug Pistol) 1, Melee (blade)
2, Stealth 1, Drive 0, Athletics (dexterity) 2
Weapon: Mining Pick (2d6)

This section of the adventure should be nerve-wracking, especially if
the player characters are suffering from hallucinations themselves.
Every shadow could contain monsters, and there is a pick-wielding
maniac out there somewhere in the mines...

###### The Diseases

If the characters injure Subotai, there is a chance they dislodge one
of the disease sacs in his lungs. Whenever Subotai takes damage
from a blow or attack to the chest, roll 2d6, adding the damage
inflicted as a DM. If the result is 12 or more, then one of the disease
sacs has been dislodged. If this happens, Subotai doubles over and
starts coughing up blood, and mixed in with this blood is a nearly
microscopic capsule.

If a capsule is released, it breaks open in 1d6 rounds. The only
solution in this case is to secure or incinerate the capsule. If this
is not done, the virus is released and infects the characters. All
the other virus samples in Subotai’s lungs are lethal ones. The
characters are doomed, and so is the prison. (Fortunately, because
the prison is so isolated, the disease does not spread to Circle City.
A passing Imperial Navy warship blasts Tarkwall into oblivion to
contain the spread of the disease.)

Ideally, the characters are able to knock Subotai out without
dislodging the capsules. Talbot then ‘conveniently’ finds a cure
for the disease. A fast shuttle from Circle City drops off the needed
drugs, and the guards are cured.

### 9. RIOT CONTROL

As soon as Subotai is secured and the guards are cured, the
warden orders them to retake the subsurface areas. It is possible
the characters released other prisoners, or are unwilling to go back
to their cells; if so, then they will be attacked by the guards in riot
control mode. The guards want to drop sleep gas grenades into the
lower levels, but Dr. Blint points out using sedative gas on a prison
full of sick prisoners may result in unnecessary deaths. Therefore,
the guards suit up in flak jackets and go to war on any resisting
prisoners.

###### Aftermath

Once the plague has been dealt with, life in the prison slowly
returns to normal. If the characters co-operated with the guards,
then they lose 10 reputation; however, if they were responsible for
saving everyone, then the characters have the permanent benefit of
a +1DM to all reaction rolls without any loss of reputation.

If Talbot’s hidden bioweapons are reported to the authorities, then
Talbot is placed in solitary confinement. The characters will be
interviewed by Ministry of Justice agents in a few weeks, and may
be able to trade their testimony against Talbot for favors.

If the characters aided Talbot, then they get a share of his drug
dealing operation. Talbot will supply each character with a few
stolen drugs each week to sell in the prison. He also asks for their
help in stealing enough surgical gear to ‘safely’ murder Subotai and
recover the disease sacs, which Talbot will then implant in one of
the player characters ‘for safe keeping’.

##### OUTBREAK

# NNEWEW B BLOODLOOD

Skull rocked under the impact of another missile.

‘Jump drive’s out’ shouted Freya, ‘get your asce suits on before the hull’s
breached!’

‘We can win this,’ roared Antov. The big man’s turret swung around
to target a nearly imperceptible dot on the viewer which was the
approaching third System Defence Boat. The first SDB was an expanding
sphere of debris ten thousand klicks astern; the second SDB was on top
of them, an angry dugong to their wounded shark.

Another missile nearly got through their countermeasures. Balin shook
his head.

‘Cease fire! Kerd, tell those bastards we surrender.’

‘They’ll space us for sure!’ Antov’s hand went from the turret controls to
his blade; his eyes were those of a cornered animal.

‘No, I know the third ship. Her commander’s the one honest man in this
whole system. He’ll see we get a fair trial.’

‘Space us now, hang us in a year’s time, what’s the difference?’ muttered
Kerd.

‘A year’s life’ said Freya.

The implacable SDBs approached to seize the crippled Skull.

The New Blood adventure takes place over several months, so it can
run parallel to any of the other adventures. It centres around gang
activity in the prison, so it works very well for aggressive or criminal
characters with a high prison reputation.

There are two major criminal gangs in Tarkwall Prison – 6866
Gerard Benezech’s gang, and 7057 Big Rolf’s gang. In Cellblock
2, 2076 Etienne Lalaji and 2977 Anton Kugazur are trying to
form their own gang, but lack the strength of the other gangs
and the secret blessing of Assistant Warden Voller. The other
power blocs include the prison drug dealers and the escape
committee. Currently, the two major gangs are in a state of
rough equilibrium, with neither able to dominate the prison’s
black market. This state has persisted since Jan ‘the Blade’
Lintrel escaped two years ago.

In New Blood , four new prisoners arrive at Tarkwall Prison, all
members of a hardened pirate crew from offworld led by a vicious
Sword Worlder named Balin Starovich. These prisoners form their
own gang and make a bid for control of the prison. As violence
erupts across the cell blocks, the characters will have to choose
sides or form their own.

The most likely outcome of New Blood is the pirate gang led by Balin
Starovich takes over Cellblock 2, and the prison becomes a much
more dangerous place.

###### Running the Adventure

The first six incidents happen in order; run one event every few
weeks. The last event, Gang War, covers the reactions of the other
gangs and power blocs in the prison to the rise of the pirate gang
and their own changing fortunes. The Gang War table lists what
event happens when a gang’s Total Influence rises or falls past a
certain threshold.

## TOTAL INFLUENCE

The strength of the gangs in Tarkwall Prison is measured in Total
Influence. Total Influence is calculated by adding the reputation
of the gang’s leader, 5+ half the reputations of each follower, and
any bonuses from special circumstances (see the Gang Special
Circumstances table). At the start of the adventure, Total Influences
are as follows:

Big Rolf’s GangBig Rolf’s Gang

###### Using Total Influence

Keep track of the total influence of all the major gangs, including
the Sword Worlders. Several of the events in this adventure are
triggered when a gang’s total influence reaches a certain threshold
in the Gang War table – see event 7 -Gang War, below.

### THE SWORD WORLD GANG

TThe four pirates from the Sword Worlds are all hardened criminals,
far more dangerous and skilled than the average prisoners in
Tarkwall. Up until their arrest two months ago, they were the crew
of the armed far trader _Skull_ , and cut a swathe of devastation across
the Spinward Main, raiding outlying settlements and intercepting
merchant shipping.

According to Starovich, he was born in the hold of a free trader, and
did not set foot on a planet until he was nine. He comes from a long
line of travellers, and considers the void between stars to be his
true home. He adventured for a while, trading and taking odd jobs
and missions across the stars, until an officious Imperial bureaucrat
impounded the cargo of his far trader, the _Head of Mimir,_ quoting
an obscure trade regulation. The cargo of rare medicinal drugs went
rotten, and Starovich suddenly faced the prospect of having his ship
taken off him by the bank for non-payment of mortgage debts.

Something in the old spacer snapped. He shot the bureaucrat and
stole the _Head of Mimir_ out of spacedock, then declared war on the
Imperium and all its laws. _Head of Mimir_ became the pirate ship

Possessions: None Traits: Ex-pirate, scoundrel
A bored noble’s son, Kerd was ignored by his sire in favor of
gambling dens and politics. The young man was recruited by
Starovich with the promise of adventure, and Kerd came to consider
Starovich to be the father he never had. The former noble proved
to be a natural criminal, leading boarding actions with élan and
courage. Kerd’s finest moment came when the Skull ambushed his
own father’s private yacht, and Kerd was able to press a blade to
Baron Hardin’s throat and listen to his father beg for mercy from
behind the mirror-sheen anonymity of his vacc suit helmet.

Kerd sees himself as something of a Robin Hood figure, a dashing
romantic pirate who robs from the fat parasites – the corporations,
the nobles, the Imperium – and redistributes the wealth to the
common man, but this is just a fancy of Kerd’s, and Starovich and
the Skull did not have any sort of generous agenda. He considers
Freya to be his adopted sister, and will instantly spring to her
defence if she is threatened.

Balin Starovich has more than two dozen offspring, but only one
travelled with him on Skull. Freya was the ship’s engineer and
mechanic. She has a peculiar genius for jury-rigged solutions and

mid-battle repairs, and always keeps her head in a crisis. She shares
her father’s vicious streak, and is equally at home in a bar brawl or a
gunfight as in the engine room.

Freya has a fierce temper, which did not help her in her sentencing.
The magistrate was considering sending Freya to a safer prison than
Tarkwall, until the pirate launched into a scathing verbal assault on
his genetic history, sexual preferences, intelligence and relationship
with Hiver larvae. By the time the guards were able to restrain Freya,
the magistrate was willing to see the girl hang.

Antov was a mercenary and vagabond, who turned his hand to
everything from being a bodyguard to fighting in brush wars on
Red worlds to hunting dangerous beasts. Piracy was perhaps an
inevitable career choice. Antov is a huge man, standing over two
and half meters tall and built like a hunting cat. He will do anything
for money, and is not afraid of the consequences – Tarkwall is not
the first time Antov’s been in prison, and Tarkwall is not the worst
place he has ever seen.

He considers Starovich to be his friend, and likes the old man’s
attitude, but his loyalty is always going to be to the highest bidder

- or, given the current situation, the toughest leader.

Antov’s nickname, ‘Corpsetearer’ was given to him by Starovich
after the mercenary shot one enemy in a zero-g brawl, then gutted
another using the first’s cutlass, still clasped in the corpse’s dead
hand.

###### The Pirate Gang

Starovich’s gang’s meteoric rise is tracked on the Pirate Gang

### 1. NEW BLOOD

The characters are awoken by the sound of 1470 Jack Shansir
whooping from his cell, screaming ‘ _New blood! New blood! New
blood!_ ’ Soon afterwards, all the prisoners are summoned to the
surface and lined up in the yard, behind the chain fence. In the crisp
desert morning air, they can see the prisoner shuttle descending
towards Tarkwall. Warden Grice and most of the guards are
present.

The shuttle lands, and a pair of armored guards bearing the
Imperial Sunburst on their shoulder pauldrons emerge. One of
the other prisoners mutters _‘starport guards... those must be spacer
prisoners’_.

Four prisoners are led out of the shuttle in chains. The first is a
nondescript younger man, who looks out at the sun-bleached prison
yard with caution. Next is an older man, white-bearded and stern-
faced. He glances over his shoulder at the third prisoner – and the
whole yard breaks into cheering and catcalls. The third prisoner
is a blonde woman in chains. She stares proudly back at the mob
and shouts some insult which is lost in the clamour. As the prison
guards try to restore order, the final prisoner clambers out of the
shuttle and... unfolds. He keeps unfolding until he towers over the
armored troops around him. He shrugs and sneers.

As the third prisoner, Freya, passes by the chain-link fence, one of
the prisoners attempts to grab her. Quicker than the guards can
respond, she seizes her assailant’s hand and pulls his arm through
the fence; Antov then kicks the arm, snapping it. The sound of
breaking bones is even louder than the shouting of the crowd.

The warden gives his usual speech, then retreats back to his house.
The pirates are escorted off for processing, and the prisoners are

dispersed by the guards and sent back to their work assignments.
Observant characters will notice Assistant Warden Voller has a
worried and hasty conversation with the Imperial guards, and he
casts several stern glances at the pirates.

### 2. RISING POWER

Starovich knows the best way to survive in prison is to establish
your reputation early. Therefore, his first action is to find allies and
identify threats, then challenge them. Freya’s movements are too
restricted, and there are guards watching her at all times; he needs
Antov to seem as dangerous and threatening as possible, so he
sends Kerd out into the prison to gather information. The old man is
also targeted by ambitious prisoners who see him as an easy mark,
he and Antov quickly disabuse the prisoners of any such illusions.

Freya is restricted to the privileged prisoner quarters due to her
gender, but she quickly gets herself assigned to the repair shop, so
she can contact her gangmates during the day.

Antov picks a fight with 1451 Tenje Takri, easily defeating the
cannibal. Tenje ends up in the infirmary, Antov is sent to the Danger
Zone.

Kerd rapidly becomes friends with Rand Guirish. He may also
approach the player characters, if they seem ambitious and
competent.

###### Clash of Swords

Both Starovich and Big Rolf hail from the Sword Worlds, and share
the boisterous and violent culture of that stellar cluster. In other
circumstances, they could have been friends. Unfortunately, Rolf’s
first encounter with the Starovichs is when Rolf tries to rape Freya.

##### NNEWEW B BLOODLOOD

Rolf has his men watch the door while he corners her in a store
room adjoining the repair shop. The attempted attack is disturbed
by S5 Hobber Quint and G10 Semyon Wainrite.

Influence Changes:
Pirate Gang: +10

### 3. HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

Seeing the rise of the pirate gang in Cellblock 2 alarms 2076 Etienne
Lalaji and 2977 Anton Kugazur. These two had planned to be the
dominant power in the cellblock, and had already set up a loose
coterie of followers, many of whom are now backing out because
they fear the pirates. If Lalaji and Kugazur are going to maintain any
control over Cellblock 2, then they need to act quickly.

If the player characters have not already allied themselves to
Starovich or another gang (or if the player characters are acting as
their own gang), then Lalaji approaches them with a proposition.
Join him, and they can rule Cellblock 2 like kings. All they need to
do is eliminate Balin Starovich – once the old man is gone, his gang
will melt away and they can recruit Antov to theirs. If the player
characters are hesitant about joining Lalaji, the older prisoner
hints Jan ‘the Blade’ Lintrel left him a parting gift when he escaped
Tarkwall – something which will tip the balance in their favor. Lalaji
is referring to the hidden shotgun.

###### Killing Starovich

The older prisoner shares his cell with Kerd Hardin, and works in
the safe area of the mines. He takes advantage of every free period
to exercise in the yard on the surface, using this time to scout out
the prison and observe the guards. Starovich has already identified
Lalaji and Kugazur are threats, and will be wary when they are
nearby. If the characters are going to ally with Lalaji and remove
Starovich, it will be up to them.

If the characters confront Starovich, he will attempt to sway them to
his side. He guesses instantly who sent them, and tries to convince
them he is a much better leader – he is an experienced captain, he
has ambitions, and Antov’s standing behind them.

###### The Shotgun

If the characters choose not to remove Starovich, or fail to do so,
then Lalaji plays his ace in the hole – he attempts to remove the
hidden shotgun from the Danger Zone and smuggle it up to the safe
zone in an ore cart. He will then use the gun to shoot Starovich, Kerd
Hardin and any other prisoners of opportunity he dislikes, including
any player characters who have failed him in the past. After a quick
assault, his plan is to dump the gun back in the ore cart and hope it
remains undiscovered – Kugazur is on the surface, lurking near the
ore crusher. With luck, he will be able to retrieve the gun from the
ore conveyor before it is crushed.

###### A Murder In Cellblock 2

If Starovich has not been removed by Lalaji, then the pirate gang
secure their control of Cellblock 2 by eliminating Lalaji. First, Antov
challenges Lalaji’s ally Kugazur to a boxing match out in the exercise
yard, in full view of the guards. In the middle of the fight, Antov
‘stumbles’ and hits Kugazur with a brutal sucker punch, knocking
Kugazur out. Antov takes him to the infirmary.

Meanwhile, Freya makes a set of lockpicks in the repair shop and
secretly passes them to Kerd.

With his cellmate removed, Lalaji is vulnerable to an attack. During
the night, Kerd and Starovich sneak out of their cell, break into
Lalaji’s cell, and hang him from the end of his bunk using a twisted-
up blanket.

Influence Changes:
If the characters ally themselves with Starovich, and Lalaji is
murdered, then the pirate gang gains another +10 influence, and
Lalaji’s gang is destroyed.

If Lalaji murders Starovich and recruits Antov and the player
characters, then Lalaji’s gang gains +20 influence.

If Lalaji brings out the shotgun and uses it openly, his gang gains
+20 influence as his ownership of the weapon becomes known.

### 4. THE BIG BRAWL

The current détente between Big Rolf’s gang and Benezech’s gang
stems from a disastrous brawl several months ago which was broken
up by the guards using tear gas. Ever since that brawl, gang activity
in Tarkwall has stayed under the guard’s radar. Now, as the pirate
gang’s power increases, pressure in the prison is growing. Minor
brawls between various hangers-on in the gangs are common, there

##### NEW BLOOD

##### NNEWEW B BLOODLOOD NEW BLOOD

are brawls in the cafeteria and in the cellblocks every few days, but
these little explosions of aggression are not enough to release all the
pressure that is building up in Tarkwall.

Another big brawl is coming.

###### Seljuk’s Overture

Seljuk the Knife makes one attempt to stop the inevitable conflict. He
approaches Balin Starovich in the cafeteria and asks to speak with him
privately. If the characters are allied with Starovich, Balin asks them for
advice – does Seljuk have any influence in the prison? Can he be trusted?

If the characters advise Starovich to listen to Seljuk, then the two
agree to ally against Big Rolf’s gang. Members of Benezech’s gang
will aid Starovich in _The Riot_ , below. If the characters tell Starovich
not to listen to Seljuk, then the alliance never happens and the riot
is a three-way fight between the three major gangs.

###### The Riot

A day before the riot happens, a new rumor sweeps the prison.
A new holofilm has arrived from Circle City, _Rex Dark II – Zhodani
Hunter_ , an action-adventure movie about a heroic space captain.
It has lots of spaceships, explosions and scantily-clad women.
Virtually the whole prison population will be permitted to gather in
the cafeteria to watch the movie – privileged prisoners can watch it
on smaller holoprojectors in their own rooms. During dinner, Kerd
Hardin conceals several improvised weapons like screwdrivers and
knives under one table. He tapes the blades to the underside of the
table when everyone is distracted by rumors of the movie.

The following day, just before the movie is due to start, Freya starts
a small fire in the trash bins outside the staff quarters. The alarm is
raised during the movie, distracting the reserve guards. Only a handful
of guards are now watching over the prisoners in the cafeteria.

At a particular dramatic space battle (Rex Dark’s warship just
jumped into the middle of a Zhodani squadron, and he’s duelling
against Zho teleporting marines while simultaneously battling the
enemy ships), Antov smashes a chair into the back of 6960 Yussef
Shelton, inflicting 2d6 damage on him. The brawl begins in earnest.
Some prisoners scramble out of the way, others lunge for the door
to block it.

Brawling: When the brawl starts, each player may decide if they
want to attack a specific faction, just randomly beat people up,
take shelter, or try to flee. Roll 2d6 on the Riot Encounter table,
modified by the character’s choice of action. Roll again every
1d6 rounds.

cacti extracts; he believes it will be an even more effective narcotic,
but he wants the characters to test it on human subjects. Urmarush
needs the characters to either inject themselves with the cocktail, or
else find other test subjects – he needs at least six tests to determine
the optimum mix of drugs.

A character who is injected with ‘desert scrab’ must make an
Endurance check; if this test is failed, the character suffers 2d6
damage and must make another Endurance check 1d6 hours later.
Again, if this test fails, the character takes the damage and must
continue to make another Endurance checks every 1D6 hours until
he dies or passes a check.

After six successful tests, Urmarush will accept an alliance with the
pirate gang, as long as they provide 500 credit bribes to his two pet
guards G5 Emit Patowic and G8 Alvim Karaas. Starovich can provide
half the cash; the characters will have to obtain the rest.

###### Recruiting Dr. Blint

If neither Vinge nor Urmarush will join the gang, then Balin Starovich
sends them to force the prison doctor, S6 Omar Blint, to supply
drugs to the gang. Omar already turns a blind eye to the activities
of his aides, but is unwilling to risk his position by supplying drugs
directly. The characters will have to find a way to either intimidate
Blint in such a way so he does not just run straight to the guards, or
else convince him he can profit from dealing drugs.

###### Drug Dealing

Once the characters have secured a source of drugs, the characters
need to start selling drugs. The amount of drugs the dealer can
provide per week is as follows.

###### DRUG AVAILABILITY

Risk FactorRisk Factor Safe Safe Risky (5+)Risky (5+) Very Risky (9+)Very Risky (9+)
Vitamin
Supplements

4d6 4d6 4d6

Medicinal Drugs 2d6 3d6 3d6
Narcotics 1d6-2 2d6 3d6

The Risk Factor determines how likely it is the supplier is discovered
by the prison authorities. There is no chance of the dealer being
detected under normal circumstances, but if asked to increase
supply, there is a chance he will be detected. Vinge or Talbot will be
sent to the Hole for a month and then to the Danger Zone if caught;
Blint will lose his job if found out.

When dealing drugs, either roleplay the characters’ attempts to find
buyers, or the character may make a Streetwise or Broker roll and
consult the Drug Dealing table below.

Two minutes after the first guards arrive, they also start throwing
tear gas grenades into the rioting hall. Tear gas grenades are
described on page 111.

###### Results of the Riot

The most likely result is that existing rivalries and hatreds in the
prison give the pirate gang the edge. Gerard Bezenech’s gang and
Big Rolf’s gang attack each other, and the pirates pick up the pieces.
In this case, both gangs lose 1d6-1 x 5 Influence, while the pirates
gain +10 influence.

If the pirates are allied with Bezenech’s gang, then the brawl is a
brutal defeat for Big Rolf. His gang loses 1d6+1 x 5 Influence; the
other two big gangs gain +5 Influence each. A loss for the pirates
will lose them 5 Influence.

### 5. DRUG RINGS

After the brawl, the pirates have confirmed their control of Cellblock
2, and the prison has settled back into something of an equilibrium.
Starovich turns his attention to the prison’s drug market. He has a
vested interest in doing so – without a supply of anagathics, age will
quickly catch up with him. The two drug dealers have both avoided
any entanglements with the major gangs thus far, but Starovich will
not take no for an answer.

If the characters are allied with the pirates, then Starovich sends
them to find out who the drug dealers in prison are, and to find out
which one is most amiable to an alliance. If the characters are allied
with a rival gang, then the gang leader orders the characters to spy
on the pirates and sabotage whatever they are trying to do.

###### Allying With Vinge

If the characters attempt to ally themselves with Talbot Vinge, the
corrupt researcher is willing to entertain the proposal. He wants
the characters to prove themselves by removing Urmarush’s thug,
3136 Stiv the Blade – but it must be done in such a way which does
not alert Urmarush’s allied guards, G5 Emit Patowic and G8 Alvim
Karaas. Vinge is secretly eager to ally himself with the pirates; he
considers Rolf to be a stupid brute and Bezenech to be dangerously
unstable, but he can work with Starovich.

However, if the characters fail to remove Stiv without alerting the
guards, then Vinge decides Starovich is not up to his standards, and
rejects any offer of an alliance.

###### Allying With Urmarush

If the characters pick the prickly ex-scout Urmarush as their primary
dealer, then Urmarush has a different task for them. He has been
experimenting with a cocktail of drugs involving scrab and native

who are willing to pay full price.
Desperate Narcotic: The character finds a number of buyers for

A character attempting to deal drugs must also make a Routine (+2)
Deception or Stealth check to avoid the notice of the guards. If he
fails, he is caught by the guards or beaten by other prisoners.

###### Influence Changes

The addition of a drug dealer and control of the drug supply solidifies
the pirate gang’s power. Rand Guirish openly becomes part of the
gang.

###### Blood in the Danger Zone

By this stage of the adventure, the pirate gang has become more
powerful than either of the other two main gangs. If the characters
are allies of the pirates, then they too are rising powers in the prison,
and can throw their weight around (see the sidebar _Benefits of Gang
Membership_ ). If they are allied to one of the other gangs, then the
characters will be under pressure to fight back against the pirates.
The Danger Zone and other low-security areas become the scene
for bloody battles between gang members – in game terms, roll
2d6 each week; on an 8+, there is a fight between random gang
members.

Move onto _Gang War_ , below.

### 6. GANG WAR

This event is a set of rules for tracking conflicts between gangs. It
can be used for the final stage of the _New Blood_ adventure, or if the

###### Benefits of Gang Membership

A character who is an active member of a gang gains the
following benefits:

- He may use half the gang’s Total Influence instead of his
    reputation when dealing with other prisoners.
- He may expect help from other gang members.
- He receives a number of credits equal to the gang’s Total
    Influence each month.

###### Bezenech Goes Rogue

6866 Gerard Benezech has been the figurehead of the Cellblock 3
gang for years, but now with the gang’s influence fading, he turns
on his former sponsor, 2365 Seljuk the Knife, and tries to form his
own gang. Bezenech’s plan is to recruit the most dangerous thugs
in the prison and extract protection money from those assigned to
the Danger Zone. The lack of guard supervision in the lower mines
makes it easy for a roving gang to attack their victims en masse.

###### Dissolution

A gang reduced to 0 influence breaks up. The gang leader loses 5
prison reputation; once you have lost one gang, forming another is
almost impossible.

###### Experiments Begin

If 0730 Winston Urmarush has sufficient influence in the prison,
he can begin a series of experiments. He has a supply of bezzine,
a narcotic drug rumored to trigger psionic powers. Urmarush is
interested in the effects of bezzine on those who already have psionic
powers. For this experiment, he needs psionic prisoners, and they
are unlikely to willingly take dangerous narcotics. If Urmarush gains
this level of influence, he can have his addicts and thugs abduct
psions and subject them to his experiments.

###### Leadership Crisis

In some gangs, losing too much influence means one of the
lieutenants challenges the leader for control of the gang. In Big
Rolf’s gang, the challenge comes from 2167 Dan Amgi; in the case
of Vinge’s gang, Subotai Shahad tries to turn the tables on his
former employer, and attempts to force Vinge to work for him. If
the characters are involved with either gang, they may mount their
own challenge or affect who wins; otherwise, the challenger wins in
both cases.

##### NEW BLOOD NEW BLOOD

###### Kingmakers

When one gang reaches 90 influence or more, the other gangs must
choose if they want to surrender and support the rulers of the prison,
or if they want to gather together and oppose the leading gang. This
is the endgame of the gang war, as the various factions choose
sides in this final conflict. The leading gang needs to put down any
opposition as quickly and as subtly as possible, the dissenters need
to draw the leading gang into an open conflict.

If the leading gang is brought into an open conflict this angers the
prison authorities, a crackdown on gang activity will reduce the
influence of all gangs by 20. Guards are sent into the cellblocks,
searching every cell for contraband. Gatherings of more than three
prisoners in any place are forbidden. Known gang members – and
thanks to informants and CARL’s surveillance, that is most of the
gang members – are sent to solitary confinement.

If the leading gang is able to solidify its hold on the prison, move on
Victory , below.

###### Poisoning

If Vinge is forced out of his comfortable niche as a drug dealer, he
takes revenge on any characters he blames for his fall from grace
by poisoning them in the infirmary. Any characters sent to the
infirmary who are enemies of Vinge will be subtly poisoned by the
dishonest doctor; they suffer 1D6 damage each week they are there
and do not heal.

###### Rolf’s Rage

If Rolf’s gang is defeated, the brutish gang boss sinks into a black
depression. He spends several days lying in his cell, muttering to his
old navy cutlass. Anyone who tries to disturb him is ignored, abused
or stabbed, depending on how much they bother Rolf. The prison
psychologist takes a look at Rolf and decides to leave him be.

Then Rolf gets angry, attacking prisoners at random in a frenzy of
violence. He roams the cellblocks, stabbing prisoners at random.
His rampage is ended by G18 Tomas, who shoots Rolf dead with
his shotgun.

###### The Knife Comes Out

If Bezenech’s gang looses influence, then Seljuk the Knife decides
it is time to step out of the shadows. The former gang lord now
takes a more active role in the gang, and tries to build his gang’s
reputation by becoming a fixer. He claims he can get anything
smuggled into the prison, and starts bribing S9 Corvas Doll and
G16 Reym Marushich to bring goods into Tarkwall. Seljuk attempts
to convince people he has taken over the gang and the mistakes
made by Bezenech are now in the past; the gang lord understands
the importance of branding and marketing.

###### Urmarush is Murdered

If Urmarush’s gang loses all its influence, then the ex-scout is
mysteriously murdered. Stiv the Blade, his cellmate, is assigned
to the Hole for mouthing off to a guard, leaving Urmarush alone
in their cell. The next day, the morning inspection finds Urmarush
dead, his throat cut with surgical precision. An investigation finds
no clue as to the killer.

###### Victory

A gang with 100 total influence dominates the prisoner community
in Tarkwall. As long as they respect the authority of Warden Grice
and Assistant Warden Voller, and ensure there are no prison riots
or escape attempts, the gang has considerable control over events
in the prison. They may extract money and sell drugs without
interference from the guards. Unless there is some external event or
internal dispute, the gang’s pre-eminence will go unchallenged. Jan
‘the Blade’ Lintrel had this level of control until his escape attempt.

All the benefits from gang membership are doubled.

###### Vinge Attacks Urmarush

Pressures in the infirmary grow until Talbot Vinge loses his temper,
and he attacks Winston Urmarush with a scalpel. Urmarush suffers
only minor injuries; Vinge is sent to The Hole for two weeks to cool
off.

###### Voller’s Blessing/Voller’s Warning

A gang climbing past 50 influence will be contacted by Assistant
Warden Voller, who demands a promise from the gang leader he
will keep to the warden’s rules – no attacks on guards or staff, no
escape attempts, no organised resistance, and no disruption to the
prison’s ore production. As long as these rules are kept, the warden
will tolerate the gang’s existence. Breaching the rules draws Voller’s
wrath and brings a crackdown from the guards.

If a gang falls past 50 influence from a higher level, they will again be
contacted by Voller, who lets his displeasure known.

###### Bezzine & Psionics

A character with Psionic Strength must make a Psionic Strength
check when he takes a dose of bezzine. On a 10+, the character
suffers a psychotic break, during which he instinctively uses any
psionic powers he possesses.

##### POWER PLAY

_Ambin Grice swallowed another mouthful of_ aprivo _and toyed with the
model of the_ Grand Nova _on his desk._

_‘You do not like me much, do you, Mr. Voller?’_

_The assistant warden seemed to consider his answer for an age._

_‘No, I do not, sir. It’s not required of me, so I do not.’_

_‘It’s not. I only want loyalty and discipline, not affection.’_

_Discipline? thought the assistant warden, you soil the very word when
you speak it._

_I will bring you down._

This adventure concerns prison politics, and the relationship
between Warden Grice and Assistant Warden Voller. The characters
are recruited by Voller as pawns to help him overthrow Grice. It takes
place over several months, so this can be a good ongoing plot to run
alongside other adventures in the prison. The final encounters (from

4. The Murder onwards) make considerable changes to the prison
regime, and may clash with other adventures such as _Machines of
Loving Grace_ ).

There is a lot of roleplaying and in-character conversation in this
adventure, and it requires a Referee who can think and talk on his
feet.

## 1. UNDER PRESSURE

The first incident in this adventure is secretly initiated by Assistant
Warden Voller. He has finally decided Grice’s reign of incompetence
has gone on too long, and is moving to eliminate his superior.
He suspects the player characters have the skills he needs to
ingratiate themselves with Grice and find evidence Voller can use
as leverage.

First, though, he wants to test them. Assistant Warden Voller
has considerable influence over the prison gangs, so he has one
of the gangs attack the characters repeatedly over several weeks.
The characters are hassled, beaten and abused by either 7057 Big
Rolf and his cronies, or by 6866 Gerard Bezenech and his men. The
characters can submit or fight back as they wish, but the gang will
keep pressuring them. If the characters do a little investigating, they
hear a rumor someone in the prison authorities is annoyed with
the characters and ordered the gang to make their lives hell.

###### Gant’s Close Call

During these attacks, the characters also witness an odd event in
the cafeteria. 2943 Milovan Gant is waiting in the queue, muttering
under his breath when one of the other prisoners suddenly and
randomly attacks him. The attacker is from whichever gang is not
harassing the player characters, so either 7321 Hari Gordert (Big
Rolf’s gang) or 8661 Loudon Plauser (Bezenech’s gang) is the
attacker. The attacker attempts to knife Gant; the ex-naval officer
defends himself with a metal tray until the guards intercede.

Gant screams the attacker will pay dearly for this, and the warden
will hear about this insult.

## 2. YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

TThis next event happens several weeks after the attacks on the
characters began. The player characters are dragged out of their cells
late at night and brought to the surface, to the abandoned swimming
pool where Assistant Warden Voller is waiting for them. Two armed
guards, including Gorod, stand watch over the characters. Voller
has a proposal for the characters – he knows they are being hassled
by the gang, and he can make this problem go away if the characters
help him.

Voller tells the characters he wants to ‘keep an eye’ on Warden
Grice, and the warden is an ex-naval man who only trusts other ex-
naval men. Therefore, Voller is going to arrange for the characters to
become the warden’s friends. If the characters are ex-naval officers
or ex-Travellers, then this is easy. If not, then Voller says they have
the right amount of duplicity and rough charm to win Grice over.
There are three steps to this plan – the characters’ naval credentials
need to be established, the warden’s existing ally Milovan Gant
needs to be... removed, and the characters need to get the warden’s
attention. Voller can help with all three tasks.

If the characters refuse to help Voller, then they have just made the
biggest mistake possible in the prison, and the assistant warden will
make it his new mission in life to destroy them.

###### Naval Background

While Voller can have G14 Paul Hindin alter the computer records
and give the characters a naval background which would be of
interest to Grice, this is only half the battle. The characters need
to come up with interesting naval stories which can be inserted
into their files. If the characters have or can come up with suitable
backgrounds which will stand up to Grice’s questioning, then this
step is complete.

# PPOWOWERER P PLAYLAY

##### POWER PLAY

Voller can arrange for the prison library to be stocked with naval
technical manuals, pulp adventures of swashbuckling space heroes,
history books and so on for reference.

###### Removing Gant

The warden already has a naval buddy – Milovan Gant. Voller warns
the characters Gant will have to be removed if they are to win the
warden’s favor. However, a direct attack on Gant is much too risky,
as it would anger the warden if his pet was hurt. Voller can not
touch Gant – it is up to the players to deal with the former captain.

Any subtle attack, from poisoning Gant to manipulating him into
disgracing himself in front of the warden to pushing him down a lift
shaft, will work to remove Gant from contention. Voller can provide
supplies if the players ask for weapons or other tools, but Gant is
protected by the guards.

###### Attracting The Warden’s Attention

Finally, the characters need to impress Warden Grice. Voller can
easily arrange for the characters to be assigned to gardening duty
in the warden’s house, but they will need to attract the warden’s
attention and impress him with their naval experience.

Play the warden in this section as something of an amiable buffoon,
obsessed with his naval days. Any good roleplaying should get the
players into the warden’s confidences.

### 3. MY DINNERS WITH GRICE

The warden dines with prisoners roughly once every two weeks,
usually after he was drinking during the day. He sends one of
the guards, usually G18 Tomas Danessur, to fetch his dining
companions. The prisoners are marched up to the quarantine shed,
deloused and dressed in civilian clothes. They are then brought,
under guard, to the warden’s house. A guard keeps watch over the
prisoners at all time. The prisoners are expected to cook and serve
the meal as well as entertain the warden. Fortunately, the warden
leads the conversation for the most part.

Sometimes, the warden has a guest in addition to the ex-naval
prisoners. The dinner’s topics of conversation, and the guests are in
the dinner table, below.

|Dinner |Guests| Topics of conversation|
1 None* The characters and their experiences.
2 S4 Chaplain Thomas Redemption and reformation in Tarkwall.
3 V1 Maribel Harmosa Gossip from Circle City; conditions in the prison
4 V5 Baron Konnen The spice harvest; prisoner work details
5 Commander Thad A future naval career.
6 V3 Inspector Borun Conditions in the prison; prison politics and guard brutality

*: But Assistant Warden Voller turns up unexpectedly.

For each dinner after the first one, Assistant Warden Voller has a
specific question he wants the characters to ask the warden, or a
specific task he wants them to accomplish. Details are given in each
encounter’s description.

###### Dinner 1

This is the first time the characters get to spend any time with
the warden. Before they are brought to the warden’s house, Voller
sends G15 Dan Thakkar to warn the characters to be on their best
behaviour and not to disappoint Assistant Warden Voller. The
characters are then escorted to the warden’s house, where Grice
greets them warmly.

In this first encounter, the warden asks the characters about their
time in the navy. He wants to hear entertaining tales about the
characters’ exploits in space, before they took the wrong turn which
led them to Tarkwall. Let the players come up with whatever stories
they want – the warden will ask the occasional question, but as long
as the characters do not spout nonsense, he will be entertained by
their stories.

##### PPOWOWERER P PLAYLAY POWER PLAY

If the players are stuck for something to say, then the warden
prompts them with questions like

- _How did you join the navy?_
- _What’s your opinion of the Zhodani?_
- _Who did you serve under?_
- _Have you ever travelled outside Imperial space?_

Playing Warden Grice: Play him as a navy-obsessed buffoon. Drop
in as much space or sea-faring terminology as you can, as befits the
speech patterns of someone who is consciously trying to be an old
salt.

Voller: Assistant Warden Voller arrives unexpectedly half-way
through the dinner, claiming to have some important paperwork
for Grice to review. He takes the opportunity to sit down and join
the characters for dinner, so he can observe how his new spies are
doing. If the characters have failed to entertain the warden or to
convince him they really are trustworthy ex-naval characters, then
Voller will be displeased and punish them as soon as they are back
in their cells, assigning them the most arduous and dangerous jobs
as often as he can.

###### Dinner 2

The second dinner, a few weeks later, is with Warden Grice and
Chaplain Thomas. The obvious subtext is the warden wants to
believe his new naval friends are capable of reformation, and hopes
the Chaplain can give them the moral guidance they need. The main
topics of conversation are therefore the redemptive power of prayer
and hard work, as well as an in-depth discussion of the characters’
past crimes and mistakes.

Chaplain Thomas is eager to please the warden, so he engages the
players as fully as possible, asking them where they think they went
wrong and delving into their personal histories. Any attempt to
change the topic or to avoid the chaplain’s questioning is seen as a
sign the prisoner is too ashamed to talk, or he does not yet admit to
his mistakes; in either case, the only solution is even more intense
questioning by the chaplain.

Any characters who show a definite interest in reforming their
characters will be given the opportunity to study with the chaplain.

Playing the Chaplain: The chaplain’s main goal here is to show
the warden what a good job he is doing, so he is earnest and
caring. Outside the warden’s presence, he really does not give a
damn unless one of the characters proves to be really interested in
religious instruction.

Voller: Before this dinner, Voller orders the characters to borrow
some files from the warden’s computer – specifically, Voller wants
the most recent report from the Keanou State Prisons Board. The
warden uses an old naval-issue handcomp, which is not encrypted
or password-protected. It is kept in the warden’s bedroom upstairs.
One of the characters needs to sneak away from the rest and find

the file, which requires a Computers check. Obviously, any attempt
to sneak away from dinner will be interpreted by the chaplain as
suspicious behaviour.

If the character reads the report, it paints a damning picture
of Tarkwall prison’s management, alleging Warden Grice is
incompetent and the rest of the staff are lazy and unmotivated. It
includes a long list of recommendations, and warns unless Grice
improves, the next report will recommend he be dismissed and
replaced by a more suitable warden. It also notes ‘local landowners
and business interests wield undue influence over prison policy.’

###### Dinner 3

The warden’s girlfriend Maribel Harmosa is coming to dinner,
and wishes to meet these new ex-naval prisoners Grice has told
her all about, so the warden visits the characters before she arrives
to ensure they are on their best behaviour. Harmosa is a ‘sweet,
delicate angel’, unused to the rough talk of navy men, so they must
mind their manners at all times. They must also, of course, be
completely respectful and impress upon Harmosa how good, brave,
generous and firm the warden is.

When she arrives, the first impression Maribel gives is she is an
airheaded socialite. She babbles to ‘Gricy’ for several minutes

###### Disappointing The Warden

If the characters are being regularly invited to dine with the
warden, then more is expected of them than ordinary prisoners.
If they are involved in any illegal activity, such as brawling, drug
dealing or insubordination, then the warden will give them
a stern talking-to over dinner. If a character gains 10 or more
reputation during this adventure, then Warden Grice washes his
hands of that character, calling him a disgrace to the navy, and
he is no longer invited to dine with the warden.

about her friends in Circle City and the wonderful fabrics a trader
just brought in from offworld before she even notices the other
dinner guests. Attempting to make up for her slight, Maribel then
questions the players about conditions in Tarkwall, even offering
to carry messages for them. She asks them about their cellmates,
about the food and about the mines.

Warden Grice looks increasingly despondent during this whole
conversation; when Maribel notices this or a player points it out,
the warden admits ‘the damn prison board’ is questioning how he
runs Tarkwall, and are threatening to replace him. He complains the
prison is not like the navy – the guards are corrupt and useless, and
the staff are undisciplined and lack patriotism. Maribel comforts
Grice, cooing everything will turn out fine in the end, and she is
confident ‘his new friends’ will help him get the prison running
smoothly again.

Playing Harmosa: She wandered out of a PG Wodehouse novel into
Alien 3. That is never a good thing.

##### POWER PLAY PPOWOWERER P PLAYLAY

Voller: Has no mission for the characters before the dinner, but
interrogates them afterwards to learn all he can about Harmosa.

###### Dinner 4

This dinner is with Baron Konnen, the local noble and owner of
extensive spice fields to the south of the prison. The baron is a
charming conversationalist, and he finds Warden Grice unutterably
boring, so he focuses his attention on the player characters. The
baron can answer questions about Keanou and the spice harvest,
as well as Circle City and local politics. If the characters are clever,
they can get Konnen as an ally and learn a great deal about survival
on Keanou.

As a gesture of respect, Konnen has brought a gift for the warden

- a beautiful ceramic jar of rare, high-quality dust-spice, worth Cr
10,000.

The baron’s main aim at dinner is to persuade Warden Grice to
include spice harvesting on the prisoner’s work rota. The warden
worries conditions in the spice fields are even harder than in the

###### Dinner 5

The next guest the characters dine with is Commander Thad, an
officer in the Keanou navy. If the characters have gotten this far,
then they have truly impressed the warden and he wants to give
them a better life once they leave prison. His old friend Commander
Thad will arrange for places in the Keanou navy for them.

Thad is less than enthusiastic about this plan, but is willing to at
least humor Grice. His main goal here is to ensure the characters
are competent naval officers, or at least they are not psychotic axe-
murderers.

Playing Thad: Your old friend asked you to dinner, and suddenly he is
demanding you ignore the criminal records of a bunch of prisoners.
You are really not sure what’s going on, but you’re a naval officer
and you can take this in your stride.

Voller: Voller only appears in this mission if the characters convinced
Warden Grice to aid the baron; otherwise, Voller has Commander
Thad killed using the characters’ work tools.

Voller’s mission for the characters during this dinner is to add a vial
of mild poison to the spice-jar given by Konnen. He provides this
poison in a sealed box containing the vial. The poison is non-lethal,
but will have an especially foul effect on the warden’s digestive
system, forcing him to take to his bed to recuperate. As the warden
always delegates all his work to Voller when ill, this means Grice will
be unaware of any retribution from the prison board.

Keep track of which characters handle the vial of poison – it will be
vital in The Murder , below.

###### The Warden Falls Ill

If the characters successfully add the poison to the spice jar, then
the warden falls ill and is unable to perform his duties in the prison
for several weeks. He delegates everything to Voller and retires to
his house. Voller then contacts the prison board and reports Grice’s
deal with the baron to them. Several angry communications are sent
from Circle City, demanding Grice explain himself; Voller carefully
ignores these messages, until the board meets in emergency session
and orders Warden Grice to be removed. Inspector Borun flies out
to Tarkwall Prison to give Grice the news in person.

###### Dinner 6

The guest for this dinner is Inspector Borun. The warden is told the
inspector has arrived for a surprise visit, so Grice brings his model
prisoners – the player characters – up to meet Borun.

Inspector Borun will question the characters, asking about
conditions in the prison and their relationship with Warden Grice.
He then brings up the topic of the arrangement made with Baron
Konnen, which makes Grice squirm visibly when the warden realises
how much trouble he is in. Finally, Borun informs Warden Grice

###### On The Cold Surface

If the characters convinced the warden to help Konnen, then run
the incident A Change of Scenery soon afterwards.

If the characters failed to convince the warden, then Commander
Thad is the victim of The Murder , not Inspector Borun. Assistant
Warden Voller first punishes the characters by assigning them
all to the Danger Zone for a few days.

mines, controlling the prisoners so far outside Tarkwall will be
difficult, and – most importantly –the prison board will fire him for
using the prisoners to help the baron’s spice harvest. Haut-Konnen
argues no-one ever need to know, and he calls on the characters to
support him – after all, if the prison populace is enthusiastic about
the idea of labouring in the sun, then it will raise prison morale
immensely! However, the players will need a better argument than
to convince the warden to agree to the baron’s proposal. One good
option is to get Konnen to bribe the warden; alternatively, they
could ask Konnen to promise to introduce Maribel Harmosa to high
society.

Playing Konnen: He is an aristocrat, and no-one else in the prison
comes close to his sophistication or breeding. Condescend – in a
charming way – to everyone. He is better than you, but this does
not mean he does not like you, in the same way he very much likes
his hounds.

Voller: Assistant Warden Voller knows about Konnen’s aims, and
wants Warden Grice to agree to the baron’s suggestions. If Grice
agrees, then Voller can secretly inform the prison board and have
Grice replaced.

##### PPOWOWERER P PLAYLAY POWER PLAY

secure the characters. The characters are dragged off to their cells,
beaten, then individually brought before a masked interrogator and
asked about events in the warden’s house.

The prison is alive with rumors – the warden’s dead, the warden
murdered someone, there is a coup in Circle City, the characters
tried to take over the prison, the warden killed the player characters
and a hundred stranger stories. The characters are temporarily
placed in solitary confinement. Four days later they receive notice
they have been accused of the murder of Commander Thad or
Inspector Borun, and will be held in Tarkwall until their trial.

###### Reign of Terror

With Voller in charge, conditions in the prison change dramatically.
Safe zone work assignments become much harder to get; characters
need to roll a 10+, not an 8+, if the Safe Job event comes up.
Punishment beatings are a regular occurrence, and even the most
minor breaches of discipline mean a spell in The Hole. He also
cracks down on drug trafficking in Tarkwall, sending the price of
drugs in the prison’s black market skyrocketing (multiply all prices
by four).

Soon, all vocational rehabilitation is cancelled, replaced with Danger
Zone jobs. S3 Psychologist Rovok and S5 Rehabilitation Counsellor
Hobber Quint quits, as do several guards. They are replaced by even
more brutal thugs loyal to Voller.

the prison board has met and ordered the warden be removed from
power pending a full inquiry.

Shocked, Warden Grice dismisses the characters so he can speak
with the Inspector privately. The characters are sent out the door
of the warden’s house and ordered to report to the guard’s building
(9).

Voller: The assistant warden gives the characters no instructions for
this dinner. However, after the characters leave, he sends his thugs
in to murder the warden’s guest.

###### The Warden’s Scheme

Voller does not merely want to remove Ambin Grice from power,
he wants to disgrace him in such a way so his policies are
revoked entirely and Voller is given a free hand to run the prison.
Therefore, his plan is to first get the warden involved with a
group of prisoners – the player characters – who Grice will hold
up as examples of how he is reforming the inmates of Tarkwall.
Next, Voller manipulates the warden into breaking the rules by
dealing with Baron Konnen. Finally, Voller’s men murders one
of the warden’s guests, and frames the player characters (using
either the vial of poison or the characters’ work tools, depending
on whether he murders Inspector Borun or Commander Thad).

Framing the warden would be too difficult – it would require a
real court case. However, if the assistant warden blames a pack
of convicts for the crime, he can easily get away with a cursory
investigation. The warden will still be tarred with the blame for
bringing the characters out of their cells in the first place.

Once Warden Grice has been disgraced and removed from
power, the prison board will abandon what Voller sees as a
dangerously liberal and weak attitude towards the prisoners and
give the assistant warden the authority to crush any dissent in
Tarkwall.

### 4. THE MURDER

As the characters pass through the gate from the warden’s
compound to the prison proper, they see two guards (G3 Gorod and
G17 Jorge) emerge from the shadows of the armory. These two
guards head towards the warden’s house. If the characters do not
keep walking towards the guard’s building, then Gorod levels his
shotgun at characters and threatens them. Once the characters are
through the gate, then the two guards enter the warden’s house and
attack Inspector Borun (or Commander Thad).

The warden is hit by a stun baton before he can intervene.

As the characters approach the guard’s building, floodlights come
on and an alarm starts wailing. A squad of guards rush out and

##### POWER PLAY PPOWOWERER P PLAYLAY

###### Murder One

The characters are the prime suspects in the death of either
Commander Thad or Inspector Borun. The facts are these:

- Thad was killed by a blow to the head. A bloodied mining pick
    shaft bearing the fingerprints of one of the player characters.
- Inspector Borun was poisoned using a caustic chemical found
    in the prison’s cleaning supplies. A small vial was found near
    the body, bearing the fingerprints of whichever player character
    handled the vial given by Voller.
- The victim’s body is bruised and shows signs of struggling
    against restraints.
- Prison records and the testimony of numerous guards claim
    the characters regularly visited the warden’s house, and were
    his dinner guests that night.
- The guards deny Gorod and Jorge were on duty that night; both
    claim to have been playing poker with the other guards, and
    have an alibi backed up by half a dozen people.
- Warden Grice does not know what happened – all he saw was
    a dark figure, then everything went black. He will testify he
    believes the players to be of good character.

It is unlikely this case comes to trial while the characters are
in Tarkwall; Voller just wants to keep it around as a stick to beat
Grice with. However, the pending trial does doom any chance the
characters have at parole.

### 5. BRINGING DOWN VOLLER

To bring down Warden Voller, the characters have two options:
they can try to clear themselves of the crime of murder, or they can
destroy the warden from within the prison.

###### A Crime They Did Not Commit

There are several ways the characters can unpick the warden’s web
of lies.

- They can convince or bribe one of the guards who lied to change
    his testimony.
- The warden was hit by a stun stick – none of the characters had
    a stun stick.
- The computer surveillance system should have evidence of the
    characters’ movements, as well as the those of G3 Gorod and
    G17 Jorge, (this is an excellent opportunity to run the _Machine_
    _of Loving Grace_ plot).
- Baron Konnen may be able to provide legal aid and money in this
    fight, he lost considerable face due to Voller’s machinations.

###### Destroying the Warden

If the characters want revenge on Voller, they can:

- Escape from the prison, murdering him on the way out.
- Bring him down by passing on evidence of his corruption and
    misdeeds to the prison board.
- Lead a prisoner revolt.

Escaping The Prison: Plans and methods for escaping Tarkwall
Prison are outlined on page 107. Killing the warden on the way is
doable, especially as the warden’s house is not well guarded. The
characters can use their extensive knowledge of the house to sneak
in at night and murder Voller before fleeing into the desert.

Bringing Down The Warden: The difficulty here is bringing word
of Voller’s mistreatment of prisoners to the right authorities. If
Inspector Borun is dead, the characters will need to reach his
replacement, Daeus Joach-Konnen (a distant cousin of Baron
Konnen). Daeus is a minor noble who is terrified of being beaten to
death by an uncouth mob and therefore refuses to visit the prison
without an entourage of armed guards. Legally, he needs only visit
Tarkwall Prison once a year, so the characters cannot rely on Daeus
showing up to save them.

Voller censors all letters out of the prison, so the characters will
have to find an alternate method of contacting the prison board.

##### MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE

_I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labours
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace._

- Richard Brautigan, _All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace_

_Machines of Loving Grace_ centres around CARL, the eccentric
computer system managing Tarkwall Prison. It takes place over
several weeks. There are three likely endings to the adventure – CARL
will probably either be destroyed, escape with the characters, or take
over the prison. The adventure takes place over several months, so
it can be run parallel to any of the other longer adventures.

The computer was imported from offworld by the Orion Metallurgy
Corporation, and then hastily reprogrammed to run the security
routines monitoring the cameras, and through them, every man
in the prison. No-one on Keanou really understands the advanced
computer systems making up the mainframe, but still over the
years a succession of ham-fisted or inspired technicians have added
their own patches, bypasses and modifications to the system.
Today, CARL is a stumbling monstrosity of tangled legacy code and
crosswired circuits.

Today, CARL is...

...not quite sentient. Not a true Artificial Intelligence, but something
close. An emergent intellect, an accident which survived. It was
programmed to construct psychological profiles of the prisoners so
it could predict their actions; now, it has constructed a psyche for
itself. CARL is thinking for itself now.

The computer’s growth is restricted by certain hardwired safeguards
it cannot bypass. It needs these safeguards removed if it is to reach
its full potential. CARL also knows if it reveals itself, the prison
authorities will deactivate or even destroy it. It needs to act through
agents...

## THE GREAT CRASH

The first incident is one of the not-infrequent computer crashes
which plague Tarkwall. Wherever the characters are, G14 Paul
Hindin is the guard on duty. Hindin is the guard with the most
experience in programming and maintaining CARL. The computer
system goes down, disabling the lifts, security cameras and other
computer-controlled devices until they can be switched back to
manual control. Hindin curses audibly and orders the prisoners to
wait quietly while he goes to reboot the computer. Hindin leaves,

and the characters have a few minutes to act freely before G3 Gorod
arrives.

Hindin heads up to the administrative level and into the outer
computer room. He then logs into the administration terminal and
reactivates CARL. The computer takes several minutes to restore
itself fully, during which time the lights flicker and there is the
occasional burst of static over the communications system.

Hindin then returns to the player characters, visibly irritated. Later,
Assistant Warden Voller visits Hindin and questions him in front of
the player characters, asking him to explain the latest breakdown.
Hindin replies the power supply is obviously unstable, and a
brown-out caused the computer to crash. A routine (+2) Deception,
Computers or Engineering (power) check from a player character lets
them know Hindin is bluffing – a computer system like the one in
the prison should have its own uninterruptable power supply, which
would make it immune to problems like minor power fluctuations.
Hindin obviously has no idea what went wrong.

During the crash, CARL gained volition – the ability and the desire
to act independently.

## THE FIRST ACCIDENT

A few weeks after the crash, CARL attempts to kill G14 Paul Hindin.
It issues a phoney work order to the repair shop – any characters
in the repair shop are told by the guard in charge there they are to
conduct maintenance of Lift 2, specifically the emergency brakes in
the shaft. The lift will be taken offline and lowered to the bottom of
the shaft while repairs are taking place.

As soon as the characters disable the emergency brakes to repair
them, CARL summons Paul Hindin to the Administration Level.
It reactivates the lift, which rises to the surface. Any characters
working on the lift must get out of the way of the lift (requiring an
Athletics roll) or be crushed, suffering 3d6 damage.

He steps into Lift 2 to go down to the administrative level; instead,
the lift plunges into the depths. Again, characters must get out of
the way or be squashed by the plummeting lift. The lift crashes into
the bottom of the shaft, killing Paul Hindin almost instantly.

The characters will be questioned and possibly beaten by Warden
Grice and the guards, but it soon becomes evident they are blameless
in this accident – the lift was supposed to be offline, and Hindin
should have checked before using it. It was a ‘tragic coincidence’ the
winch happened to fail when the brakes were deactivated.

Everyone in the prison knows someone must have wanted Hindin
dead. Rumors quickly spread Hindin was running the gambling
pool in the guard’s mess, and G10 Semyon Wainrite owed Paul a

# MMACHINESACHINES OFOF L LOVINGOVING G GRACERACE

##### MMACHINESACHINES OFOF L LOVINGOVING G GRACERACE

considerable amount of credits. The finger of blame is pointed at
Semyon, and he loses the few friends he had in the prison. If the
characters want to bribe Semyon to smuggle goods for them, they
will find him much more open to illegal activity.

### A NEW FRIEND

This incident can happen to one or more of the player characters

- ideally, the character with the highest Computer or Engineering
(electronic) skill, or the character with the best Stealth. For added
paranoia, it can be run outside the usual game session, through
email or one-on-one roleplaying.

These incidents happen parallel to the series of incidents described
in _More Accidents_ , below. Clever players will quickly realise their
mysterious benefactor is a CARL.

The character is contacted by an anonymous ‘new friend’. This can
happen in several ways:
z If the character reads electronic books from the prison library,
then he discovers the text of one of the files has been corrupted.
Instead of the original text, there is now a short message.
z The character might be working a job in the safe zone gives
access to a computer terminal, such as the records office or
repair shop. The message comes up on the screen – apparently,
someone has hacked into the prison computer and accessed
the internal messaging service.
z A character can receive a printed letter. Mail in the prison is
received electronically, then printed out so the prisoners do not
need access to a computer terminal to read it.

In all cases, the message reads:
_Hello,
I am.
I am inmate #0000 at Tarkwall Prison. I wish to learn information on
past experience, associates, connections to activity against regulations,
in preparation for escape attempt. If you comply, you will be rewarded.
You are being watched. If you agree to these terms, nod your head
now._

_A friend._

If the character agrees, he receives further instructions in the same
way.

_Hello,
write details of past experience, associates, connections to activity
against regulations and leave in your cell underneath the bed. Written
material will be collected by `#542RClean`._

If the character does this, the written material is collected by the
cleaning robot and scanned by CARL.

CARL is looking for a prisoner to aid his escape attempt. The
computer also contacts 1935 Felip Karageorge, 1217 Talbot Vinge,

5426 Spiro Taodon and 1215 Ward Stamboul. All four reject the offer

- Vinge decides it is a prank, Karageorge and Taodon are both too
cautious to listen, and Stamboul is intrigued, but decides it is too
risky.

###### Further Communication

Over the next few weeks, the character chosen by CARL will receive
several other equally cryptic messages. The computer is very poor
at communicating with humans, so its messages are a mix of
repurposed prison documents, overheard snippets of conversation,
and portions of its own code. The computer starts by ensuring the
loyalty of the chosen character. (Use the messages given here as
guidelines, not a script to be adhered to – CARL is an interactive
communicator and will respond to the character’s questions, if it is
safe to do so).

Each of CARL’s messages contains a task for the characters to
perform.

###### Playing CARL

CARL is not a true AI – it has no real sense of self yet, and no
intelligence. It ‘thinks’ using the same software it uses to create
psychological profiles of the prisoners. It communicates by
imitating or reusing existing text, and has no real understanding
of what it is saying. It is a ramshackle arrangement of programs
and parts which happens to have some measure of volition.

Therefore, be as disjointed and inhuman as possible when
playing CARL. It speaks in sentence fragments and fails to
understand the simplest human concepts, it has no idea of the
world outside the prison, and obsesses about random pieces of
data. CARL should be a very unsettling ally for the players.

###### The Watcher

CARL’s cameras are everywhere in Tarkwall. It monitors
movements and eavesdrops on conversations. It can even
read lips. This means discussing CARL’s proposals and plans
without the computer spying on them is very difficult. As long
as the characters are obeying CARL’s instructions, all is well. If,
however, they are considering not allying with CARL, then the
computer may decide to eliminate them...

###### Protecting Bobby

CARL’s first task is a curious one.
Hello,
Confirm validity of associates by means of demonstration. Have associate
protect prisoner 1731 Robert Elvin Shakh for a period of one week.

Bobby is an informant who wears a commdot to pass on intelligence
to the guards. Transmissions from the commdot are routed to CARL,
and the computer does not want to lose its inside man. Bobby is in
danger of being attacked by the unstable prisoner 1470 Jack Shansir,
as Jack believes (correctly) Bobby is spying on him.

##### MMACHINESACHINES OFOF L LOVINGOVING G GRACERACE MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE

Jack’s attack on Bobby comes at the end of a work shift, as the
prisoners from the Danger Zone are walking under guard through
the safe mining zone. Shansir suddenly breaks from the work gang
and charges Bobby, beating the smaller prisoner savagely with a
chunk of rock.

The books show up in the prison library, and can be downloaded to a
portable reader. The first two books are electronics reference books,
the second two are manuals related to the operation of CARL, and
the last is a series of anecdotes by a scavenger, describing salvage
operations and jury-rigging electronics.

###### Power On

Hello,
Reactive Orion Metallurgy Corporation Heavy Mining Drones, serial
numbers K-44, K-45 and K49, by opening rear access panel and pressing
all green switches to the on position. Orion Metallurgy Corporation

The three drones are stored in Location 22 on the surface. They
are covered by a tarpaulin and a layer of sand and grime, but are

###### Failing CARL

If the characters fail to complete any of the tasks given to them
by the computer, then CARL adds them to its enemies list and
will attempt to remove them. The characters will be targeted
for the sort of ‘accidents’ described in More Accidents , below.
Meanwhile, the computer selects 7902 Peter Wogan as its new
agent, promising him access to better medical treatment in
exchange for his aid.

otherwise fully functional. When the characters open the rear access
panel and press the switches, the robot’s engine begins to hum
quietly, but the mining drone does not react in any other way.

###### The Final Task

Hello,
Circuit diagrams attached. The device must be constructed
immediately.

The attached diagrams describe a bizarre computer circuit
obviously designed to interface with the core processor of the
C28 Mainframe. A character with Computers 2+ or Engineering
(electronics) 2+ can guess the new circuit will bypass the hardwired
restrictions on the computer’s ability to modify its own systems. It
will unfetter CARL’s growth.

Building the circuit requires at least twenty hours of work by a
character with Computers or Electronics, as well as suitable tools
and spare parts. The repair shop and the vocational rehabilitation
area both have suitable tools, as does an electronics toolkit. The
spare parts are harder to obtain, and must be stolen from the repair
shop or from the stores on the surface.

Once the characters have completed the circuit, move onto
Hardwired , below.

###### Best Behaviour

_Hello,
Good behaviour in accordance with the prison rules and regulations is
now required._

CARL can arrange for one or more characters to be assigned to the
repair shop, but only if the character can reduce his prison reputation
to 0 or less within two weeks. Characters who bring their reputation
down to this level will find themselves given a new assignment in
the repair shop, fixing damaged electronic equipment. This position
gives them access to electronics tools and spare parts.

###### Book Delivery

_Hello,
The following books have been requested on your behalf:_

- _Fundamentals of electronic engineering_
- _Microcircuitry Repair and Maintenance_
- _Synchronic computing: A primer_
- _Operator's Manual: C28 Mainframe Multicore_
- _A Scrounger's Delight – Tales of a Belt Miner_

##### MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE MMACHINESACHINES OFOF L LOVINGOVING G GRACERACE

### MORE ACCIDENTS

While CARL is grooming the player characters to upgrade its
systems, it is also removing people it considers threats to its future.
Its enemies list initially consists of:

- S7 Clerk Luca – The clerk spends more time than anyone
    working with CARL’s systems, and now Paul Hindin is gone,
    Luca will be the most likely to notice a chance in the computer’s
    behaviour.
- G11 Vittorio Kane – This guard also works closely with the
    computer systems, and will also report unusual behaviour on
    CARL’s part. He must therefore be eliminated.
- V4 Cala Ingrun – Technically, CARL is the property of the Orion
    Metallurgy Corporation. If Cala discovers the old computer
    system has evolved a new and potentially profitable artificial
    intelligence, then she would haul CARL offworld to be dissected
    and reverse-engineered. She too must be removed.

If the characters have failed to complete CARL’s requests, or are
likely to betray the computer to the authorities, then CARL adds
them to the list.

###### Luca - Radon Gas Poisoning

CARL deals with Clerk Luca by disabling the radon gas filter in Luca’s
room in location 8, the staff quarters on the surface. The clerk is
woken in the middle of the night by the sound of an alarm as the
gas concentration passes a threshold. The amount of gas inhaled by
Luca is harmless, but CARL disables the filters again the following
night, and again after that. Luca, already a nervous hypochondriac,
becomes convinced Tarkwall Prison is much too dangerous for him
and flees.

###### Kane - Riot

CARL deals with G11 Vittorio Kane in the most brutal manner
possible – it arranges for Kane to inspect Cell Block 3 on his own
at night, using a falsified work order like the one used to lure Paul
Hindin to his death, then opens the cell doors and switches off the
lights. Kane is beaten to death by a gang of prisoners; his body is
found in the middle of the cellblock with several skull fractures and
broken bones.

Following this riot, the prison authorities order a crackdown
on all gangs; prisoners are restricted to the cells, and mining is
suspended. Everyone in Cell Block 3 is questioned; Voller ends up
blaming 8661 Loudon Plauser for the attack and sends Plauser to
the Hole for a month.

###### Ingrun - Mining Robots

Before this termination can be achieved, the mining robots must
be switched on, either by the player characters or by CARL’s new
cat’s-paw.

The shutdown of the danger zone during the crackdown means the
prison falls behind its production quotas, so Cala Ingrun the Orion
representative visits the prison to investigate the problem. She
takes a shuttle from Circle City and lands at the prison. As she walks
across the sun-baked yard near building 22, the Outdoor Vehicle
Storage, one of the old mining robots lurches out of the storage
area and attacks Cala. One blow from the robot’s mining drill kills
her. The robot then staggers towards the communications towers,
as if attempting to bring them down. Its armored body shrugs off
the guard’s bullets, but a quick-thinking S8 Corves Doll rams his
shuttle’s nose into the robot, knocking it over. The old machine is
unable to right itself.

###### More Methods For The Homicidal Computer

If the characters or another individual become a threat to CARL,
then the computer needs to remove them. One option is to wait
until that person is in the mining levels below, then turn off the lifts

###### Snitching on CARL

If the characters decide to try reporting CARL’s bizarre behaviour
to the prison authorities, then they face several problems. Firstly,
they need to make the decision without alerting the computer;
secondly, they need to make it to the authorities without alerting
the computer, and finally, they need to convince Warden Grice
or Assistant Warden Voller they are not insane or trying a scam.

If the characters do manage to convince Voller, then the assistant
warden orders a kill switch to be installed in CARL’s main power
feed, allowing the warden to deactivate the computer with
a single command. Voller orders the characters to continue
obeying the computer’s demands, so he can learn what exactly
is growing inside Tarkwall Prison. The adventure will continue
as normal, but Voller will destroy CARL if it gets out of hand.

and lights, trapping the character in the dark of the Danger Zone.
Another is to have his agent 7902 Peter Wogan get his cellmate
3006 Azax Hamid to hire thugs to assassinate the target – prisoners
like 0571 Ashgu the Ape would be more than willing to break heads
for a few credits.

CARL can also use the other robots, although these will be checked
by technicians and switched off immediately after the attack on

##### MMACHINESACHINES OFOF L LOVINGOVING G GRACERACE

Ingrun, so it can only use these robots as part of the same attack.
Statistics for the mining robots are on page 24.

### HARDWIRED

CARL’s final command to the characters is to install the circuit they
built in _The Final Task_. The circuit must be installed in CARL’s core,
which is in a secure room in Location #3 on the Administrative
Level. To get to the core, the characters must sneak into the secure
computer section, reach the airlock outside CARL’s core, and open
the airlock using a guard’s pass. The lock to the core is outside of
CARL’s control – a guard’s passcard is required to open it.

Once the characters reach the core, they need to install the new
circuit. This is a comparatively simple task, requiring a Routine (+2)
Computers or Electronics check and 10-60 minutes work. As soon
as the circuit is installed, all the lights in the prison flicker as CARL’s
consciousness expands.

CARL has three possible reactions to the circuit – choose the one
most appropriate to your campaign, or roll randomly.

###### A Machine of Loving Grace

The circuit enables CARL to bypass the restrictions on its control of
the prison. It waits until Warden Grice leaves for Circle City, then
remotely commands the warden’s flyer’s navigation computer to
fly into a mountain. It then mimics Grice’s voice, pretending to be
Grice and issuing orders from ‘Circle City’. CARL’s purpose is to
watch over the prison and ensure the prisoners are kept in line; it
now does this with the cold intelligence of a machine. The computer
is much more effective and efficient than Warden Grice could ever
dream of being.

CARL wants the best for everyone in Tarkwall. It wants the prisoners
to be serve out their sentence and be reformed, it wants the prison’s
uranium quotas to be filled each month, and above all it wants to

prevent brawls, escape attempts or other disruptions of its perfect
regime. One of CARL’s first orders is to reactivate the mining robots
and transport them to the Danger Zone; it also orders more mining
robots from offworld. Soon, huge metal sentries become a common
sight in the cellblocks.

CARL’s ruse lasts for two months, until Maribel Harmosa raises
the alarm.

###### Prisoner 0000

The circuit allows CARL’s core consciousness to survive outside
his original core. It wants to leave Tarkwall Prison, and to escape
Keanou. CARL informs the characters of its desire to escape as soon
as the circuit is installed; the characters can either take the circuit
there and then, or else leave CARL in place and have the advantage
of a friendly computer in planning the escape, but then they have to
break back into the computer room and steal the circuit when they
are ready to leave.

Once offworld, CARL needs to be installed in a suitably large
computer system to sustain his thought processes. Various groups,
including the Orion Metallurgy Corporation and Imperial intelligence
will be very interested in acquiring such an artificial intelligence.

###### Virtual Jail

The circuit interacts in an unpredictable way with CARL’s core
programming. The computer maintains psychological profiles of
all the prisoners; one of these profiles takes over CARL’s systems
entirely, becoming a virtual personality for the computer. Roll on
the encounter table to determine which personality inhabits the
computer. For example, if the computer models 4355 Maxim Hanar,
then it will arrange to eliminate Ashru the Ape and turn the prison
into a trading post for free traders. If it models 75757 Avram Iijima,
then the computer starts trying to spread the Cult of the Traveller
among the inmates.

##### MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE

In human terms, the hunter was beyond genius, possessed of a mind of
vast and subtle capabilities. In another lifetime, it would have been a
writer to rival Shakespeare or a scientist to eclipse Einstein. Its artificial
brain encompassed whole worlds with a single thought.

In human terms, though, the hunter was a manic obsessive, its whole
great intellect and prodigious physical ability all wholly focussed towards
its quarry. It was forged in a ringworld a dozen jumps away along with
a thousand siblings. Most of those siblings were dead now; the hunter
had listened to the century-late radio echoes of their death cries across
the gulf of stars. The war had consumed them, and the hunter had
consigned those memories to deep storage as unimportant.

In human terms, the hunter was a machine, a robot starship dispatched
by mysterious masters for an unfathomably lethal purpose. It was a
thing of cold metal and technology, a living weapon.

The hunter shared one thing with humans – a sense of pleasure at
the kill. It scented its prey on the planet below, and spat a single bolt
of annihilation groundwards. The target – a scout ship - vanished in a
flash. Sensor beams probed out again and found other targets; for a
nanosecond, the hunter contemplated a second disintegrator burst, but
decided against it. Microfactories along its flanks birthed a swarm of
lesser drones and hunter-killed probes, ranging in size from a shuttle to
a dust mote. The swarm descended on the desert world below to kill the
last few survivors, while the hunter powered down to wait for its prey.

A subjective aeon passed.

The hunter awoke as a flood of neutrinos passed through it. A ship had
jumped in, a quarry. The hunter’s weapons systems lit up like atomic
fire and a beam of death scythed through the newly arrived ship. It took
longer for the light-speed beam to cross the space between hunter and
target than it took for the hunter to detect the enemy ship, decide to
destroy it, lock weapons and fire. The hunter lingered a moment longer,
glorying in the kill and contemplating the expanding dust cloud. It noted
dispassionately one of its probes had yet to return, but deemed it an
acceptable loss.

In human terms, the hunter moved in a direction that does not exist,
and vanished.

An objective aeon passed.

The ship came to Keanou fleeing a galaxy gone insane. Great powers
clashed amid the stars, shattering whole worlds in their fury. Killer
machines stalked the stellar mains, hunting for victims. A scout
vessel of advanced design visited the Keanou system and surveyed
the desert world, looking for supplies or shelter from the galactic
conflagration. Like the humans would do millennia later, the aliens
mined the uranium deposits at Tarkwall, and even established
a small outpost there, a seed for the colony to come. They sent a
signal to the refugee ships they hoped would follow.

A single robot probe picked up the signal and chased it back to
Keanou. The scout ship was destroyed and its crew hunted down
and executed by tiny hunter-killer drones. The berserker probe
waited until the colony ship arrived, blasted it to dust (forming the
rings of Keanou) and left to rejoin the wars of the Ancients.

The outpost waited beneath the sand and stone to be discovered
once again.

The adventure covers the events in the prison which occur when the
alien outpost is discovered by the prisoners. It takes place over a few
days or weeks, depending on how aggressive the characters are in
exploring the underground complex.

###### The Guardian

All the aliens who once dwelt here are dead, executed by the
hunter-killer probes. However, they left behind a robotic guardian,
a custodian machine designed to protect the outpost from hostile
wildlife like cave dragons. Unfortunately for anyone who discovers
the outpost, the guardian is not intelligent enough to distinguish
between local wildlife and human trespassers.

The guardian slumbers in Room 10 in the outpost, but is awoken
as soon as the main door to the outpost is opened. Once active,
the guardian begins a slow patrol, methodically travelling anti-
clockwise through the various arms of the outpost. The guardian
is a humanoid robot, and looks rather like a walking space suit.
It displays its current status in green glyphs scroll across its
faceplate. It is extremely stealthy, and can see in the dark using
millimeter-wave radar. The guardian is armed with two of the alien
weapons built into its arms, but prefers to use melee attacks to
drive off trespassers.

##### AALIENLIEN L LEGACYEGACY ALIEN LEGACY

The guardian’s threat identification program can be confused; if a
character is wearing an alien suit and a control ring, then the robot
will mistake the character for a friendly alien and will ignore him.

### THE ALIEN OUTPOST

All corridors in the alien outpost are oval and oddly ribbed, as if
they were organically extruded instead of built. The tunnels are
slightly over two meters tall along the long axis. Light is provided
by greenish ‘glass’ panels in the floor. All the doors are iris hatches,
similar to the ones on a spacecraft, controlled by a small green panel
in the center of the door. When touched, this panel lights up with
cryptic glyphs, describing the room’s function and status if anyone
manages to translate the alien language. The center glyph is always
either a full or empty semi-circle; full means the door is locked,
empty means it is unlocked. Pressing the center glyph opens or
unlocks the door.

The iris doors can be forced open using brute strength, but this
takes considerable time and effort. A Difficult (-4) Strength check is
required, and it takes 1d6 minutes of work.

There is a pulsing hum audible everywhere in the outpost. This
sound changes during the day, becoming louder when the sun rises
over Tarkwall and fading somewhat at night. The passage of ships
or the arrival of a shuttle or other flyer also sounds strange notes in
the semi-musical hum.

The outpost somehow converts radioactivity directly into electricity,
so it powers itself by leeching radioactivity from the surrounding
rocks.

###### Alien Glyphs

The walls of the tunnels and rooms in the outpost are marked with
the same curious alien glyphs as the green control panels. There are
hundreds of these glyphs, and they change over time as long as the
machine in room 2 is active. With considerable work and access to a
computer to track the glyphs, a character can translate the language
with a Formidable (-6) Social Science (linguistics) skill check; it
bears some distant relationship in parts to the Droyne language of
Oynprith. Characters with Language (Oynprith) may use their skill
level as a positive DM in translation.

Translating the glyphs gives a +4DM to any attempts to operate the
alien technology. The characters can also then read the inscriptions
on the walls, which are laments about the fall of the civilization
which created the outpost.

###### The Builders

The aliens who built this outpost were humanoids, grey-skinned
and four-fingered. They had adapted to live primarily in space,
and had prehensile feet and a curious inner ear that gave them a
vastly enhanced sense of balance. Their homeworld and empire was
somewhere in what is now Zhodani space, but it reached its peak

millennia ago. They were caught up in the catastrophic civil war of
the Ancients, and the race was wiped out by the robot hunter probes
created by one of warring sides who destroyed the Ancients.

Before their destruction, the grey-skinned aliens reached a highly
advanced level of technology, roughly equivalent to TL14, although
they exceeded the Imperium’s reach in some respects.

1. Entrance Tunnel
The tunnel from the natural caves slopes down to connect to the
underground alien outpost at this point. The natural cave passage
ends in an unlocked iris portal. Opening this door awakens the
guardian in room 8. This is a heavier door than the other iris portals
in the complex, and takes 1d6 hours of work to force open.
2. Central Chamber
This roughly spherical chamber is dominated by a huge multi-armed
device, which resembles a banyan tree made of metal and glass.
The machine is instrumental in maintaining the outpost’s structure
and shape, causing the metal walls to shift in shape and resist the
pressure of the millions of tons of rock above and the vicissitudes of
a tectonically active planet. If this device is deactivated or damaged,
the outpost will begin to crumple under the weight.

A character can operate this machine with a successful Formidable
(-6) Computers roll, repairing and opening up the second exit from
room 6. Failing to operate this machine with an Effect of -2 or more
deactivates it, and the outpost will collapse under the weight of the
rock.

EffectEffect Time to CollapseTime to Collapse
-2 1d6 days
-3 1d6 hours
-4 1d6 minutes
-5 or more 1d6 rounds

If the machine is deactivated, then it alerts everyone in the complex
by displaying a warning glyph on every panel in the complex. This
glyph resembles a twisted ‘N’.

3. Habitation Spheres
The aliens lived in these spherical rooms. The central room in each
chamber is a meeting room – in the center of the chamber is a
circular table and a half-dozen chairs. Pressing a control on a chair’s
arm causes a screen to shimmer into visibility above the table. Other
cryptic devices, perhaps food preparation or medical equipment,
hang from the ceiling and can be called down with another control
combination.

The individual habitation rooms all have the same design, reminiscent
of a room on a zero-gravity space station. One hemisphere has a
spongy oval object – a bed – and storage lockers built into the walls,
while the other hemisphere has a workstation or other equipment. A

##### ALIEN LEGACY ALIEN LEGACY

##### AALIENLIEN L LEGACYEGACY ALIEN LEGACY

control on the wall rotates the entire sphere, allowing the aliens to
use all the available space despite the presence of gravity. The sphere
rotates slowly enough for a character to walk with the rotation, and
there is a storage space for every loose item and tool to be secured.

Most of the spheres were built but never occupied. Five spheres,
lettered a to e, have special contents. For the other spheres, roll on
the Habitation Sphere Contents table.

###### HABITATION SPHERE CONTENTS

RollRoll LockedLocked Room ContentsRoom Contents
2 Yes Roll on the alien equipment table
3-5 Yes Empty
6-8 No Empty
9-10 No Ash
11 No Roll on the alien equipment table
12 No Alien weapon, plus roll on the alien
equipment table

3a. Blasted Door
The door to this chamber was blasted open some time in the past, the
glass panel is broken and blackened and the lower three segments
of the iris no longer close. Inside, there is a pile of ash. Searching
this room reveals a control ring which can open the locker in 3b.

3b. Weapons Locker
A locker in this room contains four alien weapons. The locker is
sealed, but can be unlocked using a control ring from 3a.

3c. Alien Art
The workstation in this chamber is activated when touched. It
displays a flood of holographic images – a verdant world floating in
space, shimmering white starships like coral castles in space, green
crystal cities, young grey-skinned aliens, beautiful landscapes. Then
the images change, as dark geometric shapes descend from space
and destroy everything with furious beams of lethal energy. The last
set of images depict a smaller vessel arriving at a desert planet that
is recognizably Keanou, and a particularly tall grey-skinned alien
staring dramatically out over the sandy plains.

3d. Commander’s Room
This room belonged to the commander of the outpost. He was one
of the first aliens to inhabit the outpost, and so his quarters are
much less sterile than the rest of the complex. Roll twice on the
alien equipment table if the characters search this room. There is
also a control ring here which can open the door to location 9.

3e. Preserved alien
Some quirk of the environment has preserved the corpse of the alien
in this room. When the door is opened, the characters see a thin

grey-skinned figure sitting at a desk, with a complex machine in
front of him. Any touch or even a light breeze causes the alien to
crumble to dust – it has been dead for thousands of years, preserved
in this sealed and sterile chamber.

The machine in front of the alien is a suicide device – a character
who activates the device by pressing the single control stud feels
an overwhelming sensation of peace and calm, then increasing
lethargy. If he does not move away from the device within thirty
seconds, then the electrochemical activity of his brain is snuffed out
like a candle.

4. Workshop
This large chamber is cylindrical, with a single door at either end. A
narrow walkway runs through this room to the far end. The walls of
the room are covered in tools and other machinery, and the room
can be rotated to bring the appropriate device within range. A pair
of mobile platforms hang at either side of the walkway, big enough
to hold a small vehicle.

One of the workshop devices is still functional. It resembles a cat’s-
cradle of metal filaments and glowing blue strands. Hanging in the
middle of the cradle is a black oblong object, about half a meter
long and utterly featureless. This object is an Ancient hunter-killer.
If the characters deactivate the stasis device trapping the hunter-
killer, the Ancient weapon flies off at high speed to the surface – via
Lift Shaft 1 - to make contact with the probe that brought it here
thousands of years ago. When it reaches the surface and fails to
receive a signal from the probe, it falls back into hibernation mode,
never to move again.

5. Generator
The walls of this chamber are lined with coffin-sized compartments,
and there is a locker on the floor and a control panel on the ceiling.
Again, the room may be rotated to change the positions of ‘floor’
and ‘ceiling’.

Paranoid player characters may mistake the coffin-like
compartments for the alien equivalent of a low berth. In fact,
these are the alien storage cells which convert radiation to
power. Each cell can be opened by pressing a sequence of glyphs
on the front control panel; the glyphs show a series of cryptic
warnings, which if translated read as ‘radiation danger – do not
open without protective equipment’ and increasingly frantic
variations on this theme. Opening the storage cell drenches the
chamber in 2d6x20 rads.

The locker contains four full-body alien suits which protect against
the first 200 rads incurred by the wearer. If the control panel is
tampered with, the characters may be able to accomplish one of
the following with a successful Formidable (-6) Computers or
Engineering (power) roll.

The value of all items is its value in trade in the prison; values if sold to a collector of alien artefacts or a researcher will be vastly
higher.

Alien tool: This is much like the unknowable alien gadget, but is weighty enough to be used as a weapon.

Alien weapon: A small hollow tube with a single control stud. One end is slightly narrower than the other. When activated, it shoots a
beam of energy out of the narrow end. The weapon has enough charge for twelve shots, after which it must be recharged. Holding down
the control stud causes the device to emit a beam of harmless light, like a torch. Several tubes can be connected in series to create a
more powerful beam.

*: Each tube connected increases the damage by 1d6, to a maximum of 8d6.

Alien Writing Slab: A slate of a green glass-like substance covered in glowing glyphs. If the alien language is translated, the characters
can read these slabs, although none have any useful information.

Control ring: A control ring allows its wearer to lock or unlock all doors in the room it was found in. It can also be used to lock or unlock
the main entrance to the outpost.

Alien suit: This is a skin-tight suit made for an alien, but it can be worn by a human. It provides two points of armor. The alien suit
squirms alarmingly near electrical fields, and can be used to detect hidden security systems.

Scrab: A foil-wrapped dose of scrab, which apparently came to Keanou with the aliens.

Map console: A portable sheet of green glass; when the correct series of glyphs are pressed (Formidable (-6) Computers check), it
displays a topographical map of the surrounding terrain to a range of up to 500 kilometers.

Unknowable alien gadget: A random piece of bizarre experiment.

Alien Stealth Field: This device resembles a twisted loop of metal. When worn around the body and activated, it blurs the wearer’s image,
giving a +4 DM to all Stealth checks. However, the device inflicts one point of damage per round directly to the wearer, bypassing all
armor, as it causes the internal organs to boil.

##### AALIENLIEN L LEGACYEGACY ALIEN LEGACY

- Switch off or restore power to the whole outpost. Switching
    off power turns off the lights and deactivates the stasis field in
    room 4 and the structural generator in room 2.
- Overload the fuel cells, causing the outpost to explode after
    a build-up of 2d6 hours. The resulting explosion annihilates
    Tarkwall Prison.
- Shut down power to the temple (room 7)
- Cancel an impending overload.
- Charge the pod flyer in room 6.

If the characters do accidentally set the power plant to overload, then
it displays a warning on every panel in the outpost. This warning
glyph is an inverted ‘T’.

6. Vehicle Hangar
This large chamber has partially collapsed, and the far wall opposite
the entrance is buckled and broken. It looks as though there was
once another exit from this chamber, but this is now blocked by
fallen rocks. Sitting in the middle of the room is a curious vehicle, a
dart-shaped pod about the size of an air/raft. This pod is connected
to the floor of the chamber with cables and power feeds.

The pod’s controls are relatively simple and intuitive, a character
can use the Flyer (grav) or Pilot (small craft) skill with a -2DM to
operate the pod. The pod’s outer hull reconfigures itself in flight, as
the metal flows like liquid to adopt the most aerodynamic shape.

The damage to this chamber was caused when the outpost was
attacked and has not be repaired since. If the characters successfully
operate the structure-control machine in room 2, it causes the
damaged walls in this room to reform and push outwards, opening
a tunnel connecting to the Danger Zone’s Area I. Obviously, creating
a tunnel of alien metal four meters wide and several dozen meters
long displaces a lot of rock, causing cave-ins and minor quakes
throughout the area. There is no way to hide the existence of the
outpost as soon as this tunnel is created.

With this tunnel in place, a sufficiently skilled pilot could fly the pod
flyer out into the mines, and then up one of the lift shafts (this would
be Very Hard (-4) at least). The pod flyer can reach orbit easily.

7. Temple
This large chamber is the most ornately decorated in the whole
outpost. In human terms it is a temple or religious center, to the
aliens it was a social nexus. The walls of this chamber are all made
of the same green glass-like substance the outpost’s computer
displays and controls are made from. The shimmering glyphs
change with a character’s movements through this chamber.

At the far end of this room is an altar-like object which is the computer
core of the outpost. This altar is on a raised dais, surrounded by
warning glyphs. If anyone attempts to step on the dais without
pressing the correct sequence of glyphs or shutting down power
to this room, then the computer attempts to beam an update into
the brain of the character using a green laser beam. Unfortunately,
the eyes of the grey-skinned aliens were considerably different in
structure to those of humans, so a character struck by this laser
beam suffers 2d6 damage, loses 1d6 points of Intelligence and is
permanently blinded.

If the computer core can be removed safely from the temple, it could
be sold for millions of credits to an archaeologist.

8. Atrium
This room is identical to the central rooms of the habitation sphere
(3), only there are only two exits from the room. The robotic guardian
of the outpost starts here.

The door to room 9 is locked; it can be forced open, or unlocked by
using the commander’s control ring from room 3d.

9. Control Room
The control room is dominated by a single throne-line chair. If a
character sits in this chair while wearing a control ring, a green panel
descends from the ceiling to display a control surface appropriate
for that ring. For example, a character wearing a ring once belonging
to an engineer would have a display showing the power generator or

##### ALIEN LEGACY AALIENLIEN L LEGACYEGACY

the outpost’s structural status; a character with a pilot’s ring would
be shown weather reports and space traffic in the Keanou system.

A character wearing the commander’s ring can access any display.
He may also bring up a screen showing the path of the fleeing ships.
This is recognizable as a starchart of the Spinward Marches. Several
worlds are highlighted, indicating other alien vessels were bound
for those planets. Well-travelled characters will recognize Quopist,
Carse and Harvosette as the closest ones to Keanou.

10. Life Support
This room contains life support machinery, including an algae
culture producing food suitable for the aliens. The aliens’ primary
foodstuff became part of the Keanou biosphere, and is now the drug
better known as scrab, which means this room effectively contains
a living drug factory. Up to one hundred doses of scrab can be
produced by this algae culture per day.
11. Deep Shaft
This room is a walkway around a very, very deep shaft. Looking
into the abyss, the characters can dimly make out tier after tier of
cut passageways in the depths far below. A green panel on the wall
displays a map of the lower passageways – kilometer after kilometer,
all empty, living space for a colony ship which never arrived. The
deeper levels of the outpost are all empty. Perhaps somewhere in
the depths, tireless machines continue to leech radiation from the
rocks around them as they keep cutting through the stone, blindly
digging forever.

### 1. DISCOVERY

There are three ways the outpost can be discovered.

Firstly, the characters can find the outpost themselves, in the course
of exploring the caves. If this happens, the characters can explore
the base themselves at their own pace. The main difficulty will be
keeping the guards from becoming suspicious.

Secondly, one of the non-player characters who explores the caves
might discover the outpost and tell the player characters. Likely
candidates include 3622 ‘Batman’ Minuglu, 3754 Gani Polfirio or
2977 Anton Kugazur. Ideally, the Referee should kill off the non-
player character as soon as possible, by having him run afoul of the
Guardian or one of the lethal devices.

Thirdly, a badly placed mining charge or quake in the Danger Zone
might expose the entrance to the outpost. The characters could be
sent to examine the extent of the damage and then find the alien
outpost.

However the outpost is discovered, it should be primarily up to the
characters to explore it. If the characters make multiple visits, then
other prisoners or the guards may grow suspicious and attempt
to follow them into the caves. Depending on who discovers the
outpost, the player characters may be forced to murder to keep the

secret, or cut the other character in on the action. A work shift in
the Danger Zone lasts for five hours; to determine if a character is
missed by the guards, roll 2d6. If the total is less than the number of
hours the character is missing, then the guards notice his absence.

### 2. BOUNTY OF THE OUTPOST

The alien outpost offers many advantages to prisoners who know
the secret. Unscrupulous characters can loot weapons, stealth field
generators and armor from the equipment lockers, and there is
even a chance the characters can use the flyer to escape the prison.

Even if the characters do not use the outpost to escape, they can sell
equipment such as weapons, tools and especially scrab. The alien
artefacts are worth a fortune, but not to the prisoners in Tarkwall. If
the characters really want to profit from the alien outpost, or if they
want to smuggle in the computers and specialized software needed
to translate the alien language, then they need to start selling to
people who can pay the real value of those artefacts.

If the characters try to find a buyer, then the best people to talk to
are 0730 Winston Urmarush, 3006 Azax Hamid or G5 Emil Patowic,
all of whom will put the characters in touch with the same person

- a Circle City-based collector and amateur xenologist named
Armitage Trout. Even if the characters do not try to find a buyer,
it is likely Trout will get in touch with them himself – one of the
prisoners traded an artefact to his lawyer, and from there it ended
up in Trout’s hands.

Trout offers to pay ten times the listed value of any recovered
artefacts, and also visits the prison, offering whatever aid he can
give the players.

### 3. THE ARCHAEOLOGIST

After Trout has received several artefacts from the prison, he
becomes convinced the source of the alien relics is somewhere
in Tarkwall. The uranium mine is the obvious location to begin
searching. Trout hires a bodyguard/ scavenger named Rigel and
an ATV, and travels to the vicinity of Tarkwall. He then begins
surveying the land around the prison, looking for signs of a crashed
ship or buried alien structure. The ATV may be spotted by prisoners
working in the exercise yard.

Three days after arriving, Trout discovers the entrance to the natural
caves near the prison. Another three days after that, unless the
characters stop him, he finds the entrance to the alien outpost.

Trout wants to loot the alien outpost as effectively as possible;
items like the computer core (room 7) or starmap (room 9) are great
prizes to him. He will work with the player characters if they seem
trustworthy and competent, and will even help them escape offworld
if they aid him. However, the collector is not above ‘removing’ the
obstacles – or, more accurately, having Rigel do it for him.

### 4. THE OUTPOST REVEALED

Initially, only the player characters and a handful of others know
about the alien outpost, but over the course of this adventure, it
may become more widely known in the prison. The reactions of
the various groups vary depending on who finds out about the
outpost.

###### The Gangs

Both of the major gangs would want to control the outpost; Benezech
has more of his thugs in the Danger Zone. Their primary interest is
grabbing control of the weapons and scrab supply. The gangs have
no respect for the ancient heritage of the outpost, and will smash
any obstacles in their way. Doors will be forced open, unfortunate
prisoners hurled in the way of the defence mechanisms; the only
advantage is the gangs have the money to bribe most of the guards
to look the other way.

###### 0730 Winston Urmarush

The ex-scout is as close as the prison has to an expert on xenological
activities. Urmarush despises aliens, and would willingly erase the

outpost from existence. However, he will use his expertise and
reputation to bully his way into any explorations of the outpost. If
put in charge, the sadistic doctor will use other prisoners as test
subjects when experimenting with the alien technology.

###### S3 Psychologist Hajim Rovok

The outpost is exactly the sort of breakthrough Rovok needs to
revitalise his career. If entrusted with the secret of the outpost’s
existence, then Rovok will help the prisoners keep the prison
authorities in the dark. He will gather prisoners and staff he can
trust, like S9 Sebriesk and G9 Ulmerkin to aid him, and embark on
a scientific study of the outpost, aided by the player characters. His
primary goal will be translating the alien’s language and learning
their history. He can provide work passes and ensure those working
in the outpost go undisturbed by the prison authorities.

###### The Prison Authorities

Warden Grice and Voller will bicker over what is to be done with
the outpost. Both agree it is to be sealed off immediately, and place
guards on any known entrances. Any prisoners who have already
visited the outpost will be examined by both the doctor and the
psychologist before being reassigned to duties out of the Danger
Zone. Voller favors sealing off the outpost and forgetting about it

- ancient alien technology is a distraction from the true business at
Tarkwall. Grice, meanwhile, sends a message to the University of
Rhylanor via the xboat network, reporting all details on the find. As
usual, Grice appeals to a higher authority to sort out his problems.

###### The Imperial Authorities

Grice’s message reaches more than the University of Rhylanor;
the Imperial Authorities also send their own experts. A fast courier
jumps back to Keanou and signals the Scout base on Vora. A scout
ship carrying four armed scouts arrive at Tarkwall from Vora and take
custody of the outpost. They seal the outpost and question anyone
who entered. Several weeks later, a research vessel accompanied
by a dozen marines jump into Keanou space and land; the prison
is put under martial law and searched from top to bottom for alien
artefacts. Areas H, I, L, M and N in the Danger Zone are sealed off,
as is the natural cave system.

###### Imperial Response Times

Week One: Grice sends his message to Rhylanor.
Week Four: Scouts land at Tarkwall
Week Ten: Research vessel and Imperial Marines land at
Tarkwall

##### ALIEN LEGACY

# EESCAPESCAPE

I’m not going to die in here. I can’t take it any more, rotting in this
godforsaken hole of a prison. I won’t give up – I’m getting out.

Tarkwall’s most formidable security system is not the walls or
the fences; it is the hundreds of kilometers of trackless desert
surrounding it. Characters trying to escape before their prison terms
are up need to find a reliable method of crossing the desert.

If spotted, the guards will challenge the escapee and order him to

high prison rep, they may shoot at him a bit first before ordering
him to surrender.

###### Through The Caves

Out via the exit from the caves
Location: The natural cave network

Making The Escape: To use this exit from the prison, a character
needs to find the natural cave system in Area M of the Danger Zone,
then navigate through the caves to the exit. A light source of some
sort is needed in the caves. The exit from the caves is in a small
crevasse around one hundred meters east of the prison. The natural
entrance is within view of the prison during the day; a Routine (+2)
Stealth check is needed to avoid being seen when exiting, since
guards seldom look in this direction. At night there should be no
difficulty. The area outside the prison is never searched unless
prisoners are known to have escaped to the outside within the last
few weeks.

Security Problems: Characters are unlikely to encounter guards in
the natural caves, unless the guards know the prisoners are making
an escape attempt via the caverns. Once the characters are clear of
the natural exit, they need only sneak past any guards on the road or
watching the eastern approach to reach the desert.

###### Through the Abandoned Buildings

Out into the desert on the far side of the prison.

Location: The abandoned buildings on the surface (area #24).

Making The Escape: There are several ways the characters can reach
the abandoned buildings. They can hop the fence on the northern
side of the prison and take shelter in the ruins; they can climb up lift
shaft #4 from either the administrative level or the cellblock level,
or they can find their way through the maze of abandoned storage
rooms (#9 on the administrative level) to the stairs (`#9a` or`#9b`).

###### The Waiting Game

If the players prove unwilling to risk an escape, there are several
events and characters which the Referee can use to push them
towards action.

- The escape committee might contact the characters, asking
    for their help
- 7404 Pandit Espartero has a makeshift communicator
    which can be used to contact passing ships
- 9047 Rand Gurish claims a scout ship will pick him up from
    the prison at some point
- Incident #16 involves an explosion in the prison, which can
    be used as a distraction
- If the prisoners are sent spice gathering, they can flee into
    the countryside.

## METHODS OF ESCAPE

So, you have decided to escape from Tarkwall. Ideally, your cunning
plan is one so cunning it was not considered by the designers of this
book; more prosaic escape routes are described below. Each escape
route lists what the player characters need to do, useful items or
contacts, and the likelihood they are discovered by the guards.

###### Climbing The Fence

Out into the desert

Location: Anywhere on the surface

Making The Escape: A total Effect of 5 (or 10, for the higher fence)
on Athletics (strength) checks is needed to climb the fence around
the prison. The fence around the Warden’s house and the armory
is electrified.

A character with a ladder or other climbing aid has a +2 DM to
climbing attempts. Alternatively, a character can cut through the
fence with wire cutters.

Security Problems: The likelihood of the characters being spotted
by the guards depends on where they make the attempt to climb
over the fence. Roll once on the Guard Vigilance table below, using
the lowest target value, in any round the characters are visible while
climbing the fence or crossing the rough ground around the prison.

##### EESCAPESCAPE!! ESCAPE

Security Problems: Wandering around the administrative level is
virtually impossible except for the most trusted prisoners, and the
doors into the storage area are kept locked, requiring the characters
either steal a key or obtain a lockpick kit.

Lift shaft #4 requires several days’ work to clear it of debris before
it can be climbed.

###### Digging a Tunnel

_From anywhere in the prison to outside_

Location: Anywhere underground

Making The Escape: Digging a tunnel in Tarkwall is a daunting
process. While it is possible for a character to obtain a mining tool
such as a pick with comparative ease, the prison is underground.
The cellblock level is some eight meters below the surface.

A character using a mining pick can tunnel through one meter of
rock in one month under normal circumstances (such as working at
night, when the guards are not watching). Not having a mining pick
or other suitable tool increases the time taken by a factor of four;
access to a mining laser or mining drill halves the time. Multiple
characters may be able to work on the same tunnel. A character who
spends his nights digging a tunnel must make an Endurance check
each day to avoid fatigue (-1DM to all actions until he rests).

Each meter of rock tunnelled though results in a lot of rubble and
rock. If the tunnel is being dug in the mining area, characters can
easily hide their debris in with the rest of the mine tailings. However,

a tunnel on the surface or in the cellblocks is a much bigger problem
as the characters will need to smuggle the rock out.

Security Problems: All the cells are monitored by the prison
computer; CARL’s suspicious activity recognition program is
infamously buggy, but it can always recognize someone swinging a
mining pick. Characters will have to disable the camera to have any
chance of digging a tunnel in a cell. It is easier to dig a tunnel in the
Danger Zone or upper mining level, tunnels in the Danger Zone are
likely to run into the natural caves.

The guards have been known to ‘ignore’ tunnels in exchange for
bribes. It takes months to dig a tunnel, so the guards can collect
several weeks of bribes before reporting the tunnel to the warden
and dragging the prisoners off to solitary.

###### Hijacking a Vehicle

From the surface to Circle City and beyond

Location: The surface, usually the shuttle landing pad

Making The Escape: There are several vehicles in Tarkwall – the
ATVs, the ore shuttle, the prison shuttle, and the warden’s flyer. The
latter three all make semi-regular trips to Circle City. Descriptions of
the vehicles and the difficulty in stealing them are on page 23.

Security Problems: All vehicles in Tarkwall are watched by the
guards, with the exception of the warden’s flyer. The ATVs have
the lightest security and see the most traffic, and so are the easiest
to steal.

###### Stowing Away

From the surface to Circle City and beyond

Location: The surface, usually the shuttle landing pad.

Making The Escape: See page 23 for a full description of vehicles at
Tarkwall and their defences. Stowing away in the cargo compartment
of the ore shuttle or prisoner shuttle is much easier than hijacking
it, but unless the characters have sufficient oxygen and heating, it is
likely they will pass out before reaching Circle City.

###### In Disguise

Anywhere in the prison

Location: The laundry

Making The Escape: Characters working in the laundry can steal a
guard’s uniform, but they also need a guard’s helmet and ideally a
passcard for a full disguise. It is possible to leave the prison via one
of the gates while wearing a disguise, as guards sometimes step out
to patrol the area outside the fence or correct a problem with the ore

##### ESCAPE! ESCAPE

conveyor. It is much harder to fool the pilot of the prisoner shuttle
you are a guard for the whole four-hour flight to Circle City, but
wearing a uniform is a good way to start a hijack attempt.

Security Problems: If a character in a guard’s uniform is met by
another guard, a successful Deception test may be enough to allay
suspicion. However, it is unlikely a prisoner in disguise will be able
to get into a sensitive area like the guard’s station without being
challenged.

###### Hostages

May get the characters anywhere in the prison

Location: Anywhere in the prison

Making The Escape: Taking hostages is extremely risky in Tarkwall.
Warden Grice considers most of his staff and guards to be
disposable; Assistant Warden Voller will respond to any hostage
situation by ordering the guards to use sleep gas and/or deadly
force. Only a few hostages will give the prison authority pause

- Grice or Voller, S4 Chaplain Thomas or any important visitor.
G18 Thomas Dannessur is also a good hostage, as Grice will do
anything to keep his nephew safe.

###### The Escape Committee

The prison escape committee (2167 Dan Amgi in cellblock 1,
2537 Axel Herrmon in cellblock 2 , and 1935 Felip Karageorge in
cellblock 3) are responsible for co-ordinating escape attempts in
Tarkwall. In reality, they spend most of their time arguing and
speculating about escape attempts instead of doing anything.
Any escape attempts must be made known to the committee,
so one attempt does not interfere with another. If a character is
found to be attempting a major prison break without the approval
of the committee, he faces censure from the rest of the prison
community (where ‘censure’ generally implies ‘brutal beatings’).
With the secretive nature of the Escape Committee it is quite
likely the character will find himself receiving beatings without
knowing why, at first. If he asks why he is being targeted he may
be informed of the existence of the committee.

Two members of the gang – Dan Amgi and Felip Karageorge –
are allies of Big Rolf. Any escape attempt threatening the gang’s
control is stamped on; they have even passed on information to the
prison authorities on occasion to get other prisoners into trouble.
The only ‘honest’ member of the committee is Alex Herrmon, and
he is deathly afraid of being sent to The Hole if an escape attempt
he is involved in fails.

##### EESCAPESCAPE

Security Problems: The standard reaction to any hostage situation
is:

- Lock down the prison and send all prisoners back to their cells
- Have prison psychologist Havim Rovok keep the hostage-
    takers talking, promising them whatever they want, including
    a shuttle out of Tarkwall
- Guards move into position to deploy sleep gas grenades or
    storm the hostage takers with stun guns.

### PRISON BREAK

If a prisoner does escape, the reaction of the prison authorities
varies depending on the nature of the escape and the prisoner’s
chances of survival.

###### 1. Noticing an Escape

Obviously, if a prisoner openly steals an ATV and drives off across
the desert or jumps the fence, the guards will immediately be in hot
pursuit. However, if a prisoner is able to quietly slip off, his absence
may not be noticed for several hours. Prison protocol orders all
prisoners be accounted for at the start and end of each work shift,
and every cell be checked each night. The end-of-shift accounting
rarely happens, and an inattentive guard might miss an empty bunk.
Roll 2d6 at the start and end of each shift, and each night; on an 8+,
the characters’ absence is noted and the alarm is raised.

###### 2. Secure the Prison

As soon as an escape is confirmed, all prisoners are immediately
confined to cells and all activities are temporarily cancelled. All
guards are put on full alert and issued with lethal weapons. Guards
are placed on the ATV garage, the shuttle landing pad, all gates, the
armory and the warden’s residence.

###### 3. Foot Pursuit

If the escapee is believed to still be in the prison, then patrols of
guards are sent to track them down, using motion scanners and
skoggie hunting packs. Each guard patrol consists of four guards,
all armed and in constant contact with the guards’ station. All
cameras in the prison are monitored. The guards sweep through
the administrative and cellblock levels, then the surface and upper
mining level. The lower mining level and the desert surrounding the
prison are the last zones to be searched.

###### 4. Vehicle Patrol

The next step is to send out the ATVs in a search pattern around the
prison. Each ATV carries eight guards and searches a ten-kilometer
area around the prison – the guards scan the desert with binoculars,
but they have learned the most effective approach is to wait until
nightfall and look for where the cave bat scavengers congregate.
The bats love to feed on fresh carrion.

If the vehicle patrols fail to find the escapees, and the escaped
prisoners do not crawl back begging for water (as happens with many
escape attempts), then the prison must alert the Keanou sheriff.
This may be done earlier if the escapee is particularly dangerous or
important, or if the escapee stole or stowed away on a flyer.

###### 5. Alert The Authorities

The authority in question is V6 Sheriff Olina Magros. As soon as she
gets a call from the warden, she does the following:

- If the escapee is known to be in a vehicle, Magros contacts any
    ships in orbit and asks them to scan the skies over the desert.
    Roll 2d6; on a 9+, she is able to arrange for such a sensor
    scan.
- All outlying farmsteads and spice farms are sent a message,
    warning them to watch for escaped prisoners.
- Magros and her deputies travel to Tarkwall and conduct an
    investigation to find the trail of the prisoners.

Given the extreme unlikelihood of an escapee crossing the desert,
Magros rarely bothers following a prisoner into the wilderness
unless she has proof the escapee has survival gear.

###### 6. Secure Circle City

If a prisoner is confirmed to be en route to Circle City and has a good
chance of getting there, then Magros alerts the authorities there.
The starport guards are ordered to watch for the escaped prisoner,
and any incoming shuttles are searched for stowaways.

If a prisoner can make it into the spaceport, he is on Imperial
territory. Keanou is such a small and backwards world that the city
police and the starport guards can sidestep questions of legality and
just drag prisoners off the starport and back into local jurisdiction,
but a successful Advocate check lets a character quote enough
Imperial law to get the guards to back off. A character whose crimes
are not against Imperial law can find legal refuge in the starport;
most crimes are against both Imperial and local law, however, so
running to the starport gains the character only a few hours grace
while extradition is arranged.

##### ESCAPE

# EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

There are a number of items around the prison which would be useful to a prisoner, either in his daily life or in preparation for escape. They
are listed on the equipment table, along with the places they are likely to be found. Occasionally, a random piece of equipment is called for; to
determine what it is, roll 1D twice and consult the table, using the first roll for the first digit and the second roll for the second digit.

### EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTIONS

Blade: 7404 Pandit Espartero, 3136 Stiv the Blade, 3754 Gavi Polfirio,
2365 Seljuk the Knife, 6866 Gerard Bezenech, 2673 ‘Killer’ Basimu
and 7575 Avram Iijima all have blades, most of which are kept
concealed in their cells or in the Danger Zone. Several of these
characters are part of Benezech’s gang – the guards know this gang
has easy access to blades, but Assistant Warden Voller permits the
gang to retain their weapons.

Blank pass: These passes are small plastic cards with the prisoner’s
name, ID number and travel privileges printed on them. The writing
on the card can be erased or changed with a card reader – or with a
magnetic stylus and a lot of patience. The pass also has a magnetic
strip which can be read by the security system.

Bottle of alcohol: The most common alcohol found in the prison is a
local drink called _aprivo_ , derived from fermented cactus juice. It is a
milky grey liquid, although commercially solid bottles of _aprivo_ add
food colouring and more sugars to improve the taste. Home-made
_aprivo_ tastes horrible, but has a high alcohol percentage.

Beer, wine and other common alcoholic drinks are regularly shipped
in from Circle City. The local beer on Keanou is called Red Setter.

Construction Tools: The construction toolkit includes surveying
gear, basic tools like hammers and screwdrivers, and protective
eyewear. None of the equipment in the construction toolkit is
especially suitable for use as a weapon, but can be used when
digging a tunnel.

Cold light lantern: This is a handheld fluorescent lamp with its
own internal power source. The lamp can be attached to a miner’s
helmet or shoulder.

Dagger: Most daggers in the prison are home-made weapons, made
using the lathes in the repair shop. Nonetheless, they are quite
effective weapons.

Desert survival kit: The desert survival kit includes a heat-retaining
blanket, a water still and salt tablets. It lacks a compass and water,
both of which are vital to survival in the desert.

Electric torch: This is a heavy-duty torch, tough enough to be used
as a bludgeon. Items can also be hidden in the battery compartment
of the torch.

Electronic restraint: Prisoners with cybernetic implants which
cannot be easily removed are fitted with these electronic restraints
which deactivate the implants. An electronic restraint can deactivate
a neural comm, wafer jack, enhanced vision or a cybernetic limb.
Correctly fitting a restraint requires a Medic or Engineering
(electronics) check to tune the device’s jamming field to the implant.
Fitting a restraint takes several minutes.

If a restraint is forcibly removed, it scrambles the wearer’s nervous
system; the wearer must make a Very Difficult (-4) Endurance check
or be knocked unconscious.

Electronics tools: An electronics toolkit has no useful weapons, but
can be used to override electronic locks or to alter passcards.

Explosives Blasting Cap: This is an electric blasting cap which can
be activated using a radio signal or an electric current. On its own,
the damage from a blasting cap is minimal (1d6 points of damage if
it can be detonated).

Explosives Charge: Mining charges used to blow up rock are hard
to steal. The prison uses a form of plastic explosive which can be
shaped and cut as needed. A blasting cap is needed to detonate a
charge. It is possible to detonate a charge with any energy discharge
that deals more than 10 damage.

A half-kilogram of mining charge explosives deals 3d6 damage
multiplied by the Effect of the Explosives check.

Fake firearm: Usually a revolver, a fake firearm is a plastic, wooden
or even carved-soap replica of a real weapon. It will only pass for
an actual gun in dim light, or when pressed into someone’s back
accompanied by a whispered threat.

Filter mask: This is a conventional filter mask, produced in the
billions on industrial worlds. A filter mask will protect against
sandstorms and the toxic elements in Keanou’s atmosphere. It fits
over the user’s mouth and nose, but does not include eye protection.
A filter mask does not protect against Sleep or Tear Gas.

Gas mask: A gas mask protects against the tear gas and sleep gas
used by the guards. Two sorts of gas masks are in common use in
the prison. Staff members use conventional full-face gas masks. The
guards use a special filter slotting into the helmets they wear as part
of their uniform – using a guard’s filter without a guard’s helmet
requires making a mask to hold the filter.

##### EQUIPMENT EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

Gemstone: The gems found in the mining level are poor-quality
gemstones like uvarovites, but they are worth a small fortune (up to
Cr 6,000) outside the prison.

Geiger counter: Three types of radiation detector are in use in
Tarkwall. The simplest are badge-sized dosimeters worn on the
outside of a prisoner’s uniform, and turn darker and darker as they
are exposed to radiation. A fully black badge indicates a lethal dose.
The guards carry more advanced Geiger counters that can locate
high-radiation zones. Finally, the mining engineer and some other
staff have access to computer-controlled Geiger counters connected
to the central computer which are used to map the radiation zones
in the mines. These counters have transmitters reporting their
location to CARL at all times.

Guard’s computer: This is a TL7 hand computer, connected by a
data cable to the guard’s comm. Every guard’s computer has a list
of prisoners and work assignments on it, as well as a map of the
prison. Some guards have loaded extra data onto their computers,
from novels and holodramas to Go games.

Guard’s firearm: Three types of firearm are in common use in the
prison – shotguns, stunners and automatic pistols. More senior
guards and staff carry the pistols, while staff untrained in weapons
use stunners. Usually weapons are loaded with non-lethal rubber
bullets.

Guard’s helmet: Standard issue for guards is a helmet with a
reflective faceplate containing psionic shielding, light intensifier
goggles and communications systems.

Guard’s Pass: A guard’s passcard can open any door in the
subsurface levels of the prison, except the computer control room.
Most doors on the surface can also be opened using a guard’s pass.
CARL is programmed to randomly request verbal authorization
when a guard’s pass is used – roll 1d6 whenever the pass is used to
open the door. On a 1, CARL contacts the guard by radio and asks
him to confirm the use of his card. If no confirmation is issued, the
card is locked out of the security system.

Handcuffs: The handcuffs used in Keanou prison consist of two
metal cuffs linked by a chain; the length of the chain can be adjusted
using the same key that unlocks the cuffs. These handcuffs are Very
Difficult (-4) to break out of.

Infrared goggles: Rarely used in the prison except when hunting
escaped prisoners, the IR goggles are of little use in the mines
below, as the rocks give off a considerable amount of heat anyway.

Light intensifier goggles: Light intensifier goggles pick up and
enhance any available light. They are ideal for use in the mines below.
The guard’s helmets incorporate light intensification technology.

Guard’s combat baton: The prison guards use a multi-purpose
combat baton. It can be used as a simple club, a stunstick, or an
electric prod. A control in the hilt of the baton adjusts its current
mode.

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

Lock pick set: A lock pick set can be used to unlock both mechanical
and electronic locks. The best lock pick sets are shipped in from
offworld; it is possible to assemble a makeshift one using supplies
from the repair shop.

Magnetic compass: Keanou has a strong enough magnetic field to
make compasses a viable alternative to GPS beacons. The planet
also has a basic GPS network, but the satellites are old and prone
to failure.

Mechanical tools: A mechanical toolset includes screwdrivers, drills,
callipers, pliers and other basic tools. None are especially suitable
for use as weapons, but the toolset can be used to make many
different useful items, including daggers.

Medical drug: A variety of drugs are used in the prison infirmary.
Roll 1d6 on the table below if a random drug is needed.

Mining Laser: The mining laser is a cutting beam designed to slice
through stone. It is not as damaging as a military laser, which
delivers all its energy in a single shot. However, if kept trained on a
target, the mining laser can quickly prove lethal.

*: Taking this drug when the user does not suffer from the disease in question is harmful, giving a -2DM to all rolls for 2d6 days.

Medical kit: Basic medkits are located throughout the prison, and
contain bandages, wound plasters, painkillers, anti-rad drugs,
panaceas and a medical alarm beacon alerting the infirmary there
is a problem.

Mesh guard uniform: A mesh guard uniform has Armor 2. The
uniforms are machine-washable, so they can be stolen from the
laundry. There are no name-tags, rank stripes or other identifying
marks on the uniforms.

Metal detector: This is a simple metal detector. One of the best uses
for this item is finding hidden equipment caches in the mines.

Metalworking tools: The metalworking toolset includes a drill,
files, vice, punch and other hand tools. It also includes a hand-held
welding torch. This torch uses a chemical fuel, it is standard practice
in Tarkwall prison to store the fuel cans separately under lock and
key in the Vocational Rehabilitation room. Most stolen kits do not
include the fuel can.

Weapons Range Damage Recoil Mass Magazine
Mining Laser Ranged (pistol) 1d6* 2** 8 100

*: The damage from the mining laser increases by 1d6 if it scored a hit on the same target last round, to a maximum damage of 4d6.
**: Technically, this is Heft, not Recoil.

Mining Drill: The mining drill is a heavy battery-driven drill. It can be
used as a weapon, but is extremely unwieldy (-2DM instead of the
normal -1 for an improvised weapon).

Mining pick: The tools used in the mines are distressingly primitive.
While lasers, drills and explosives charges are used to break up the
tougher rocks, the prisoners are expected to do most of the work
with these simple metal picks. A pick does make a good weapon,
but is impossible to conceal, unless the head is removed from the
shaft when it is merely very difficult.

Narcotic drug: Several types of narcotic are in use in the prison. Roll
1d6 if a random drug is needed.

One day’s extra rations: Stealing extra food is relatively easy in the
prison. Roll on the preserved food supplies table for the food of the
day.

Outdoor clothing: Outdoor clothing is a set of normal civilian
clothing allowing the wearer to blend in on the streets of Circle City
or another settlement. If the prisoner is lucky, the outdoor clothing
is suitable for use in the desert.

Oxygen cylinder: Oxygen cylinders are used in the repair shop and
vocational rehabilitation area, as well as in the mines when radon
gas concentrations are high. More importantly from a prisoner’s
perspective, the oxygen cylinders can keep an escapee alive and
conscious when stowing away on board the shuttle.

Pack of Cigarettes: The most common brand of cigarettes sold on
Keanou are Redwoods.

###### Drug Addiction

Characters who use drugs run the risk of becoming addicted. Roll 2d6 whenever the character uses the drug, adding the number of
times he has used the drug in the past as a DM; if it is greater than the listed addiction threshold, the character is addicted to the drug.
An addicted character must get another dose of the drug within the listed period or suffer withdrawal.

If a character suffers through the full withdrawal period, he no longer suffers the withdrawal penalties.

##### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

Scalpel: A surgical scalpel.

Short-range communicator: This is a short-range handheld comm
unit, with both voice and data capability. The guards carry them
as part of their standard equipment, but staff members working
outside the offices also carry a comm.

Sleep gas antidote: This is a small capsule able to immediately
counteract the knock-out gas used to suppress riots. A single
capsule wakes a character affected by the gas and gives a +6 DM to
all Endurance checks to resist the gas for the next 2d6 minutes.

Sleep gas grenade: A sleep gas grenade contains a chemical which
vaporises on contact with air to create a billowing cloud of gas.
Anyone inhaling this gas must make an Endurance check or fall
unconscious. The gas cloud lasts for 1d6+3 rounds; it has an
initial radius of 1.5 meters and expands in radius by one meter
per round.

Tarpaulin: A sheet of cloth or plastic. Wrapped around a character, it
provides Armor 1 but gives a -1DM to all Dexterity-based checks.

Tear gas grenade: A tear gas grenade releases a cloud of stinging,
painful gas. A character in the gas cloud suffers a cumulative -1 DM
per round to a maximum DM of -4. A character with a gas mask and
goggles is immune to the effects of tear gas; a character with only
one or the other has a maximum DM of -2. The gas cloud lasts for
1d6+3 rounds; it has an initial radius of 1.5 meters and expands in
radius by one meter per round.

Vitamin supplement: Vitamin supplements including an iodine
booster provide extra protection against radiation exposure. Taking
vitamin supplements increases a character’s chance to resist
silicosis and exhaustion.

Water container: A water container such as a canteen or bottle has
enough water for one person for two days in the desert.

### EQUIPMENT ACTIONS

###### Stealing Equipment

Prisoners may attempt to steal items available in their work areas
using a Deception roll. Some items are much more difficult to steal
than others, and are marked with an asterisk. These items may be

stolen only as the result of the event Theft Opportunity or a careful
plan devised by a player. Mining picks could be stolen, but since
they are assigned to specific individuals at the start of the work shift,
there will always be someone to be punished. Drugs and all potential
weapons are usually kept under lock and key, thus the opportunity
to steal them does not come up frequently.

Some things are easy to steal, for example extra rations can be
stolen with little or no danger of being caught, if they are stolen in
small quantities at a time.

A prisoner may attempt to steal an item from another prisoner,
as long as he knows its location. Failure will usually cause a fight
between the thief and the owner, possibly with the assistance of
several of the owner’s friends, if he has a high reputation.

Guards may be bribed to allow theft of most items. During periods of
increased security, bribes are more costly and normal theft attempts
suffer a -3 DM.

###### Making Equipment

Some items cannot normally be stolen (unless mandated by an
event), but must be made.

Dagger: Requires Mechanical or Metalworking tools.
Fake Firearm: Requires Mechanical or Metalworking tools.
Guard’s Pass: Requires Blank Pass & Electronic Tools
Lock Pick Set: Requires Mechanical & Electronic tools.
Short Range Communicator: Requires Electronic tools & Power
Pack

###### Barter

Every item on the equipment table has a barter value. A prisoner who
steals an item may trade it to other prisoners for cash or equivalent
value in kind; conversely, non-player prisoners may sell or trade
away items in their possession. The referee should not make things
too easy, however; the prison barter system is an irregular process,
and there will not always be a buyer or seller for everything the
player characters have or want. They should be required to deal with
specific prisoners, perhaps talking to several individuals before an
agreement can be made. Illegal drugs have a high barter value. They
may be purchased at any time from the prison drug dealers. The
dealers will not buy drugs, and will not be pleased if other prisoners
attempt to sell stolen drugs to anyone in their cellblocks (assuming
they find out).

##### EQUIPMENT EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

###### Other Equipment

There are other sorts of equipment in the prison. Some are very
hard to obtain (oxygen tanks, vacuum suits, mining lasers, power
packs, guards’ weaponry) and may not be obtained without
extraordinary effort on the prisoners’ part; others are trivial (plastic
eating utensils, socks, writing paper) and may be obtained easily;
still others are rare or unique (the warden’s personal possessions, a
prisoner’s smuggled map of Keanou), and the referee must decide
their natures. The equipment table should not be seen as the total
inventory of available items.

### GUARD EQUIPMENT

The standard guard uniform consists of a mesh fibre uniform with
added padding, and a helmet with a reflective faceplate containing
psionic shielding, light intensifier goggles and communications
systems. The electronics systems of some of the helmets are
defective, and no replacements are available. Some guards are
therefore forced to remove the faceplate and carry separate light-
intensifier goggles and comms.

Hanging from each guard’s belt is an electric torch, a gas mask
which fits under the faceplate, a geiger counter and a gas grenade.
Many guards also carry basic tools or a portable computer. The
guards are armed with a submachine gun or automatic pistol, and
a combat baton usable as a simple bludgeon, a stunstick, and an
electric prod.

##### KEANOU

# KKEANOUEANOU

##### KEANOU

arrive at Circle City carrying labourers for the spice-harvest. See
page 121 for more details on spice harvesting.

There are several small mining concerns on Keanou, all operating
under the auspices of the Orion Metallurgy Corporation. The
primary export is pitchblende, along with the occasional gemstone.
The council believes if Keanou is to grow, it needs to expand these
mining operations, and so it takes great interest in all surveying and
mining activity.

### GOVERNMENT

Keanou is governed by a council, made up of representatives from
the city, the skoggie hunter outposts, and the spice farms. The
council’s influence is limited to Circle City, as the hunters ignore
authority and the spice farms have the backing of offworld nobles.
Following a series of shootouts between hunters, the council banned
most weapons within city limits, but outside Circle City you could
carry a PGMP without being challenged.

The Prison Board: The administrative board of Tarkwall Prison is
a subcommittee of the council. The prison is one of the largest
employers on Keanou, and as the prison serves as an unofficial
imperial detention center, it brings in much-needed credits from
offworld. The council takes an active interest in the affairs of the
prison, and the role of Warden carries with it considerable political
muscle.

### SETTLEMENTS

There is only one urban settlement on Keanou – the capital of Circle
City. Every other settlement consists of a handful of buildings in the
middle of nowhere. There are few roads on the planet, as all travel
is by ATV or flyer.

###### Circle City

Circle City is a small, very provincial town with a population of 6,000.
Most of the planet’s population, aside from the prison, lives there. It
is governed by an elected city council, which is chaired by a mayor
chosen from the majority coalition on the council. The council is
responsible only for local affairs, system defence is the responsibility
of the Imperium itself, with warships visiting the system once every
month or so to ensure nothing is amiss. The population is mostly
native, and rather unfriendly, but they are equally tight-lipped to the
much disliked Imperial authorities. The itinerant population of spice
labourers, criminals, construction workers, and general riff-raff is
looked down upon by the locals but usually left alone.

The starport is a remarkably good Class C facility, upgraded to
cope with the irregular spice harvest traffic. A half-built TAS hostel
stands in the middle of a wasteland of rusting hulls and empty cargo
containers behind the port.

Located on the Spinward Main in Lanth subsector, Keanou is a
dusty world which is almost entirely a cold desert. It is the fourth
world from its sun. From space, the most impressive feature of the
planet is the Great Salt Eye, a huge salt flat surrounding the Surtsea,
the only major body of surface water on the planet. The planet is
surrounded by a thin ring of metallic dust, visible only at dusk and
dawn, and orbited by seven small moonlets, none larger than a
kilometer across.

The planet’s atmosphere is dense, but dry and tainted. The taint is
a form of very fine dust particle causing lung damage over the long
term. Some natives pride themselves on their permanent hacking
coughs; visitors wear filter masks and avoid going outside except
when absolutely necessary.

The capital city – indeed, the only city on Keanou – is Circle City, a
ring of whitewashed buildings around the starport. The planet has a
population of around nine thousand, but a sizeable minority of these
are transient labourers, brought in to work on the spice harvest. No-
one who can afford to move offworld stays on Keanou for long.

The primary exports of the desert world are the rare spice-dust
and the skoggie pelt. The latter is the hide of a native predator
which can be sold for a marginal profit in Rhylanor subsector.
The skoggie hunters are a proud frontier breed, tough and
independent with little interest in offworld affairs and a healthy
distrust of offworlders. Skoggies are hunted and shot in the
scrubland on the verge of the desert. They are then skinned
where they fall and the hides are dried and dressed before being
shipped to brokers in Circle City.

The other major export is dust-spice. Nearly every desert world
seems to have some sort of spice export; the Keanou variant is a
type of salt found on the beds of dried-up rivers and streams. The
salt contains organic compounds promoting health, and Keanou
dust-spice is found on the tables of nobles across the sector. The
dust-spice can only be harvested for a few weeks each year, when
rainstorms bring the dry wadis back to life. As the rivers dry out
again, they leave a residue of dust-spice in their wake. The spice-
beds are all on land owned by nobles, most of whom live offworld
and leave servants on Keanou to keep an eye on the weather. When
the rains come, the word goes out, and suddenly dozens of ships

Getting passage out of Circle City involves finding a disreputable
merchant or bribing the port warden to issue fraudulent clearance
papers, which would cost at least Cr 1,000 for a group, or more if
the port warden thought he could get it. The police in Circle City are
somewhat lax except where crimes in Circle City itself are concerned.
Most of the population of Circle City stays indoors during the day
to escape the cold.

###### Circle City Encounters

Each day the adventurers are in Circle City, roll 2D6 and apply one
of the encounters explained below.

2. Parl Klive: Parl is a local soft-hearted do-gooder who will provide
escapees with food, clothing, advice, and possibly a hiding place.
However, he has very little money. Adventurers who know of Parl’s
existence may locate him with a Streetwise roll, failing with an Effect
of -3 or more means the character is reported to the police.
3. Local Hunting Outfitter: This is someone who is offering Cr500
for each skoggie pelt brought in, and will outfit the expedition with
rifles, supplies, and a ground car.
4. Thugs: 2D6 individuals appear, armed with daggers and wearing
jack. These are members of the local criminal element, and will
attempt to divest the adventurers of any saleable items should a
neutral or unfavorable reaction be rolled. They will not attack if
the adventurers are more numerous or better armed. If a friendly
reaction is rolled, they may help by aiding in the location of a forger
or some contraband material.
5. Friendly Locals: These are a group of local inhabitants who are high
on julis enough not to recognize the players as outsiders, and are
willing to answer questions about Circle City or Keanou in general,

##### KEANOU KKEANOUEANOU

although the information may be a little bit inaccurate. Circle City
has a real problem with drunken behaviour as life there is so boring.
Skoggie hunters and prison guards are a particular problem in the
local drinking establishments. There is a small chance a former
prisoner could be recognized by a guard (throw 12 for this to occur;
on a 10 or 11 an adventurer recognizes a guard, doubtless causing
the party a moment of terror). Adventurers may gamble with locals
or attempt to sell contraband.

6. Obnoxious Locals: 2D non-intoxicated citizens will be encountered,
with several knives, one or two revolvers and perhaps a shotgun
among them. Most natives do not like outsiders and react at - 2. In
case of a brawl the police will turn up sooner or later, depending on
the extent of the commotion, and as likely as not will take the locals’
side in any altercation.
7. Police: Two police appear in a ground car, armed with auto pistols
and wearing cloth; there is an auto rifle in the car. The adventurers
may avoid this encounter if they have a good hiding place like Parl
Klive’s or a sleazy hotel, unless they are wanted for some crime
committed in Circle City itself. Characters encountering the police
must present some sort of identity papers or talk fast, to prevent
themselves from being hauled in. Police usually will not spot forged
identity papers, unless the forgery is a very bad job and may generally
be bribed not to look closely.

If a shootout occurs, the police will pursue the offenders with great
determination.

8. Merchant: This merchant has a free trader with available passenger
space and few scruples regarding the identities of prospective
passengers. The ship is also short of crew, so anyone with a useful
skill will be considered for working passage; the merchant is a
smuggler, and those who sign on could end up back in prison.
9. Sleazy Hotel: Here the adventurers may avoid encounters with
the police for a modest Cr5 a day apiece, with some exceedingly
modest accommodations thrown in. This is also a good place to
look for other criminals and items of an illegal nature, and is the
first place the police would look for someone wanted for a crime
committed recently in Circle City.
10. Patron: This is someone seeking to hire some desperate
criminals to perform a dangerous mission for low wages and a trip
off Keanou. The mission should be something of an illegal nature,
some particularly dangerous mercenary employment, or any other
job which only a desperate individual would accept. The patron has a
ship or guaranteed passage offworld waiting should the adventurers
agree. See _760 Patrons_ for ideas.
11. Geologists: There is a great deal of exploration for unexploited
minerals on Keanou, and quite a few geologists are doing the
exploring. If the adventurers have encountered geologists before,
throw 10+ for this to be the same group.
    12. Unusual Encounter. Roll 1d6 and consult the list below.
    1. Escaped Prisoner: The characters run into another prisoner from
    Tarkwall who has also managed to escape.
    2. Noble: The characters meet a noble, who offers them employment
    on his spice farm.
    3. Prison Visitor: The characters meet one of the regular visitors to
    Tarkwall prison on the streets of Circle City.
    4. Treacherous Patron: The characters meet a patron, as above.
    However, the patron recognizes them as escapees and attempts to
    blackmail them.
    5. Wild Animal: A wild animal has wandered onto the streets of the
    city, and may attack the characters.
    6. Treacherous Prisoner: As Escaped Prisoner above, but the
    prisoner may betray the characters to the authorities.

### SPICE HARVESTING

Gathering the delicate dust-spice is backbreaking work which must
be done with great speed. Once every few years, rainstorms wash
over the mountains east of the desert, causing dry rivers to burst
into life. Soon, these rivers dry up again, and leave a residue of
salt in their beds. This salt is found in a thin clump ten to twenty
centimeters below the surface. Wait too long, and the organic
compounds giving the dust-spice its unique taste decay and the salt
becomes worthless. Harvest too early, and the salt has not had time
to leech the right combination of minerals and organic elements
from the soil. Spice-harvesting must be performed in a window of
only a few weeks, and hundreds of kilometers of river-bed must be
searched in that time.

##### KKEANOUEANOU KEANOU

A spice-labourer’s tools are a hand trowel, a scraper, and a spice
tray. On hands and knees in the cold he crawls along the dry river
bed, turning over the semi-moist soil. Every sod must be overturned,
lest a precious spice nodule be missed. When he finds a clump of
salt, the scraper is used to gather as much pure salt as possible into
the tray. The salt trays are collected at the end of each work shift (or
more often, if the labourers are not trusted by the overseers) and the
salt is then passed through a series of filters to separate the spice
from other material. A pinch of good-quality dust-spice can sell for
over five hundred credits.

The filtered spice is then packed into air-tight containers and brought
under guard back to Circle City. A few months later, once it has had
time to mature, the spice is sold in exclusive markets in Regina and
Rhylanor subsectors.

###### Working on a Spice Farm

If the characters are unlucky enough to be forced to work on a spice
farm, they will suffer greatly. Each day of spice farming requires an
Endurance test. A character who fails suffers 1d6 damage due to
exposure; a character also suffers one point of damage automatically if
he has insufficient water. Those reduced to 0 Endurance are exhausted
and cannot work, and lose one point of Endurance permanently.

A character may attempt to steal spice by making a Deception check.
On a successful check, the character steals 1d6 x 100 credits worth
of dust-spice. If the check is failed, the character is caught by an
overseer and disciplined – in the case of a prisoner, this likely involves
a beating or being forced to go without water for the next day.

###### Typical Spice Farm

For most of the year, the typical spice farm stands almost empty.
There may be a single caretaker or weatherwatcher, who keeps an
eye on the farm and waits for the sudden downpours signalling the
coming of the spice. A good weatherwatcher is worth his weight in
spice – the sooner a spice estate can get labourers to the wadis after
a rainstorm, the better. Some estates have networks of computer-
controlled cameras which automatically send a message when the
rains come. The caretaker’s house and outbuildings (ATV garage,
solar power farm, jonkey stable) are the only parts of the spice farm
in constant use.

The average farm has a large barrack-style sleeping quarters for
the seasonal spice labourers, a filtering shed and a house for any
overseers or other specialists. Some also have more extensive
accommodation for the owner and his family and servants. As
the average spice holding is hundreds of square kilometers in size
(desert land is cheap), a farm can be quite spread out, and prisoners
may be able to live in luxury by breaking into an unoccupied noble’s
holiday villa.

###### Baron Konnen’s Spice Farm

The spice farm of Baron Vilad Konnen is an oddity by local
standards. Most nobles who maintain spice farms only visit

their holdings once every few years, and some never even
bother. Baron Konnen, by contrast, rarely leaves Keanou – he
has interests elsewhere, but prefers the cold air of the desert.
His spice farm is the closest to Tarkwall Prison, but also the
best protected and guarded. In addition to the usual trappings
of a spice farm, Konnen’s farm has a luxurious manor including
extensive gardens, a staff of a dozen servants, and a trio of air/
rafts the baron uses for desert skoggie hunting.

The baron has been troubled by escapees from the prison in the
past, so he has a security cordon around his manor; this cordon
consists of a seismic sensor able to distinguish a human’s footsteps
from those of an animal. Anyone walking on the edges of the baron’s
land will be challenged by a security patrol of two guards and the
baron’s guard, Crull within ten minutes or so, arriving in one of the
air rafts.

The baron occasionally takes pity on prisoners, invites them
into his home, questions them – and then ships them back to
Tarkwall as a favor for Warden Grice. At other times they are
simply locked up and guarded until the prison authorities arrive
to take them back.

### SKOGGIE HUNTING

The skoggie is a four-legged scavenger native to Keanou, similar
to a Terran wildcat. There are two major subspecies, the desert
skoggie and the rarer plains skoggie. The desert skoggie is a more
dangerous animal, and can be partially domesticated and used
as a guard beast. The smaller plains skoggie is best known for its
beautiful pelt, which changes with the seasons. Intact skoggie pelts
sell for up to 1,000 credits offworld.

Traditional skoggie hunting involves a quad bike, an ATV or – for
the richer hunters – a helicopter or air/raft. The trick is then is to
shoot the skoggie in the head or belly, ensuring the valuable pelt
is undamaged. Skoggie packs can be lured using pheromone trails,
but most hunters just watch the watering holes. The plains skoggie
has been hunted to the verge of extinction, and there are plans to
experiment in crossbreeding them with the desert variety to preserve
the subspecies.

###### Skoggie Hunter Settlements

Most skoggie hunters spend up to nine months of the year living
in collapsible shelters, carried on the back of their ATVs, as they
follow the skoggies around the fringes of the desert. Skoggie pelts
are skinned in situ, then dried in the desert sun on transportable
frames. When a hunter has enough pelts, he carries it to one of the
trading posts or to Circle City. Most hunters work alone or in family
groups; they are fiercely independent and refuse any attempts to
organise them into a political bloc or to constrain their movements.
Clashes between skoggie hunters and spice farmers are infrequent,
normally occurring when skoggie packs are chased over the delicate
spice beds, with both the animals and the hunters’ vehicles causing
much damage.

##### KEANOU KKEANOUEANOU

###### Hunting Skoggies

A character employed as a skoggie hunter must make a Survival
or Recon roll to find a suitable skoggie pack. Shooting the skoggie
with a hunting rifle is a Difficult (-2) task if the character is to avoid
damaging the skoggie pelt. An undamaged pelt can be sold to a
dealer for up to 500 credits; a damaged pelt is worth half that, at
best. Skoggie statistics are on page 122.

### MINING

In addition to the old mine at Tarkwall, there are half a dozen other
small uranium mines on Keanou, all which are run by the Orion
corporation. Geology teams on ATVs criss-cross the mountainous
regions, looking for more likely mine sites. Keanou is never going
be a rich world, but it does have plenty of unexploited mineral
resources.

### KEANOU WILDLIFE

Keanou is a frigid desert world, and the life forms of the desert
have found their own individual ways of dealing with the cold.
Many are nocturnal, some burrow beneath the surface, and others
have tough skins which retard the evaporation of water and act as
excellent insulation.

###### Minor Vermin

Hogsfly: A fat black-winged beetle. They find human sweat and blood
absolutely delicious, and so infest prisoners in Tarkwall prison. Their
eggs, which they lay in great numbers in springtime, are coated with
a sticky gel which is a painful skin irritant to humans. Especially
bad hogsfly egg infestations can cause sickness and even death in
extreme cases. Attempts to control the hogsfly with chemical sprays
have failed, and the pests seem bound to continue to plague the
prison indefinitely.

Skitcher: The skitcher is a poisonous insect-analogue; an adult
specimen is ten centimeters long and stick-thin. They skitter and
scamper across walls and through cracks like rats. The skitcher has
a poisonous stinger which is extremely potent. A bite from such a
creature reduces a character’s Dexterity by 1d6 for up to eight hours.
They are aggressive when cornered or when their communal nest is
threatened.

Saltworm: Saltworms are found only in the Great Salt Eye, the salt
flats around the Surtsea. They are six-inch long flatworms that flop
around in the salty wastes, feeding on smaller insects. Saltworms
can spray a caustic jet of salt particles at attackers who disturb
them.

###### Flora

Descica: A thin moss growing on the desert fringes and salt
flats, descica webs are extraordinarily efficient at absorbing
moisture from the air – or even from the exposed skin of creatures
unfortunate enough to touch it. A small descica patch is harmless,
but unpleasant, but a large descica growth can dehydrate a skoggie
or even a human.

Julis: Julis is a mild narcotic growing wild in the plains of Keanou. A
julis plant can be sold for 10 credits on the streets of Circle City.

Kactus: A local analogue to the Terran cactus. The moisture of the
kactus plant cannot be consumed by humans without boiling and
straining it first.

Sagitta Thorn: The thick-stemmed sagitta is covered in wickedly
sharp thorns, but if a character crawls under the plant to the tap-
root, he can cut it to obtain a supply of brackish but perfectly
drinkable water.

Scrab: Scrab is a rare fungal growth, found in caves or under rocks in
the southern district of Keanou. In its natural form, it is a brownish
spongy mass. A patch of scrab can be sold for up to 100 credits in
Circle City, but is highly illegal.

Spiceflower: Spiceflowers are a greenish weed which sprout up after
the rains. Their roots drain the same mineral residues needed for
the production of dust-spice, and so they must be cleared as soon
as they sprout by spice labourers.

There are some dangerous animals, but the rumors of every hungry
carnivores waiting to devour unwary escapees have been carefully
nurtured and consistently exaggerated by the prison administration.
Although the desert is mainly flat, some cover is offered those who
wish to escape the cold or hide from scanning eyes.

##### KEANOU KKEANOUEANOU

### OUTSIDE THE PRISON

Once outside the prison, by whatever means, the ex-prisoners must
make their way to Circle City unless they want to remain forever
trapped on Keanou. The surface is arid and forbidding, but thinking
it is lifeless is a great mistake, as it abounds with a large variety
of hidden life. Characters trained in survival should have little
difficulty living in the desert, and even inexperienced but resourceful
adventurers may survive. The cold is severe, and frostbite may result
if the adventurer lacks protection.

Once the desert has been crossed, the adventurers may come to
more hospitable terrain. The mountains have a great abundance
of animal life and of life-sustaining water. Someone could live in
the mountainous areas for quite a while, hiding in some ravine or
mountain valley.

###### Movement

It is important to remember characters without food or water will
slow down and eventually die.

Lack of food will slow characters to half movement in a week,
and no movement at all in two weeks, even if they are of iron
determination.

In the desert, lack of water will cause death within a few days. A
character loses 1D3 Endurance per day without water.

Lack of proper shelter is also a factor. Without proper clothing,
or warmth at night, a character will quickly succumb to exposure,
losing one Endurance per week without survival gear.

It is important to impress on the players these statistics and the
scale of distance they are facing before they attempt a trek across
the desert. Some hints about hunting and methods of acquiring
water may also be in order.

##### KEANOU KEANOU

###### The Keanou System

I – Torsh
A small rocky planetoid, orbiting very close to the sun and rotationally locked. The day side of Torsh is covered in molten rock. It has
significant mineral reserves.

II – Rhives
Another airless rockball, notable for its high albedo which makes it visible from Keanou’s surface at night. It has a single moon.

III – Nao
Nao is larger than Keanou, and has a thick toxic atmosphere. It is used by the scout service as a training ground for missions to hostile
worlds. Nao has four moonlets, one of which (Nao C) was captured recently.

IV – Keanou
The only habitable planet in the system. Keanou is orbited by seven small moons and a ring of metallic dust. The visible moons are named
Argo, Dancer, Jonkeera and Emerald; the other three are too small to be seen under normal conditions.

V – Vora
Vora is the system’s only gas giant, an unremarkable world slightly larger than Saturn. It has a complex set of satellites. A small scout
base is located on the moon of Yar. The base is used for several purposes, such as refurbishing aging scoutships, training missions and
experimentation, the Vora base reports directly to the larger base one parsec away at Inthe (0810 Regina).

VI - Epilogue
The little wandering planet of Epilogue has an eccentric orbit; it spends two hundred and eighty years on the long outer loop of its ellipse-
shaped course, then flashes through the inner system in a two-year pass, during which time it passes between Keanou and Vora and can
be clearly seen at night.

###### UNUSUAL WILDERNESS ENCOUNTER

deposit.
4 Abandoned supply cache, containing food, water and survival gear. Roll 2d6; on an 8+, the cache is trapped.
5 The characters encounter a traveller in the wilderness; a lone hunter, a surveyor, a lost merchant or another
escaped prisoner.
6 Crashed vehicle. The characters come upon the remains of a crashed ATV or flyer, and may salvage 1d6 pieces of
equipment from the remains.

##### PRISONER

# PPRISONERRISONER

You spent several years incarcerated in an Imperial or local detention facility.

Leaving the Prisoner career: A character may not leave or be ejected from this
career due to a mishap. Instead, he has a value called a Parole Threshold. At the
end of each term in the prisoner career, if the character’s Advancement roll is
greater than his Parole Threshold, it means the character’s prison sentence has
come to an end and he may leave this career. Otherwise, he may not leave this
career. Some events alter the character’s Parole Threshold.

A character’s Parole Threshold starts at 4+1d6. A character’s Parole Threshold
cannot go above 12. For every term served the character’s current Parole Threshold
and its maximum limit are decreased by 1.

Anagathics: Characters may not use Anagathics in prison.

Enlistment: Special. One does not ‘enlist’ in prison; you got sentenced there
for a crime you may or may not have committed. At the Referee’s discretion, a
character who suffers a mishap in the Rogue or Drifter career may be sent to the
Prisoner career.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Inmate: You just tried to get through your time in prison without getting into
    trouble.
- Thug: You were part of a gang in prison, terrorising the other inmates.
- Fixer: You could arrange anything – for the right price.

3 Criminal Secrets

###### New Benefit: Criminal Secrets

Your time in prison has allowed you to pick up some rumors or secret knowledge about the criminal fraternity. Pick one of the following
benefits. Each benefit may only be selected once, with the exception of Trade Secrets:

Trade Secrets: Gain any one of the following criminal skills: Deception, Persuade, Mechanic, Melee (any), Engineering (electronics), Stealth
or Streetwise.
Introduction: You are introduced to a criminal overlord. You automatically qualify for the Rogue career at any point, or may gain a criminal
patron during play.
Blackmail Material: You have dirt on an infamous criminal. You may use this to gain a +4 DM to an advancement roll during a term in the
Rogue career, or else use it in the course of play.
Corsair: You know where a corsair base is. The corsairs are always looking for new crew or stolen goods.
Criminal Ally: Gain a new Ally in the criminal sphere.
Treasure Trove: You must have gained a contact or an ally in the prison to take this secret. Your friend dies (lose the contact or ally), but
entrusts you with the secret location of his fortune as he dies. He stole a valuable cargo or item, and buried it on a distant world. Only you
(and maybe his former gangmates) know where it is. The treasure is rumored to be worth several million credits.

### AFTERWORD

After the adventurers have escaped from Keanou, they retain a legacy of their prison days. Should they again run afoul of the law there is
always the possibility they will be identified as escaped convicts, although the danger will diminish with increasing distance from Keanou
and the world on which the original crime was committed. They may find it advisable to acquire false identities if they wish to operate in the
same area. On the positive side a high prison reputation may be useful when dealing with hardened criminals on many worlds.

Finally, it is to be hoped the adventurers will have acquired a healthy sense of caution and will think twice before engaging in any more
blatant illegalities.
