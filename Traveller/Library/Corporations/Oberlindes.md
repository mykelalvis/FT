A 'fledgling' shipping line operating a handful of vessels across [[Regina Subsector|Regina]] and [[Aramis Subsector|Aramis]] subsectors and out into the [[Vargr Extents]], Oberlindes is a family concern which has been known to take in free traders seeking a 'home'. As its operations increase in size, Oberlindes risks treading on the toes of [[Akerut]], which operates in the same areas on a much larger scale.

Owned primarily by [[Marc hault-Oberlindes]]

Trade and transport corporation of the [[Spinward Marches]]. Founded in 487 in the Regina  subsector and still strongest there, Oberlindes has recently expanded its service into many other portions of the Marches and the Vargr Extents.

Oberlindes Lines is a relative newcomer to [[Aramis Subsector|Aramis]], although it has been a family-run transport business since 487. A major force in transport in the Regina subsector, Oberlindes has recently expanded into the [[Aramis subsector]] as a cargo carrier and trader with the [[Vargr]]. Oberlindes operations roughly parallel the operations of [[Akerut]].

Oberlindes Lines hires any qualified personnel.

Oberlindes maintains facilities at [[Paya]]. [[Violante]]. [[Carstan]]. [[Aramanx]], [[Nasemin]], [[Towers]], [[Jesedipere]], and [[Lablon]], its main offices for the subsector are at [[Paya]], although they are in the process of being transferred to [[Aramanx]].
