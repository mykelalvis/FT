There are 24 star systems in the Cronor Subsector, of which only one, [[Quar]], is a member of the Imperium. Quar is the site of both an [[Imperial Navy]] and [[Scout Service]] base even though it is situated within Zhodani territory, a curious situation that came about as a result of treaty negotiations at the end of the Frontier Wars.  Although there is no subsector fleet, the base at [[Quar]] is heavily defended. In peacetime, it is home to a small flotilla of patrol ships that operate in neutral space and some intelligence-gathering vessels. In wartime, the base would probably be used as a forward staging post if it were not quickly eliminated.

The rest of the subsector is either controlled by the [[Zhodani Consulate]] or neutral. The neutral worlds are variously influenced by Imperial and Zhodani policies and sometimes a battleground for overt political manoeuvring or covert action by agents of both sides.  Trade ships from the [[Imperium]] and [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] are also active among these worlds.

Astrographically, there are two main clusters of worlds in the subsector. The five worlds centered on [[Cipango]] are easier to reach from Imperial space than from Consulate holdings in the subsector, as this requires a jump-3 vessel or a roundabout trip through [[Whenge]]. This is not a problem for military ships but does make commercial shipping to this cluster and Zhodani holdings in Jewell more difficult.

The largest grouping of worlds centres on [[Cronor]] (sometimes spelt Chronor by Imperial cartographers), which is the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] capital of the subsector and a major naval base. Cronor has the highest Tech Level and population in the subsector, and is a major economic center. Unsurprisingly, it is also very heavily protected.

There are also important [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] bases at [[Errere]], [[Gesentown]] and [[Cipango]], and major fleet assets are based at these locations. The bases at [[Atsa]], [[Ninjar]] and [[Sheyou]] are much smaller and play host to patrol vessels and couriers that make the run to rimward into the [[Querion subsector]].

The Zhodani border has been stable in this region for centuries, other than some slight readjustments resulting from conflict. Culturally, worlds that are members of the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] have been so for a long time and are entirely comfortable as members. There are also large numbers of people of Zhodani extraction who live on the neutral worlds. These are not part of the Consulate and, in most cases, have never been but are still, for the most part, culturally Zhodani. Imperial visitors often cannot tell the difference between non-Consulate Zhodani and their cousins on the other side of the border.

Other groups, living on the same worlds, are not Zhodani in terms of genetics or culture and this sometimes causes conflict. In other cases the two groups live happily together or remain separate without major difficulties. Each world is different.

To spinward-rimward, stellar density drops off quickly.  The [[Querion subsector]] to rimward is sparse and as a result there is little traffic across this gulf other than official couriers and military vessels.
