Heguz is a dangerously mysterious world in the Scatters. Two colonies have been established on this planet. and each has failed for unexplained reasons, The first had 20,000 citizens in 649, but when a supply ship arrived in 650, no trace of the colony remained. Within a few years the colony was reestablished, only to disappear in the early 9005 with nearly 70,000 inhabitants. Both were formed around large, floating bases of the type often established on water worlds. Large areas of the ocean floor have been searched, but so far no trace of either colony has been found. An investigative team representing another group of prospective colonists, numbering about 500 and based in orbit, is currently studying the world in an attempt to solve its mystery.
