The Kaskii subsector has a low stellar density but a surprisingly high population. With only 24 star systems – the fewest in all of the Core – it is home to the second-highest number of people in the sector, second only to Saregon. Of Kaskii's seven high-population worlds, three are classified as industrial.  Of these, Kaskii and Khuir are models of efficiency; the other, Markasher, is plagued with problems that prevent it from becoming one.

Most worlds in the subsector were barely populated when the Third Imperium was established. It was a barren and desolate place with only a few struggling remnant populations that were left over from the Long Night. There were two reasons why this changed as rapidly as it did. The first was the betrayal of the Wayward Worlds. When 10 systems from the original Sylean Federation refused to join the fledgling Third Imperium, the Syleans expanded their presence to trailing of [[Capital]]. The second was the desire of the Syleans to build a cultural legacy, which they felt they could only do if there were significantly more Syleans and more worlds on which they had an enduring presence. While they were instrumental in the founding of the Imperium, the Syleans were a tiny minority at its outset. They embarked upon an aggressive population expansion project, the fruit of which may be seen in the Kaskii subsector today. Sylean families were encouraged to be fruitful and multiply, which they did with great alacrity, so much so that there are now over 48 billion Syleans in the subsector.

The Sylean Worlds are thought to be like any other Imperial worlds until one visits them. Travellers often note that when they make the jump into the worlds of the cultural zone, they feel as if they have left the Imperium for a foreign polity. Others say that it is more like going through a time warp, either to a distant past when technology was not so prevalent or to a utopian future, in which there is no military presence. The cultural zone does in fact have many high-tech worlds but the Syleans are understated when it comes to technology. A key tenet of their culture is that technology is best when it is seamlessly integrated into things. Flashy tech takes away from more important things in life like quiet contemplation, religious worship, industriousness and family. Despite the Syleans being devoted to the Imperium as much as anyone else, one rarely sees the Imperial Sunburst or similar iconography within its borders. What one does see is a devotion to culture. The art, architecture, religions, style of dress and dominant philosophies of the Sylean Worlds are distinctly different than those seen outside the boundaries of the cultural region. Within these borders, the Syleans are allowed to be Syleans.

There are no navy or scout bases within its borders, except on two worlds: [[Capital]] and Yirsh Poy, both of which are in the Core subsector. The defense of the cultural region is left to external star systems along its borders. It was not always this way. The Sylean Worlds were as heavily militarised as any other Imperial world up until the end of the Civil War. The Emperors of the Flag made the Core and Kaskii subsectors their own private war zone. The Sylean leaders allowed the Moot to declare the region an autonomous state in order to prevent the war from spreading to the rest of the Imperium. After the war ended and Arbellatra was declared Regent, the leadership of the Sylean Worlds held a conference on Khuir, where they decided as a group that they would never be used in such a way again. Sylea, they declared, was instrumental in the formation of the Imperium and it had been equally important for its preservation. From then on, it would become a place of peace.

Because of the demilitarization of the cultural zone, Kaskii has few military bases. There is only one scout base and three navy bases. The Imperial Navy's 4th Fleet is concentrated on few worlds but has an active presence in the subsector. Its personnel are by regulation over three quarters Sylean and each of its ships are given traditional Sylean names above the banner of Kaskii, a trio of three crimson Imperial sunbursts. The sunbursts represent 'The Belt of Cleon,' a constellation of red giants visible just to coreward, the stars of the
Uungip, Kuuir Am and Kishkeiim systems.

The jury is still out on the Kaskii experiment. While the Syleans certainly demonstrated they could tame a barren wasteland, make its worlds prosperous and whole, and populate them, there is still the question of what they were trying to prove and to whom. The Wayward Worlds have long since been annexed and with the expansion of the Imperium to 11,000 worlds, the Syleans remain a relatively tiny minority. The debate rages on among historians. While some dismiss the Sylean Worlds as a civilization borne from a fit of pique, others applaud them for expanding their presence, thereby ensuring their place in history.

> [note]+ The Chasmata Sylea
> Kaskii has two stellar chasms, one to coreward that averages three parsecs in width and another to rimward that runs four to six parsecs wide. The two are collectively known as the Chasmata Sylea; the smaller called Chasma Sylea Minor and the larger Chasma Sylea Major. In frontier sectors, such as the Spinward Marches, stellar voids like these are simply seen as an impediment, an inconvenient absence of stars that one must circumnavigate. In sectors like the Core, these regions present a threat to the security of the empire.
>
> In 1056, Solomani supremacists built a secret deep-space outpost one parsec from the Riid Irman system. The Solomani had acquired several large planetoids from the Riid Irman belt and took them into the Chasma Sylea Major using disposable jump drives. They intended to accelerate the planetoids to near-relativistic speeds to impact on Sevan, thereby destroying the world. While the Solomani did everything they could to maintain the secrecy of their mission, Imperial Naval Intelligence agents intercepted them in the Shashuua system and prevented the catastrophic event from happening. The Imperium had long feared that terrorists or insurgent organizations might try something like this, perhaps with [[Capital]] itself as the target. The event resulted in the immediate funding of Project Shortbow, which is intended to prevent an attack like this from happening.
>
> Because of the threat to security that the Chasmata present, these deep-space regions and others like them are regularly patrolled by the Imperial Navy and Scout Service. The Imperium has placed dozens of refuelling caches and space stations in many of the empty parsecs of the Chasmata, although their exact location is a state secret. Travelling into stellar voids is tricky business. Jump technology relies on the presence of large gravity wells that are used by astrogators to plot their courses; these are obviously lacking in deep space. Generally speaking, if one wants to actually find an object that has been planted in the empty depths of space, it must be equipped with a communications device that broadcasts its location, lest it be lost. For this reason, bases emplaced in the Chasmata are equipped with sophisticated equipment that makes them easy to find if one knows where to look.
>
> The methods used to patrol the chasms are not perfect but until Project Shortbow goes online, they will have to do. Along with the diligent work of the Imperial intelligence agencies, they have thus far averted a major catastrophe from taking place. Meanwhile, the Imperial Navy has catalogued thousands of deep space objects within the Chasmata, the locations of which are classified.
