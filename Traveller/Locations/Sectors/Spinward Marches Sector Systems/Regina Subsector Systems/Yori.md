(C560757-A)
ri is a desert world lying on a spur of the [[Spinward Main]]. Whilst not on the main trade routes, it receives large numbers of visitors due to finds of Ancients artefacts. Most suspected Ancients sites are off-limits to casual visitors but permits for legitimate research or scholarly visits can be obtained. There are also numerous museums displaying local finds and general information about the Ancients. In addition, Yori has become a center for the antiquities trade, with dealers from fields having a presence there. Much of this activity has nothing to do with the Ancients but grew to take advantage of their presence.

A decent set of jump-2 links and significant population movements through its starport make Yori an excellent choice for a Zhodani intelligence hub. So many different people visit the Ancients museums that cover stories are easy to concoct, especially as many visitors are from fringe groups fond of conspiracy stories about the Ancients. The fact that a significant proportion of these people engage in activities that look a little suspicious makes the task of Imperial intelligence agencies even harder. They have managed to identify part of a Zhodani spy ring but do not know how or by what route information is transferred out of the Imperium and eventually to Zhodani intelligence analysts.

# YORI

Yori is a rich desert world with no free-standing water. This world
contains an archaeological site with artefacts suspected to be from
the now-vanished Ancients. This world has the Imperial Research
Station Beta for the Sector. It is a member of Third Imperium in the
Regina Subsector of Spinward Marches Sector and in the Domain of
Deneb. Yori, as a member world of the Third Imperium, holds the
estate of an Imperial knight and the fiefdom of a baron. Both are
members of the Imperial Nobility charged with overseeing the
world. This is the home world to Zhurphani, a Minor Race. They are
60% of the world’s population.

# THE ZURPHANI

The native species of Yori are the Zurphani or Zerphs to the local
humans. A typical adult Zerph is roughly two meters tall and can
range in body weight from forty kilos to an impressive one hundred
and fifty. They are bipedal creatures with muscular arms and legs
ending in six fingers and toes. The Zerph hand is extremely flexible
meaning they do not have the need of thumbs. The Zerph look
reptilian due to their insulated and armoured skin which has
evolved specifically to conserve moisture and protect them from the
blasting heat, their two eyes can see into the infrared and their
hearing and smell is extremely sensitive. During their prehistory
they evolved into a three-sex race with male, female and warrior,
the warriors being both male and female. Warriors reproduce
warriors and both partners in a coupling bear children. Traditionally
warriors would hunt, protect and fight for their clan territory and as


the planet dried up the important water supplies while the males
and females would build and farm. The males and females also form
the leadership with appointment based on technical skill or
accomplishments.

At some point in the distant past Yori’s climate began to change
and the tech level eleven society had to adapt to increasing
temperatures and decreasing water supplies, at this time there were
several major wars over resources and the eventual decline and
retreat to a subsurface society.

# POPULATION

Currently there are around twelve million Zurphani on Yori and
probably around another five million scattered around the Marches.
Zurphani warriors have made a name for themselves as mercenaries
being able to adapt to most climates and gravities but particularly
for combat in dry environments. There is a long tradition of off
world military service both as freelancers and for the Imperium,
warrior Zurph respect strong leadership and combat prowess and
have been known to follow respected leaders into unwinnable
battles conversely, they are also known for beheading unpopular
ones.

The clan system is still very strong and Zurph city hives and
territories are fiercely protected by their warriors, each city hive is
usually built around an underground aquifer or supply of water
which enables the farming of native vegetables and grains plus
keeps the limited industries operating. Zurphs are vegetarian and
can digest most plant materials but are most fond of their native
staples spiced with blistering hot Yori Peppers. Any food crops


grown on Yori are remnants of a time when the planet was a lot
wetter, so the seeds and genetic material are precious to the
natives. The Zurph hydroponic technology is especially efficient,
becoming a major source of off world income.

# GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY

Each city hive is governed by a council of elders representing each
of the technical guilds, currently there are eleven guilds ranging
from the growers to the infotech guild, warriors are not represented
in government and are seen as a tool of the city state as they also
provide policing as well as the military, like any society there are a
range of crimes and misdemeanours but the most common is
conflict between families or smaller clans over property both
physical and intellectual and contractual obligations, these can
sometimes lead to the engaging of warriors to sort out issues with
violence, this has been illegal for some years but still goes on. Great
houses and clans have warrior security as part of the house staff or
clan military forces, but city councils have gone to great lengths to
ensure peaceful resolution and avoiding bloodshed. Conflict
between city hives however is another matter with several ongoing
skirmishes over territory happening at any given time.

Typical Zurph military action involves long range wheeled and
tracked vehicles slugging it out before assaults on city hive facilities.
Air power is limited to fast and light reconnaissance drones with
very few manned aircraft, this is probably due to the proliferation of
effective ground to air missile systems making just about any
aircraft redundant in combat. Zurphs are masters of mobile desert
warfare and their weapons systems reflect the long range nature of
this kind of conflict however they are also vicious in close combat


having learnt their trade in the underground warrens of the city
hives.

# SOCIETY AND CUSTOMS

A Zurph city is much like any other, citizens wear a variety of
clothing styles and colours, shops are gaudily decorated, house
colours dominate with lots of rich reds, blues and yellows. The
warriors stick out from the rest of the population being both bigger
and usually wearing camouflaged coveralls with rank and house
badges decorating them. Carrying weapons in a city hive is illegal
and will usually result in a run in with the council police. Zurphani
media and entertainment is still running at around tech level ten
and consists of the usual range of music, television and movies- a
common movie theme is one of the houseless warriors on the quest
for redemption.

Humans are usually welcome in Zurph city hives however this will
depend on if they have aligned themselves with another city hive
that is currently in opposition. Being neutral is the best idea if you
want to safely survive in the Zurph underground. Humans will also
find the lighting particularly dim and suited to the more sensitive
Zurph eyes. The food is always vegetarian and is digestible by
humans however the spices and toppings used are extremely hot to
the point where they can do some serious damage- eating a Zurph
green curry can be compared to an assault with capsicum spray or
mace.

# HUMANS ON YORI


The first humans were settled on Yori around 118 by the Imperial
Navy who at the time was relocating belligerent populations during
is pacification of the region. The original thirty-two thousand
“refugees” were given supplies and support to begin developing
Yori Startown as an agricultural and agrarian settlement with a basic
starport. Early on the settlers had initial contact with the Zurphani in
the form of raiding parties looking for rival trading caravans, the
humans having settled nowhere near an aquifer or water supply and
in unclaimed territory left the bemused Zurphs wondering who and
what these new crazy creatures were up to. The next three hundred
years saw steady but slow population growth with little contact with
the rest of the Imperium and with only the occasional Zurph visit
but this changed in 554 with the arrival of Sir Verilian Balstic , and
the declaration that Yori was now a fiefdom of the Baron Dupleiss
based on Regina.

# EXPLOITATION

Verillian’s task was to commercialise the planet, especially the
massive salt flats of the dried-up seas where surveyors had found
particularly pure and unusually flavoured pink salt. The Balstic family
had been in the spice and luxury goods trade for generations and
having Yori as an asset gave it access to markets reaching as far as
the Imperial Palace. The preferred method of harvesting salt was
through massive tracked refinery platforms that slowly made their
way through the seabeds scraping the top layer of rich salt then
purifying it on board ready for despatch to orbit via onboard mass
driver. Infrastructure and support services for the new enterprise as
well as a substantial estate for Sir Verillian was setup in the new city
of Davinci. The platforms are massive machines nearly five hundred
meters wide and eight hundred meters long with over one hundred


crew and capable of launching nearly five hundred tons of pure Yori
Pink into orbit every day for pickup by bulk freighter. The three
platforms between them can fill one five-thousand-ton bulk carrier
per week. Originally these carriers were limited to jump one forcing
them to take the dangerous Spinward Main route through to
Regina but a redesign of the standard freighter after the loss of
several cargoes to pirates, enabled a direct jump two route to the
processing and packaging centres at Regina High. Recently there
has been an increase in the black market or grey export of Yori Pink
in an attempt to break the monopoly of the Balstic family.

# CONFLICT

As the mining operation moved closer to traditional Zurphani lands
they came into conflict with the clans that owned them. After three
hundred years of mining the giant machines had encroached too far
and in 897 a three-clan raiding party assaulted and captured a rig in
the Great Central Salt Sea claiming it as joint clan property. After
several months of negotiation, it was decided to attempt a hostage
rescue via orbital assault. It ended badly with the Zurphani shooting
down several dropships and then detonating demolition charges on
the platform. The crew were staked out in the desert and left to
bake in the sun with the vision broadcast live around the planet. The
subsequent eight year conflict between Balstic mercenaries and the
three clans claimed thousands of lives, the human side lost mainly
soldiers but the Zurphani civilian casualties from city hive raids were
extensive. In 903 the Imperial Navy stepped in and forced a
ceasefire by blockading the planet and threatening to bombard
both the remaining platforms and the Zurphani military installations
from orbit. Currently tensions are still high between the three
Central Salt Sea Clans and the Balstic family but payments to the
clans have seen some much needed off world credits injected into
the Zurphani economy.


Currently there are two mercenary companies employed by the
Balstic family that provide security to the platforms. They are
equipped to around tech level 11 and are heavy on light armoured
grav vehicles giving them the ability to cover the vast areas needed
to ensure the safety of the platform operations. The Zurphani are
masters of both physical camouflage and multispectral camouflage
which makes their vehicles extremely difficult to target and even
with the armistice their are rogue elements within the clans that will
raid unwary humans.

# DAVINCI

Davinci, Yori Satrtown and Bartolow Green detail map showing the
green zones and the Lambert Sink Well as well as the major features
of the human colonised areas.

Similar to Zurphani structures, the city of Davinci and its two million
inhabitants tend to build down rather than up. The tallest buildings
are only four or five stories tall and reflect the need to keep out of
the heat. Technology has enabled the extraction of water from
underground and the atmosphere, the almost unlimited power from
solar and fusion has guaranteed good supplies from cracking the
surface soil and extracting the hydrogen and oxygen. The area
around Davinci and the city itself is green and lush through the
planting of gene modified crops and decorative trees making it an
oasis in the vast desert.

The tallest building on Yori is the mining operations control centre
which reaches a full six stories and houses the technical and
operational support for the platforms. Local security provided by
the Balstic company police and is relatively loose however there is
extensive remote monitoring of the populous similar to Regina.


Most of the citizens living in Davinci are involved in the salt trade
either directly or indirectly however there is a thriving
manufacturing sector that specialises in high efficiency solar panels
and desert proofing of equipment. There is constant trade with the
Zurphani clans to the East and large caravans of desert cargo rovers
come and go on a weekly basis. These caravans are occasionally
raided in the deep desert by rebel clans so there is constant work
for security teams willing ride shotgun.

To the west of the city is the massive Lambert Sink Well which
started as one of the largest open cut mines in the sector. When the
prices of minerals crashed as supply outstripped demand the mine
was decommissioned and left. The locals had the idea to continue
the digging into what they knew was a large aquifer freeing up
enough water to make a substantial lake at the bottom of the pit.
Now it is a major attraction for sailing and water sports as well as
supplying water for irrigation and drinking. There are several resorts
dotted around its shores as well as some excellent wine growing
and vineyards.

There is currently a maglev line that connects Yori Startown with
Davinci, the four hour journey is cheap and cheerful with the train
being mostly used for goods and vehicles rather than passengers.
Most locals will put their personal vehicles on the train so they can
use them when they get to their destination.

# RESERCH STATION BETA

The Imperium has set up a network of research stations across
human space each one tasked with investigating a specific line of
research. It might be jump drives, psionics, artificial intelligence or
advanced materials. In the case of Research Station Beta it is faster
than light communications (FTL), the holy grail of the Imperials. FTL


communications would enable the Imperial government to
governing realtime, currently the fastest a message can travel from
the capital to Regina in the Spaniard Marches is around thirty weeks
with a jump six fast fleet courier, via x-boat it would be nearly ninety
weeks or over one and a half years. Given this having the ability to
send data instantly would change everything.
