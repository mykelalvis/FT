Primitive, Low-tech, and High-tech can interchanged/used at -2, but Military/Heavy and Gunnery are not [[#Cross Skilled]] without the subclassification.  [[#Gunnery (Ship's Weapons)]] is a paid station on a ship.

Note that shoot _specializations_ (as stunts, once you have the classification), offer the standard +2.  As with other specializations, another one costs 1 stunt.
