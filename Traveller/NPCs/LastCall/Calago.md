## Calago

Calago is a chimera, the product of a lab experiment in the distant Julian Protectorate to create a human/Hhkar hybrid. Calago was living in the streets of a world in the Lishun sector as a youth and adopted by [[Zashe]]. He is loyal to his adoptive mother but gets into trouble from time-to-time, causing her a great deal of stress.
