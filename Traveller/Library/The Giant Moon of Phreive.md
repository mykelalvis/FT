# The Giant Moon of Phreive

Phreive is a gas giant lying in the far outsystem, and thus of little interest to most starfarers. Those who wish to skim fuel tend to use one of the inner giants since the transit times to the mainworld are much shorter. Phreive might occasionally be visited by ships making a long transit using skimmed fuel, but even then an inner gas giant is often preferred since a ship this far out in the system is beyond rescue if something goes wrong. Outsystem giants like Phreive are typically only skimmed by ships making a covert transit or wishing to avoid other traffic. This makes it difficult to estimate how much traffic passes by. The most likely figure is none, or almost none.

Phreive falls into the ‘large gas giant’ category, but is fairly small by those standards. It has only three moons, of which two are tiny rockballs in highly eccentric orbits. They may be captured comets, or could have been perturbed out of a more normal orbit by their much larger companion. Noted in the starcharts only as Phreive’s Moon, the giant moon is officially noted as a hazard to navigation. Its surface gravity is almost 2G, making it impossible for some starships to take off again if they land for whatever reason. A Thrust 2-capable ship would struggle to regain orbit, and would be at risk from the atmospheric conditions as it did so.


Phreive’s Moon, unsurprisingly, has a dense atmosphere of methane and other unbreathable gases. It is also highly volcanic, and the combination of heat escaping from the core and a thick blanket of gas ensures that the surface temperature varies from warm to dangerously hot. Given the moon’s distance from the system’s star this might come as a surprise to unwary Travellers. The high variance in temperature gives rise to violent atmospheric currents and eddies, some of which can become storms that persist for months on end.


There is no official data available on the surface or conditions there, and visual surveys are difficult due to the opaque atmosphere. Radar mapping would work reasonably well, but cannot determine for certain if a landing site is safe. Despite these difficulties, there are rumours that an expedition was launched to Phreive’s Moon, returning with strange artefacts that sold for a fortune to collectors. According to those who claim they know for sure, these artefacts were not produced by the Ancients but by a completely different culture and technology. If they were made by a vanished high-gravity dwelling race, it is possible that this species might have evaded discovery simply because humans tend not to visit such worlds.


Whatever the truth of it, Phreive’s Moon is a dangerous place to visit or to search for artefacts that may or may not be there. A ship’s internal gravity field could maintain a comfortable resting environment, but working outside would be difficult and dangerous. Even small dips and bumps would endanger a vehicle, and getting stuck would be a constant hazard. However, there seem to be those who think it is worth the risk – there are records of several follow-up expeditions after the first, though there are no records of any finds made nor the fate of the expedition.
