Dr. Bledsoe's specialty is the science of psionics. While she is not a psionic herself, she is an expert in the theory and practice of using psionic talents.

Formerly a professor at the University of Tobia, Bledsoe has been stationed at Research Station Delta on Dostoevsky for over a decade. She has been studying psionically sensitive artifacts at the planet's Ancients site.

After possible evidence of an Ancients site was found on the planet Tktk, Bledsoe built a team to investigate the site and verify its validity. The team consists of scientists from the research station, members of the psionics, archaeology, paleontology, and geology faculties from the University of Tobia, and a droyne delegation from Ayldem.
