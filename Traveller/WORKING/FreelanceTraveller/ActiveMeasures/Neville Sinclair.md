Neville Sinclair

 profiled by Peter Newman

Baron Sir Neville Saint John Worthington haut Sinclair  
Baron Miigashkushkur (Ley 0504 B000511-C),  
Member O.I.H., KCGOI (Knight Grand Cross Order of Illelish),  
Commander Imperial Navy (Gunnery) Retired, MCUF, PH x2

Sinclair is a 44 year old (in 1002) ethnically Solomani Human who is 170 cm tall and has long red hair. He is very charming and persuasive.

Neville is the second son of Baroness (Dowager) Miigashkushkur and has ascended to the title following his mothers health related retirement at the most recent Moot Meeting. (His older brother Malcolm renounced his claim to the title after converting to Islam on Terra.) Neville is an (adoptive) member of the Imperial Household itself and is currently 436th in line for the Imperial Throne

Neville was graduated from university with a BA in Languages and Modern Cultures and a Naval ROTC Commission. He served 20 years in the Navy's Gunnery Branch and served in the Solomani Rim War. In accordance with the Imperial Official Secrets Act this biographer can neither confirm nor deny that the ethically Solomani Neville, who is intimately familiar with Solomani culture and speaks unaccented Confederation Anglic, completed any espionage related missions during the war.

Neville was discharged in the Spinward Marches and became a crew member of an armed merchant ship. Later he served as Chairman of the Board of that company after they acquired two more ships and a Mercenaries license. Neville met his future wife, the niece of Baron Wypoc, during his travels and they were married at Regina in a wedding that was _the_ social event of the year for the sector.

Following the attempted coup on Regina, Neville, under orders from the Emperor's Great Uncle, an Imperial Grand Duke who is rumored to serve in the _[Not Available at this Clearance Level]_, acted to apprehend and punish the perpetrators. He and his shipmates personally saved the day when terrorists attacked the Sector Moot meeting. Neville, acting under a Ducal Imperial Warrant (See Edict 97 &101) then left Regina, but not before making an Imperially famous speech (correctly) implying Zhodani complicity in this attack.

Following the capture of their ship, and accusations of Espionage by a Federation of Arden planetary government, Neville blew up their Highport's main fusion generator with a Meson Gun and the party escaped back to Regina. Shortly following these events the Duke of Regina was recalled to Capitol for an (unfriendly) audience with the Emperor, following which the Duke reigned for "health" related reasons.

Neville is a noted author whose first monograph, an analysis of the possibility of the Zhodani attacking the Imperium while their efforts are focused on the Solomani, has sold several hundred million copies. He is working on a book about the Hiver. He has no children yet but he and his wife are planning on having a family.
