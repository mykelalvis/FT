The Federation of Arden are based on the world of [[Arden]] in the [[Vilis subsector]]. Arden is controlled by the Arden Society who created the Federation by networking a number of businesses and shipping lines. Individuals in the Arden Society have made substantial financial and labour contributions to make the Federation a growing success.

The Federation works by investing in existing industrial operations, usually small facilities on independent worlds. By bringing new technology and the expertise of their people, the Federation can increase productivity and therefore boost the local economy. This allows them to drive competitors out of business, slowly making the planetary economy reliant on facilities run by the Federation of Arden.

This business strategy is proving very successful. The Federation of Arden already controls [[Utoland]] and is also having a great influence on [[Zircon]], giving them a strong foothold in the [[Jewell Subsector]].

Although both the [[Imperium]] and the [[Zhodani]] Consulate tolerate the Federation, the [[Imperium]] has become increasingly concerned as the Federation seems to be exerting more influence over the neutral worlds in the [[Jewell Subsector]].


#### The Federation of Arden

The Federation of Arden does not, technically, exist.

[[Arden]] is one of several independent worlds lying between the Imperial/Zhodani border that have been influenced by both powers over the centuries. In recent years, Arden has proposed a local defence association among nearby worlds with a view to creating a formal alliance neutral to both Zhodani and Imperial interests.

Although this idea has not been met with great enthusiasm, a number of political pressure groups, businesses and minor shipping lines have recently begun making a lot of noise about a Federation of Arden. Exactly what is meant by this term depends on who is using it. It is often used to describe a loose alliance of businesses and groups attached to the political coat-tails of Arden.

There are those who predict that some kind of trade or even military alliance may emerge in time. This would require other governments to sign up, which does not seem imminently likely. It is probable that the whole thing is just talk but the Federation of Arden has now passed into common use in the surrounding region. Time will tell what form the Federation eventually takes.
