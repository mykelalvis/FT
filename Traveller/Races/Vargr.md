# Vargr in the Marches

Vargr are the second most common species in the [[Imperium]], especially at the coreward end of Imperial space. Most worlds in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] have a mixed human/Vargr population, although humans are prevalent.  On a few worlds, the minority Vargr are second-class citizens or live in separate communities but, for the most part, humans and Vargr live in the same streets and apartment blocks, work alongside and are entirely familiar with one another.

Imperial Vargr are just that; Imperial citizens like anyone else, and seen as a-person-from-[[Regina]], for example, rather than an alien. They tend to display Imperial cultural influences or follow the culture of their homeworld, just like anyone else.

Non-Imperial Vargr, from the Extents, come from different cultures, one of many that exist in the region.  They have different habits and values to Imperial Vargr, depending on their origins. There are no large Vargr states in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and no monolithic power structure in the Extents. Local politics are vigorous at times and governments can change on a short time frame, making cross-border politics somewhat interesting.

Vargr of all origins show their pack-animal roots in a tendency to gravitate to individuals or ideas with charisma. Charisma is hard to define in this context; each individual Vargr has his own idea of what constitutes a worthy cause or leader. Status and recognition tend to be more important to Vargr than in humans, especially if it comes from someone the Vargr admires or respects.

Contrary to stereotypes, Vargr are not flighty in their allegiances. They may transfer loyalty from one leader to another if he has sufficient charisma, however this is not done lightly. It is usually considered a natural consequence of meeting a more charismatic leader, rather than betrayal if a Vargr leaves his old allegiance.  However, this does not mean a Vargr naval officer will switch sides at the drop of a hat. Charisma is a factor but there are many others to be considered; demonstrating loyalty to a leader is a charismatic act in its own right.

Vargr trade boats from the Extents can be encountered all over [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], especially in the coreward-trailing corner of the sector. Unfortunately, so can corsairs.  Raiding is considered a more honorable profession by Vargr than humans and some states of the Extents actively encourage it, though most Imperial Vargr are less accepting of raiding and piracy.

# VARGR

Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted
by the Ancients, a fact the Vargr are extremely proud
of. They are often seen by other races as aggressive
pirates and scavengers but Vargr have a diverse culture
deeply rooted in pack mentality and the desire for
companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant
struggle for leadership results in a culture fuelled by
conflict and change.

Governments in the Vargr Extents (the area of space
dominated by Vargr) continually rise and fall, borders
move and allegiances change. Life here is turbulent and
dangerous – the Imperium considers all worlds in the
Extents to be Amber Zones unless proven otherwise,
with many designated as Red Zones.

There are few human worlds in the Extents and few
Vargr worlds within the Imperium but both races
coexist in these regions of space. Humans and Vargr
have had a chequered history – a number of wars have
been fought with these two races fighting against, as
well as alongside, each other. However, most conflicts
between them occur on the border worlds where Vargr
empires seek to expand their borders and corsair
raiders attack indiscriminately.

It has been nearly 500 years since the last major
conflict occurred between humans and Vargr. Although
relations since then have been relatively peaceful, the
Vargr are an unpredictable race that embraces conflict;
it is perhaps inevitable that these traits will one day
lead to new hostilities.

## PHYSIOLOGY

Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser stock;
genetically engineered by the Ancients circa –300,000
from the genus _Canis_ and transplanted from Terra to
Lair/Grnouf in the Provence sector. Although Vargr were
artificially developed, a certain amount of evolution and
natural selection took place as the species adapted to
the conditions on Lair without further manipulation by
the Ancients.

Male Vargr typically are 60 kilograms in mass and
stand 1.6 meters high. Females tend to be smaller and
average 1.5 meters in height and 55 kilograms in mass.

Map showing position of Vargr Extents in relation to Imperium and Consulate.

Vargr bear a close resemblance to their canine
ancestry, as can be seen by their muzzle, tail and fur.
The latter covers their entire body and can be found
in a variety of colours. The most common colour is
grey but it is not uncommon to see Vargr with brown,
black or even red fur. Fur colour is partly determined
by climate with those from colder regions displaying
a greater variety of colours than those from warmer
areas. Parents from different climates will see offspring
having patterned fur with the stronger bloodline being
the most dominant colour. Tail characteristics such as
length and bushiness also vary greatly between Vargr
from different ethnic backgrounds.

Several anatomical modifications were made by the
Ancients to the canine body structure, the most
significant being stance, forepaws and muzzle. Vargr
adopt a digitigrade stance (putting weight on their
toes rather than the soles of their feet) and many
have a slight stoop although most Vargr would call it
a 'relaxed stance'. Vargr hands are similar in size and
functionality to human hands but the internal structure
is quite different and unique to Vargr. Muzzles are
shorter than that of their canine ancestors, largely due
to dietary considerations.

Three hundred thousand years of evolution on Lair
resulted in the Vargr adapting to the 26 hour rotation
of their homeworld and this circadian rhythm is shared
by all Vargr. However, Vargr remain extremely flexible in
their sleeping habits, adopting a polyurnal sleep pattern
where they prefer to sleep several times a day for short
periods rather than one single long sleep period. Vargr
will adapt their sleeping habits to their circumstances
but will typically sleep after meals or through
particularly hot or cold periods in the local climate.

The Vargr gestation period is usually four months. Most
litters have two young but litters with as many as five
pups have been known. Pups are born blind and deaf,
completely reliant on their parents to care for them for
the first four months until their senses develop. Vargr
females are able to conceive soon after giving birth but
will rarely do so until their pups are old enough to take
care of themselves, around the age of six.

Vargr share the same senses as humans but they tend
to be more acute. Olfactory receptors develop very
quickly to compensate for a pup's lack of sight and
sound, resulting in a keen sense of smell that Vargr
use to recognize each other. Vargr hearing is also much
better than a human's, able to detect a greater range
of frequencies over longer distances; humans are more
sensitive to low frequencies and Vargr are able to hear
high frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans.
Vargr eyesight is sharp but less sensitive to colour than
human eyes and less effective in dark conditions.

### Lifespan

Vargr living in industrial areas usually live for 65 to
75 years. Pre-industrial Vargr have a shorter lifespan
due to poor living or environmental conditions and lack
of medical advances. The lifespan for Vargr in higher
technological cultures increases with advancements in
anagathics and medical treatment.

### Diet

Vargr are a carnivorous species with the bulk of their
diet being fresh, raw meat. Uncooked fruits and fruit-based drinks are also popular amongst Vargr but lack
the nourishment needed for a healthy lifestyle. Vargr
metabolism is faster and more efficient than the human
digestive system, meaning that Vargr eat more frequently
but are able to fast for longer periods if necessary.

Although Vargr adapted to conditions on Lair and the
indigenous wildlife was edible, it was not as appetising
as the meats that canines had become accustomed
to on Terra. Vargr chefs spent much time and effort to
find herbs, spices and seasoning that make food on
Lair more appealing and gourmets developed these into
sauces and dressings to further enhance Vargr meals.

Selective breeding of livestock was undertaken to improve
local food and make it more appetising. This practice
continues today on many Vargr worlds and comprises
much of the interstellar trade within the Extents.

### Subspecies

A little known fact to most outsiders is the number of
Vargr subspecies that exist within the Extents. Most
ethnic minorities were seen as deviations from the
'perfected' Vargr race developed by the Ancients and
became the victims of prejudice and racial abuse that
prompted many to leave Vargr society and settle in
the unpopulated regions of Vargr space. Most of these
subspecies remain unknown to the Imperium and even
Vargr knowledge is limited since the subspecies were
outcast from society so long ago.

#### Urzaeng

The Urzaeng are one of the few subspecies
known to the Imperium and the only subspecies not
outcast by Vargr society due to their superior physical
prowess. Urzaeng average 1.85 meters in height and
weigh 70 kilograms. They are more powerfully built than
the average human and physically a match for Aslan.
The Urzaeng were originally bred by the Ancients for
heavy labour and combat so their increased physical
prowess comes at a cost to their mental characteristics;
this has resulted in the Urzaeng being a naturally violent
people with contempt for weakness.

#### Kokasha

The Kokasha are all but extinct now and those
that remain live in a refuge in Rukhs Dall (known as
the Trenchans sector in the Imperium). They are the
smallest of the subspecies and were engineered by the
Ancients to have heightened mental faculties at the
expense of physical attributes. Kokasha are typically
1.45 meters high and weigh 50 kilograms. Females are
slightly smaller, averaging 1.4 meters high and weighing
45 kilograms.

### Akumgeda

Like most other subspecies, the Akumgeda
fled Lair after their people were ostracised by the rest
of the Vargr population. The Akumgeda settled on a
number of worlds in the Ksinanirz sector and although
some of these settlements still exist, many of the packs
reintegrated with their brethren as the Vargr expanded
throughout the Extents.

The Akumgeda appear much like normal Vargr but tend
to have spotted fur. Although unusual, spots are not
unknown and the Akumgeda found it easy to blend in
with 'normal' Vargr. What set the Akumgeda apart was
their strong psionic ability and some postulate that the
Vargr only developed psionic powers after the Akumgeda
reintegrated with their society.

### Nakagun

This outcast subspecies lives in exile in the
Nakagun sector and are known to possess strange
psionic powers. Males and females are similar in
size averaging 1.5 meters in height and weighing 55
kilograms. Little else is known of this group since they
fled from Lair over a 1,000 years ago.

### Roth Thokken

This subspecies settled in the Angfutsag
sector and although they look similar to the Nakagun,
they are even more peculiar. Their psionic powers are
said to be even stranger and more powerful. Further to
this, all Roth Thokken are permanently blind from birth.
This superstitious group live in seclusion and are known
to perform bizarre rituals using psionic senses unknown
to anyone outside their group.

## SOCIETY

The Vargr are a dynamic people, their governments
and businesses constantly changing with the loyalties
and goals of individual Vargr. Many humans see this as
anarchic but this is not the case at all. Vargr society is
deeply rooted in charisma, loyalty, racial pride and the
need for companionship and approval.

### Genetic Instinct

In addition to many of the physical features of their
canine ancestors, the Vargr have also inherited some
behavioural traits as well; few Vargr are aware of how
deeply rooted these traits are in their subconscious. Pre-sentient canines constantly crave approval, much more so than humans and most other races. This can be seen
in nature where wild dogs or wolves seek approval from
the pack's leader, where the cooperative nature greatly
improves their chance of survival. Likewise, domestic
canines seek approval from their master, which makes
them very loyal and easy to train.

It was these qualities that the Ancients wanted to
exploit, genetically engineering the genus Canis to
become intelligent beings to serve the needs of the
Ancients. Canine traits are so strong in the Vargr that
they have changed little in the evolution of the species
and are evident in the behaviour of all Vargr today.

#### Packs

The genetic instinct of Vargr is most evident in the pack
culture of their society. Like many species, they seek the
companionship of others for comfort and security, the
gregarious nature of Vargr giving them a drive to connect
with others and a need to belong to other groups. This
arises from both their natural need for approval and
the racial pride that unites all Vargr with a sense of
solidarity and camaraderie.

Vargr packs vary greatly in form and function. Some
common types include the family pack, businesses,
religions, recreational groups, governments, military
units and the infamous corsair bands. Most Vargr
belong to several packs, loyal to each one for different
reasons and proud to have many commitments and
loyal brethren.

Individuality is still important within the pack and each
member strives to become the most dominant. This
contest for leadership is based upon an individual's
charisma and influence but although members of a
pack are competitive, the good of the pack comes first
and members know they can always count on their
peers for assistance, companionship and support in
times of need.

Large organizations usually consist of several packs
divided by roles or specialities. Where several packs
exist in a single organization, a hierarchy exists where
the leader of each answers to the primary pack. This
takes power struggles to new levels as individuals
compete not only for dominance within their own pack
but with other packs in the organization – a leader of
one pack might seek to become the leader of another
or may try to make their pack more dominant within
the organization.

#### Charisma & Loyalty

At the heart of Vargr psychology is the concept of
charisma, which Vargr define as an individual's prestige
and force of personality that attracts other Vargr.

This, combined with pack mentality, is the foundation
for Vargr society and the driving force behind their
constant change in leadership, whether in a pack of
scavengers or government.

The Vargr desire to constantly increase their charisma
makes them a competitive race, always seeking to
improve their standing amongst the pack. It is this
charisma that gives them their focus and drive. Whilst
many humans see this as a flaw, it is one of the reasons
that Vargr have become such a prominent race.

Charisma is gained or lost by word and deed, and Vargr
are keen to perform special or difficult duties if it means
they will gain standing by doing so. This behaviour means
that Vargr always try their best in the hope of gaining
charisma and the fear of losing it – very few Vargr are lazy
or procrastinate when they have duties to perform.

Vargr always look to the most charismatic person in
the pack for leadership and that individual will only
maintain position by proving they have the ability and
force of personality to lead the pack. All Vargr respect
a leader who has a greater charisma than their own
and likewise have a responsibility to those with a lower
charisma who submit to their authority.

A leader might not have the skills to effectively lead the
pack but charisma gains them the loyalty of everyone in
the group. Contrary to popular belief, a Vargr's loyalty
is very strong and will only waver if the pack leader
fails to meet the needs of their people and thus lose
charisma. Loyalties may change but never quickly and
never without reason. It is this that seems to have gone
unnoticed by outsiders who regard the Vargr's loyalty as
volatile at best and mutinous at worst.

Should a leader be found to lack the skills to lead
their people, members will look to others within the
pack who have the charisma to take control. This may
seem strange and unproductive to other races but this
behaviour always ensures the strongest person is in
charge of a pack.

### Racial Pride

Vargr see themselves as a unique people, a race chosen
by the Ancients and uplifted to be an intelligent race. In
their eyes, this makes the Vargr special and sets them
apart from the other major races, since only Vargr have
such esteemed origins.

Some Vargr believe in racial superiority, which has led to
two schools of thought on the subject. Those who follow
the so called 'high superiority' school propose that Vargr
were designed to be better than other races, that the
Ancients designed them to be nothing less than perfect.

Proponents of the 'low superiority' school maintain they
were the original sapient race on Terra and the Ancients
moved them to Lair so the Vargr would not interfere with
the genetic engineering of humans from [[Terra|Terran]] apes.

As with all things in Vargr society, there are numerous
other ideas supported by scientists, politicians and
religious groups. A minority of Vargr even take the view
that their origins make them an inferior race and these
troubled souls feel they have to prove their worth by
performing dangerous and extraordinary actions.

With so many takes on racial pride, it is important to
note that most Vargr lie somewhere between these
extremes and are content in the knowledge that they are
a special and unique race – from humble beginnings
they were chosen by the Ancients and eventually
reached the stars.

#### Family

The family is a pack of blood relatives and it is in this
environment that pups first learn about pack structure,
quickly learning to recognize charisma and develop
their own personality. Young members of a family
must show the proper respect to the family leader
and establish their own position within the pack by
improving their charisma. This learning curve is crucial
training for a young pup.

In agrarian or pre-industrial societies, the family
pack tends to be larger than those of more advanced
cultures. On a low technology world, a larger family
means a greater number of hunters, essential to the
pack's survival. However, if a pack grows too large
it becomes less effective, especially if the pups and
elderly outnumber more able-bodied members as it
places an additional burden on the hunters, threatening
the survival of the pack. Larger packs are also more
noticeable, making it difficult to hunt wildlife.

Vargr families become smaller as technology increases
and the economy moves towards industry. Industrial
based societies require large workforces so parents spend
much of their time working and less raising families.
Raising pups in the family environment is essential for
their development, so most Vargr females on these worlds
will only give birth to one litter in their lifetime.

In higher technology societies where much of the
workforce is automated, the demands on family
members are reduced and they are better able to raise
their pups in a more traditional manner. Female Vargr
on these worlds will therefore give birth to several litters
and the average family size is more akin to that of pre-industrial societies.

### Beliefs

Religion is as diverse and varied as every other aspect of
Vargr society. Many religions stem from the Vargr's pride
in their origins and the Ancients are venerated as gods
by many groups. What humans would consider orthodox
religions also exist in great numbers but they are not as
common as belief in the Ancients.

Many who do devote themselves to a religion will
continue in their chosen career but some will also
change profession to better follow their faith; this is
especially true of loners who are more likely to seek the
companionship of fellow believers. Religious leaders
often have a background as emissaries but this is not
always the case.

### Church of the Chosen Ones

This religion was established
in the year 895 of the Imperial calendar and for a short
period it was one of the largest and most influential
religious movements in Vargr society. Although the
religion is not as popular as it once was most Vargr have
heard of the Church of the Chosen Ones.

The religion postulates that not only did the Ancients
create the Vargr by genetically engineering [[Terra|Terran]]
canines but that the Ancients continued to return
to Lair to make improvements until they created the
superior race that Vargr are today. To followers of the
Church of the Chosen Ones, this also explains the
existence of the Vargr subspecies; they were mistakes
abandoned by the [[Ancients]].

Congregations tend to live in their own communes and
each commune has its own particular traditions, dress
codes and practices, such as wearing only white clothes,
wearing an embroidered sash or adorning themselves
with a particular marking or tattoo.

The popularity of this religion has declined in recent
years and there are now thought to be around 20
branches remaining in the Extents, although each
branch consists of multiple congregations. Infrequent
surges of popularity boost the number of followers
but not in sufficient quantity to rival its popularity in
the early days. Many scientists have discredited the
claims made by the Church but this has not swayed the
remaining fanatics from their beliefs.

### Faarzgaen

This is a religion of fanatics who believe
in a single god, Faarzgaen, who continually guides all
who worship him and determines how they should live
and act; if a follower of Faarzgaen is hungry then he
wants them to eat, if they are tired then he wants them
to sleep and if they have the urge to take a life then
Faarzgaen wants them to kill someone.

Followers of this faith believe that Faarzgaen is the one
true god and his religion thus the only true faith. Anyone
who does not follow Faarzgaen is a heretic. Worshippers
of Faarzgaen spread their religion by forcing it upon
others using fear and violence.

This fanatical behaviour has lead worshippers of
Faarzgaen to believe that they are the only ones fit
to rule the universe and have become a powerful
organization feared by many Vargr. On some worlds the
religion has become a ruling power, oppressing their
subjects until they submit to the one true faith.

The religion and the few states they control are run
by seven overlords known as Kafaazgaen. To become
a Kafaazgaen a priest must commit a number of
violent acts, including the assassination of a serving
Kafaazgaen, in order to take that position.

## INFIGHTING

Infighting is unique to Vargr and is more than just
combat; it forms part of their struggle for power and
charisma within their pack. There are times when
dominance cannot be decided by charisma alone
and in these situations the Vargr will succumb to the
more primitive means of tooth and claw. Infighting is
frequently used to settle disputes and insults.

Infighting is similar to a duel but participants are fighting
for charisma and loyalty, not honor and pride. This may
seem a small distinction to humans but to Vargr and
indeed the Aslan (who duel for honor), the difference is
considerable. Infighting is not so much about injuring or
killing the opponent but getting them to submit and thus
proving the victor is the most dominant.

Whenever two Vargr are battling for dominance within
a pack and loyalty is divided or a Vargr questions the
abilities or leadership of another, one challenges the
other to fight. Such infighting is not necessarily for the
role of pack leader but simply for one Vargr to raise their
position above another and slowly increase charisma
and status within the pack. A pack member might also
challenge someone of lower charisma to prove they
remain superior to their subordinates.

Individuals who constantly challenge their comrades will
usually lose charisma and in some cases are cast out
from the pack. Exploiting one's prowess in combat as an
easy way of gaining charisma is seen as un-Vargr and not
tolerated. Infighting has its rightful place but it is not an
alternative to charisma; it is just one of many aspects of
the Vargr struggle for dominance.

## DRESS, ART & ARCHITECTURE

Due to Vargr eyesight being less sensitive to colour,
their clothes and decorations are often made up of
bright colours that appear garish to humans. Clothes
tend to be tight fitting and practical but cloaks and
capes are not uncommon. Most Vargr prefer to forego
footwear but this varies between locations and cultures;
shoes and boots tend to be used for practical reasons,
such as with armor or in regions with rough terrain
and cold climates.

Art follows a similar trend, with a preference toward
bright colours using a variety of styles and techniques.
Paintings and sculptures often depict charismatic
leaders and renowned Vargr packs. Corsair bands are
also a common subject of paintings, stories and poetry.

As one would expect from such a diverse race, Vargr
architecture varies widely not just between locations and
cultures but within the same settlements. Designs are
typically asymmetrical and have a lot of ornamentation.
The garish colours of one building often clash with
neighboring structures, making Vargr cities appear
chaotic and disorganised.

The gregarious nature of Vargr manifests in their
architecture, resulting in wide communal areas and
open plan offices. This can be seen on a greater scale
with most settlements having large open areas for
markets and recreational uses.

An important feature of most buildings is that they
are rarely designed with a particular use in mind. The
continuous changes in Vargr society mean buildings
constantly change in ownership and function. For this
reason, it is important that a building can be easily
adapted to the needs of its occupants; a building might
be a government office one day, a junk dealership the
next and a month later it could be a fine restaurant.

### Tattoos and Markings

A popular tradition amongst Vargr, especially in military
and corsair packs, is tattooing their bodies or painting
armor to show past deeds. Pack members will use
a variety of symbols painted in different colours to
represent deeds such as victories, kills and leadership
achievements. Rank and pack insignia are also common
tattoos. Like so many aspects of Vargr culture, tattoos
are constantly changing as new victories are won and
achievements gained.

Tattoos are generally applied to the face where the fur
is short. Some Vargr have been known to dye their fur
or shave patches but most will simply paint symbols
on their armor, clothes and weapons. In this context,
symbols painted on items are often referred to as
tattoos, as there is no distinction between the two.

Although this tradition is followed by many Vargr, it is
by no means practiced by all groups. Some individuals
abstain from the custom, preferring deeds to speak
for themselves rather than displaying them in such an
obvious manner.

The meaning of symbols and colours varies from one
pack to the next and in some groups the location of
the design is also relevant. In most packs, the meaning
is derived from only one characteristic of colour,
location or symbol; the remaining aspects are simply an
expression of the individual.

## EMISSARIES

The number and variety of Vargr governments makes
diplomacy very difficult. Disputes arise over a
variety of matters and when two or more charismatic
leaders (of packs or of governments) are involved,
the situation can quickly resort to violence without
intervention of intermediaries.

A specialized group of mediators, known as emissaries,
has arisen to meet the needs of disputing parties.
Emissaries are highly skilled diplomats, much sought
after for their experience in negotiation and diplomacy.
These individuals are greatly respected and well paid
for their services. They are used as much in corporate
dealings as they are for political negotiations.

Other races on the borders of Vargr territories are often
subject to raids by independent corsair bands. This
has led to misunderstandings and political disputes
since few outsiders understand the Vargr's apparent
lack of respect for authority. In these situations
emissaries are frequently called to mediate on behalf
of Vargr governments. Emissaries are usually successful
in creating the peace or at least avoiding further
hostilities. In the cases of raids and unprovoked attacks,
reparations are usually given to the victim as a gesture
of good will.

## BUSINESS

Vargr do not have anything approaching the
megacorporations found in other races, as the
hierarchy and remote authority necessary to run a large
corporation is something that simply does not work with their mindset. Vargr workers who are unsatisfied with
their jobs or feel undervalued or underpaid also have a
tendency to simply look for new leadership within the
company or find a new job more suited to their needs.

The few larger corporations that are successful have
become so by splitting their organization into smaller
subsidiary companies, thus reducing remote authority
and keeping the feel of a smaller company, at least as
far as workers are concerned. These businesses are most
successful when working on the subsector level and most
operate in the shipping and interstellar trade markets.

As one would expect with the Vargr, businesses come
and go with astonishing frequency, much more so than
any other race. This might have a negative impact on
trade but the environment prevents capital from being
tied up in unprofitable businesses. The nature of Vargr
business has made a number of professions both
lucrative and essential to the Vargr economy.

Junk Dealer: The junk dealer, also known as second-hand equipment merchant, is one of the most common
professions in Vargr society. Anyone can set themselves
up as a junk dealer with minimal collateral and there
is never a shortage of second-hand goods. As Vargr
businesses rise and fall, leftover goods and unwanted
equipment is always available for those who know where
to look.

Some businesses will search for goods but without
knowledge and connections this can be a time
consuming task, especially if rare or specific items are
required. The majority of second-hand equipment is
purchased quickly and cheaply by junk dealers who
then sell it on to corporations or scroungers, making a
significant profit in the process.

Many junk dealers are independent traders with small
to medium size establishments but larger second
hand dealerships also exist with vast warehouses and
numerous dealers on the payroll.

Scrounger: Scroungers are specialist brokers, working
both independently or for corporations. Companies with
a good scrounger on the payroll will save a lot more
money than it costs to hire their services.

Bargains can be found throughout the Vargr Extents but
the right skills and knowledge are required to locate
them. Scroungers are experts in this field and can find
just about anything a company or individual might need,
from raw materials to high-tech goods. They will often
purchase goods from junk dealers but also cut out the
middleman if the opportunity arises.

### Contingency Expert

A contingency expert fulfils a
similar role to the scrounger. Businesses rely on each
other to provide goods and services; in the fluctuating
world of Vargr business it is essential to ensure that
if one supplier stops trading, a replacement can be
found quickly and efficiently to reduce the loss of
sales and productivity.

### Economy

The many governments and states of Vargr society
mean that there is no global economy in the Extents.
Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the
local economy of each government and world fluctuates
wildly. Prices can vary from place-to-place by as much
as a third.

Vargr will usually haggle and negotiate to get a higher
salary or a better price for whatever goods or services
they are purchasing. Busy areas of trade such as
spaceports and marketplaces are a cacophony of
raised voices with bartering, intense negotiations and
angry consumers.

Due to the fragile nature of Vargr economics, bank
lending and finance options are virtually unheard of.
Investment opportunities are also uncommon for the
same reasons. Businesses are so unstable that lenders
and investors must not only be convinced of a return
but will demand some sort of collateral to protect
their investment.

## THE MILITARY

The Vargr military conforms to no standard conventions.
Local governments have their own forces, each varying
in organization, technology and strength. Larger states
might control all the military of their member worlds
or rely on local forces. For most worlds, the military
comprises of three divisions: army, navy and marines.

Each military division consists of a number of packs,
with each pack forming a unit. Tactics tend to operate
on a unit level depending on the abilities of the current
leader and change with leadership within the pack.
Units are often grouped into a variety of regiments,
battalions, platoons and squads but, being Vargr, this is
not always the case. Larger military organizations tend
to have a more formal hierarchy but again, this varies
between governments.

Ranks vary from one group to another. Many divisions
have their own arbitrary ranks issued on a whim, whilst
others have a more formal hierarchy in place. The usual
infighting occurs within the military as it does in other
Vargr packs and individuals are promoted on force of personality rather than skills in leadership or battle.
The result of this is that officers are often promoted to
commanding positions but lack the skills needed for
military leadership and tactics.

In addition to the power struggles within a pack, there
is also a jockeying for position between different units.
Some packs seek to become more dominant than others
in their division and leaders jockey for command of more
prestigious units, often bringing members of their own
pack with them.

Once in a commanding position, leaders must live up
to the expectations that earned them the promotion.
Leaders who fail to command their force to success are
soon replaced by more charismatic individuals.

The result of the Vargr mentality means their military
is somewhat volatile. This instability not only affects
organization and leadership but can have a great impact
on morale as well. It is not uncommon for charismatic
individuals to gain popularity in resisting higher
authorities for a number of reasons, causing disputes and
strikes to demand better conditions, equipment and pay.

Mutinies have also been known to occur but such
extreme shifts in loyalty are infrequent. These acts
have been known to turn the tide of battle as units and
entire battalions have deserted or even changed sides
during a conflict; such is the nature of Vargr. However,
this behaviour is discouraged and considered treason by
many governments; punishments can be quite severe.

Humans find this concept of leadership difficult to
understand but from the Vargr perspective it makes
perfect sense; if a leader proves they are not capable
of command it is important to replace them with a
charismatic leader who can, especially in combat.

## CORSAIR BANDS

When most people think of Vargr, the first thing that
comes to mind is the corsair bands that operate
throughout the Extents and along Imperial borders.
Indeed, this imagery comes foremost to many Vargr as
well but whereas humans see pirates raiding free traders
and merchant ships, the Vargr are more likely to see
glamour and prestige.

Although the life of a corsair is appealing to Vargr,
these space pirates constitute less than 10% of Vargr
society. Unfortunately, all Vargr have been tarred with
the same brush despite the fact that corsairs are hated
and feared by many Vargr who have chosen a more
honest way of life.

Corsair raiders do not abide by any laws, nor do they
recognize boundaries. This is made possible by the
fractured governments and lack of centralised policing
within the Vargr Extents. Without coordinated law
enforcement, corsairs are free to prey on the trade
routes with little opposition. When they do encounter
resistance they can avoid legal issues by simply crossing
a border.

Outside of Vargr space, corsair bands face a much
tougher prospect as most other races have dedicated
law enforcement and military patrols to prevent acts
of piracy. Imperial law ensures criminals cannot
escape justice by simply crossing the border into other
territories and this means only the largest and most
experienced bands prey on ships beyond the Extents.

A number of larger corsair bands have become so
powerful and organised that they rival the might of some
governments. It is not uncommon for groups of renown
to be hired as mercenaries to bolster the defences of
smaller worlds or work alongside military forces. Many of
these large corsair bands also have their own bases.

Smaller bands also exist, right down to single-ship
crews. These independent raiders focus their efforts on
weaker vessels ignored by larger corsair bands. These
targets are also safer for small raider packs as there is
little threat of reprisal by larger bands who also operate
in the region.

These larger corsair bands operate much like military
groups but with one significant advantage; a corsair
band will usually have a strong leader who is both
charismatic and skilled, whereas military leaders obtain
the position by popularity but often lack the skills
and tactical knowledge that come with experience.
This results in the usual Vargr struggle for dominance
amongst military units, whilst corsair leaders have
proven themselves time and again making their pack
more stable and outsiders have difficulty understanding
how a group of pirates can have a more solid hierarchy
than other Vargr packs.

## VARGR IN THE IMPERIUM

There are numerous Vargr scattered throughout Imperial
space. Settlements with a significant Vargr population
usually have a Vargr quarter where most live and socialise
and such areas tend to be loud and colourful with an
atmosphere much like any other Vargr community.

Vargr in the Imperium behave much as they do in the
Extents. They still lack respect for authority but will
follow a charismatic human leader just as they would
a Vargr. However, the usual jockeying for charisma and
power is not so prevalent as such behaviour tends not
to be so beneficial in human culture and rarely results
in promotion.

Vargr also discover that laws are enforced more strongly
in the Imperium and although the Vargr disrespect
for the law remains they become more mindful of it,
learning what they can get away with and what they get
arrested for. This is often a case of trial an error and
most Vargr who travel to Imperial space will be charged
with at least one misdemeanour before taking a more
active view of the law.

## LANGUAGE AND NAMING

The diversity of Vargr society extends to their language.
There are hundreds of different languages and dialects
spoken throughout the Extents. Governments tend
to favor a particular language but this is not always
the case and in some regions a common language is
adopted to aid in trade and negotiations.

Vargr usually choose their own name when they come of
age. Some choose a name significant to them such as
an important event or achievement in their life, whilst
others are chosen arbitrarily and do not necessarily have
any meaning.

### Non-Verbal Communication
Like other races, body language plays in important role
in Vargr communication. However, Vargr have a limited
range of facial expressions so they use posture, bearing,
ears and tails to convey unspoken meaning.

Much of a Vargr's body language is subconscious and
can often give a clear indication as to their emotional
state. This can obviously make Vargr quite vulnerable,
so they will often use additional gestures to distract
others from seeing such strong emotional signals.

# VARGR TRAVELLERS

Vargr Travellers follow the same procedures and
concepts as human Travellers, as detailed in the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_. Although Vargr are covered on
page 51 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , it is assumed
that Travellers created that way were born and raised
within the Imperium or, at least, human-based society.
The Traveller creation rules presented here are suitable
for Vargr born and raised within the Extents. Unless
otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and
career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

## INITIAL TRAVELLER GENERATION

Use the characteristics and traits for Vargr Travellers shown below:

### Characteristics

STR-2, DEX +1, END-1

### Traits

Bite, Heightened Senses (see page 51 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ).

Vargr from the Extents do not have a SOC characteristic - instead, they use Charisma (CHA). A Vargr will start with CHA 1D+2.

## STARTING AGE

Vargr characters begin their careers at 18 years of age.
Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career
to gain new skills, experience and, most importantly,
Charisma. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years.

## Titles
Vargr do not have titles of nobility as humans of high
SOC do. Like most aspects of Vargr society, there is
no consistent system for titles and different packs
and cultures will use their own arbitrary methods of
assigning titles, if at all. Travellers with CHA 10+ have
enough dominance within their pack to select their own
title or assign one to subordinates.

## Careers
Vargr careers, in general, are used in the same way as
described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, there
are exceptions, which are noted here.

Those Vargr born and raised in the Imperium will
take one of the careers detailed in the Traveller Core
Rulebook , as if they were human.

## QUALIFICATION

Once a career has been selected, the Traveller must
attempt to qualify for that career. Due to the nature of
Vargr society, qualifying for a career is usually based on
CHA instead of a characteristic more relevant to the type
of career. CHA is therefore used for all careers except
Loner, Psion and Scientist.

Vargr Travellers are expected to change their career often
as they gain CHA, seek new goals or a pack leader fails
to live up to expectations. For this reason, there are no
penalties when moving from one career to another.

If a Traveller fails to qualify, they can take the Drifter
career (detailed on page 26 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_ ) or Loner career for the term, or they can
submit to the Draft. Enlisting in the Draft works
exactly the same as detailed on page 17 of the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ but Travellers roll on the Vargr
Draft table instead.

### Vargr Draft

    1D Career
    1–3 Army
    4 Marines
    5 Navy
    6 Law Enforcement

## SKILLS

Skills are determined as normal but all Vargr Travellers
automatically receive Melee (infighting) 0. This
represents the natural infighting ability of all Vargr.

## PSIONICS

Vargr Travellers have the same psionic potential as
humans and the same rules apply, using the Psion
career on page 200. The primary factor holding back the
wide ranging use of psionics amongst Vargr is the lack of
organised research and training facilities. As a result of
this, Vargr psions are uncommon in the Extents.

Vargr attitudes towards psionics vary – many worlds are
indifferent but some governments have outlawed the
use of psionics, some encourage it and to other cultures
such abilities are blasphemous.

## MISHAPS TABLE

## EVENTS TABLE

## VARGR LIFE EVENTS

The life events of a Vargr Traveller are similar to those of a human, with the addition of pack events. The pack is an
important part of a Vargr's life and events that affect the pack will often impact on the character.

### Life Events

    2D Event
    2 Sickness or Injury: You are injured or sick. Roll on the Injury table.
    3 Birth or Death: Someone close to you dies, such as a friend or pack member. Alternatively, someone
close to you gives birth (or is born!). You are involved in some fashion (father or mother, pack member
or similar).
    4 Ending of Relationship: A romantic relationship involving you ends. Roll 1D. On a 1–2 your mate is killed.
On a 3–4 your mate leaves you. On a 5–6 you leave your mate.
    5 New Relationship: You become romantically involved with an existing Ally, Contact, another Traveller or
pack member.
    6 Pack Event: Roll on the Pack Event table. Travellers not currently in a pack roll CHA 7+ to join a pack or
gain a new Rival instead.
    7 New Contact: You gain a new Contact.
    8 Pack Event: Roll on the Pack Event table. Travellers not currently in a pack roll CHA 7+ to join a pack or
gain a new Ally instead.
    9 Travel: You move to another world. You gain DM+2 to your next Qualification roll.
    10 Good Fortune: Something good happens to you; you come into money unexpectedly, have a lifelong dream
come true or another stroke of good fortune. Gain a Benefit roll in your current career or gain CHA +1.
    11 Crime: You commit a crime or are accused of a crime. Lose CHA –1.
    12 Unusual Event: Something weird. Roll 1D:

### 1. Psionics

You have an encounter with a psionic phenomenon, such as a human psionic institute,
Zhodani agent or alien entity. You may immediately test your Psionic Strength and, if you qualify, take
the Psion career in your next term.
**2. Aliens** : You spent a long time amongst an alien race. Gain Language or Science 1 and a Contact from
that race.

### 3. Alien artefact

You come into possession of a curious piece of alien technology or an archaeological
relic.

### 4. Amnesia

There is a hole in your mind.

### 5. Contact with government

Your pack became well known and had dealings with a government leader.
Gain CHA +1.

### 6. Ancient technology

You have an item believed to be left behind by the Ancients when they first
brought the Vargr to Lair.

### Pack Events

These events affect the Traveller's pack and
their position.

    1D Event
    1 Failure: Your failure causes a serious problem for your pack such as the loss of a well-paid job or the death
of a pack member. Lose CHA –1. If you are the leader, your pack will look to new leadership until you can
redeem yourself.
    2 Leave Pack: A change of situation, disagreement or lack of leadership forces you to leave your pack and
your job. Roll CHA 6+ to find another job in your current field or you are ejected from your career.
    3 Join Pack: You join a new pack. This can be a change of job or employer within your career or you become
involved with another group such as a religion or recreational group.
    4 Power Struggle: The leader of your pack does not live up to the reputation their charisma suggested and
you look to other members to replace them. Roll 1D. On a roll of 1–3 the current leader keeps their
position; gain a Rival. On a roll of 4–6 a new leader takes charge of the pack; gain an Ally.
    5 Success: You are successful at a particularly difficult task and exceed all expectations. Gain CHA +1.
    6 Leadership Challenge: The leader of your pack fails in their role and the pack looks for a new leader. Roll
Leadership or CHA 10+ to become the pack's new leader. If you fail, another member is chosen and you
gain a Rival.

## MUSTERING OUT

Benefits are granted at the end of career service, as
detailed on page 45 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.
Vargr have access to two new mustering out benefits.

### Corsair

You receive a Ruguelka corsair with 25% of
the mortgage paid off on it. This corsair is identical to
the one on page 236 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the corsair will have no mortgage
and it will be all yours!

### Trader

You receive a Koerae trader with 25% of the
mortgage paid off on it. This trader is identical to the
one on page 228 but you must roll 1D times on the
Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core
Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional
25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this
benefit four times, the trader will have no mortgage
and it will be all yours!

### Gaining and Losing Charisma

A Vargr's CHA can change many times during the course of an adventure, as long as they are responsible for the
success or failure of any given task; if a Traveller is using their initiative and making choices, the outcome of
those decisions can raise or lower their CHA.

For example, a pilot who misjumps due to a damaged jump drive would not be responsible for the failure,
whereas a pilot who destroys a superior vessel due to clever thinking and good piloting would be responsible for
the success and therefore have a chance to increase their CHA.

### Charisma Gain

Providing the Traveller is responsible for a noteworthy success where they have shown initiative
or completed a task against difficult odds, roll 2D and add their CHA DM. If the total equals or exceeds their
current CHA, they gain CHA +1.

### Charisma Loss

If the Traveller is responsible for a significant failure, roll 2D and add their CHA DM. If the total is
less than their current CHA, they lose CHA –1.

When making these checks, it is important that the Traveller has earned the gain or deserved the loss either
through their actions or decisions. Referees may also alter the task difficulty of these checks as appropriate to
the significance of the outcome. For example, a Traveller who saves the pack by spotting an ambush and taking
out the enemy might have an Average CHA check. A Traveller who causes their ship to collide with a mountain
through complete inattention might face a Formidable CHA check.

Travellers making CHA checks of this kind can opt to use Leadership instead if the Referee deems it appropriate
to the situation.

The pack mentality of the Vargr means they require leadership in order to function effectively, so anytime a pack
leader loses CHA or if the leader is injured or killed, the pack will look for new leadership. The new leader will
usually be the most charismatic member of the pack but individuals might join the struggle for power. If the new
leadership is contested, everyone vying for the position makes an opposed CHA or Leadership check and the
Traveller with the highest check wins the battle for leadership and instantly gains CHA +1.

A pack leader who is stripped of their position loses CHA –1. This reduction is in addition to the CHA loss caused
by the failure itself.

### CHA and SOC

When travelling to other worlds, it will be likely
that Travellers with SOC will need to make CHA
checks and vice versa.

Whenever this is required, simply increase the
difficulty of the check by one level and use the
characteristic possessed by the Traveller. So, a
Traveller with the SOC characteristics called upon
to make an Average (8+) CHA check, will actually
make a Difficult (10+) SOC check.

Vargr equipment is, for the most part, similar in form
and function to human items. The main differences are
found in clothing and armor where the physiological
differences of the Vargr influence the design. Although
clothing and armor from other races can be modified
to fit Vargr, they prefer specifically made items that are
naturally more comfortable.

A large amount of Vargr equipment is second hand. There
is no status attached to buying new or second hand; the
abundance of second hand goods from failed companies
is simply part of Vargr life that creates a buyer's market.
Junk dealers usually trade out of a warehouse, bulk
selling to corporations, but most have an open door policy
allowing anyone to browse their stock and purchase goods
as required. For those looking to bulk buy second hand
merchandise, finding an experienced scrounger can save
the buyer a lot of money.

There is less of a second hand market for personal and
domestic items such as clothes and house wares since
these items are less likely to become redundant when
companies fail. However, this market is still big by
human standards and second hand shops that cater to
the domestic market are a common sight in any Vargr
settlement, ranging from small independent retailers to
large megastores.

## PURCHASING

EQUIPMENT

Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the
local economy of each government and world fluctuates
wildly. When purchasing equipment and services,
Referees should alter the costs by up to ±15% by
adding 2D-7 x 3 percent to the list price.

Travellers wishing to purchase second hand items
can go direct to a junk dealer or hire the services of
a scrounger. Buying direct from a second hand store
or junk dealer will reduce the list cost by up to 40%,
which is determined by subtracting 5D+10 percent
from the modified list price; it is indeed entirely
possible that brand new goods on one Vargr world are
cheaper than buying the same items second hand on a
different world.

A scrounger will typically find required items with a further
2D percent price reduction but will take a commission of
1D percent of the total cost of goods purchased.

### BASE GARMENTS

It is not necessary to attach armor to a base garment
but many Vargr do so in order to have a basic level of
protection over the whole body or make it easy to get in
and out of the whole suit. Base garments are made of
flexible materials.

The standard base garment is a coverall, usually
decorated in patterns of the user's choice. Camouflage
is rare; garish designs that scream 'here I am!' are the
norm. These attract as much fire as attention but are
part of the Vargr way of life. Jacket-style base garments
are also available, although they usually come with
shoulder and arm pieces.

## ARMOR

Personal armor is common in the Vargr Extents and
not only worn by corsairs or members of the military.
The high risk of attack by pirates means many traders
and Travellers also don protection when passing through
dangerous regions and undefended space routes.

Vargr tend to use separate pieces of armor bought,
stolen or scavenged to suit their needs and comfort.
Many Vargr, especially corsairs, have a mismatch of
armor in a variety of materials, colours and styles.
Even when Vargr armor is purchased as a complete set,
it is likely to comprise many individual and disparate
pieces providing protection to different parts of the
body. Second-hand armor is likely to be completely
mismatched as a result of junk dealers piecing together
various components to make a set or the original owner
simply acquiring different pieces over time.

Vargr individuals wearing helmets are less able to exert
influence and charisma due to a significant amount of
expressions and body language being concealed under
the armor. For this reason, helmets are less common
than for other races, although they are required as part
of sealed suits.

Armor is as much an expression of a Vargr's personality
and achievements as it is for protection and is usually
customised by each individual with ornamentation and
personalised symbols. This is especially true of corsairs
and military personnel.

Armor Components
A number of standard components are used by Vargr as
building blocks for personalised armor or warrior sets
as they are collectively known.

## TORSO ARMOR

Torso armor is generally rigid or semi-rigid. Those
who put together their own armor sets often make
use of standard pieces such as mesh, cloth or flak
jackets, obtained as per the Central Supply Catalogue
or Traveller Core Rulebook. A number of more
characteristically Vargr items are also available.

Shoulder Guards (Kforzonga): Traditional shoulder
guards provide minimal protection, restricted to the
bones and arteries running along the top of the torso.
They protect well against downward blows and might
stop a bullet. Some take the form of epaulettes, others
are shaped shoulder plates that extend over the very
top of the arm. Standard shoulder guards are of semi-rigid ballistic materials while heavy guards are made of
metal/ceramic composites.

### Chest Guard (Dhinourraksa)

The traditional chest guard
is favored by those who need to move fast or engage
in complex tasks – it is popular with pilots and vehicle
crewmembers. It takes the form of an upper-torso and
shoulder guard, sometimes with a loose fringe covering
part of the abdomen.

### Breastplate (Dhinou)

A breastplate covers the whole
frontal torso with lightweight metal/ceramic armor but
offers no protection from the rear. There is a subtext
to someone wearing a Dhinou in combat; they trust
those behind them and are not inclined to turn their
unprotected backs to the enemy.

### Vest (Dhoukha)

The standard Vargr full-torso protection
consists of a back-and-breastplate unit. Each face
is usually a single unit shaped to deflect bullets and blows. A heavy version, with thicker armor over the
vital organs and enhanced shoulder protection, as well
as a short 'skirt' of linked plates to protect the upper
legs, is available for those wanting additional protection.

Cloaks: Some torso protection (typically shoulder
guards but sometimes other items) incorporate a
cloak that is usually a waist-length decorative item.
However, a floor-length detachable cloak of fireproof
material can be added instead. This will absorb 20
points of fire or energy damage if the wearer wraps it
around themselves. After 20 points are taken the cloak
disintegrates and must be replaced.

    Fireproof Cape +20 (ablative)
    against fire and
    energy only
        8 — 1 Cr250 None

### LIMB ARMOR

Limb armor is usually light, to facilitate fast and agile
movement in combat. There are exceptions, however,
notably among Vargr who favor a head-on close combat
approach or those worried about floor-level threats. The
ability to crash right through a set of spiked foot traps
or even anti-personnel mines is useful when leading a
charge on foot – despite Vargr not feeling comfortable
with rigid footwear, they will tolerate it in combat if it
keeps their feet on the end of their legs.

### Bracers (Negdhazuk)

The commonest form of arm
protection is a set of lightweight polymer vambraces
covering the lower arm, with an elbow cup and a
flexible but lightly armored gauntlet. A heavier version
is available, offering greater protection at the cost of
additional weight. This variant is equivalent to the arm
guards found in riot armor.

### Arm Guards (Dzuesgogne)

A heavier full-arm guard is
available, consisting of metal/ceramic upper and lower
arm protectors linked by lighter flexible sections, with an elbow cup and heavy gauntlets. Links to attach to
shoulder guards or a breastplate are normally included
when bought new. Arm guards are a bit clumsy and
impose DM-1 to all DEX-based checks when not fighting
or shooting.

Arm Shield: An arm shield, sometimes called an assault
shield, is a lightweight oval of polymer designed to
crumble and ablate rather than pass impact to the
user. An arm shield clips to an attachment on bracers
or arm guards and provides additional protection from
incoming fire for a short time. It provides Protection +6,
reduced by one for each damage dice rolled against the
user that comes up a 5 or 6. Eventually the shield will
be shot away or its remains can be discarded by the
user. The shield is big enough to cover the whole of the
wearer's front but makes it impossible to carry out tasks
requiring both hands.

Fighting Boots (Ogzkua): Fighting boots are the standard
light leg protection used by many Vargr. They cover the
foot and ankle, with rigid sections of hard polymer over
softer material.

## LIMB ARMOR PROTECTION TL RAD KG COST REQUIRED SKILL

    Bracers +1 7 — 1.5 Cr50 None
    Heavy Bracers +2 8 — 2.5 Cr100 None

    Arm Shield +6 (special) 9 — 3 Cr100 None
    Fighting Boot +1 6 — 1.5 Cr100 None
    Charging Boot +2 7 — 2 Cr150 None
    Stomping Boot +3 8 — 4 Cr250 None

### Charging Boot (Dzouegon)

Charging boots are designed
to protect the whole lower leg and have additional
protection for the foot and ankle. Although heavier,
they are not significantly more encumbering than
fighting boots.

### Stomping Boot (Gvoderrsku)

Stomping boots are
designed for heavy assault work through obstacles or
anti-personnel minefields. A very heavy armored boot
covers the lower leg, with a flexible section above the
knee augmented by light plates on the front of the
thigh. Stomping boots reduce movement speed by one
meter and impose DM-1 on checks requiring delicate
placement of the feet.

### ARMOR SETS

Although the exact design and composition of Vargr
armor tends to vary considerably, it is possible to buy a
complete set of armor that fits a general specification.
Parts may or may not match one another, depending
on their origin, and prices can also vary depending
upon the quality of the equipment, its age and who it
belonged to in the past. A beat-up piece of armor can
sometimes have quite a history to it and be worn with
pride by its owner.

### Fighter Set (Kforzhazuk)

The lightest fighter set is
favored by warriors who need to move fast but want
some protection. It consists of a set of shoulder guards
and light bracers, used by those who expect hand-to-hand combat.

### Fighter Set (Kforzgong)

A variant on the fighter set, this
kit consists of a set of charging boots and light bracers,
is favored by scouts or those expecting to encounter
ground-level hazards.

### Leader-Fighter Set (Vhezkforz)

Consisting of a set of
shoulder guards fitted to a light ballistic cloth jacket,
with an additional fireproof cloak for gravitas and
protection, the fighter-leader set is favored by many
Vargr officers. Bracers or boots may be easily added.

Warrior Set (Zuurku-Azuk): The lightest of the warrior
sets, this loadout consists of an armored vest and
bracers. It is used, for the most part, by pilots and
vehicle crew.

Warrior Set (Zurrku-Ekdho): Consisting of a heavy vest
and bracers, this warrior set is favored by those who
move in and out of vehicles on a frequent basis and by
urban combat specialists.

Warrior Set (Zurrku-Oengga): Adding a set of fighting
boots and an arm shield to the Zurrku-Ekdho, this set
is favored by lightly equipped assault troops or whose
who prefer highly mobile hand-to hand combat.

Warrior-Leader Set (Vhezk-Zurrku): A heavy vest and
bracers attached to a suitably ostentatious lightly
armored jacket, this loadout is favored by those who
hope to lead others in the thickest of the fight

Assault Set (Kungedz-Udhvarr): Although intended for
the assault role, the Kungedz-Udhvarr is very light and
has no chest protection. It consists of separate pieces:
shoulder guards, charging boots, a light bracer on the
primary hand and a heavy arm guard on the secondary,
with an attached arm shield.

Assault Set (Kungedz-Dhagu): A breastplate attached to a
heavy ballistic cloth coverall, with bracers and charging
boots, this is a standard loadout for combat troops
expecting to fight in a linear environment, such as a
starship or spaceport.

Heavy Assault Set (Kungedz-Verz): A heavy armored
vest, stomping boots and arm guards all permanently
attached to a fireproof heavy ballistic coverall, this
assault set is used by many Vargr combat troops who
cannot get away with swapping components to create
something a bit more dashing.

Vargr combat armor is a complete armor suit primarily
used by military divisions but obtained with relative ease by
civilians. This combat armor offers the same functionality as
the Vargr combat vacc suit but is significantly lighter and has
greater protection. It comes with the TL12 electronics suite
detailed on page 19 of the _Central Supply Catalogue_.

### Options

All standard options listed on page 96 of the _Traveller
Core Rulebook_ and page 27 of the _Central Supply
Catalogue_ can be used with Vargr armor. Modifications
of Vargr origin are listed here and although other races
can acquire them, some will grant only Vargr Travellers
their full benefits.

### Audio Filter

Usually fitted into helmets, the filter also
comes as a pair of earpieces. These devices filter all
incoming audio to prevent very loud and high frequency
sounds from damaging or disorienting the wearer. A
Traveller wearing an audio filter gains DM+4 to their
END check against sonic-based attacks.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Audio Filter 8 — Cr50

### Blade Enhancements

Small blades or spikes mounted
into armor are popular with corsair raiders, usually
mounted to bracers or shoulder guards but can be
fitted anywhere the wearer requires. These weapons
can be used with the Melee (infighting) skill and deal
2D damage.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Blade Enhancements 6 1 Cr75

### Retractable Blades

These function just like standard
blade enhancements but a concealed controller allows
the wearer to extend and retract the blades as required.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Retractable Blades 8 1 Cr150

## AUGMENTS

Vargr opinion on the use of augments varies
considerably throughout the Extents. Those of a
religious nature tend to frown on Vargr augmentation,
firm in the belief that the Vargr have already attained
perfection or that it is blasphemous to alter the physical
form given to them by the Ancients.

However, there are still many cultures that see the
benefits of genetic and surgical alteration. The most
notable applications are the physical and combat skill
augments used by corsairs and the military. Intelligence
and related augments see little use in Vargr society.

All augments listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook can be
used by Vargr characters but availability depends on the
type of augment required at the Referee's discretion.

Aural Filter: This works much like the audio filter
option fitted to armor to prevent loud and high
frequency sounds from harming the Traveller. A
Traveller with an aural filter gains a DM+6 to END
checks against sonic weaponry.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Aural Filter 12 — Cr15000

Tail Enhancement: The bones and muscles of the tail are
enhanced to increase its strength and dexterity, allowing
it to make an unarmed attack for 1D damage. Attacking
with the tail still uses a significant action but the rarity
of this augment will surprise most opponents (especially
non-Vargr), making them unable to dodge or parry the
blow in the first round.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Tail Enhancement 10 — Cr3000

Urzaeng Modification: This augment evolved in the
Urzaeng region by Vargr with a desire to fit in and
become more like their Urzaeng brethren, although
other Vargr are attracted by this augment simply to be
more of a physical match for Urzaeng in combat. Many
worlds have outlawed this modification for a variety of
reasons, usually on religious grounds.

The procedure for Urzaeng modification is long (D3
months) and painful, requiring a combination of
genetic manipulation and surgery. Travellers with
this augment gain the following modifications: STR
+1, END +1 and INT –1. The Traveller's body also
increases in size, gaining 2D+6 centimeters in height
and 1D+4 kg in weight.

## MODIFICATION TL KG COST

Urzaeng Modification 13 — Cr75000

## ROBOTS AND DRONES

Robots and drones are not as popular among the Vargr as with most other races. This is mainly because of the
importance of charisma in Vargr society; a robot has no place within a pack as it has no charisma. For this reason,
someone in charge of robots does not gain the same charisma and respect as someone who commands other Vargr.
Combat robots are also rare as sending machines to fight instead of Vargr shows weakness of not just the leader but
the entire pack.

However, robots are used in some commercial arenas such as factories, construction, hostile environments and as
drivers or pilots for non-essential work. Robots are also used in an advisory capacity but Vargr will only consult such
robots in private to avoid losing the respect of their subordinates.

As a science, Vargr robotics is not particularly advanced due to the social implications of using robots or simply
being involved in the robotics industry. As such, Vargr robots tend to be overpriced, badly engineered and with low
intelligence. The poor quality of Vargr robotics has led to thriving criminal enterprises that steal robots from other
races, particularly the Imperium.

A11/58231 TASKBOT
This general purpose robot is one of the most advanced
robots of Vargr design. A broad skill set is included with
this robot allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks. The
taskbot is humanoid in appearance with a head design based

## WEAPONS

The Vargr have a wide variety of weapons and the most common are described here. Vargr versions of human
weapons also exist, differing in form but not function; Vargr characters are free to use any of the standard weapons
listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

A11/58231 CLAW FIST
A spiked fist weapon that fits over the hand, is designed to
look like claws and is a good example of the types of weapon
favored by corsairs for both practical and aesthetic purposes.
It is a very effective close combat weapon but the claw fist
must be strapped firmly to the hand and takes D3 rounds to
attach or remove. The wearer also suffers DM-2 to any task
that requires the use of their hand (not including combat).
The claw fist can be used with the Melee (infighting) or Melee (unarmed) skill.

### New Weapon Trait: Sonic (–X)
During the pre-stellar era on Lair, opposing Vargr
factions began experimenting with sonic weaponry
to both stun and disorient the enemy on the
battlefield using ultra high frequency sounds.

Anyone hit by a Sonic must make an END check
with a DM equal to the Sonic score; if successful,
the target is unaffected. However, if the target
fails, for the next 1D rounds they will suffer a DM
equal to the Effect of the END check to all actions.

Sonic weapons can only work where there is
atmosphere and are more effective on the acute
hearing of the Vargr – the effect lasts for an
additional two rounds when effecting a Vargr.

### A11/58231 SONIC PISTOL

The sonic pistol emits focussed, directed sound waves at its
targets. Although extremely painful, the effects are ultimately
non-lethal and the sonic pistol has found its way into the
arsenal of law enforcement on some worlds.

### SONIC RIFLE

More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle can easily affect
two or more targets in close proximity and unleashes far more
powerful sound waves. In assaults, the rifle is often used to
supress enemies while other units move in to engage them in
close combat.

grenades, the sonic grenade casts its effects over a much
wider area, making it perfect to disrupt rioting crowds or entire
units with one throw.

TRAITS

Most Vargr vehicles are much like their human counterparts in ability and function but the aesthetics of the Vargr
lead to much more decorative and elaborate features, with a variety of fins, spines and bright colours that look garish
and tasteless to humans. Many vehicles also comprise a mismatch of components scavenged from various sources.
Markings are often painted on vehicles to indicate race wins or, in the case of military vehicles, kills or pack insignia.

### VEHICLES OF THE VARGR

Vargr might not share the same taste in
design as humans but both share a love
of speed and grav racing. Unlike human
grav racers, Vargr designs incorporate a
passenger or co-pilot seat; such is their
need for companionship they like to share
the racing experience with their brethren.
The racer can be driven alone but the co-pilot usually serves as navigator so as to
have more participation in the race.

explorers, that is both sturdy and reliable. It is
large enough to carry a small Vargr pack, with
cargo, to and from their destination in hostile

# HIGH GUARD: VARGR

There are several customs and important facts to
consider when travelling onboard Vargr ships and within
the Vargr Extents.

Passage Types
Passage on Vargr ships has the same three categories
as on human vessels: low, basic, middle and high
passage. Travellers can be 'bumped' from a berth by
another passenger with higher CHA, regardless of the
class of ticket they have. This often has a chain effect of
bumped passengers consequently bumping others else
with lower CHA.

The Low Lottery: This custom is practiced by some Vargr
captains but not by others. To determine if a ship's
captain runs a lottery, roll 1D; on a 1–4 they not, a roll
of 5–6 they do.

The Traveller's Aid Society: There is no Vargr institution
comparable to the TAS that covers the Vargr Extents in
its entirety but smaller organizations do exist that offer
similar services on a smaller scale. They vary in size,
standards and services on offer.

Borders: Vargr do not recognize borders and territories.
Established borders are an abstract concept to most
Vargr, especially corsair raiders who will think nothing
of crossing borders to raid a ship, whether it is a border
between Vargr governments or alien worlds.

Piracy: Piracy, hijacking, raiding and similar crimes are
more frequent in Vargr space than in the Imperium. Roll
on the Corsair Encounters table once per trip using the
Encounter Modifiers table (modifiers are cumulative
and applied to the 'tens' dice only) to determine
what vessels are encountered. If a corsair band is
encountered, use the Encounter Distance table on page
79 of the Traveller Core Rulebook to determine the
range of the vessels.

    Patrolled Region –2
    Major Trade Route +2
    Minor Trade Route +1

    51–56 Two Vargr Scouts
    61–66 Vargr Corsair
    71–76 Vargr Corsair and Scout
    81–86 Vargr Corsair and two Scouts
    91–93 Two Corsairs
    94–96 Two Corsairs and two Scouts
    101–103 Two Corsairs and 1D Scouts
    104–106 1D Corsairs and 1D Scouts

CREWS

The Vargr pack mentality onboard a spacecraft is more
significant than any other environment. The long periods
of time spent in a confined space rely on pack dynamics
for Vargr to function effectively as a crew. Although the
typical infighting and power struggles are as prominent
here as anywhere else, the camaraderie of the crew is
essential to its success – mutinies are rare unless the
leader constantly fails in his duties.

The hierarchies and dynamics of the pack are also more
varied onboard starships. As with all packs, there is
always a leader but an individual's CHA rises and falls
depend on how important their role is perceived by
the rest of the crew. Priorities can change according to
events; for example, medics might not be considered
particularly important until the crew become dependent
on them for survival.

Large crews are often made up of several packs divided
by roles such as flight crew, engineers and gunners.
Marines and other fighting crewmen are also grouped
into their own packs. Corsair crews differ slightly in that
the captain usually leads the boarding unit in addition
to commanding the ship.

## LOPER GROUND CARRIER

## PILOT

## AAKUM HEAVY FIGHTER

The Aakum is the most common fighter
craft used by Vargr military organizations
and it appears in many corsair bands. It
is fast enough and tough enough to battle
other fighters, while carrying enough
firepower to assault larger vessels with
some effectiveness.


## AETIN SCOUT

Using a 100-ton hull, the Aetin scout is
primarily used by the navy and corsair
bands for reconnaissance and ground
support duties but also lone prospectors
and explorers. Much like its Imperial
counterpart, the Aetin scout is a common
sight in the Extents and therefore easy to
maintain and repair.

The Aetin scout only requires a crew of
one pilot but a gunner is carried as well
if weapons are mounted in the standard
double turret. Two additional crew or
personnel can be carried with double
occupancy if required.


## KOERAE TRADER

This interstellar trading vessel is built on a
200-ton hull and is used extensively in the
Vargr Extents. Like most Vargr ships, the
Koerae is armored to provide protection
against the many corsair bands that prowl
the trade lanes. While not sufficient to
keep the Koerae safe in pitched battle, the
thin armor is deemed enough to buy time
to escape an attacker.


## AVOUZ COURIER

Using a 200-ton hull, the Avouz courier
is designed for the fast transport of
emissaries and messages over interstellar
distances. The courier is generally used
by military and government organizations
for diplomatic and intelligence purposes
but its performance makes it attractive to
explorers, corsairs and Travellers alike.


## RRADHI SEEKER

The Rradhi seeker is a versatile ship
designed for mining and prospecting. The
normal crew consists of a pilot, navigator,
engineer and medic, although some multi-skilled prospectors will attempt to fly the
ship on their own. Up to four additional
workers can join the crew with double
occupancy if required, although care has to
be taken that this does not reduce profits.

## AKALVO YACHT

The Akalvo is a luxury pleasure craft – but
most certainly built for Vargr. Built for
speed as much as comfort, the interior is
a riot of colour and trimmings, pitched
perfectly to awe lesser Vargr. To the eyes of
other races, however, it appears the height
of vulgarity. Akalvo yachts are sold directly
to wealthy Vargr who have made their
fortunes in business or raiding ventures,
although the latter have been known to
continue their corsair life from the bridges
of these ships.

## RUGUELKA CORSAIR

Using a small but potent 400-ton hull, the
Ruguelka is the raiding vessel of choice
for most corsair bands. It is a common
sight in Vargr space and one feared by
many Travellers. Extremely fast, it is hard
to escape from once an intercept course
has been set and it can carry a substantial
boarding party.

## AEROUNKHU PACKET

This merchant vessel is designed to
transport both passengers and cargo, and
is well armed to defend against would-be
raiders. The Aerounkhu is primarily used
as a passenger liner with the cargo space
allocated to luggage storage and supplies.

The Aerounkhu typically has a standard crew
of eight, with many of the crew also serving
as gunners in the event of corsair attack.
## LEKLUN CORVETTE

Using an 800-ton hull, the Leklun is
commonly used by Vargr military forces
for patrols and fighting corsair raiders.
Some variants sacrifice the fighters for a
G/Carrier, allowing a larger complement of
troops to be deployed in a single action.
While the smallest of true warships, the
Leklun is nonetheless potent enough
against raider vessels and when combined
into squadrons, the corvette can cause
problems for larger ships.
