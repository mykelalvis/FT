![[TImp-ChantSubsector.jpg]][[TImp-ChantSubsector.jpg|Chant]]
The Chant subsector currently has a population of about 13.7 billion. At its peak, it had over 14 times that. Chant has been continuously settled for over 7,000 years dating back to the original Vilani expansion into the Core but over the millennia, ecological collapse, war and the effects of the Long Night decimated its worlds. The remnants of lost civilizations are  verywhere, in particular at Merat and Avthaus where sprawling Vilani ruins sit side-by-side with the structures of the modern Imperium. On Effinity, the deserts and equatorial marshes have reclaimed the ruins and new cities have sprung up in the temperate latitudes to take their place.

Some have compared Chant to the picked over remains of a long-dead carcass. Others call it 'the sick man of the Core'. Its resources have been plundered for thousands of years and it has been a bloody battlefield more times than anyone cares to remember. Perhaps the greatest killer of all was the Plague of Duskir, the slew of Terran diseases that wiped out billions of Vilani.

With its population in freefall and its economy in tatters, things have certainly been better for Chant. Nevertheless, there is reason for hope. While Chant is a shadow of its former self, there are signs of a resurgence. The subsector retains several of its Class A and B starports, propped up by Imperial subsidies. Industrial worlds Skeen and Raami, two of the oldest civilizations in the sector, have pledged to revitalise Chant. The Achenaar Antilles Line has opened up a hub at Anther from which they have plans to reinvigorate trade on the trailing spur of the Sylean Main. Emperor Strephon himself has invested a portion of his personal wealth in the region and solicited trillions more from the megacorporations. As far as the Emperor is concerned, it simply will not do to have an economic disaster of this scale on [[Capital]]'s doorstep.

Chant is defended by the Imperial Navy's 2nd Fleet, which consists of only three squadrons. The ships of the 2<sup>nd</sup> are outdated, underfunded and desperately in need of a refit. Fortunately, the fleet has more than its share of auxiliary spacecraft, many of which are dealing with a burgeoning piracy problem in the rimward portion of the subsector. The Imperial Navy normally takes a heavy hand against pirates but because Chant is so close to Capital, they are addressing the problem with a lighter touch. That such a thing as piracy could even occur so close to the throne world is an embarrassment and if word were to get out to the greater Imperium, it would be a public relations nightmare. Piracy results from economic strife and the Imperium hopes to rejuvenate Chant's ailing worlds. While the navy is not averse to using force, they are attempting to win hearts and minds instead. They hope to provide viable alternatives for those who have turned to piracy.

There is no single reason for the severe decline of the rimward worlds. There are many factors that have contributed to their fall but corruption, nepotism and cronyism are by far the greatest culprits. Astrography plays a part as well with the region being surrounded by several small- to mid-sized stellar gaps, which impede the flow of information and make for a spotty economy. Chant is also bordered on its rimward flank by the Chanestin worlds, which are isolationist and therefore rarely trade with outsiders.

The future of Chant is very much in question. Relief has begun to flow in from external sources but the subsector has more than its share of kleptocrats who misappropriate funds and redirect them to their own coffers. It will require more than just the good will of the Emperor to save Chant from plummeting even further into decline.
