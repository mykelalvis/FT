### REMSEN

Remsen's atmosphere is uncomfortably dense and combined with its large areas of surface water this creates near-permanent thick cloud cover. 'To rain like on Remsen' is a figure of speech on several local worlds, and not without good reason. There is no such thing as drizzle or mist on this world; rain can best be described as big lumps of water falling from the sky, whilst fog renders even walking hazardous.

The world is heavily balkanised, as a result of the population dwelling in widely dispersed city-states.
Conflict between communities is uncommon, not least due to their separation, but rivalries exist in areas as diverse as sport, trade and art. Offworlders are sometimes puzzled at just how excited citizens of a city-state can get because an artist from their community has been awarded a prize or simply produced something better than his arch-rival from another city.

These rivalries extend to trade in a way not entirely connected with making money. Revenue is always welcome but a city-state that makes more from trade or tourism than another will value the money more as an indicator of victory over a rival. The people of Remsen are friendly to offworlders but in their eagerness to get one over other communities, may forget their manners or become offended at outsiders who will not comply with their plans.
