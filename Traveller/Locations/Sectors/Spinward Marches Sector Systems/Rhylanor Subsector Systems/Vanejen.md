# Vanejen

Vanejen/Rhylanor (0709-C686854-5) is the major inhabited world in the Vanejen system, situated in a backwater cluster or worlds in the Rhylanor subsector in the Spinward Marches. The system consists of a bright central star, a total of seven planets (including Vanejen} and five satellites. Only Vanejen is in the system's life zone, and none of the other worlds show any sign of life or of value. In addition, the Vanejen system has no gas giantâ€” surprisingly, an asset which first drew Imperial attention to the system. The oceans of Vanejen can provide water for starship fuel to forces occupying the world, but attacking starforces are at a distinct disadvantage, needing to conquer the world itself before gaining access to the water they require for volume refueling.

Vanejen has two of the five satellites in the system, both of them small chunks of rock. Both were used as orbital bases by the Imperial Navy when Vanejen was fortified in 980; they have since been stripped of any armaments, but may retain some equipment not considered important enough to remove.

## Starport
Vanejen itself boasts a class C starport, a lower quality installation which once served as an Imperial naval base. But no longer: the navy pulled out of the base in 995, and the installation was retained as the world's starport. In a few years, as Vanejen gets up to tech level 8 or 9, the starport will probably be upgraded to B. Currently, the starport provides unrefined fuel, and does not have either ship building or repair facilities. It is located at the urban center on the large central continent.

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Vanejen is a medium-sized world with a dense atmosphere. Having a diameter of 8900 kilometers and a circumference of 28000 kilometers, the world has an atmosphere with a more or less standard gas mixture and no noxious elements. Seas of water cover 62% of the world's surface. These seas are quite deep, especially away from land masses. Polar icecaps are present in both hemispheres, but the lack of continental anchors or boundary land masses makes them fragile and prone to dispersion into icebergs due to weather.

## Planetography

The equator divides the world into north and south hemispheres, and passes through three of Vanejen's four continents. The northern fourth continent is relatively barren, without any mineral wealth or large human settlement, although there is a chirper population.

The three other continents each have urbanized and settled areas as indicated by the city symbols; urbanization and extensive development can be encountered on each continent within four hexes of those symbols. Mountain symbols indicate mountainous, rough or broken terrain; clear areas may be clear, prairie, forest, jungle, desert, swamp, marsh, or river. Arctic terrain can be expected in the top and bottom four hex rows of the map. Flora and Fauna. The animal and plant life of Vanejen is unremarkable (with the exception of the semi-intelligent chirpers) and corresponds to standard animal encounter tables constructed from the instructions contained in Traveller Book 3.

## SOCIAL DESCRIPTION

Human population on Vanejen is 543 million (a computer estimate) as of 1105. Racial extraction is primarily Vilani, a result of colonization some 3500 years ago; only limited intermingling (primarily from naval personnel during the Third Frontier War) with Solomani and other human races has occurred. Government is a planet-wide feudal technocracy imposing a rather liberal law level of 4. Technology. The current technological level of Vanejen is 5, equivalent to the Terran period 1900 to 1939. Electronics are rudimentary and gravities nonexistent. The primary emphasis of manufacturing is mechanical.

## HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
During the Third Frontier War (979 to 986), the major efforts of the Outworld Coalition were directed at Efate, Boughene, and Pixie, all in the Regina subsector. This strategy was essentially the same as had been used in the previous wars. But in addition, the Coalition launched a subordinate drive through the [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] and [[Lanth subsector]]s, across the Abyss, and gaining a foothold at Jae Tellona. From there, both Rhylanor and Porozlo were put under siege. This salient diverted large portions of the Imperial fleet from their main engagement in the Regina subsector, and brought the war to a stalemate that lasted some eleven months. Neither side could make any real advances, but the entire rear of the Imperial defense was threatened. The insertion of substantial reinforcements from the neighboring Sabine subsector eventually broke the deadlock, and forced the Zhodani hordes back.

Vanejen figured prominently in this campaign of the Third Frontier War. Originally settled in the third colonization wave of the Vilani Empire, circa 1230 VI, Vanejen regressed (along with most of the human worlds) to barbarism during the Long Night, and remained at low tech levels until recontacted in 980. Strategically, the Navy needed a rear area starbase from which to support the expulsion of the Outworlders; Vanejen looked to be most suitable. The local inhabitants became aware of their starfaring neighbors.

Ordinarily, this would be the cause of great civil upheaval, but the Navy was exceptionally prudent. Preliminary contacts were made; the ruling families were convinced that they could chart a well-planned course into their own future. The government of Vanejen was (and is) basically feudal, and (while static), was a comfortable sinecure for those in power. These ruling families each held their own territories, and competition had become essentially stylized, channelled into trade and commerce. The rulers could see the obvious appeals of progress, so long as their own power was not challenged.

In return for services to the Navy, the government received orbital surveys, computer simulations (complete with advisers to translate them), and basic technological assistance to get their programs moving. And then, the people in power translated their regional authority into monopolies in commerce and technology. The Margrave family, for example, assumed the monopoly on steel and construction metals, while the Flandren family took land transportation. Other families took other basic areas (such as communications, chemicals, or banking; sea transport was ultimately divided among several families), while long-range planning left open new areas (such as electronics, and gravities) to be issued to worthy or powerful groups which might arise in the course of time.

In the century since the naval base was established (and long since closed down), Vanejen has progressed slowly and deliberately from tech level 2 to tech level 5, while the original ruling families have retained their power in the planet-wide government.
