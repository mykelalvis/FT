Ao–dai Ao–dai 0401 E410644–6 0401 E410644–6 Z NA NI GZ NA NI G Ao-dai is a world very similar to Mars. It was ignored for centuries until the Zhodani discovered several rich deposits of lanthanum. It was not long after this that the Consulate established a small colony here and built several mining facilities. Full details can be found on page 9 (Passenger).
# DETAILS

The [[Ao-dai]] system has a planetoid belt, a gas giant and the planet of [[Ao-dai]] which is the furthest from the sun.

[[Ao-dai]] 0401 E410644–6 Z NA NI G [[Ao-dai]] is very similar to Mars in its size and surface conditions. It was of little importance to the [[Zhodani]] for centuries until they discovered deposits of [[lanthanum]] in 660. With this discovery, the Consulate established a small colony and built a number of mining facilities to extract and process the ore.

Most of the ore has since been mined out but many of the colonists remain. The few mining facilities that are still operational bring in enough credits to help support the dwindling population. [[Ao-dai]] is now of little strategic or economic value, so [[Zhodani]] patrols in this region are few and infrequent.

The habitat domes have all been built in craters that are the result of an orbital bombardment. Many people speculate that the craters were created by the Ancients, either the results of a failed experiment or the remnants of a terrible war.

# ATTITUDES

As one would expect with the Zhodani, most of the population are content with their lives on Ao-dai. They are indifferent to the few visitors that travel here; neither welcoming or hostile.

# LAWS

Anyone is permitted to land but travellers must notify the port authorities upon entering the [[Ao-dai]] system and must land at the starport. Personal weapons are allowed but automatic and heavier weapons are illegal, as are all narcotics.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

[[Ao-dai]] is an uninspiring world. Apart from the craters, which provide a topic of conversation, there is nothing else to bring travellers here other than a place to rest and refuel.

There are typical establishments as found in most [[Zhodani]] settlements but none are particularly memorable or noteworthy. To most travellers, [[Ao-dai]] is a boring backwater world where only the [[Zhodani]] would be content to live.
