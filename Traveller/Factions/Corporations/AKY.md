# AKY

Aiaokhtaoestiyh Kyoawaihoawea Yu Aiaokhtaoestiyh Kyoawaihoawea Yu (AKY) is an Aslan trading group whose vessels can be encountered almost anywhere. The company – the human term is useful but does not quite describe this grouping – is made up of assets from several clans, but does not contain all of the trading assets of any given clan. It might be best described as a special-purpose business group with some political overtones.

The purpose of the Aiaokhtaoestiyh Kyoawaihoawea Yu group, so far as it can be discerned by outside observers, is to generate wealth and prosperity for the clans providing assets to the group, and to ensure future prosperity. This means that AKY is not just about trading in the ports where its ships dock; it also wants to alter the local political climate so that future trade is more profitable and more importantly not endangered by outside events.

One important implication of this policy is that AKY is for the most part opposed to the activities of the typical ihatei group. Ihatei are all about grabbing land or territory wherever they can, which can create a backlash that may be detrimental to a clan’s trade in the area. The leaders of AKY recognise that the activities of ihatei are good and proper, and necessary to the future of their parent clan, but this does not rule out opposing

them if circumstances require it. Aiaokhtaoestiyh Kyoawaihoawea Yu is thus a stabilising influence along the frontiers, attempting to guide the actions of its associated clans’ ihatei in directions that provide maximum long-term benefit to the clan rather than to the specific band of ihatei.

When this policy works well, it means that well- respected AKY leaders meet with hot-blooded young ihatei and offer them guidance towards targets that benefit everyone in the longer term. If the ihatei go along with the advice, AKY will often support them – though usually in a fairly minor way. If they insist on going their own way, the worst-case scenario is that escort vessels operating under the Aiaokhtaoestiyh Kyoawaihoawea Yu banner may fire on ihatei ships, and AKY ground troops might even help defend a human settlement against encroaching ihatei. This causes a certain amount of friction, but this is accepted as part of the challenge facing an ambitious ihatei.

AKY operates a range of merchant ships, some of which are optimised for long-distance trade missions into the heart of the Imperium and other major powers. All vessels are well armed and carry a contingent of security troops, and in many cases a trade mission resembles a military convoy. Even on fairly short missions, it is not uncommon for a cluster of small to medium sized merchant vessels to be supported by tankers and escort ships, proceeding to a central point together before spreading out to trade in the local ports. This can be alarming for ship operators in that region; a dozen Aslan ships including three or four small warships suddenly jumping into a system can cause some concern.

It is an open secret that there is a political dimension to AKY’s activities. In addition to working towards better trading conditions and the creation of trade lanes, AKY gathers intelligence and attempts to sway local opinion in favour of closer ties with the Hierate. This is all done in a fairly blunt and open manner for the most part, with AKY taking the position that every major state does this sort of thing, and the Hierate is simply more honest about it than most.
