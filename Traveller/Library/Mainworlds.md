### MAINWORLDS

Most star systems are identified by their mainworld, the most important planet, moon or planetoid belt in the system. This is for the simple reason that people visit worlds, not stars. The mainworld of a system is usually the most habitable, but not always. It may be a moon of a gas giant or a planetoid belt, but most commonly it will be a planet of some kind.

The nature of the jump drive is such that unless there is a good (usually economic) reason to visit other worlds of a system, vessels tend to ply between mainworlds in different systems rather than less important worlds in the same system. It takes as long to jump a few hundred AU to an outsystem rockball as it does to travel to the much more important mainworld of the star system a parsec away.

For this reason, the remainder of a star system can be quite underdeveloped, although there may be outposts, mining stations and other installations, not all legal or above-board, scattered among the various bodies and planets of a system.

### Star Systems and Mainworlds

Most star systems are identified by their mainworld. That is, the most important planet, moon or planetoid belt in the system. This is for the simple reason that people visit worlds, not stars. The mainworld of a system is usually the most habitable, but not always. It may be a moon of a gas giant or a planetoid belt, but most commonly it will be a planet of some kind.

For this reason the remainder of a star system can be quite underdeveloped, though in many cases there will be outposts, mining stations and other installations, not all of them legal or above–board, scattered about the various bodies and planets of a given system.

### Starports and Spaceports

By convention, a world has only one Starport but can have many Spaceports. The designation Starport is given to the world's main port, where most commercial and passenger traffic goes. Any other port is designated a Spaceport. This can cause problems on Balkanized worlds where several governments exist; most will claim that their port is the main one. Usually, but not always, the Starport is the best port on the planet and others will be of inferior types. Normally there will be a main port accompanied by a 'Startown' which is often the planetary capital. The Startown is usually geared to offworld visitors and doing business with other star systems, and may have more relaxed attitudes or even laws than other regions of the planet. This is not always the case however. The Imperium considers that a Starport (but not usually a Spaceport) is Imperial territory, so that Imperial law and not local law applies there. In practice there is often a compromise in place, with shared jurisdiction in terms of law enforcement. Law levels vary from place to place, but the typical well–regulated starport tends to restrict visitors to sidearms – this may be more or less than people are permitted to own or carry outside the port. The Startown is planetary territory, not part of the port, and theoretically local law applies there. However, the Startown is often a buffer zone between world and port, and if there are radical differences in law level then sometimes the Startown has a special set of laws in place within its limits. The groundside part of a starport or spaceport is termed the 'Downport'. There may also be an orbital component termed the Highport. In some cases this is big enough to be a city in space, in which case there may be no need to go groundside at all if business can be conducted in orbit. As an example, an important system might have a large Highport serving a Downport at the capital. Big ships dock at the Highport and use shuttles for passenger and cargo transport; smaller vessels can land if they choose. From the orbital Highport it is possible to go to the main Downport or to Spaceports in each of half a dozen cities, plus a commercial port serving an industrial complex somewhere. Meanwhile there is a dedicated military port, a small government port and a couple of spaceports serving small installations on other bodies in the system,for example a mining colony on a moon of one of the gas giants. A minor system, on the other hand, may have little more than a shed and a marked landing area.
