### Meson Accelerator

Weapon which produces a beam of pi neutral mesons travelling at relativistic speeds. By controlling the speed of the beam, the mesons may be caused to decay inside the target, producing intense radiation effects. Since mesons do not interact with matter, ship armor offers no protection. Most large modern warships have meson accelerators as their main weaponry.
