# Atrake

Fruity wine produced on [[Zila]] from [[trake]]s. Atrake enjoys a solid reputation within the [[Aramis subsector]] as a quality wine. Trakes grown on [[Pysadi]], however, are acknowledged to be of superior quality to those grown on [[Zila]]. and atrake produced from Pysadian trakes is also superior: since winemaking is illegal on [[Pysadi]], the logistics of producing atrake from Pysadian trakes can be complex and the price is correspondingly high.
