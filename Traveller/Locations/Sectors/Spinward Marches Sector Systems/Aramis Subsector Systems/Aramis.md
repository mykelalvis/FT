# ARAMIS

Aramis is in [[Aramis Subsector]] as a part of a secondary main lying just off the coreward-trailing tip of the [[Spinward Main]]. A spur leads rimward into the [[Rhylanor subsector]] but the primary arm runs to trailing across the rimward end of [[Pretoria]]. This gives jump-2 access to [[Pretoria]] itself and the very edge of the Lamas [[subsector]] beyond, although astrography intervenes at that point.

As a result, [[Aramis]] and the region around it is something of a nexus for trade into Deneb as well as the [[Vargr Extents]] to coreward. Considerable quantities of goods come into Aramis Highport from Pretoria via jump-1 vessels plying the main and then transhipped aboard jump-2 vessels via [[Nutema]] and [[Celepina]], either to the [[Spinward Main]] or Rhylanor cluster.

Situated on the  [[Aramis Trace]] and giving its name to the region as well as the subsector is the world of Aramis l0?-'10-Al3B0655-Bi, trade center and subsector capital. The planet is some 9500 km in diameter, swathed with a swirling corrosive atmosphere that makes life on its dry desert surface intolerable. Nevertheless, the world boasts a population of nearly 620,000, almost all contained within the tunnels of its only city: [[#Leedor]].

There is a very healthy brokerage and private shipping industry operating out of Aramis Highport, in addition to vessels of the mid-level shipping line Akurat, a subsidiary of Tukera Lines dedicated to serving this region. Actual Tukera vessels do come this far coreward, if infrequently. Akurat ships call at the smaller ports of the coreward end of the subsector although their main business is done in the more settled areas towards the rimward ends of Aramis and Pretoria.

Few vessels proceed to the surface of Aramis. The world itself is forbidding, with a exotic atmosphere and no surface water. Despite this unpromising aspect, several hundred thousand people live in Aramis, underground in comfortable, high-tech and carefully sealed cities.

Aramis is the fief of an important member of the Tukera family, although it is not directly ruled - officially. The Marquis of Aramis is the richest and most powerful member of the ruling class on Aramis, all of whom are heads of critical industries or important businesses.
Thus, although the rank of Marquis is an Imperial title and does not confer rulership of the world, the Tukera family and the Marquis in particular dominate all government affairs.

Aramis also hosts both a naval and scout base. The naval base is co-located with the Highport and acts as the headquarters for the subsector fleet and system squadron, which is not large and augmented by a handful of system defence boats crewed by mercenaries. These are in service with the Aramis Port Authority but paid for by donations coming from the office of the Marquis. Heavy units of the Sector Fleet are based elsewhere in the subsector but there is usually a cruiser or carrier task group in the Aramis system on guardship deployment.

Guardships are usually deployed for several weeks at a time and normally relieved on station by a replacement vessel or task force. It is not possible to maintain many such standing deployments, especially of larger vessels like heavy cruisers, without diluting naval strength in the region excessively. Most naval deployments are part of a patrol schedule whereby vessels proceed through a series of locations in the course of a cruise, staying a few days at each before moving to the next.

The fact that Aramis enjoys the more-or-less permanent assignment of a heavy cruiser or similar-sized vessel, along with escorts and support vessels, suggests the navy considers it to be of great importance. However, there are plenty of other ports which see more trade and a lot of worlds whose industrial base is greater, so what is so special about Aramis?

The answer, at least as far as most cynics are concerned, is that Aramis is the fief of a senior member of a megacorporate family and given naval protection as a result of his firm's importance to the Imperium.

Whether or not this is true, the location of Aramis at the coreward end of the subsector protects it from most raids launched by corsairs out of the Vargr Extents.
Akurat vessels are well defended and more than a match for a typical merchant-ship-turned-corsair. However, their very toughness makes them a target for a certain kind of raider captain, who seeks to make a reputation back home as much as profit from his voyages. Although requiring heavy firepower, good planning and luck, such strikes have been successful. As a rule, however, pirates tend to go after easier targets.

The Aramis scout base is not large, being mainly concerned with supporting the x-boat route from Rhylanor to Pretoria. Survey and exploration vessels operate out of this base, mainly to monitor and collect data on the rimward parts of the subsector; affairs to coreward are the province of the much larger way station at Junidy and the smaller base at Nasemin.

# Places of Interest

## The Starport

Aramis has a [[Class A Starport]] at [[#Leedor]] with an associated [[naval base]], [[scout base]], and shipyard (operated by the megacorporation [[Naasirka]]).

Situated on a mesa in the lee of a large mountain range, Aramis Down starport is (on the surface) simply a well-lit patch of bedrock and a few phased-array detector towers. Flanking the main landing pad are smaller, similar pads for an Imperial [[Naval Base]], an imperial [[Scout Base]], and the [[Naasirka]] Shipyard. Only a very few squat buildings poke their roofs above the rock level-to contain back-up systems that require a line-of-sight to the landing pads. Studded throughout the landing pads are a series of airlock hatches, sturdily reinforced and shielded; properly aligning a ship with one of these hatches allows the crew and passengers to leave and enter a warren of tunnels that form the starport itself without becoming exposed to the corrosive atmosphere of Aramis. At greater intervals are larger cargo hatches that allow offloading freight and goods in suitable protective containers. Finally, there are several lift elevators which can lower entire ships into large chambers away from the corrosive atmosphere for the offloading of delicate cargo, live animals, or unprotected goods. The [[Naasirka]] yard has several of these elevators for convenience in ship repairs, and the March Harrier is in one of [[Naasirka]]'s underground bays.

### The Library

The starport library contains large amounts of information about the subsector beyond the [[Aramis Trace]].
### The Starport Terminal

Ships that call at Aramis are principally interested in the starport where goods are offloaded, passengers discharged, new passengers found, new freight contracted for, and commodities bought and sold for speculation. The starport enjoys extra-territoriality; individuals who make use of its facilities are not subject to the laws of Aramis, provided they do not leave the protective confines of the starport.

The terminal contains offices, customs inspection stations, and a hotel for those who prefer to stay outside Leedor: crews often live in their ships and order supplies delivered from the city.

### The Naval Base

The Imperium maintains a small naval base and the 219th Imperial Cruiser Squadron (CruRon 219) operates its forces from [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis|Aramis]]. The naval base includes landing pads, basic repair and damage control facilities, and living and training areas.

### The Scout Base

The Imperial Interstellar [[Scout Service]] maintains a base on Aramis. The base supports the express boat tender in the system, provides the local [[x-boat]] messages office (where messages may be deposited for forwarding), and supports a fleet of 2 to 7 scout/couriers which forward messages to worlds not on the main routes.

### The Naasirka Shipyards

Naasirka. a megacorporation involved in communications equipment and small craft, operates the shipyard facility at Ararnis. Although the yard is capable of building starships, its major occupation is the overhaul of ships in order to meet their annual maintenance requirements.

## Leedor

![[CT-TTA-075.jpg|100]]
[[CT-TTA-075.jpg|Leedor]]

 The city is the personal fief of the [[Marquis of Aramis]], and all important posts and contracts are let on the Marquis' sufferance and can be cancelled at his whim.

Leedor grew up in the wake of the extensive mining at this particular point on Aramis. The mines were the reason for the establishment of the starport, and their empty shafts soon became used as quarters, storage, business locations, administrative offices, and sites for supporting operations. Today, the mines have extended far beyond the city, following the veins into the mountains. What was left behind has become the city of Leedor.

Leedor sprawls, just as the mines sprawled. The city is defined by a major east-west thoroughfare called Founder's Way. This avenue leads from the starport to the Marquis' Palace. Flanking the way is the business district filled with shops, stores, and warehouse outlets. To the north are residential areas, Startown for the drifters and spacers, the Plazas for executives and the well-to-do, and Wallside for the more ordinary citizens. To the south is the mining district connected to the main tunnels leading to the mines.

The city is small in area and originally expanded without rhyme or reason, remaining relatively small in population. During the Civil War, Aramis' mines produced crucial supplies of materials for the manufacturing complex at Rhylanor and were occupied by Imperial Marines for a time in order to keep them producing, in the prosperity following the war, Leedor expanded, and the Naasirka yard was engaged in the production of express boat equipment for several decades. Now the economic boom has passed, but Leedor still enjoys a prosperous lifestyle.

### The Slidewalks

In the period following the war, Leedor went through a period of renewal and many of its older, shabby areas were renovated. In addition, the old access tunnels were straightened and equipped with slidewalks. Slidewalks are a people-transport device intended to cut down on the number of vehicles required in the congested corridors of Leedor. Typically, corridors are about 20 meters wide, with six meters on each side given over to sidewalks to give access to the various entrances along the corridor walls. The central 8 meters is occupied by two 3-meter slidewalks moving in opposite directions, separated by a 2-meter buffer of sidewalk. Each slidewalk extends the length of a city block (about 150 meters) before ending at the intersection. Sliders then walk across the intersection and board the slidewalk, for the next block.

Most slidewalks are slow (about 5 kph) and offer no real advantage over walking, except for the energy saved in standing rather than walking. Long trips through town can be made easier by virtue of the fact that the slidewalk is free and goes everywhere.

Some basic thoroughfares (Founder's Way. Cross-Town Link, Wall Street, and Tunnel Strip) have an elevated strip that makes 10kph without breaks at intersections and thus provide faster transport to various parts of the city. As a result, most individuals use the major thoroughfares to move to an area of the city and then walk to their destination.

Because the slidewalks cannot handle the transport of large amounts of goods for sale, consumption, or distribution, a limited number of small electric trucks are operated by transport companies. The slidewalks are stopped (actually, they run intermittently and are stopped without warning) for several hours each day (midnight to 6 AM of the Imperial standard day) in order to allow the trucks to move through the city with deliveries. Private operation of the small flatbed trucks is not allowed, and all driving is in the hands of local licensed transport companies.

The elevated major thoroughfares run at all times; since their operation will not interfere with the movement of the trucks, they need not be stopped.

### Air Tax

Because the environment within the city of Leedor is entirely self-contained and replenished through the municipal air plant, the city has adopted an air tax to defray the costs involved. All individuals entering the city (through the starport, any one of the bases, the shipyard, or through the mine tunnels) are called upon to pay a basic air tax of Cr10 per day spent within the city.

The collection booths will issue a bracelet which indicates payment of the tax and the expiration date. Bracelets are chemically coded to turn yellow 48 hours prior to expiretion, ﬁnd orange 24 hours prior to expiration. They turn red when the tax payment period has ended.

It is considered severely ungracious to utilize the air and facilities of the city without paying a fair share of the costs. To avoid embarrassment, locals generally renew their air tax bracelets before they turn orange (they receive credit for the unused portion when it is turned in).

The local enforcers will tend to stop individuals with yellow or orange bracelets and warn them that their air tax will expire shortly; they automatically stop anyone with a red bracelet and arrest the individual on a charge of tax evasion. When throwing for police harassment in Leedor (6dailyl, impose a DM of2 if bracelet is yellow, -4 if it is orange, and - 6 if it is red. Local citizens will be apt to refuse services to anyone wearing a red bracelet. The city keeps computer records of air tax payments, and anyone (especially a visitor) whose tax payment is delinquent for more than a month may be visited by police. When leaving Leedor, bracelets may be turned in to a checkpoint attendant for credit an unused days remaining.

The air tax is not charged for individuals who remain in the starport or who transfer directly to the [[naval base]], the [[scout base]], or the shipyard.

## Residential Areas

There are four major residential areas in Leedor: Wallside, the Plazas, the mining district, and Startown.

### Wallside

The major middle-class residential area in Leedor is Wallside. It includes large numbers of apartments separated by small parks, schools, and stores providing food and sundries. A great deal of business is conducted from these apartments via computer terminal. The standard of living in Wallside is relatively high.

### The Plazas

These are three areas of upper-class residential apartments and estates. Separated from the city proper by a restricted number of entrance ways, the Plazas are small areas isolated from the everyday routine of the city. Each of the three separate areas has its own parks, guards, and facilities. The Plazas are for the idle rich, the powerful executives, and their families. Entrance is allowed only upon invitation from a resident.

### The Mining District

Here are the slums of Leedor. Some portions are no more than unfinished rock walls, while others are haphazardly partitioned by curtains or foam packaging material, in many cases, the slidewalks are not functioning or have never been installed. Non-residents are advised not to enter the area or, if they must, only in groups of four or more.

### Startown

The edges of Startown are indistinct. Closest to the starport are a variety of establishments that cater to the starport trade, supplying food and drink, entertainment, spacefarer's goods, and novelties from Aramis. The quality of Startown improves the farther one goes from the starport gate until (several blocks away) one finally finds quality lodging and decent food.

## Business Districts

The city of Leedor has three business districts: Downtown, Startown, and the Mining District. Startown and the Mining District are also residential areas.

### Downtown

This area flanks Founder's Way and is the city's major commercial district. Prominent corporations, banks, and stores maintain quarters along Founder's Way: the most prestigious locations are closer to the Marquis' Palace and directly on the Way. Other companies must be satisfied with stores farther afield.

### The Mining District

If one cares to visit it, this area can be the source of reasonable bargains, if one is not too scrupulous about buying stolen goods or receiving substandard items.

### Startown

Catering as it does to the spaceferer, Startown has a greater variety of goods of direct interest to them including vacc suits, basic life support items, and other equipment for spaceships and their crews.

## The Marquis's Palace

At the head of Founder's Way is the Marquis's Palacean elegant structure built in the years following the Civil War and the Second Frontier War. Unlike other structures in the city - which rise floor to ceiling within the tunnel - the palace is built under a domed portion of the old mines and has a roof and clear space between the roof and the ceiling of the tunnels. Spectacularly lit, the palace is a showplace of beauty as well as a seat of government.

### The Marquis of Aramis

As an Imperial noble, the [[Marquis Leonard Bolden-Tukera of Aramis]] holds his patent directly from the Emperor, although the channels of allegiance provide (and requirei fealty to intervening nobles between him and the Emperor. The Marquisate is a hereditary position which, on Aramis, has made him ruler of the planet.

The Marquis owes allegiance to the Count Knowln of Celepina (in nearby [[Rhylanor subsector]]), who in turn owes allegiance to the [[Duke of Rhylanor]], one of several Dukes in the [[Spinward Marches]].

The Marquis, as head of the feudal technocracy of Aramis, grants a variety of subordinate positions in city government to citizens of Aramis and Leedor in return for money, pledges of loyalty, and other services.

## Other Attractions

Leedor is underground, tunneled into bedrock and often following the now empty veins from which era has been extracted. The city's population pursues many occupations: mining, local and subsector governmental bureaucracy, life support for the City, light manufacturing, working for the local shipyard and starport, and various jobs at the scout and naval bases. The city is a comfortable home and a reasonable provider for hundreds of thousands.

Leedor is full of interesting places and things to see. The two weeks that the group spends in the city should probably be full of opportunities to see new things and meet new people.

#### The Mines

Visitors have an opportunity to see large scale ore extraction in progress.

#### Cavern Park

At the north end of the city, situated just beyond the residential district of Wallside, is Cavern Park -a natural cavern encountered early in the mining history of the city. The natural beauty of the cave led to its preservation (actually, about two-thirds of the cavern was destroyed by mining and excavation; much of it is now the building filled portion of Wallside) as a park for all in the city to enjoy. The stalactites and stalagmite formations and the precipitated minerals on its walls and floors make it a thing of beauty. At the entrance to the cavern (a slidewalk leads about halfway in) a souvenir shop sells small electronic flashers-each has a battery that lasts about a half-hour; tourists enjoy observing the fluorescent, patterns that the flashers produce. In addition. Several walls within the cavern have large sections of fluorescent minerals; a flasher set off to cast a shadow will leave a lingering shadow on the wall, to the delight of visitors.

A warning on the flasher warns its use may be dangerous to the eyes and to exercise care to avoid temporary or permanent blindness. 

Referee: When the flasher is used in any situation where it is unexpected, throw victim's dexterity or less to avoid temporary blindness (1D minutes). Temporary blindness causes the individual to be unable to run, maneuver with any accuracy, or fire weapons with accuracy. Apply a DM of -6 to hit with gunfire and -8 to hit with blade weapons.

#### Downtown

This area contains theaters with live productions of plays as well as filmed and holographic versions of classic literature. Ticket prices vary from Cr1-10.

#### Escanil Park

In the center of Leedor is a large, serene park (open to a limited number of individuals for a fee of Cr5 each) with live creatures and holographic imitations combined to trick the eye.

#### The Museum of Aramis

The local museum covers the history of the world, as well as showing other interesting facts about the universe.

![[CT-TTA-085.jpg|200]]
[[CT-TTA-085.jpg|Museum of Aramis]][[CT-TTA-085b.jpg|Rotated right]]


The Museum of Aramis occupies one city block in the underground city of Leedor in an otherwise unremarkable business district. Its walls blend well with the neo-Imperial style (smooth walls with a band of bas-relief sculpture at eye level) of this portion of the city. The museum is situated several blocks off the major traffic routes, but comfortably close to the [[#Escanil Park]]. On school days, the local educational institutions often bring children to see the exhibits, which are changed frequently. The Museum of Aramis is a science and technology oriented museum, with exhibits on the physical universe and the technological environment in which the citizens of Aramis live.

The museum complex entrance leads directly into animposing foyer providing a dominating view of the major exhibit: an early scout ship of the type which originally surveyed Aramis in 305. Flanking the foyer are the museum offices, gift shop, check room, question and answer terminals, and an information kiosk. Beyond, in the interior of the museum, are many long galleries providing exhibits of interesting aspects of the universe.

Each exhibit in the Museum of Aramis has a prerecorded commentary, which is broadcast to small headsets rented at the entrance to the museum. A visitor dons these earphones and walks around the museum. When the earphones enter the area near an exhibit, they receive the commentary for that exhibit. Different languages have different frequencies, and a visitor can have an earphone set for a given frequency at the time of rental.

Most of the exhibits in the museum are prepared by offplanet agencies (such as large universities, major Imperial museums, government bodies such as the [[scout service]]'s contact and liaison branch, and special interest groups such as manufacturers' organizations) and are sent on long term loan to small museums such as this one, in this way the museum gets better exhibits than it could prepare on its own.

_The Hall of Animals_ contains stuffed animals and holographic displays of dozens of interesting animals from all over the [[Imperium]]. The exhibit stresses how similar environments on different planets can produce animals which are externally very much alike, but which differ radically in other respects.

_Our World_ is designed with lower educational levels in mind. The centerpiece of the exhibit is a large globe of Aramis, with the chief points of interest marked with glowing lights. Other displays include a holographic diorama of the founding of the first colony on Aramis. Other displays show plants, animals, and minerals native to the planet, and short presentations of geology, history, and other topics of local interest.

__Our Subsector__ contains a holographic starmap of [[Aramis subsector]], more dioramas of major historical events in the subsector, and displays of interesting geological features of the worlds of the subsector. It also contains a large animated map illustrating the products of the subsector and the patterns of interstellar trade, both within the subsector and with other parts of the [[Imperium]].

__The Imperium__ is designed to impress the population with the power and majesty of the [[Imperium]], and to instill pride and patriotism in its citizens. The displays concentrate on the history and settlement of the [[Spinward Marches]], and the importance of the region to the [[Imperium]].

_The Stars: How They Work_ deals with the birth and evolution of stars and planetary systems. The displays show how fusion works, how elements are created inside stars, and the life cycles of the various types of stars. The exhibit has a magnificent holographic display of the various ways different sorts of stars die.

![[CT-TTA-087.jpg|100]]
[[CT-TTA-087.jpg|Meson Gun]]

__Weapons of the Starfleets__ is a display sponsored by [[Ling Standard Products|LSP]], and is designed to acquaint the general public with the various main armaments employed on large starships land to serve as a subtle advertisement for [[Ling Standard Products]]. A key feature of the display is a scale model of a type J [[meson accelerator]], sectioned in half and labeled with colored lights and holographic gimmicks.


_Glass: Then and Now_ is sponsored by the megacorporation [[Makhidkarun]] and the Ceramics Institute of Sylea to serve as an advertisement for various manufacturers' luxury crystal products, to display the works of some of [[Makhidkarun]] artisans, and to provide an educational exhibit land subsequent tax write-offs) for local manufacturers. The displays contain dioramas showing the history of glass manufacture, and hundreds of examples of stained glass window, tableware, crystal sculpture, and other artistic use of glass and ceramic materials.

_Zhodani Perfidy_ is a description of [[Zhodani]] culture, government, and society, slanted heavily towards the lmperial view. The displays are designed to sway public opinion against the [[Zhodani Consulate]], and demonstrate Zhodani aggression with regards to the [[Spinward Marches]]. Holographic displays of major battles and scenes of Zhodani atrocities are predominant.

_Physical Principles_ is an exhibit aimed at the elementary school level, and is designed to explain fundamental laws of physics. Exhibits explain the basics by means of animated displays, hands-on exhibits and demonstrations, and simple question and answer games.

_600 Years of Progress_ examines key inventions of the last six centuries, with emphasis on the improving quality of life over that span. Small holographic dioramas depict the discovery of each invention: and the commentary knits all cfthem together into a coherent sweep demonstrating the continual improvement of the standard of living.

_Fashions of Yesteryear_ depicts the history of costume from the beginning of history to the present, covering swings of fashion for the major cultures of the [[Imperium]] in an interesting and educational way.

_Interstellar Neighbors_ deals with the major and minor races of the [[Imperium]], their characteristics, their histories, and how they all live together in harmony. This exhibit is sponsored by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service's Contact and Liaison Branch as a means of reducing interspecies conflict and misunderstanding.

_Communications_ explains the means by which information is sent over distances, with dioramas demonstrating maior communications systems of the past and present. Working models, of primitive and modern communications devices are available for hands-on study by visitors.

Several parts of the museum are not open to the public. A large environment control area provides ventilation, temperature, and humidity controls for the museum's interior. Several workshops occupy a back room of the complex.

To the left of the main entrance is a small entry from outside leading to a reception room, and on to the staff library, the environment controls, and the restrooms. This entry also provides a rear entrance to the gift shop and check room for employees.

Inside the main foyer, to the right, are the main offices of the museum including conference rooms, a computer room, offices for staff and executives, and a vault for the storage of items not on display.

## The Deserts

Few people live outside of the city of [[#Leedor]]; those who do maintain weather monitoring stations or scientific data collectors, or rove about in ATVs prospecting for exploitable mineral deposits.
