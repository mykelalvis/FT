The indigenous population of[[Foelen]] are an aquatic race, resulting from the genetic manipulation of dolphins by the Ancients. Although the Chokari (literally meaning 'water people') are not confined to the oceans, they are happiest when they are in or near water. They are humanoid in appearance and size with several notable features:

- Their skin is darker than most humans and is mottled with hues of greens and blues.
- They have webbed hands and feet.
- Chokari find it easy to learn new languages but they speak with a distinct clicking sound.
- Chokari do not have a nose and therefore have no sense of smell.
- The Chokari have acute hearing giving them +2 DM to any related skill check (such as Recon).
- Chokari have the following traits: Aquatic, Fast Metabolism, Notable Intelligence (+2), Psionic, Weak Dexterity (â€“2).

The Chokari are a peaceful race and despite the hostilities with the Zhodani, they rarely fight their oppressors. When defending themselves, most Chokari will try to use their psionic abilities in a non-lethal way but some will be more aggressive.

Chokari society is tribal and there are thousands of different tribes living on Foelen. Due to the peaceful nature of the Chokari there is no hostility between tribes, just different customs and outlooks. Some tribes are more amenable to the [[Zhodani]] but it is simply to make life easier for their tribe. Many of these tribes also seek to secretly undermine the Zhodani. Most tribes continue to live a traditional Chokari lifestyle but some have accepted technology into enhance their lives.

It is also important to note here that the Chokari are different to the minor race called [[Dolphin]] who were uplifted by the [[Solomani]]. Although both races originated from the Earth dolphin they have evolved into very different and separate species.
