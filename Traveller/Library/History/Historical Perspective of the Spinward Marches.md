## Historical Perspective of the Spinward Marches

To understand why the sector is the way it is, it is necessary to look back over its long and somewhat troubled history.

It seems that the [[Ancients]] were active in the [[Spinward Marches]], as is evidenced by the transplanted [[Terra|Terran]] species; various animals and plants native to [[Terra]] and other distant worlds were found in the region when human exploration began. There were also humans living in the area; the [[Darrian]] people, for one, and the rather more powerful [[Zhodani]].

There are also some interesting anomalies. Several [[Ancients]] sites and many artefacts have been located, and the [[Ancients]] are thought to have been somehow responsible for [[Shionthy]] being an asteroid belt; there is strong evidence that it was a planet until, in cosmological terms, quite recently.

However, little is known about ancient times in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. Archaeologists uncover new data from time-to-time but the work is intermittent and piecemeal. Evidence has been found of non-human civilizations dating from the distant past but which are not thought to be associated with the [[Ancients]]. Perhaps time and research will make this clearer.

In the meantime, it is known that the [[Ancients]] were here at some point and they did a number of things that suggest a lengthy stay. They are gone now. Beyond that, everything is a matter for conjecture.

The [[Ancients]] appear to have transplanted humans from [[Terra]] (and possibly modified them).  These were the [[Zhodani]] and the [[Darrians]].

Several hundred thousand years later, the eventual inhabitants of the [[Sword Worlds]] arrived.

Another influence on the region, albeit a minor one, was exerted by the [[Aslan]]. The Aslan home region lies across the [[Great Rift]] and, although they have possessed jump drive technology for 2,000 years, the [[Aslan]] have only recently arrived in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. In 585, several groups of Aslan _ihatei_ offered to fight for the [[Darrian Confederation]] in return for grants of land. Since that time, the [[Darrian Confederation]] has had a fair sized Aslan population and recruited many thousands of Aslan troops into its armed forces.

### The Imperium in the Marches

The [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] was founded in [[IY0000]] and expanded quickly at first. After the end of the [[Pacification Campaigns]], this changed and the [[Imperium]] as an entity was no longer concerned with expansion. It was entirely willing to accept new members, and for corporations and other bodies to launch expeditions beyond its borders, but the initial deliberate expansion had been replaced by a gradual 'border creep'.

Expansion to coreward was curtailed by the [[Vargr Extents]], a large area filled with small states and independent worlds with mostly [[Vargr]] populations. Major states were encountered in most other directions, or rifts created natural barriers. However, there was a narrow corridor between the coreward end of the [[Great Rift]] and the [[Vargr extents]], and through this bottleneck the [[Imperium]] gradually expanded into the region beyond.  This area is often referred to as lying behind the claw, as the shape of the [[Great Rift]] resembles a lobster claw.

When they began exploring, early [[Scout Service|Imperial scouts]] found an underpopulated region that eventually led to the [[Sword Worlds Confederation|Sword Worlds]] and [[Darrian Confederation]]s. These two small but developed powers lay close together, islands in a sea of unclaimed worlds. Before meeting them, however, the Imperial scouts ran into the [[Zhodani]] in Year 50. Initial contact was tentative and it was some time before the scale of the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] was appreciated.

After establishing a forward base at [[Deneb]], the [[Scout Service|scouts]] pushed on to open up the region and behind them came traders and colonists. In the region around [[Deneb]] itself, to trailing of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], expansion was rapid and many colonies received considerable investment, resulting in the creation of several economically important worlds. Movement into [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] was slower and made in piecemeal fashion.

One of the biggest developments for [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] was the establishment of a trading settlement at Mora. Set up by [[Ling Standard Products]] in Year 60, this was initially the far end of a long trade route through Corridor and [[Deneb Sector]]. Over the years, it gradually developed into a forward base for trade with the new colonies of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and the states encountered there.

Contact with the [[Sword Worlds]] was in [[IY0073]], but it was not until [[IY0148]] that the [[Darrians]] met the Imperials. During this time, the [[Sword Worlds]] managed to create a new unified government, the Triple Dominion (shared by [[Anduril]], [[Colada]] and [[Dyrnwyn]]), which lasted from [[IY0104]] to [[IY0217]]. It may be that the Sword Worlders deliberately discouraged the Imperials from moving through their territory and thus meeting their Darrian rivals. Certainly, the number of scouting missions in that direction dropped rapidly.

By [[IY0200]], Imperial interest in new territory, especially in distant regions that were hard to reach, had waned. Expansion in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] proceeded in a disjointed manner, fuelled by economics and on a small scale. The presence of the [[Spinward Main]] enabled easy access to large parts of the sector but the remainder was largely ignored and there was little interest in pushing beyond, even to spinward or rimward where there were open borders. To coreward, the [[Zhodani Consulate]] blocked further expansion.

In [[IY0250]], the [[Imperium]] had spread into those parts of the sector easily reachable via the [[Spinward Main]], bypassing less accessible regions. [[Regina]], settled as early as [[IY0075]], became a major trade center, acting as a hub for half a dozen neighboring worlds. By [[IY0250]], this number had grown to 17, although some were very minor colonies.  Expansion slowed further as easily-reached worlds were taken. Colonies grew into independent world-states in their own right and the region developed a respectable economy. However, backwaters remained exactly that; few new colonies were founded in most parts of the sector.

### War

By 500, tensions with the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]] were rising as Imperial expansion, although slow, had resulted in Imperial and Zhodani colonies being intermingled along the border. After a period of escalating tensions, war broke out in 589. The conflict took the form of skirmishing along the border and deep raids into the sector against the main Imperial worlds. The [[Imperial Navy]] was caught at less than full readiness and the Zhodani formed the first [[Outworld Coalition]] with [[Vargr]] states in the [[Gvurrdon sector]].

Eventually, the Imperials were able to force a stalemate and the subsequent armistice, enacted in [[IY0604]], ended what is now known as the [[First Frontier War]]. The [[Imperium]] lost territory but was compensated with ownership of large unclaimed areas of the sector. Had the [[Zhodani]] wanted these systems, they had had centuries to take them unopposed, so this was an easy concession for them to make.

The Imperial commander in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]],  Grand [[Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell]], was deeply disgusted at the lack of support he had received during the war. Desperately needed reinforcements were not released from other sector fleets despite Plankwell's entreaties. When they finally arrived, the reinforcements were enough to force a stalemate, after which Plankwell used them for another purpose.

With a fleet at his back,  [[Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell|Plankwell]] advanced on [[Capital]], assassinated [[Empress Jacqueline]] and took the [[Iridium Throne]] for himself. This began the [[Civil War]], during which a series of emperors ruled for brief periods. These [[Emperors of the Flag]] or Barracks Emperors were almost all naval commanders who defeated the last claimant only to fall in battle themselves.

While the [[Civil War]] was raging, the [[Outworld Coalition]] reformed and struck again, in 615. The [[Second Frontier ]]War, which lasted until 620, was characterised by a brilliant, if rather desperate, holding action orchestrated by Grand Admiral [[Arbellatra Alkhalikoi]], coupled with raids by Imperial cruiser forces into enemy territory.  Benefiting from a crash-building program to replace losses incurred in the Frontier and Civil wars, [[Arbellatra Alkhalikoi|Arbellatra]] fought the [[Outworld Coalition]] to a bloody standstill. She unilaterally negotiated an armistice that ceded more Imperial territory to the [[Zhodani]] and, as [[Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell|Plankwell]] before her, advanced on [[Capital]].

The [[Second Frontier War]] ended in 620 and, in 622, Grand Admiral [[Arbellatra Alkhalikoi|Arbellatra]] reached [[Capital]] and defeated the fleet of [[Emperor Gustus]]. Rather than simply take the crown, she appointed herself regent, holding the throne in trust until the Imperial Moot could settle the matter of succession. Arbellatra was made Regent in 622 and crowned Emperor by [[the Moot]] in 629, ending the [[Civil War]] and beginning the modern dynasty.

These events stripped [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] of its fleet but there was no resumption of hostilities with the Zhodani for many years. Indeed, it was not until 979 that conflict broke out once again. There had been incidents, and even a few skirmishes, in the intervening time and tensions had been rising for some years.

Despite this, the Imperial response was disjointed and, overall, inadequate. The war mainly took the form of commerce raiding by cruisers while the battle fleets of both sides faced off but did little. The Navy and Emperor himself were censured for their lack of activity and, eventually, in 986 a peace agreement was reached.  The terms were unfavorable to the [[Imperium]] and this, coupled with general disaffection over the way the war was prosecuted, resulted in the abdication of [[Emperor Styryx]].

The settlement eliminated problematical border regions and allowed a good defensive frontier to be set-up in accordance with the 'thin hard crust' strategy then in use. This strategic model called for a forward defensive zone to be held as strongly as possible but was replaced by a more flexible system of defence in depth.

Peace returned to [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], although elsewhere the [[Solomani Rim War]] distracted Imperial attention. Then, in [[IY1082]], the [[Fourth Frontier War]] erupted. This conflict was triggered by an unintentional incident and took the form of a series of naval battles along the frontier.  It was over quickly; peace was made in 1084, before the Emperor's orders for conduct of the war or any significant reinforcements reached [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. Again, there was some slight realignment of borders.

Since the end of the [[Fourth Frontier War|False War]], as it is sometimes known, the region has existed in relative peace. There are troubles on various worlds, the occasional Imperial intervention or trade war between corporations and so forth, but there are no indications that major troubles are brewing.
