Like the neighboring Lamas subsector, Antra is a border region, with nine of its 25 worlds lying outside the [[Imperium]]. Economically, the subsector is not well developed and often considered to be somewhere to be passed through or bypassed altogether rather than a destination for goods or investment. This situation is not improved by the difficult conditions in Lamas, to spinward.

Antra is astrographically scattered. Although stellar density is not unusually low, there are no large mains or clusters to create favorable conditions for trade.  The largest local cluster is connected to the subsector capital, Antra itself, but lies mostly in Lamas with all the difficulties that entails. The handful of Imperial worlds around Ostov are connected to a main running into non-aligned space to coreward but are too underdeveloped to take advantage of cross-border trade opportunities.  Indeed, these worlds are more a liability than an asset as they offer an easy route into the [[Imperium]] for smugglers, corsairs and carpetbaggers hoping to make a big score in the chaotic economic environment of the subsector.

The central part of the subsector is devoid of stars, creating a barrier to rapid communications and interstellar commerce. The systems to trailing are likewise also cut off from most of Million by another rift.
Thus, the political and economic leaders of Antra tend to think in terms of the strip of worlds along the rimward end of the subsector, with everything beyond essentially out of reach. This is not a universal mindset; there are a few outward-looking corporations and small shipping lines that work hard to create trade links coreward to the border. The difficulties they face suggest that conventional wisdom is based upon at least a half-decent appraisal of the situation.

Antra is protected by the 151st fleet, which has a higher than usual allocation of high-jump couriers and fast-response vessels to help secure distant parts of the subsector. This is a mixed blessing; the sector commander routinely borrows these assets to undertake missions elsewhere and it is not uncommon for returning ships to be shortstopped by other commanders to deal with problems in their locality. As a result, the 151 st Fleet is chronically understrength and has lost its best assets but on paper it looks very capable. This makes getting replacements or even just securing the return of borrowed vessels a difficult business.
