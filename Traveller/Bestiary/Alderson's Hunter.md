# Alderson's Hunter

Alderson's coastal hunter, more commonly referred to as an Alderson or Alderson's Hunter, has a broad body about half a metre long, covered in thick scales, plus a whip-like tail roughly the same length as the body. The Alderson has a pair of puny lobster-like claws but normally hunts by either surging from cover to grab small prey or entangling larger invertebrates with its tail. Aldersons can give a human a nasty bite and are tenacious if they feel their territory is being threatened or they mistakenly entangle a diver's limb with their tails. Their armour plates make them difficult to kill with a knife.
