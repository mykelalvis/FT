# Skymelon

Pungent, sharptasting fruit grown on [[Pysadi]]. The skymelon grows on vines which co-exist with trees; the fruit appears in the upper reaches of the branches, making it difficult to harvest. Many farms have induced the vines to grow instead on trellises with overhead catwalks to facilitate harvesting. Skymelons have a light blue interior color, hence the name.
