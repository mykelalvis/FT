Dunea was once home to the Chanestin Kingdom, an interstellar empire conquered by the Imperium in the year 2. The Chanestin worlds were pacified and some occupied for a time before being turned over to self-rule. Even after over 1,100 years of Imperial citizenship, the Chanestin people have clung to their cultural heritage and have found it difficult to assimilate. All eight of the Amber Zones in the subsector have been designated due to the activity of Chanestin separatists. A great deal of unrest has sprung up on these worlds and there is a burgeoning movement to create a Chanestin cultural zone similar to that of the Sylean Worlds. Cultural zones have been afforded to human Minor Races and cultural groups that have found it difficult to fully accept Imperial hegemony. While the Emperor is considering the possibility, he does not want to set a bad precedent. The Imperium wants to emphasise inclusion, not division. If too many groups are granted cultural zones, the Imperium could become a fractious entity, which is the last thing the Emperor wants.

The Emperor must tread a fine line with the Chanestin Crisis. The Imperium has had to put down revolts before and they are unpleasant affairs to say the least. The Chanestins have little in the way of resources to stage a bona fide revolt and everyone knows this. With ultra-high-tech surveillance gear and  highly trained counterinsurgency operatives at their disposal, the Imperium has the upper hand. Without the ability to actually make things uncomfortable for the Imperium, it would appear that the Chanestins do not have much of a leg to stand on. However, this is the Core and appearances are important. The Emperor certainly does not want to see a multi- world insurgency occur in his home sector, even one hopelessly doomed to fail. The Moot is divided on the subject. While some are determined that the Imperium must draw a line in the sand and deny the Chanestin request, others believe it to be more expedient to simply give them what they want so that the Core can move on to more pressing matters.

Meanwhile, the Imperium has done what it can to keep the peace. None of the Chanestin worlds are under Imperial military rule but the armed forces do have a presence on most of the systems that they claim. The Imperial Navy 132nd Fleet, headquartered at Uundizi, keeps a watchful eye on the Chanestin worlds and has been quick to respond when there are riots, mass insurrections or terrorist acts. In addition to its role as a link on the x-boat routes, the Scout Service way station at Ginnekar also maintains a small fleet of jump-6 couriers to keep Capital abreast of current events should things go awry.

The coreward portion of Dunea has a moderate-sized stellar gap, which makes for a somewhat challenging passage to the rest of the Core. The worlds in and around this gap have formed strong commercial ties with one another, anchored by the efforts of the Uundizi, Zimmel and Bussirka starports. This trio would very much like to incorporate the Chanestin worlds into what could become a vibrant subsector economy. While the Chanestin buy goods from coreward Dunea, many of them levy ‘phantom taxes’ on visiting traders. It is against Imperial law to hinder free trade but making things inconvenient by charging exorbitant prices for routine services and fuel and finding other ways to gum up the works are workable methods to hamper the flow of commerce. The Chanestin are playing with fire here since free trade is the law of the Imperium. Should tensions escalate, the Imperial Navy could apply a form of gunship diplomacy by taking over starport operations on the Chanestin worlds and forcing them to play fair. The Imperium sincerely hopes it does not come to that.
