# Eneri's Cantina

Just off of [[Affinity#Restoration Plaza]], Eneri's features a bi-level layout with a single bar on the lower level and copious seating in booths, tables and barstools. The bar's proprietor, [[Zashe]] Pamzirma, loves music and has a band playing on the soundstage most of the time, usually a smooth jazz trio during the day with a lively quartet or larger band playing more boisterous tunes in the evenings.

Eneri's is a pan-sophont-friendly venue with beverages provided to please a broad variety of alien palates. In addition, the lift and stairwells are reasonably spacious and outfitted with grav assist so as not to favor only sophonts with legs. There is also a lift near the front entrance for those who would prefer to forgo stairs altogether.

Like many bars, Eneri's has its foibles. One of its barstools is said to belong to the 'ol' Captain', although no one seems to remember exactly who the ol' Captain actually was. Nevertheless, his stool is always vacant and regulars all know not to sit there. Newcomers who break this unwritten rule are quickly informed that they must vacate the stool or face the captain's wrath. On the upper level, there is a section strictly reserved for gamblers. There is nearly always at least one or two games of chance being played in this part of the bar. The Referee should feel free to add more personalities, nooks, crannies, oddities and quirks to the bar as desired. Eneri's has a lot of character and customizing it to the Travellers' needs and interests is recommended.

[[Zashe]] has an eidetic memory and remembers the favorite drinks of all her regular customers. After Travellers have been to Eneri's two or three times, they can expect to have their preferred drinks served to them moments after they sit at a table or sidle up to the bar. [[Zashe]] has a small staff of servers, and sometimes hires temporary help when there is a big event going on, but mostly relies upon her adopted son, [[Calago]], and a [[#BDVSR Bartender Robot|robot bartender/bouncer]] named 'Bug' to run the place.

#### BDVSR Bartender Robot

![[CA2-50_1476395987.jpg]]
"Bug" is a four-armed bipedal robot optimized for autonomous operation. Bug normally operates with an external beverage dispenser, such as a full bar or beverage cart, but has an autobar installed within its torso with dispenser nozzles and a 10-litre capacity integral refrigerated container that holds up to 20 different beverages at a variety of temperatures, allowing it to dispense everything from hot coffee to iced smoothies. Spare capacity of another eight litres allows for custom installation of additional dispensers or other custom features. A vacuum/blower feature and internally stored mops and brushes allow the robot to keep its beverage-dispensation area clean.

With four arms, the BDVSR can dispense multiple drinks simultaneously but its two stronger arms serve the additional purpose of maintaining 'venue security', namely removing unruly patrons. Normally the model performs this task with the utmost courtesy but Bug's patience has seemingly worn out. Troublemakers are brusquely and summarily removed from the premises. Bug is a decent conversationalist but lacks deep insight into human behaviour.

Bug has been in service for many decades and has a few quirks. While it does not have a more sophisticated brain than other members of its class, it has collected a library of canned responses that it uses in conversation. Most of the time, these responses help to create the illusion of typical banter but once in a while it responds with an off-kilter or awkward statement that might leave Travellers scratching their heads.
