## LOZIN

![[JTAS-01-064.jpg]]

Lozin are amphibious carnivores native to the planet [[Suevanis]], a world with high gravity, standard atmosphere and oceans covering 40% of its surface. Hunting has endangered the species on Suevanis but recent efforts to transplant the beasts to other worlds have proven successful. Lozin are endothermic, quadrupedal, bilaterally symmetrical organisms with webbed feet, a dorsal fin and both gills and lungs (features reflecting their amphibious nature). Their jaws are filled with a variable number of sharp, undifferentiated teeth. There are two sexes, which mate for life and bear one to three young per year.

While in water, they float near the surface with their extremities folded neatly under their body. Their colouring (light grey ventrally, shading to a dark blue-grey dorsally) helps to hide them from their enemies and prospective prey. They prefer to spend most of their time in the water of the warmer regions of a world, floating languidly on the surface, emerging onto the land only to hunt. Lozin are generally encountered alone or with a mate, except for the few months each year when they are caring for their year's young. They are oviparous but retain the eggs in a special incubation pouch on their ventral body surface until hatching.

They hunt by concealing themselves near the water's edge and lying motionless until their prey comes within range. Then, in a surprising burst of activity, they rush forward and seize the victim, shaking and twisting themselves to tear loose great chunks of flesh. Rarely, they scavenge the kills of other predators.

For obvious reasons, commercial fishermen have hunted the Lozin to near extinction on their home world. Recently, however, advanced technology has developed a number of non lethal controls over the Lozin.

The areas of primary commercial aquaculture activity on [[Suevanis]] are now surrounded by a barrier of sonobuoys, which broadcast ultrasonic sounds. These sounds make Lozin extremely uncomfortable and have been quite effective in reducing commercial losses.
