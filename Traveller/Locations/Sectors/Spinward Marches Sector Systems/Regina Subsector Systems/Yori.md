(C560757-A)

Yori is a desert world lying on a spur of the [[Spinward Main]]. Whilst not on the main trade routes, it receives large numbers of visitors due to finds of Ancients artefacts. Most suspected Ancients sites are off-limits to casual visitors but permits for legitimate research or scholarly visits can be obtained. There are also numerous museums displaying local finds and general information about the Ancients. In addition, Yori has become a centre for the antiquities trade, with dealers from fields having a presence there. Much of this activity has nothing to do with the Ancients but grew to take advantage of their presence.

A decent set of jump-2 links and significant population movements through its starport make Yori an excellent choice for a Zhodani intelligence hub. So many different people visit the Ancients museums that cover stories are easy to concoct, especially as many visitors are from fringe groups fond of conspiracy stories about the Ancients. The fact that a significant proportion of these people engage in activities that look a little suspicious makes the task of Imperial intelligence agencies even harder. They have managed to identify part of a Zhodani spy ring but do not know how or by what route information is transferred out of the Imperium and eventually to Zhodani intelligence analysts.
