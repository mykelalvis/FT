## The Mockumentary Interview

#### A Custom Rule For Expositional Roleplay

From Adventures Of Bogo

## The Mockumentary Interview

Sometimes at the table it can be difficult to portray a thought or idea that your character has during a discussion or event. On the other side of the table it can be difficult when you are running a game to understand things about the character's thought processes and motivations.

This Custom Rule seeks to ease that issue by allowing character's to take a sidebar where they can voice their thoughts directly to the rest of the table and the game runner can ask them direct questions. All without ever interrupting the narrative. For an example of this in modern media you can look at any of the various mockumentary shows where they cut from the narrative to a short interview with one of the characters. These interviews serve to allow characters to give a little exposition around their motivations, true feelings, and any other information that seems useful for the audience to know. In this context the rest of the table acts as the audience.

## Player Led Interviews

It may be the case that as a player you want to start an interview to express an idea, motivation, or other concept that is proving difficult to convey through the course of the event or discussion currently taking place.

Indicate to the game runner you would like to take a moment to "talk to the camera". Once the go ahead has been given you should take no more than a minute to monologue the expositional information you would like to deliver. Ideally you should frame the exposition as if answering a question asked of you by a hypothetical interviewer. If you are finding this difficult but have something you would like to express then you should still feel encouraged to proceed.

Once a player initiates an interview the game runner may wish to ask follow-up questions of the character. The interview should ideally be kept brief so as not to detract too much time from the rest of the table. Once the interview is ended the table drops back into the narrative flow as if the interview had not happened from the perspective of the characters.

## Game Runner Led Interviews

As a game runner you may see a player is struggling to convey an idea, you may be curious to get a glimpse into the mind of the characters at the table, or you may just wish to encourage people to discuss their character's minds in more detail. 

To achieve this you can pull a character into an interview and ask them direct questions that they can answer outside of the narrative. The questions should be specific and answers should be kept short and concise to help maintain the pace of the game.

Rather than a single character you may wish to do a rapid fire across all of the characters, asking a simple question and getting a short answer from each character. Ideally these should be a snappy yes or no question.

## Benefits

Generally you are looking to get the players at the table more familiar with your character's thought processes or as a game runner to get some insight into the character's motivations. However this rule is primarily designed to help keep games entertaining and you should feel free to use it in any way you think might enhance your gaming experience.
