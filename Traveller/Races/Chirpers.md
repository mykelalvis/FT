[[A2RSG-24.jpg|Chiree]]

The semi-intelligent minor race native to [[Vanejen]] is called (by the locals) the chirpers. Once, they ranged widely over the entire world, but have now dwindled down to a few scattered groups. Chirpers are omnivore/gatherers in the 25 kilogram class. Living in small groups with a limited social organization, they follow age old patterns of gathering fruits and berries in the wild.

Chirpers are intelligent to a point, and have been known to learn to speak. Their intelligence is more of a rudimentary cunning, devoted to stealing shiny objects or intriguing gadgets. Since this is usually keys, or shiny coins, or other small valuable items, the humans on [[Vanejen]] have never reacted well to the chirpers. Finally, chirpers are extremely swift, much more so than their size or build would indicate. They can dash and dart about virtually unseen, if they care to. If someone tries to catch one, it usually can get away.
