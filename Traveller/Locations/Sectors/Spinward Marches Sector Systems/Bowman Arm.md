The Bowman Arm, sometimes misquoted as _Bowman's Arm,_ is an astrographic grouping of twelve worlds: 
- [[567-908]] 
- [[Asteltine]] 
-  [[Bowman]]
- [[Caliburn]]  
- [[Datrillian]]  
- [[Enos]]  
- [[Faldor]]  
- [[Flammarion]] 
- [[Flexos]]  
- [[Nirton]]  
- [[Squallia]]  
- [[Walston]]

It is an astrographic feature consisting of a number of linked clusters and traces forming part of the [[Spinward Main]].  It is located outside the borders of the [[Imperium]] on the [[Spinward Main]] in [[District 268]] and the [[Sword Worlds Subsector]] of the [[Spinward Marches]].

## Description
The Arm provides the only Jump-1 link between the handful of Imperial worlds in [Five Sisters Subsector] and the rest of Imperial territory. The Arm diverges from the Main at [[Caliburn]]  in the direction of [[Foreven Sector]] and meanders Spinward until [[Flammarion]] and the beginning of the chain known as [[Sisters' Reach]].
## History and Background
The Arm is an underdeveloped backwater and sees much less traffic than the more central parts of the Main; consequently, a great deal is not commonly know about the systems. Given that these frontier worlds are not members of the [[Imperium]], it is difficult at best and more often hazardous for Imperial traders to operate in the Arm.
