# Anola

![[CT-TTA-123.jpg|100]]
[[CT-TTA-123.jpg|Anolas]]
_Anola grevii_

An arboreal omnivore native to [[Pysadi]] in the [[Spinward Marches]], occurring nowhere else in the wild or in captivity. Anolas are considered holy by the Mother Church of Pysadi. Their export, capture, or study by any but those high in the religious hierarchy is banned. They are kept in special, heavily-guarded, garden preserves and are cared for by specially appointed keepers. Killing one of these animals is a capital offense. Although anolas are occasionally encountered in the wild on Pysadi. those close to civilized areas have been taken into the preserves.

Anolas mass an average of 3 kilograms. and are usually between 50 and 75 centimeters in length, including their two prehensile tails. Since anolas were known only from poorly preserved pelts smuggled off-planet, for many years there were thought to be three species, but as more complete specimens became available. it was determined that the three different types were only different sexual phases of one species.

Respiration is accomplished by paired lungs in the upper chest cavity. The circulatory system is closed. with a pair of two chambered hearts moving the blood. Gas exchange is typical, making use of an iron-based hemoglobin. Details of the neuro-muscular system and the digestive system are not presently available. Anolas are now known to be hermaphroditic, and the three phases are stages in sexual development. Upon reaching maturity, an anola's male system becomes active, the female system remaining dormant. Under certain conditions, the male system degenerates, glands for the nourishment of the young develop, and the male becomes a neuter, or parental. Under certain conditions. the female system of a parental will activate. and the individual becomes a female. Little is known for certain about the details of the reproductive cycle, but the following is currently the accepted sequence of events.

Anolas live in small groups. Five adults is the average size, one male. three parentals of varying ages and one female. Females mate soon after assuming the female phase, and soon bear a litter of three cubs. The birth process is hard, and she is quite weakened from the ordeal for about three months afterward. With each successive litter. the females become weaker, and few survive their third.

When the female dies, it appears that the lack of a certain pheromone triggers the female organs in the oldest neuter into activity, and that neuter becomes female within a few weeks. The change in proportion of the parental pheromones causes the male to become a parental. The group then seeks out a new male as rapidly as possible.

Each phase (male, female. and neuter) has its own distinct pattern of fur coloration, density, and length, caused by hormone changes associated with the shift in sex.

Several universities, zoos, and xenobiological institutes have offered substantial rewards for live anolas. Wealthy animal collectors are reported to offer as much as Cr7,000,000 for a breeding group (five adults, as outlined above).

The original settlers of [[Pysadi]] encountered the small furry anolas in the course of their exploration and settlement of their world. Unknown elsewhere, the animals were endearing, harmless, and easy to care for. In addition, their family structure seemed perfectly reflective of the settlers' religious philosophy. In the course of several decades, many anolas were adopted by families as pets. Over time, the anolas became accepted as sacred animals and were ultimately made the responsibility of the church.

[[Pysadi#The Mother Church]] has long maintained small groups of the species, kept in walled parks. They are bred in captivity, with their numbers supplemented by occasional wild [[anola]]s captured and adopted. [[Pysadi#Sadi]] and each of the nine town churches have such park areas. The sacredness of the animals makes discussions of the anolas, their habits, or any aspect of their lives rare, and it is not surprising that the adventurers have had little or no exposure to the existence of the little beasts.

There are four distinct categories of information regarding anolas: generally known facts available through library data or conversation, church teachings, secret church knowledge known to the priests (some of which may be made known to the characters), and referee's information which is used to manage the activities of the anolas in the presence of the players.

Pysadians asked about anolas speak of them as symbols of Mother Pysadi and of the sacred values of their religion. Few, however, are willing to discuss anolas at length and prefer to terminate a conversation rather than be forced to talk about them. In the rare instances where a short conversation occurs, locals will far more easily confirm information than volunteer it. What they can confirm is that anolas are kept in the parks, anolas are Sacred animals in their religion, individuals cannot own or keep them (the church has this responsibility), and that they are very cute.

### Church Teachings

The church on Pysadi teaches that anolas are the embodiment of the qualities of the world in one perfect family. Much as people must work together, the anolas work together in harmony and perfection. The male is the protector and provider; the parentals are the gatherers and the caring parents: the female is the mother and the one who binds the entire family. All work together to care for the children and bring them into the world.

Each anola contributes to the well-being of the whole; each has a part in the overall progress of the family. The unique characteristic of the anola is that each member of the family has the opportunity to serve in all roles. The male becomes a parental and then a female in turn. Each is able to contribute to each aspect of the family.

The church on Pysadi treats this example of the anola as an ideal: each member of society can and should contribute in all possible ways to the good of society. While humans may not progress through the phases of the anola literally, humans may also make contributions in many different aspects of their lives.

### Church Information

The church has integrated the anolas into its religious rituals and they figure intricately in church activities.

As the sacred animals of the church, anolas are raised in the sheltered parks in the city and in similar parks in each of the world's ten towns. These parks are carefully landscaped and are filled with trees and clearings. Surrounding the park is a large brick wall intended to keep other animals out as well as to mark the boundary. The parks are in actuality cemeteries: Pysadians are buried in unmarked graves in these parks.

Anolas live in comfort and ease, with selected priests assigned to live with them, providing for their needs. These priests grow quite attached to the anolas land the anolas to the priests as well.

The caretaker priests are selected by the anolas themselves. The animals respond better to some people than to others: those whom they respond well to become caretakers and look after the animals. Such caretaker priests, of course, do little of the actual labor themselves. The menial tasks are performed by apprentice priests on the grounds.

The church is aware that anolas also live in the wild. Strict teachings prohibit citizens from approaching wild anolas: the people are taught to allow the wild anolas to live out their lives without interference. In some few cases, the church has allowed a rural family to retain a group of anolas which it has rescued or found, but only until a family member joined the priesthood and brought the anolas to one of the parks to live.

Anolas can eat almost any food that humans can. One anola will eat about 10% to 20% of what a human eats; an anola family generally consumes about the same amount as one human.

### Referee's Information

Members of a strange species which has developed several unusual methods of protection and survival, anolas are excellent examples of the fascinating diversity of nature. Their protection mechanisms are two-fold-a family structure and the development of special talents.

The anola family structure is reproduction-oriented, and designed to protect slowly-maturing young. The female is the oldest member of the group, and her primary purpose is bearing young. Three parentals (of varying ages) serve to care for the young, as well as to help gather food such as berries, nuts, and fruit. The male is the youngest of the group.

Reproduction is a difficult activity for the female and she generally dies before the fourth litter is born. When the female dies, a pheromone she produces is no longer present.

In reaction to this, one of the parentals (usually the oldest) undergoes changes which make it female and becomes the new female in the family. At the same time, the male in the family undergoes changes which make it a parental.

The litter of (usually) three cubs is raised by the parentals until about six months of age, and are then set out into the world. At about this time, the family recruits a new male in order to complete its structure. Males are never recruited from the litter just born. Males roam the forest freely and alone until they join a new family.

Anola females hear one litter per year once they turn female, which occurs about the fifth year, and die before they are ten. In very rare cases, an anola male will live alone, without a family, for several years. Once an anola male joins a family, the process of going through parental to female begins.

### Special Talents

Anolas have a variety of special talents which protect them from harm. These talents are sex-linked, and are fairly automatic in their operation. Males have a threat-sense which detects the presence of danger. Parentals are able to calm by touch. Females have the ability to create affection. These talents are explained in greater detail in the section entitled Anolas in the Game.

An anola captured by the adventurers will adapt to the group very swiftly, and will follow typical behavior patterns for the various phases. A complete group will produce a litter of cubs within about one year. A partial group will progress through the various phases based on its composition. In the absence of a female, the eldest parental will become a female, and the male will become a parental (the group will seek a male to join it). A lone parental will become a female. A lone male will remain a male.

Anolas are not intelligent, having mental capabilities roughly equal to that of a [[Terra|Terran]] dog (_Canis familiaris_). Anolas are native to Pysadi and prefer its particular type of tainted air. They do not require the contaminant, however, and can breathe standard atmospheres without ill effects. They do not adapt to other types of tainted air.

## Anolas in the Game

Once the anolas have been discovered and taken offworld by the adventurers, the referee must be able to administer them believably and reasonably. The following section provides a guide.

### The Anola Group

The group consists of a female, three parentals, and a male. Their ages are indeterminate, but it is safe to assume that the male is about a year old, the female about eight (already having borne two litters), and the parentais are aged five, six, and seven.

The female can be expected to have a litter of three cubs within about a year of being picked up; after that, she will die. The oldest parental will become the new female and the male will become the youngest parental. Within about six months, one cub will become the group's male. The other two will remain immature until about a year old, when they will also become males. The excess males will take the first opportunity to leave the group.

Since a lone anola on a strange world has no hope of finding other anolas, the crew should be encouraged to find a way of helping. This may entail sending the anola back home to Pysadi on a ship going that way or carrying it home themselves. It is also possible for the group to put together several anolas (from different litters) and form a new group. The new group could be placed in the care of scientists on other worlds or given to individuals who want them.



### Males

The anola cub leaves the group within a year of birth. Just before leaving, the young cub turns male. In the wild, the young male lives alone, looking for food and wandering great distances. This wandering behavior helps distribute genetic material over wide areas. The male anola makes use of his own talent to protect himself while alone. The male can detect the presence of a threat at distances of up to 200 meters. While alone, the animal uses this warning to hide or flee.

Referees should be able to portend threats to the adventurers when the anola is present by indicating the low meaning sound. The warning is also accompanied by a scent released by the male.

The anola male's threat sense is psionically based; the animal is attuned to detecting a peculiar pattern present in threatening animals. As such, it can detect animals that may be stalking or preparing to attack and it can detect humans or 'Vargr who are considering violence, it cannot detect purely physical danger such as poisonous atmospheres or falling rocks.

#### Parentals

The anola parental is one of three in the typical anola group. One parental cares for one cub in a litter of three. Parentals also spend much of their time gathering food from trees or plants or searching for small larvae in the dirt.

Parentals have a responsibility for the safety and security of the cubs in their care and, as a result, they are capable of calming the immature animals in order to avoid attracting predatory animals (the threat sense of the male alerts the parentals as to when this is especially important).

Referees can implement the calming touch of the parentals when they affect individual player characters as well as the young. The calming touch serves as a tranquilizing agent, soothing an individual without fogging the senses. As a result, the referee should be able to implement a DM of +1 or +2 for such activities as shooting, delicate manipulation, or careful action: activities which are normally subject to disruption because of nervousness.

The anola parental's calming touch is not psionic. The effect is nearly immediate and continues for a few seconds after the touch is released.

### Females

The anola female is the oldest of the animals in a group. The female mates with the male and produces one litter of three cubs about once a year. Because the birth process is very difficult, the female usually dies shortly after the third litter is born. Some females live to have five or even six litters while some die after the first litter.

The female anola is the focus of the anola family. Her talent is the ability to radiate a feeling of comfort, security, and affection which attracts those around her, and which keeps the family safe and content. This talent generates a strong feeling of affection and closeness, which grows into a very strong bond.

Unfortunately, this power has a negative effect on most sophont species. The constant feeling of safety and comfort promoted by the female's psionically-based talent eventually, over a prolonged period of time, dull the mental processes and cause an increasing apathy and inertia. The individual so affected shows many of the signs of a premature senility-confusion, slowness or disorganization of thought, etc. Affection for the anola family is unabated, and characters may frequently find themselves absent-mindedly playing with, petting, or caring for the animals. But the ability to react rationally and utilize the brain is very much reduced.

This is a subtle and gradual process. At first, the group will notice nothing special about the female anola: she lacks both the threat sense of the males and the calming touch of the parentals. It may be some time before the female power begins to exert itself at all, in a general feeling of wellbeing. This is difficult to simulate in the game (it wouldn't do just to say "you feel very good"), instead the referee must resort to some subterfuge to simulate the feeling.

The referee should indirectly cultivate the feeling that the female anola is lucky. When a problem arises and a die roll must be made, the referee can refer to the female anola and indicate that her presence helped favorably influence the roll. ("Boy, you guys were sure lucky the female anola was around. You wouldn't have made the throw otherwise.”) ln point of fact, the anola has no influence on any roll, but the referee should foster this feeling. This will promote the proper attitudes in the players to parallel what their characters feel--affection, security, and lust a hint of complacency as they begin to feel they can do no wrong under the ”protection" of the anola family.

As time passes, the anolas should generally become so much a part of the crew that they are hardly noticed. The notion of luck and the effects of other abilities should remain, but should become almost second nature to all. It is at this time that the negative effects begin to show themselves.

All characters in close proximity to the anola family land especially to the female anolal will begin to suffer adverse effects 1D months after first picking them up on [[Pysadi]]. The time is different for each character. When the indicated time has elapsed, a character's intelligence rating will go down by 1 point. The referee should make a saving throw (Endurance or less) to represent the character's chance of resistance to the anola's influence: a positive DM equal to the number of months which have passed since acquiring the anola should modify this saving throw. If the throw is not successful, the intelligence loss takes place.

One character in the group will have been "adopted" by the anolas family. This character (the one designated as "chosen" by the priests on [[Pysadi]]) will be more constantly in contact with the entire family. The parentals will most often help this individual in applying skills, and the referee should imply that the "luck" of the female is especially strong for him or her. But the characters will also be more strongly affected by the negative aspects of the relationship; the saving throw has an additional +2 DM applied at all times, and the intelligence loss is -2, not -1.

The characters will not be aware of this intelligence loss. It is recorded secretly by the referee. The decline is so gradual that no one in the group will be aware of any great change. However, it will make itself felt as time goes on. Throws against intelligence will begin to fall more often than usual, and the referee may deliberately begin withholding information that might normally be usefu|-representing inattention or confusion. Rolls against intelligence should be instituted to allow completion of relatively simple tasks (putting on a vacc suit properly, or making a routine landing)- in these cases, applicable skills should be used as negative DMs (augmented as needed by the parental anolas) to represent the fact that familiar tasks may still be handled by rote. Any way the referee can think of to simulate a gradually growing problem is suitable, including adverse DMs in surprise situations, adverse modifiers on the reaction table to represent the negative reaction engendered by vagueness or abstraction, and so forth.

These effects will be slow. Referee judgment is called for. The cumulative effect will eventually become noticeable, but it should not be a sudden revelation-more a gradual feeling that things aren't going too well. Eventually, characters will realize something is badly wrong.

One way they will definitely discover the problem is through the decline of a character's intelligence to a “1 " rating. This is as low as it can be pushed. When it happens, the character is considered to have been so badly affected as to be, in effect, temporarily rendered incapable of independent thought or action. The other characters might discover the individual on watch one morning, staring off into space and unable to respond to any sort of stimulus or danger. The character will still be capable of eating, taking care of himself, and occasionally taking care of the anolas-though he may have trouble deciding what to have for dinner or which suit to wear! But in situations where thought or action are required, he will not be able to function without help, and the player should be barred from contributing ideas or plans to the rest of the group.

### Adventuring with the Anolas

The anolas enjoy travelling with the crew and moving about with them. They weigh 3 kilograms each, and of course add to the weight toad carried by an individual (though they may shift from person to person or even move independently from time to time). The arboreal creatures can cling to humans (or Vargr) with ease and will not fall off even if the host is running.

Special equipment will be necessary for the anolas in the same places characters need it-filter masks in tainted atmospheres, compressor masks for very thin atmospheres, even vacc suits. It would even be possibie to have special compartments built into characters' vacc suits to hold the anola, thus preserving contact with parentals. Cost for specially fabricated equipment will be roughly equivalent to costs for standard human~designed items (a vacc suit modification, however, would cost only Cr1000 per vacc suit).
