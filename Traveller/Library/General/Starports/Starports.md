### STARPORTS AND SPACEPORTS

By convention, a world has only one starport but can have many spaceports. The designation "starport" is given to the world's main port, where most commercial and passenger traffic goes. Any other port is designated a spaceport. This can cause problems on balkanised worlds where several governments exist; most will claim that their port is the main one.

Usually, but not always, the starport is the best port on the planet and others will be inferior. Normally, there will be a main port accompanied by a startown, which is often the planetary capital. The startown is usually geared to offworld visitors and doing business with other star systems, so may have more relaxed attitudes and laws than other regions of the planet. This is not always the case, however.

The Imperium considers a starport (but not usually a spaceport) as Imperial territory, so Imperial law, and not local law, applies there. In practice, there is often a compromise, with shared jurisdiction. Law Levels vary but a typical well-regulated starport tends to restrict visitors to sidearms â€“ this may be more or less than people are permitted to own or carry outside the port.

The startown is planetary territory, not part of the port, and theoretically local law applies there. However, the startown is often a buffer zone between world and port and if there are radical differences in Law Level then sometimes the startown has a special set of laws in place within its limits.

The planetside part of a starport or spaceport is termed the downport, although there may also be an orbital component termed the highport. In some cases, this is big enough to be a city in space and there may be no need to descend to the planet at all if business can be conducted in orbit.

An important system might have a large highport serving a downport at the capital. Large ships dock at the highport and use shuttles for passenger and cargo transport; smaller vessels can land if they choose. From the orbital highport, it is possible to go to the main downport or spaceports in each of half a dozen cities, plus a commercial port serving an industrial complex.

Meanwhile there may be a dedicated military port, a small government port and a couple of spaceports serving installations on other bodies in the system, such as a mining colony on a moon of one of the gas giants.

A minor system, on the other hand, may have little more than a shed and a marked landing area.
