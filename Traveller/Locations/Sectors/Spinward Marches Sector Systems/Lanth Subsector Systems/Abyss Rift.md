# The Abyss Rift

The Abyss Rift is an unofficial designation given to a region of space lying spinward of the [[Spinward Main]] as it runs through the [[Lanth subsector]].  Its actual extent is nebulous; some include the trailing parts of [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]], others consider that only the region around [[Victoria]] and [[Sonthert]] is the Abyss and the surrounding region of low stellar density is just a normal rift.

The Abyss Rift is associated with jumpspace phenomena and a higher than average rate of misjumps. Much of what is 'known' about the rift is speculation based upon tales told in starport bars but statistically there is a higher tendency for ships to misjump or suffer mishaps in the region.  The idea that the rift is a bad place does seem to have some scientific basis.

The Abyss Rift is an example of a [[jumpspace trench]] (see The [[Great Rift]] ), an area where jumpspace is 'deeper' and subject to different physical laws. The vast majority of ships traversing the region will suffer no ill effects but you may never convince a superstitious Traveller that they are safe.
