## MORA
Mora is, both historically and astrographically, the Gateway to [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. It is now one of the richest worlds for many parsecs and extremely important to local politics, despite the fact that technically Duchess Delphine of Mora wields no more power and has no more responsibilities than any other subsector Duke in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

Mora is a large world with a dense, tainted atmosphere, almost entirely covered in oceans with only a few large islands and smaller archipelagos breaking the surface.
Nevertheless, Mora was the first world of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] to be settled by the [[Imperium]] and received far more investment than other colonies; starting in 60, Mora was developed as a trading center financed by Ling Standard Products. This required a good starport, which led to the creation of yards to overhaul trade and exploration vessels. Soon afterward, full-scale shipbuilding began.

As early explorers pushed into the sector, Mora was the interface point where goods were marshalled for shipping back into the [[Imperium]] and settlement missions made preparations for the final leg of their journeys. It was through Mora that goods from the [[Sword Worlds]], the Darrian Confederation and even the Zhodani Consulate came.

Eventually, Trin became important as a secondary route into [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] but for many decades everything and everyone came through Mora. Some colonists never went any further, choosing to settle on Mora rather than advance into unexplored territory. The world's population grew rapidly and, with it, the amount of industry it could support.

Today, Mora has a population numbering tens of billions, dwelling in gigantic mega-cities that cover much of the available land mass as well as surrounding seabed. The upper regions of these cities project high above the surface of the seas, each crested with a spaceport. Most cities lie on or close to the equator and have spread so much that they run into one another, creating a single city circling the entire equator. Smaller cities are separated from the main belt by oceanic trenches.

Most of the little dry land that remains is given over to high-technology intensive agriculture, with additional food production provided by seabed farming. There are, however, a few exceptions. One is Mora's massive downport, which takes up most of an equatorial island.
Another is the World Park, a large nature reserve, and there is also an island reserved as a private estate for the high officials of the world government.

Mora's system of government is unusual, in that Duchess Delphine is not just the world's official representative but also the head of Mora's government.
In practice, the duchess delegates her role of representative to the [[Imperium]] to a deputy, except when she feels personal intervention is necessary. All senior governmental positions are held by women and Mora is legally a matriarchy. Males are not enslaved on Mora, merely not permitted to hold high office.

Mora has no police force or other civilian emergency services, as all such tasks are undertaken by the armed forces. One particularly important branch is concerned with orbital traffic control and vessel tracking; local space is very crowded and keeping traffic flowing is a full-time job for a great many people. There is so much traffic around Mora Imperial Highport that a secondary highport has been constructed for use by those with permission, including vessels of the Imperial Navy and sector administration, but primarily megacorporate starships belonging to Delgado, Tukera and Imperiallines, who jointly funded the venture.
These vessels receive heavily discounted services and a streamlined customs system. The port is secured by mercenary troops and patrol craft supplied by Instellarms, which has a large commercial presence there. The volume of traffic is still so high that there is talk of building a third port to serve government and sector administration vessels.

The world is highly industrialised, with a very high Tech Level. This makes it one of the most important economic players not just in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] but also in Deneb, where a significant proportion of Mora's goods are sold.

High-technology industry is supported by the Mora Technical Institute, which performs cutting-edge research into gravitics, electronics and manufacturing, as well as training graduates. MTI is somewhat overshadowed by the Imperial Mora University, which deals more in history, political studies and similar fields, and the social status associated with being a graduate of IMU is higher than MTI. It is said, not without reason, that technical institute graduates can expect a good, well-paid career working in firms owned by the families of IMU attendees.

The remainder of the Mora system is heavily exploited.
There are mining outposts throughout the planetoid belt and the moons of both gas giants are also heavily mined, with scientific installations scattered here and there. The belt is also the site of major biotechnology industries, conducting both research and production.

The system's scout and naval bases, located on large planetoids in the belt, are both huge. The scout base is the IISS regional headquarters for the Spinward Marches and marshals a huge communications fleet in addition to a flotilla of scout/couriers, express boat tenders and survey vessels for tasks across the sector. The naval base is headquarters for the sector and subsector fleets, although the sector admiral resides on Mora and commands from there. The Mora system is home to several heavy battle and cruiser squadrons of the Sector Fleet and the naval base has more capital ships in reserve.

If another frontier war erupts, it is from Mora that the fleet will sally out to defend [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and from here the war will be directed. If the worst comes to pass, it might be that Mora becomes the last bastion of the [[Imperium]] in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]; certainly, it would be held with great determination. Were Mora to be lost, [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] would either have already fallen or defeat would be inevitable. Unsurprisingly, Mora's system defence squadron is one of the most powerful in the [[Imperium]].

NEXINE Nexine is a large world, almost entirely covered by oceans. The atmosphere is of a standard composition and density but its taint makes the use of a filter mask necessary. The world is part of the Palique Cluster, on both the coreward x-boat route form Mora and also the jump-2 route into Trin's Veil and ultimately Glisten.

Several attempts have been made to settle Nexine at various times, usually without success. A small population, numbering in the tens of thousands, dwells in far-flung communities, all of them small, on islands across the globe. The island-towns are broadly self-sufficient, each with its own agricultural base, light industries and fisheries to maintain equipment in local use and feed the people. The overall TL8 rests on industry at the cottage level and is insufficient to export significant goods.

There are a few larger settlements, notably the capital which is co-located with the starport and scout base.
Even here, the population is not large enough to support heavy industry and it is the scout base that is the mainstay of Nexine's economy. The Scout Service contracts with local businesses for everything from food supplies to cleaning services, as does the starport.
However, the scout base is small, consisting of a fenced-off corner of the starport leased by the Scout Service.

A handful of cutters and shuttles serve the tenders that support x-boats passing through the system and there is an extensive communications suite. In all, there are no more than 200 Scout Service personnel in the system at any one time.

Trade ships come through Nexine but the world's tiny economy cannot support buying and selling, nor produce enough of anything to be worth freighting, so the port makes only a little money from berthing fees, rations and the like. Crews spend a significant amount of money in the capital's bars, restaurants and shops.

This dependence on the port for income has crippled growth of Nexine's own economy. A disproportionate percentage of the world's population is employed in service industries around the port, leaving too few to develop other sectors. Were this source of income to dry up, Nexine's economy would almost certainly crash, a situation is all too common on worlds with a low population. What Nexine needs more than anything else is more people. There have been attempts to attract immigrants using schemes ranging from generous land grants to refugee-relocation projects but nothing has worked. The current idea is to see if genetically engineered humans could be seeded on Nexine, making use of the oceans that make up 99% of the world's surface.

As yet, the project consists of little more than a few scientific teams, researching a wide range of important factors, from mineral content in the oceans to current conditions, with extensive seabed mapping also underway to locate suitable regions for an aquatic or semi-aquatic population to be settled in.

Some Imperial scientists working in Nexine's oceans are Dolphins, uplifted to sentience long ago and now a species apart from their lesser cousins. Their unique insight into the aquatic conditions of Nexine will likely prove invaluable to the project.

There are several scientific outposts in various corners of the world and information-gathering drones have been dropped into the seas in great numbers. The main scientific base is a large installation with a crew of about 100 technicians, scientists and support workers, from which research submarines of various sizes depart on their cruises. Deep-diving subs have also been deployed to Nexine and have begun penetrating the deep ocean trenches and exploring the abyssal plains. This represents a significant investment in money as well as effort, so presumably there is a real chance that the project will go ahead at some point in the future.

THE SPECIALIST COLLECTION

_Palique is renowned for the high quality of its vacc suits and environmental protection equipment. All are manufactured at TL14 and have a reputation for reliability and comfort that extends far beyond the sector. Of course, this is reflected in the price tag._

PALIQUE TAILORED VACC SUIT A standard lightweight suit worn as crew uniform by some personnel, the tailored vacc suit is little more cumbersome than a set of heavy duty clothes. Armor and radiation protection is not as good as a bulkier suit but the main garment can be worn constantly without fatigue.
Suits come with a set of undergloves' and a soft bubble headcovering that are adequate, although most users purchase the accessory kit and use it when they need real protection.

The suit contains a highly oxygenated gel trapped between layers of cloth around the collar area, which is combined with carbon dioxide scrubbing materials. This creates an integral air supply/rebreather system that can sustain a wearer for an hour under normal exertion without discomfort and about five times as long in gradually increasing distress. All Palique suits use this system, giving the wearer a last chance to reach safety if other systems fail or the opportunity to operate without a life support pack. The collar system is activated by pulling a tab and must be replaced after use. This is a fiddly but not complex process, although most users prefer to avoid it by using accessories.

A tailored vacc suit can be used by anyone who has had the most cursory instruction

- it is little more than a set of clothes with glove seals and a bubble helmet. It is not

recommended that unskilled personnel do anything more complex than sit at their consoles while wearing a vacc suit, however.

PALIQUE ACCESSORY PACK The accessory pack contains a solid helmet and semi-rigid torso piece, which drops over the suit and provides additional armor protection, although this is intended to protect against micrometeorites. There is also a belt that can be worn with or without the torso piece. Its pockets contain over-gloves and safety tethers, a battery-powered lamp and a one-hour air bottle plus two emergency disposable gas thruster units that allow a stranded spacefarer to return to their ship. The suit can be fed with power and air from an external source – a feed is normally found at all starship crew duty stations

- or run off the belt batteries and air bottle. For extended operations, the

manufacturer recommends the use of the torso unit, which contains an eight-hour air supply and sufficient oxygenated/rebreather gel to keep the wearer alive for twice that long after the air runs out.

DESCRIPTION



The Deep Ranger-class is an extremely well-equipped vessel intended for long duration deep-diving in water or other non-corrosive fluids. Its underwater displacement is around 1500 tons; not large for a maritime vessel but sizeable for a civilian submarine (note that water displacement is not the same as starship displacement, which is determined by displacement of liquid hydrogen rather than water).

This submarine can safely descend to depths of 16km, far more than needed on most worlds, and can stay underwater for as long as food stocks last. It is extremely cramped, however, as almost all available space is taken up with equipment or controls The submarine has a nominal crew complement of 10, although most vessels operate with 3-5 personnel on board.
This makes it possible to remove some of the bunks and reconfigure spaces to give the crew a little breathing room.

By far the most spacious part of the submarine is its laboratory suite, which consists of a main hydrographics lab and four configurable research spaces. Most external work is done with a mix

of heavy and fine-work manipulator arms or sensors mounted on extendable masts pushed into seabed silt. There are airlocks for divers but these can only be used in shallow water unless robotic craft are launched. The research suite also contains holding tanks, of which nearly half can be refrigerated and a cryoberth unit normally used to freeze samples.

The vessel's fusion power plant allows extremely long duration operations and is complemented by a water-jet system linked to hydrographic sampling equipment. High powered water jet thrusters allow rapid emergency movement away from a hazard or station-keeping in strong currents, and there is an auxiliary crawler system on the ventral surfaced of the submersible to permit movement on the seabed.

Although all submarines come equipped with life support and hostile environment capability, the Deep Ranger takes this to an extreme and has a multiply redundant backup system. In dire emergenies, the main control cabin can be sealed and ejected, returning to the surface by means of slight positive buoyancy.
