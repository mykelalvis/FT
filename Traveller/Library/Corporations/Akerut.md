# AKERUT


An anagram of '[[Tukera]]', Akerut is a whollyâ€“owned subsidiary of that Megacorporation. It operates a fleet of vessels based out of the [[Aramis subsector]], plying routes into the [[Imperium]] and across the border into the [[Vargr Extents]]. Akerut, like its parent corporation, maintains facilities within commercial starports, allowing its ships preferential docking at private berths. This has led to a couple of 'customs irregularities' in the past but there have been no recent allegations.

Wholly-owned subsidiary of Tukera Lines. organized to establish trade routes and shipping stations within the [[Aramis subsector]]. Akerut gains most of its revenue from cargo transport and trade within the subsector. Approximately 25% of its shipping involves transport of cargos to or from locations outside the subsector.
