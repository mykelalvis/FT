Reverently referred to as the 'Gateway to Capital', Ankod is a key stop on the route into the subsector from Vland and Lishun. The Imperial Navy base at Ankod has a partnership with universities on neighboring Knabbib to develop security technology that provides a protective cordon for [[Capital]] and the subsector at large. Naval astronomers and technologists come to Ankod to work on the ultra- secret Project Shortbow at its secure training anddevelopment facilities.

Ankod is a key stop on the Annililik Run (for more on this epic event, see The Annililik Run on page 120) and has hospitality facilities for millions of visitorswho come to see the  thousands of racing ships en route either to or from Vland. When not providing lodging and entertainment for fans of the race, the government subsidizes these facilities, using them to provide free housing for visiting traders and other Travellers. Ankod also provides complimentary refuelling for ships in the sub-1,000-ton range and a 60 percent discount for those larger than that. Ankod is a gas-giant moon and runs a fleet of skimming drones that extract hydrogen from the gas giant for processing at its refineries. This generosity is a big expense but is more than paid for by the increased trade that it brings to the system, which is near the terminus of the Sylean Main.
