# CIREC

CIREC (Consumer and Industrial Robotics, Electronics and Cybernetics) Group CIREC produces high-technology electronic and robotic equipment for a variety of market sectors. Most of its products are very mundane such as personal communicators, computer networks for installations and starships, and data transmission equipment. This is a large market niche, with huge quantities of goods shipped all over the sector, but one that is so commonplace as to be forgotten about by most starfarers.

CIREC’s more obvious products are found in many industrial installations and starports; the group produces some of the most common loading and cargo handling robots in the region along with other heavy-duty robotics for a variety of purposes. Among these are the enormous automated mobile logging units deployed on some worlds, which have generated considerable controversy and not a few protest movements. CIREC robots are also used in hostile environment applications ranging from exploration and mapping to construction and maintenance.

The firm also produces security and defence-sector systems. Most of these are self-contained units such as vehicular add-on laser turrets capable of downing a reconnaissance drone or a moderately large flying predator. Designed to provide protection for explorers, these units have found their way onto numerous battlefields and are a popular item with insurgents seeking to offset their enemies’ technological advantages. This connection with rebels and guerrillas is downplayed by CIREC, which considers the image of colonists protected from predators by the defensive fire of their automated laser mount to be more marketable.

CIREC’s military and defence products also include security robots, which can be armed with weapons ranging from stunners and similar less-lethal equipment up to submachineguns and shotgun-calibre weapons.

Heavier combat robots are available, but only to government and licensed mercenary clients. These are mostly armed with lasers or light machineguns, but CIREC’s support robot range includes versions armed with mortars and light missile launchers.

These heavier combat robots are controversial, even though they are designed to be closely monitored by human personnel and are not fully autonomous. They are only available to military clients but sometimes turn up on the black market. They are also deployed to protect CIREC’s installations, a practice that has attracted some negative comment from time to time. Opponents of the firm like to present it as building forest-devouring monsters that march across the landscape at the head of an army of combat robots. Its proponents use quite similar imagery, but stress the defensive and economic advantages of the products rather than their destructive potential.

CIREC has recently moved into hostile-environment engineering in a big way, unveiling its new range of mineral extraction and construction robots optimised for corrosive and insidious atmosphere worlds. There are persistent rumours that a combat version is also due to become available, and is undergoing testing on an unspecified hostile world at the present time.
