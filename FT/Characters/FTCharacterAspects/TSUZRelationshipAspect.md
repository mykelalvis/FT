While working as a "security consultant" on a backwater world, my client was assassinated. This client also happened to be the Planetary Governor. Well, someone floated the idea that maybe I was to blame, the "inside man" so to speak (I wasn't). I didn't feel like it was in my best interests to see how that situation played out. I hopped the first ship I could find headed out of the system, a cargo hauler. Jonathan Doont was nice enough to take me on and hide me on the ship (for a small fee). Now I've got a warrant on Yulka III, for "questioning".
