##### Caldos: Lost Oasis

**By Christopher Griffen**

Appearances can be deceiving in the Outrim Void. Star systems that
would be nothing more than gas giant stopovers on a jump-1 main
in the Imperium, might have hidden value in the wilds of the Void.
Caldos (Dpres subsector in the Trojan Reach: B530879-6) is just that
type of system. Despite its rather humble appearance, it is a nexus
through which fortunes flow. Caldos' location in the region known as
the Dustbelt, and proximity to regional powers Acis and Tyr, have given
it strategic importance that it would otherwise not possess. Without
control of Caldos, one cannot dominate the Dustbelt.

Despite appearances, Caldos was once a shining gem of the Sindalian
Empire but that was millennia ago. The ghosts of the past haunt Caldos
today. Its parched, sunburned and bomb-cratered surface shows
the scars of the devastation wrought on this once-verdant oasis of a
forgotten interstellar empire.

THE GEM OF THE SINDALIAN EMPIRE
To understand the Caldos of today, one must first understand what it
was like 2,500 years ago. Much of this history is lost but chronicles of
the great works and ambitions of its first ruler have survived the ages.

Most of the artefacts of the Sindalian epoch have been buried in the
dust of Caldos' countless sandstorms, fallen into the gravity wells of its
gas giants or plunged into the fiery heart of its bright star, Caurchlan
Contigo. Those that remain are evidence of a progressive and
ambitious leader who sought to create a paradise among the stars.

When Terran colonists poured into the Trojan Reach thousands of years
ago, its most habitable planets were settled first. Colonists claimed
worlds that had plentiful liquid water, a breathable atmosphere and a
stable primary star. The region's less optimal systems were bypassed
during the first wave.

Early in the second wave, in approximately -2025, an industrialist by
the name of Magda Madjiyb set down roots in the region. She selected
Caldos as the place where she would build paradise. Where others saw
an abysmal ball of rock and sand with a paltry atmosphere and a star
that was too bright and hot, she saw the cradle of utopia.

Madjiyb was drawn to the deep scar that ran along Caldos' equator.
This massive crag, nearly encircling the planet, was named the Valles
Caldos. Its average depth was five kilometers but it ran as deep as 10
kilometers in some places. The Valles' tributary canyons run north and
south like stitches along the edge of a great gash.

Madjiyb had been a belter by trade, making her fortune mining the
metals of asteroid belts in the systems near distant Terra. Prior to
settling in the Caldos system, her corporation analysed its two planetoid
belts. They discovered the belts were mediocre in precious metals but
rich in ice. That ice, she surmised, could be transported to Caldos and
dropped into the canyon and its tributaries, forming the basis for an
agricultural powerhouse.

It took almost a century to bring the project to fruition but Madjiyb lived
long enough to see it thanks to her health regimen and judicious use of
anagathics. She followed the Caldos project from cradle to grave before
her death in -1886. By that time, the Valles had been filled with melted
ice from the belts and enormous canal systems had been built to serve
a dozen plantations and their subsidiaries. It was a system designed to
feed billions.

As Madjiyb oversaw her pet project at Valles, her delegates were
given wide latitude to create industry and housing for the masses of
colonists who would come to Caldos. They came in droves, settling the
planet and prospering under its liberal financial rules. Caldos' fortuitous
position in the Sindalian Main made it an optimal trade hub.

Madjiyb sought to build a society as generous as it was prosperous
and she made sure that quality services, education and welfare were
available to all Caldosian citizens. Where she saw corruption, she
appointed trusted ministers to ferret it out. When a project failed, she
scuttled it and tried something different. She recruited the region's
best and brightest to oversee her public works projects. Having made
a vast fortune in belt mining, Madjiyb showed little interest in new
entrepreneurial ventures, instead focusing on the creation of what she
imagined to be a perfect society.

At the system's largest gas giant, Burge Velgut, she built massive
refuelling barges that provided wilderness refuelling assistance to
starships. Velgut's gravity is too great for ships with less than 3G of
thrust to use for skimming. Madjiyb was afraid that the inability of
starships to refuel at the gas giant nearest the system mainworld
would prevent visitors from coming. Visiting ships docked with the
barges much like they would an orbital starport. Starship captains
would open their fuel skimmers as the barges descended into the
upper atmosphere of Velgut, basically 'dipping' the attached starships
into an ocean of fuel. Many historians have balked at this eccentric

creation. Why had Madjiyb not simply created a refuelling station at
Velgut? While her motives are lost in the annals of time, many believe
she was trying to send a message to visitors: Travellers are welcome
here and we will help you partake in our riches. While the process
was cumbersome, it gave visitors the chance to interact with the barge
crews and transient communities who lived on the immense refuelling
craft. You did not just stop over at Caldos. You were welcomed and
drawn into a community and embraced by its culture.

In close orbit of Caurchlan Contigo, the system's solitary star, engineers
built immense stellar battery platforms, each over 200,000 tonnes in
displacement. Speckled with thousands of capacitors, they collected
stellar energy that was relayed to Caldos using laser arrays. The
platforms were intended to one day join together to form a Dyson Sphere
around Caurchlan. While Caldos had nowhere near the technology to
pull it off at the time, they anticipated a day when they would.

On Caldos itself, the temperate zones and polar caps were fitted
for housing and industry. Hundreds of arcologies were constructed,
surrounded by habitat domes that contained a variety of artificial
climates. Animals and plants from throughout known space, including
Terra, were cloned from their DNA and housed in these complexes.

THE GOLDEN AGE OF CALDOS: CA. -
Maglev trains and gliders provided public transit and two downports
were constructed to manage the interstellar traffic. A specialized
underground transportation system shipped the planet's agricultural
products from automated farming facilities at the equator to the cities
and starports in the northern climes for consumption by the population
or shipment offworld.

Like any society Caldos had its problems, yet the vast majority of
Caldosian citizens led peaceful, prosperous lives. Being a cutting-edge
interstellar society was a source of great pride for most. Caldos enjoyed
a rather harmonious existence in the Sindalian Empire, reaping the
benefits of membership, fortuitous astrography and 'herd protection' of
neighboring martial worlds.

As things began to take a turn for the worse in the Sindalian Empire,
the delicate balance of technology and environmental control on Caldos
suffered. The downfall of the Empire was disastrous for Caldos.
A peaceful world with little invested in defence, Caldos was spared
during the initial onslaught of nuclear and biological annihilation
that occurred throughout the Empire. The interruption in interstellar
commerce drastically lowered the standards of living for the billions
of Caldosians and eventually threatened their very lives as the flow of
crucial life-support supplies was stanched by war.

Things went from bad to worse when Caldos began to be targeted
militarily. The people and government of the planet had done little to
offend the Empire but Noricum eventually decided that Caldos had
strategic value. While Caldos posed no direct threat, the Empire felt it
was necessary to deny Caldos' riches to all potential enemies.

One wickedly clever Sindalian admiral revived the dormant drones that
had once towed ice to Caldos from the belts, this time using them to
drop planetoids on Caldos' agricultural plantations, starports and major
population centres. Hundreds of millions of people were vaporised
in the bombardment. Those not so lucky were fated to endure the
aftermath. The destruction of its infrastructure coupled with the nearly
complete loss of interstellar trade and transportation brought about
Caldos' death knell. While Madjiyb's modifications to the planet had
made it habitable for billions, this habitability hinged on its delicately
balanced agricultural systems and constant influx of goods and
materials to keep the life support systems running. Without the lifeblood
of trade, Caldos' shining civilization degraded into a Hobbesian
nightmare in a matter of weeks.

The massive amounts of fallout from the bombardment made any
attempts to reconstruct the plantations moot. Survivors salvaged what
they could and sought refuge from the bombardments. The people
of Caldos turned on one another, cannibalising their civilization both
figuratively and literally.

At its nadir, the population dropped from several billion to little over 100
million people. With the destruction of Noricum and the dithering of the
Duke of Albe, the collapse of the Sindalian Empire became a certainty.
The twinkling lights of battling dreadnaughts, now barely visible
from the hazy surface of Caldos, gradually declined and exhausted
themselves until there was nothing left but the stars and the blackness
of the void. Caldos descended into a dark age, the likes of which its
people had never imagined.

DUSKY DAWN
It would be wonderful to say that Caldos recovered from the apocalyptic
fall of the Empire and that it miraculously rose from the ashes like the
phoenix of myth, yet that would be grossly inaccurate.

After the fall, the survivors went through dozens of wars, battling for
their share of the planet's dwindling resources. Two hundred years after
the fall, just as the fallout had more or less cleared from the previous
bombardment, the isolated world endured insult to injury as one final
planetoid fell to ground. No one is quite sure how it happened but the
prevailing theory is that when the Sindalian Navy reprogrammed the
tug drones to drop planetoids on Caldos, a faulty computer on one of
them was set to minimal acceleration so that it took centuries instead of

hours to reach its target. Delayed by 200 years, the final shot fired in the
Sindalian collapse was a rock so massive that its impact brought about
another two centuries of dim starlight and diminished agricultural output.

The ensuing years have been an epic struggle fraught with setbacks
and disasters that would bring down the spirits of even the most
universal optimizt. The remnants of Madjiyb's ambitious projects are
now either lost for eternity or bristle out of the ground like the jagged
teeth of a bygone civilization.

Despite all this, the population has recovered to approximately
800 million people. That this happened at all is a testament to their
resilience. Even after two and a half millennia, Caldos' culture of
innovation and pragmatism persists.

The equatorial canal that once ran along the circumference of the
planet has been virtually dry for 2,000 years. The gigatons of water
brought from the belt have been absorbed into the planet's crust,
subsumed into its meagre atmosphere or burned away into the cosmos
by Caurchlan's unrelenting stellar rays.

In the golden age, few people lived in the equatorial region. The
plantations at the valles were almost entirely run by robots but there
were large maintenance facilities, control centres and warehouses
in the canyon walls. These facilities have been salvaged and made
habitable. Settlements in the canyons are now vertically oriented
cities. Millions of people live in the nooks and crannies that dot the
escarpments, using airships to travel from city-to-city along the length
and depth of the canyon.

The 'Equatorials', as they are called, have rebuilt a modest agricultural
center on the fringes of the valles. Moisture collection is a hallowed
science among the Equatorials. Gone are the maglev and antigravity
transports that once efficiently distributed produce to the north; now
it is transported by electric rail and massive airships. The output is
not nearly enough to serve all of the planet's inhabitants and most
of Caldos' sustenance is provided by aid packages and trade with
neighboring systems. Nevertheless, the fact they produce any of
their own food provides a psychological boon to the people. Caldos'
culture feeds on its desire for independence and self-sufficiency. The
resurrection of farming in the canyon has had a positive effect on
morale that cannot be overstated.

When the planet was home to billions of people, the arcologies of the
northern latitudes were the primary locales for housing. Today, many
still live on the grounds where the arcologies once stood but most of
the titanic buildings have been brought down by centuries of erosion by

wind and sand. Of those that remain, most are too dangerous to inhabit
but a few of these mammoth structures have been renovated and
made safe for habitation. Instead of grav ports, there are airship and
glider docks; in place of fusion power plants, there are wind and solar
farms. Apartments in the revived arcologies are much sought after by
Caldosians and fetch a premium price. Not surprisingly, the surrounding
regions have become suburbs, sprawling low-lying settlements that
extend for 100 or more kilometers from the central spires of the
arcologies. Pollutant-laden industrial complexes, housing communities
and massive shanty towns blanket the most undesirable areas.

While the decadent grandeur of the arcologies is a spectacle, smaller
and more practical cities have sprung up elsewhere. Most cities are
built with low-tech materials, some supplemented with scavenged
pieces from fallen arcologies. The high-tech polymers and synthetic
metals used to build ancient Caldos survive in large quantities to this
day. The haphazard reuse of these materials gives many urban areas
an unusual patchwork look, mixing low and high-tech building materials
in an odd mish-mash of architectural flourish.

Transportation between Caldos' cities occurs in myriad ways; dirigibles,
passenger gliders, solar-powered ground cars, railways and, perhaps
most unusual of all, sand skiffs, the primary vehicle used to cross the
planet's dangerous dune seas. Sand skiffs come in various sizes but
most are designed to carry one to six individuals. They typically include
an auxiliary engine that enables them to 'jump' sand traps and sinkholes.

SOFT OPPRESSION
Under the current arrangement, the Caldos system is stagnant.
They have found it next to impossible to progress technologically or
enhance their prospects and Caldos has been relegated to the role
of a mere conduit through which wealth flows between the Imperium
and Florian League. If scraps fall off the table, the more technically
and politically savvy governments of Tyr and Acis catch them. Despite
its higher population, Caldos can do little to gain traction against their
higher-tech neighbors.

Caldos is not oppressed in the traditional sense. Jackbooted thugs
are not asserting martial law, nor has a foreign power installed a
petty dictator to lord it over the people. There are too many disparate
factions in the mix for that to happen. It would be more accurate to
say that the system is passively oppressed, for it is in the interests of
Tyr and Acis for Caldos to be malleable. The corporate, political and
military organizations that dominate the Dustbelt want Caldos to have a
functional starport, a populace willing to help facilitate the flow of goods
and trade, and a feckless government.

Rather than manufacturing an authoritarian regime to oppress a
potentially restless populace, the neighboring powers have sought to
destabilize Caldos. To wit:
•  When Caldos began to move toward a unified technocratic
government, Tyr's espionage services intervened, casting doubt on
the movement's leaders and quashing its credibility.
•  A grass-roots democratic movement became stillborn when an
unexpected famine occurred in the equatorial region and a greater
level of 'external management' was deemed necessary until the
crisis passed.
•  Just as Caldos attempted to implement a tax for using its highport and
downport, a sharp increase in piracy occurred in the system, reducing
its status as a trade hub and necessitating a repeal of the tax.

Whenever the citizens of Caldos attempt to better their lives, outside
forces conspire to keep them down. With the highest population in
the Dustbelt, neither Tyr nor Acis wants to invest military resources to
enforce martial law on Caldos. The counterinsurgency effort alone would
require the creation of a massive bureaucracy, permanent garrison and
mercenary forces. The approach so far has been to keep the Caldosians
so busy mistrusting and discrediting each other that they do not have the
will to rise up en masse and break the chains of oppression.

While fomenting internecine squabbling and gridlock has worked for the
most part, there are two rather significant things that rankle Caldosians
to the bone; the planet's Class B orbital starport and the controlled flow
of water from the belts.

The immense highport was initially built by the Tyrian Lordships over
a century ago to provide a hub for trade on the spinward arm of the
Sindalian Main. With the Lordships now long gone, the highport has
since been modified, added to and updated by Acis and other regional
powers in haphazard fashion. Despite the importance of Caldos Highport
to the Dustbelt, the facility has not been well maintained and suffers from
a high number of breakdowns and accidents. Travellers are urged to
keep their vacc suits on when visiting. The facility maintains its Class B
status but just barely. Patronage from the Imperium and Florian League
keep most of its features operating on a shoestring budget.

Most Caldosians see the highport as a symbol of oppression. Few will
ever visit the facility during their lifetimes and even fewer will see a
single Credit from its existence. The station glows in the evening sky,
humming along in close orbit of the planet, serving the flow of trade
between the Florian League and the Imperium, reminding Caldosians
on a nightly basis that their star system is effectively not their own.
If that were not insulting enough, disgruntled Caldosians need look
no further than their blighted downports, none of which transcends a
Class D facility.

In addition to the starport situation, access to the water reserves of
the planetoid belts presents a much direr – some would say existential

- threat to Caldos. The planet is unable to sustain its hydrosphere
primarily for two reasons; its bright type-F star and its thin atmosphere.
No matter how much water is shipped to the planet, a great deal of it
burns off because Caldos does not have the technological resources
to prevent it from happening. The world depends on an unremitting
replenishment of water, courtesy of a fleet of drone spacecraft managed
by the highport administration, that harvest water from the belts and
bring it to Caldos much as it was done millennia ago. Whenever a glitch
occurs in the system and water shortages occur, the governments of
Caldos express their indignation.

As far as the run-of-the-mill Caldosian is concerned, starport access
and control of the planetoid belts present an untenable situation.
Fragmented as the people of Caldos are, if there were a rallying cause
to unite behind, either of these would suffice. The Caldosians are the
descendants of a progressive, innovative and ambitious people. It
remains to be seen whether they can summon the collective will to
break the bonds that contain them.

At this point, they seem doomed to suffer eternal servitude to the
indifferent forces of the Dustbelt.

##### Sojourner Light Trader

By C. Urs Wohlthat

While large corporations use jump-boats or purpose-built merchant ships
for maximum efficiency, tramp freighter captains have to make do with
whatever hull they can afford. The Soujourner light trader ranges even below
the ubiquitous 200-ton free and far traders when it comes to making do
along busy trade routes. With their meagre cargo capabilities and cramped
quarters, Sojourners excel only at one thing: maximum self-reliance for the
cheapest possible cost. They owe this trait to their architectural heritage.

The sleek lines of the dagger shaped hull give away this heritage at
first glance. The Sojourner is however not a true variant of the famous
Type-S but most ships of the class are indeed former scouts. Most
were salvaged or bought in a derelict state and completely refurbished
and rebuilt, often reassembling whole sections or modifying large parts
of the hull's interior. While this legally makes a Sojourner a new ship,
technically many parts of it are already decades or even centuries old,
leading to many quirks picked up along the way.

In consequence, no Sojourner is completely identical to any other ship
of the class. Most commonly however, a Type-S will see its docking
space, drone hangar and several tons of its fuel tank converted to a
cramped common area of four tons, a twin low berth chamber and
small biosphere for maximum autonomy. Additionally, some of the
bridge components (usually the computer and astrogator's station) will
move into the nose of the ship, where a downgraded sensor module
frees up space. The bridge bulkhead can then be moved forward, too,
allowing for one stateroom to be repositioned directly next to the office
and creating room for the common area.

The primary cargo hold is enlarged by removing the fuel tanks adjacent
and installing a cargo hatch, essentially converting the cargo deck into
one giant air lock. A secondary cargo space is created by repurposing
some of the main-deck fuel tank as well as the docking space and
drone hangar, using their former access doors for loading freight. This
secondary cargo space is also used for any luggage passengers might
bring, allowing easy access while in transit.

As many hulls slated for conversion have damaged jump drives, they
are usually rated down to jump-1 but that does not mean the drive
could no longer attain jump-2, although it would not be safe. Also,
the ship does not have enough fuel capacity left to engage jump-2,
although demountable fuel tanks could be installed, if necessary. These
conversions essentially make Sojourners available at TL10 or even TL9,
if a spare hull with undamaged armor can be provided to the yard.

While spare parts are cheap to come by in the Trojan Reaches, the
class is notorious for its high demand in maintenance hours. As the
Sojourner usually acts as a merchant vessel for both cargo and
passengers, its crew needs are already high. Although it can be crewed
in theory by a single person – owing to its Type-S heritage – four to
five are much more common: pilot, astrogator, engineer, steward and
medic. With such small cargo and cabin space, monetising a Sojourner
can only be achieved by cutting crew salaries, however. Thus, the
Sojourner is best known as a ship of family enterprises: two adults
and one or more adolescent children easily cuts salaries by half if not
more. This way, they can hope to even out at the end of the month
thanks to the workshop, fuel processors and some creative bunking of
passengers and family members.

##### Extravehicular Activity Suit

```
The extravehicular activity suit, often abbreviated to EVA suit, is
a form of vacc suit designed for repairs of a ship in flight. Only
minor repairs can be conducted by individuals in these suits but
those are usually lifesaving and thus cannot wait. EVA suits tend
to disappear from starfaring societies once repair drones become
available but remain commonplace for crews at the fringes of
society, adding to the proverbial self-reliance of belter communities
and tramp traders.
```

```
While the earliest models of EVA suits come with an electronics
suite equivalent to TL8, more advanced suits come with
electronics suites appropriate for their TL. All come with a tactical
video suite (TL7, page 28 Central Supply Catalogue), a 30 meter
tethering cable including either a magnetic grapple at the end
or a carbine hook, as well as an electronic tool set. From TL
onwards suits also include thruster packs (page 28 Central Supply
Catalogue). Additionally, early suits will also carry an electric
welding kit and a cutting torch. Advanced suits will instead mount
laser cutting gear (page 78 Central Supply Catalogue).

Under these circumstances it is not uncommon to find the family
sharing the cabin adjacent to the bridge office, while the other state
rooms go to passengers. To let the family squeeze every possible
Credit out of the Sojourner, the ship features a common area that can
seat up to 12 around a large table, which can be raised and lowered
from the ceiling. Many passengers in the outback of the Trojan Reach
tell stories of a trip they 'enjoyed' on a Sojourner, where they booked
steerage passage and ended up sharing three staterooms with 11
others for a total of 18 souls aboard, counting the family crew of four
and two passengers in the low berths.

As the hull comes installed with some armor and a double turret, many
Sojourners carry weapons for self-defence. Usually this is a beam
laser and a sandcaster but burst lasers or laser drills for prospecting
are almost as common. The combination of inconspicuous design,
preinstalled armor and double turret opens up another trade to crews
of these vessels however; the step from failing merchant to raider or
pirate is short. Many crews feel the lure of easy prey and while some
only steal once or twice during their career, others let it become a habit.
Still others buy a Sojourner precisely to become raiders of the Sindalian
Main or the Borderlands, because these ships do not raise red flags,
house a dozen pirates and still have room for cargo and a couple of
hostages. At double the thrust of a far trader, Sojourners can be on their
way before help arrives.

The renowned or even notorious self-reliance and outright autarky of
their crews, with the dubious nature of their trades and undertakings
puts many crews of a Sojourner into a similar social niche as belters
or other drifters at the fringes of interstellar society. In fact, the
term 'Sojourner' has been applied to the crews themselves and, in
extension, to crews of other tramp traders in the Trojan Reach. The
denomination is rarely positive however, and can fuel fisticuffs in a
belter bar if understood as a denigration.

Sojourner light traders are usually converted from Type-S starships
and such a conversion will result in 'used as new' vessels. The
facilities needed for a conversion like this are present at most Class
B starports, provided the original ship has a running jump drive. In
theory, hulls in any state of deterioration can be converted so long as
they are structurally sound. Cases in which scavengers have towed
multiple derelict hulls into a shipyard, asking for a single Sojourner
to be built out of the wreckage, are common yarns in Travellers' Aid

##### The Gauss Rifle's Big Brother

By Jeremy Rector

**Mag Cannon:** These heavy weapons are 25–30mm human portable
mass drivers designed to accurately and quietly deliver small munitions.
Its variable power, controlled by an onboard computer, provides up to
300m/s muzzle velocity. This flexibility allows direct-fire or can arc a
payload over hard cover to drop it right on a target's head.

The mag cannon can take data from its onboard range finder, a
battlefield sensor web, or other data sources, to identify and target
anything within range. Biased magnetic fields apply spin to the
projectile, for stabilization.

Available munitions include most ammunition types available for
heavier weapons, generally excluding nuclear-based rounds that create
something of a hazard for the operator. In direct-fire mode, this weapon
is somewhat more powerful than a shotgun. In indirect-fire mode, the
rounds fired are as powerful as a grenade of the same type, the shells
not requiring the additional propellant, or casing to withstand barrel
pressures associated with propellant based weapons. RAM grenades
cannot be used in this weapon.

The mag cannon can be fed from a magazine, belt or 'Smart' box with
up to four different types of round, selected at time of firing. When
using the 12-round magazine, the weapon is human portable, the
belt or Smart box generally requiring the weapon to be stationary or
vehicle mounted. However, it can be carried and used by battle dress
equipped troops.

##### Corporal Vishnu Zarca

By C. Urs Wohlthat

A man wronged many times over. Renegade. Ex-marine turned pirate.
Ronin even. Former corporal Vishnu Zarca has been called all of that and
worse. But he never felt words could describe what he felt or the abysmal
misery he was cast into, transforming him from a loving husband, soon-
to-be father and loyal marine of the Imperium into who he is now. Rage?
Hatred? Sure, he feels all of that but those are just superficial feelings
his mind comes up with to process what he has been feeling deep
down in his core for over 20 years, since it all began: plenary existential
angst. The utter disorientation that manifests into a being so thoroughly
uprooted by an inimical act, which makes it lose all grips on itself, setting
free the raw creature beneath the veneer of civilization.

All that Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) knows for certain about former
Corporal Zarca is that he started as one of theirs. As an Imperial
Starmarine, he was transferred to Dostoevsky Station (Dpres, Trojan
Reach) over 20 years ago, shortly before the defection of future
arch-pirate Admiral Darokyn. Shortly afterwards, Zarca's future wife
transferred to the Dostoevsky system as well being part of the crew of
the Eviscerator, an Imperial ship detached to the 203rd Colonial Fleet
at Dpres. Sometime later, when the couple had just become parents,
Corporal Zarca was part of a pirate hunt, sent to capture or kill Admiral
Darokyn. Intelligence had caught a lead on the defector and was
certain his flag ship had been sighted over the planet of Gabriel. It was
the largest mustering of its forces the 203rd Colonial Fleet had seen
in centuries but it turned out to be a year long hunt that ended in utter
debacle – and the end of many careers for flag officers of the fleet.

Corporal Zarca never returned but his journey through the Outrim Void
had only begun. Now, almost one and a half decades later, the INI
has recovered Zarca's personal video-log from an unknown source.
The whereabouts of the renegade pirate are unknown and it is even
uncertain if he still lives. Word has it that the INI is paying premium for
leads on him and has contracted several bounty hunters: preferring
a cold return. It seems what they read from his log has set in motion
bigger cogwheels.

MORE THAN 14 YEARS AGO
We've been huntin' Darokyn for almost a year now. Damn, I hate this
guy! Not only did he make me miss Kal and the kids but his defection
has already cost us at least a dozen marines plus an escort. Regal
Pride, fancy name. She burnt a full 24 hours after Darokyn's trap
sprung... Man, the navy guys at poker tonight will be pissed. Especially
that dude Yerzey. I think he had a girl on the Pride.

14 YEARS AGO
We're on to him now. Our CO got the green light from the old man
himself: Admiral Deacon Roberts. The legend himself. We've been
huntin' Darokyn for a year now and not once have I seen Admiral
Roberts relaxed. He's always looking like a bloodhound carrying all the
weight of the world on his shoulders.

That was the claxon. We'll board the shuttles now. In four hours, we
should have taken over our target: Potlicker, an old Magenta repair
ship. That'll be our trojan horse to get to Darokyn's flagship.

6 YEARS AGO
... I, I, don't know where to begin... I remember, we were boarding the
Potlicker. When we started advancing through the docking section, we
heard claxons screeching as the general alarms went off. We thought
that would be about us, but then the ship started shaking as if hit by
weapons fire. That couldn't be us our shuttle was only lightly armed.
Next, we lost the feed to the shuttle and then these figures appeared:
marines, but not ours. Definitely not Darokyn's either... Their helmets
were all bug-eyed. It all goes blank then. I don't mean we were subdued.
Although, maybe we were. But I don't remember, like... nothing.

The next thing I know is waking up. Here. Hearing that strange
woman's noise. She calls herself 'Golden Queen'. On Yggdrasil,
apparently. Calling that a backwater dustball would not be an
insult... What a piece... She says she 'bought' our cryo-berths from
a wandering Aslan merchant. Screw her! Those weren't Aslans who
engaged us. Maybe human mercenaries working for Aslan but how
likely is that? And what about boarding the Potlicker, precisely when we
were boarding, too?

Anyway, this tool of a queen demands I earn my freedom back. Yeah,
right... She gave me time to think about it: work for her for one year,
then be free to do whatever I like. Meanwhile, she'll be looking out for
me... I don't like it. She also gave me another piece of information: I've
been in the ice box for eight years. So, that's a gamechanger... Screw
Darokyn! And screw these headaches! I've been vomiting and feeling
like my head will explode for a solid hour now.

Her deal is easy: I'll be her problem solver and, in return, she will help
me find my family and pay me a wage... Damn! That's bleak. It's only
just dawning on me... Kalassa, Kolomy and Hastir. I haven't been
there for years now. Where are they now? If only these headaches
would go away...

MORE THAN 5 YEARS AGO
I'm beginning to settle in. The 'Supreme Goddess Incarnate' and 'Mother
of Water' is giving me time and space to accustom. But yeah, it's still
looking bleak. She also told me she was having her Imperial contacts
look into my matter. This could take time of course... I probably shouldn't
expect anything from her before my contract time is up.

5 YEARS AGO
Still got these headaches. And yesterday I woke up but I wasn't in my
bed. I was lying in a bed, yes, but it belonged to Herbert's, a cheap
hotel here in the palace space station.

Also, my year with her majesty is up but I decided to stay. She offered
it; I didn't have to ask. I think she needs my services at least as much
as I need her money and resources. These knuckleheads are really far
behind in almost everything. My headaches are getting worse again...
And I keep on having these dreams about soldiers in bug-eyed armor.

Her majesty, the queen, has also 'confided' that her investigations
about my family never led anywhere. At least not those she sent over
official Imperial channels. She offered me the services of one of her
sleuths. The sleuth is charging moderate rates but travelling expanses
will add up, once that needs to happen.

MORE THAN 4 YEARS AGO
Those blasted headaches won't disappear. The queen's doc couldn't
find anything. Said it's probably post-traumatic. Yeah, smart boy. I told
him, I keep waking up in different places every other month or so. He
just looked at me and told me to drink less. Drekhead! I haven't drunk
so little since I was a boy. He gave me some pills then. Nice stuff.
Makes me feel special, bursting head or not.

I had an interesting encounter today here in her majesty's palace. I met
one of the queen's relatives, or shall I say 'business partners'? A young
trader named Sal. She might be valuable, as she seems to have her
own ship and good contacts.

MORE THAN 3 YEARS AGO
I received word from my sleuth on Kalassa and the kids. It seems she
was re-posted and got transferred to Gabriel but never arrived there,
apparently... Her ship was ordered to take a detour and patrol Janus,
before jumping to Gabriel... The Eviscerator never arrived over Janus
but her hulk was found drifting above the largest gas giant several
weeks after she was due. With big, radiating holes in her belly and
rumors of alien raiders preying on some of the smaller settlements
on Janus, it's pretty obvious what happened: Aslan! Probably a light
warship with some of their Elar Kha'yaheh fighters that surprised the
Eviscerator, when she was skimming... I don't know what to feel...
just numb... It's unlikely the twins were onboard with her. But where
could they be without their mother? Her majesty has already expressed
her condolences to me. This just feels wrong. I'm the one who was
supposedly killed in action. But here I am... Alive, forgotten and a
bloody widower...

3 YEARS AGO
Big changes are coming for my services unto the queen. The planetary
government of Yggdrasil, with whom the queen is 'not on speaking
terms' just seized her most prized ore-freighter to 'settle debts of the
crown'. That pretty much tanked the queen's funds for the future...

Thus, the queen will release me from my duties and contract me on
a case-by-case basis. I hope I trained my replacements well. She
arranged for Sal to take me as far as Acis to find a new occupation,
make contacts and gather intel. She even made the doc hand me over
a big box of his pills, because these lousy headaches come and go
every other week.

MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO
I did not see this coming. I travelled with Sal for a couple of months
along the Sindalian Main to Acis. I learned a lot about being a spacer, a
trader and a gunner. Once on the main, I found proposals to join crews
of mercenaries and pirates quite frequently. Becoming a pirate? Might
actually work as a cover for my work on behalf of the Golden Queen...

MORE THAN 1 YEAR AGO
After becoming pirates, we stayed on the main a while. But today, our
cruise ended, and I came to Theev for the first time in my life. Never
had I thought, as an Imperial Marine, that I would come here. Nor that
I would get an offer by one of Darokyn's captains to join his crew. Life's
a joke, really, isn't it? I get hired by the man who started all of this.
Including my headaches... They get worse again.

Seriously, I haven't had headaches and nightmares so bad since...
Well, since I learned of Kalassa's demise. I woke up not in my bunk
but in a storage space. I have no idea how I got there. I remember my
face hurting. Being swollen, too... And my knuckles hurt. Almost like I
was in fight. But with whom? I can't remember one thing about having a
fight with someone... I was asleep! Anyway, some of the other marines
aboard the Sorrowful Maiden keep looking at me full of hatred. Like I
crossed them the wrong way or something. I don't know what's going
on here...

The Admiral wanted to have a word with me. In person. That got my
blood pumping. It's not something that normally happens. I answered
that I cannot remember getting in a fight with anyone aboard. When I
was standing to attention in his office... Boom! My head starts hurting,
like someone was twisting a plasma torch down my right eye and
trying to blow my skull from the inside at the same time. I cried out in
pain. Everyone looked at me, as we were sitting in the mess hall. Then
everything went blank... I came to my senses, waking up in the cabin
of our medic... He was holding a wrench in his right, one eye bloodshot
and swollen... Told me I had punched him right in the face, when they
wrestled me to the ground. With four men.

Naturally, Darokyn kicked me out. Well, luckily not out of the airlock. I'm
back on Theev now. I caught up with that captain I met the other time
we were here. One Ferrick Redthane...

##### Guerraedzahkhue 'Ed' Zhaerdeng, Pilot

**By Geir Lanesskog**

**Location:** Any starport with a bar in The Beyond
**Required Equipment:** A starship, preferably one which could use a
primary or secondary pilot
**Reward:** An excellent pilot willing to work for passage

**Mission:** Offer working passage to a pilot

Guerraedzahkhue 'Ed' Zhaerdeng ('call me Ed') is an out of work Vargr
starship pilot. He will spin a story (verifiable, although the details are a little
fuzzy) of his former employers going out of business after a drive failure
grounded their starship. Ed wants to 'get off this heap' and is willing to take
working passage with anyone who will accommodate him and his custom
Stinger SZ-100 g/bike, 'Baby'. The g/bike will either fit with Ed in a single
occupancy stateroom or occupy one ton of cargo space.

Referee's Information
Roll 1D or choose from one of the options below:

**1:** All is as stated. With his skills and dexterity Ed has DM+5 when
piloting, making him close to his billing of 'the best starship pilot you'll
ever see', and he is willing to take working passage for up to three
jumps, after which he will negotiate for a permanent position or leave
the Travellers' ship. He is a reliable pilot, whose drinking is more an
act than an affliction, but he is extremely dyslexic and has trouble
with written instructions and displays. He also lacks any knowledge of
astrogation and is generally useless outside the cockpit or the g/bike
seat. While vague about his past, Ed is little trouble unless someone
calls him a liar or criticizes his flying skills; then he is liable to bite.

**2–3:** As above but Ed has several traffic infractions resulting in suspended
pilot's certifications in the Monarchy of Lod and Stormhaven Republic. If
fines of Cr10000 are paid in each jurisdiction his license can be reinstated
but if found piloting in Lod or Stormhaven space, the Travellers' ship will be
grounded until the fines are paid or Ed is released from employment.

**4:** As all above but Ed's drinking problem is beginning to affect his
performance. On any given flight day – generally arrival and departure
from a starport or during gas giant refuelling – Ed will be intoxicated on
a 2D roll of 9+. This will remove his DEX modifier and change his INT
modifier from +1 to -1. Any incident resulting in a boarding – including
a random inspection – will test for intoxicants. If drunk, Ed will be fined
Cr10000x1D and have his license suspended for a year, unless the
Travellers can overcome or subvert the local legal authorities.

**5–6:** As all above but Ed is associated with the Sequoia Nasirim, a
Soho-class light freighter (see JTAS Volume 1, page 76) that dabbles
in smuggling and piracy. In an out-of-the-way location – a Class D or
worse starport or a lonely gas giant – the Travellers' ship will encounter
the Sequoia Nasirim. Ed will attempt to lock the Travellers out of the
bridge and maneuver to allow the pirates to board the vessel. Ed is
only armed with a TL12 stunner and will surrender to the Travellers if
they threaten Baby.

GUERRAEDZAHKHUE 'ED' ZHAERDENG
Guerraedzahkhue Zhaerdeng (Goor-ed-zha-koo Zhaer-dung) begins
most conversations by stating his full name and then saying, 'call me
Ed'. He is a dark brown-furred, slightly built, relatively tall Vargr with a
sharp muzzle and protruding canines. When first encountered, often in
a starport bar, he is typically wearing a black leather trench coat over a
black body suit. The outfit doubles as ballistic armor, providing overall
Protection +7 or +3 with just the bodysuit. A black and very bright yellow
grav cycle helmet with flourishes making it resemble a dragon's head
usually sits on the countertop or hangs from a clip on his coat.

Ed is the best pilot you will ever meet, or so he says. He is currently
'between employers' and is vague about his origins: 'I grew up in a
bad neighborhood'. His Galanglic has a definite Imperial, Spinward
Marches accent and his Gvegh is poor, with a clear Galanglic accent
and random grammar. He also speaks a 'smidgen' of Zdetl, Trokh and
very mangled Vilani.

Ed has only two possessions he cares about: his custom Aeon Flyer
Stinger SZ-100 g/bike 'Baby' and his custom TL12 vacc suit, whose
headpiece doubles as his grav cycle helmet. Both sport a bright yellow
and black 'bumble bee' colour scheme. While he wears his leathers for
'local rides', he dons his vacc suit for 'serious runs', including rides to
and from orbit. He will go on at length to describe how to make flights to
nearby moons by the 'fly fast and coast' method using just Baby's lifters
and limited only by his air supply. He claims to have done this twice.

Ed's main vocation is as a starship pilot. He is willing to take working
passage on any ship, provided he can take along Baby. He forgets
to mention that he does not know astrogation, although will admit it
if asked. He is very dyslexic and flies by instinct, not instruction, and
really cannot understand written manuals or detailed warning displays.
If asked for references from former employers, he gets vague and
inconsistent, generally saying 'they're no longer in business' or 'they
had a mishap – not my flying, mind you, but bad engines'.

He is a reliable pilot. He normally does not drink as much as he lets on
and really can fly just about anything, although he likes to showboat
and a detailed background check will find evidence of many minor
starport traffic infractions but no accidents. He does like his tales,

however, and while most are at least partially true, details vary with
each telling but, if someone calls him a liar or denigrates his skills, he is
likely to fight and he has a nasty bite.

AEON FLYER STINGER G/BIKE SERIES
The Aeon Flyer Consortium specialises in high-performance stylish
grav vehicles, which are as much status symbol as transport. The
Stinger series of g/bike has been Aeon's premiere model line for more
than two centuries.

The entry level SZ-100 is an old design but the base unit costs more
than twice as much as a typical g/bike. Among serious enthusiasts and
celebrities, owners of the SZ-100 are considered to be posers and pale
imitations of true Stinger riders. However, there exists a considerable
subculture of SZ-100 riders who have heavily modified their bikes,
improving the electronics and automation to the point where the vehicle
can compare with a more advanced model in all but speed.

The most current top-of-the-line Stinger model is the SZ-580Z, which
carries a base price of more than Cr200000. The SZ-580Z is capable of
supersonic flight and comes standard with an advanced autopilot and
sophisticated customisable personality unit. The vehicle can literally fly
itself and can be instructed to perform complex tasks autonomously.
Enthusiasts are loath to admit it but the autopilot's skill is superior to
most riders and only a machine is capable of avoidance maneuvers
at supersonic speed. The rider is more passenger than driver in most
circumstances. The ability to exceed the speed of sound in most
atmospheres is academic, as local regulations tend to limit supersonic
flight to well-defined corridors and many urban jurisdictions require
autopilot control and velocities below 200 kilometers per hour.

All Stingers come equipped with a gravchute ejection system.
Recommended rider attire is rated as a vacc suit, although most
riders ensure their suits and helmets are suitably stylish, which often
precludes carrying all but a minimal supply of oxygen. Common
upgrades include the computer and entertainment systems, with hull
modifications to ensure their vehicle stands out uniquely.

#### BestiaryBestiary

##### Atichnae

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli
(Susurrus Bestiola)

With a humanoid shape that, were it not for their obvious unintelligence,
could get them confused with a sophont alien, the atichnae are a
swarming creature found on Condaria (E54779B-5) in Freikorps
Skander. Flying in groups of 20–30, they have no hierarchy or real
group structure, instead acting as a singular entity. When one is
separated from the swarm it will stop moving and emit a high-pitched
screech, in order to be located.

Eating anything in their path with serrated fangs, the atichnae will
consume whatever living creature it encounters, its large swarm size
reducing even the largest of creatures to nothing more than bone and
viscera. At approximately 30 centimeters in height with a weight of one
kilogram, they are formidable when spotted in the distance. This is
compounded by the 'whispering' of their wings and constant chittering
to one another.

Due to the proportion of their wings in relation to their body (2:1) they travel
quickly with almost reckless abandon towards any moving target in sight.
The sharp tips on the crest of their wings can be used, with great effort, to
cut through overgrowth that hinders their ability to flee from predators.

This see-hunt-kill method of movement means they are unrestricted
in their habitat, their single lung filtering the tainted air of the planet
remarkably well. An issue, however, is in the right chest cavity, which
contains their stomach; the most common cause of death being
inhaling food. If food accidentally enters the lung, the creature will
seize and cease breathing. Often, due to this anomaly, singular dead
atichnae can be found abandoned by the swarm.

With leathery skin in shades of green and blue, they often blend into
terrain, stopping on farmlands to rest for three or four hours before
continuing on their path of destruction. They can change their sexual
biology when necessary; if the swarm is lacking males a small number of
females will simply become male in order to procreate and vice versa.

The standard gestation period is one month, with pregnant females in
the later stages of pregnancy being supported by two others. Atichnae
are raised in preparation for life as part of a swarm, with all being
equally responsible for the lives of the young, although they are born
fully capable. With a short lifespan of only six to eight months, the
turnover is remarkably high.

Atichnae are not particularly intelligent and act more as destructive pests
than sentient hunters. Often drawn by the dust caused by harvesting
fields, they are more active in the inhabited areas of Condaria during this
time. Historic disuse of their legs means they are incredibly slow whilst on
the ground, instead relying on their wings to cross large distances.

##### The Hunter Career

**By Christopher Griffen**

Travellers who are specialized in the arts of hunting, wilderness survival
and ecology management are found throughout Charted Space. Hunters,
survivalists, rangers, preservationists and other outdoorspeople operate
both within the borders of the Imperium and on its fringes. The Imperium
is a diverse and varied place. The varied demographics of Charted
Space often result in settled worlds being only a parsec away from star
systems that contain entire worlds of pristine wilderness. Furthermore,
many populated planets and even some industrial high-tech worlds have
wildlife preserves of their own. Such are the places where hunters and
their ilk operate for pleasure and profit.

```
The hunter career is for Travellers who delve into the wilder
environments of Charted Space. They can be found hunting or
interacting with the many animal species and plants that exist within
the galaxy.

PROFESSION (HUNTING)
The Profession (hunting) skill gives the Traveller in-depth knowledge
of the techniques, equipment and weaponry used for hunting. Allow
Travellers to use Profession (hunting) for checks or as a positive DM in
hunting-related activities. For example:

_Identify and find the native habitat of an alien animal_ : Difficult (10+)
Navigation check (1D hours, EDU). Add Profession (hunting) skill level
as a positive DM for this check.

Sneak up on prey in its native environment: Difficult (10+) Stealth check
(2D minutes, DEX). Add Profession (hunting) skill level as a positive
DM for this check.

Determine the appropriate weapon and ammunition to take down
_a specific animal_ : Average (8+) Gun Combat check (EDU). Add
Profession (hunting) skill level as a positive DM for this check.

Assist a fellow Traveller or NPC in a hunting-related task: Average (8+)
Profession (hunting) check (1D minutes, EDU). Effect 0–3 enables the
individual to perform the task. Effect 4+ does the same, adding DM+1
to the subsequent check by the instructed individual.

##### Noricum Viollera

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli
(papilio purpura)

Found within the oceans and marshlands of Noricum (A58A7CC-E) in
the Trojan Reach, this plant is useful for its excellent air processing abil-
ities. Able to filter oxygen from even the least dense of atmospheres,
the viollera is praised by botanists for a variety of uses. Unfortunately,
due to the rather xenophobic society of the native peoples it can be
hard for offworlders to collect one to cultivate.

Needing a temperate climate of 23o–30oC for optimal growth, the plant
must be misted every six hours with nutrient rich water heated to pre-
cisely 17oC. Sometimes found within a botanist's shower thanks to its
evolutionary necessity for humidity, it is impossible to overwater it per
its natural oceanic habitat. The usual cause of wilting is a lack of water,
a common occurrence for those unused to its natural growth conditions.

As it usually grows in areas of lesser light and is often overshadowed
by trees, the viollera is intolerant to bright lights and should be kept
in partial to full shade. One trait of the plant, other than its air filtering
capability, is that it is nearly impossible to kill. The soil used should be
nutrient rich with adequate aeration provided to ensure the flow of wa-
ter. Acidic soil is no detriment to the plant, so peat moss may be used
during periods of water scarcity.

Dead leaves should be trimmed and disposed of immediately and when
receiving appropriate care, leaves will appear a luscious dark purple
with an almost mirror-like shine to them. The growing period lasts three
to four months and will be evidenced by growth of new leaves and
lavender flowers. The flowers are papilionaceous and grow in a corymb
manner. Any dead flowers should be removed, as they can cause the
stem holding them to rot.

The plant can only be duplicated by means of water propagation, as
the roots' only purpose is to hold the plant in place in the oceans of
Noricum. It will detach flourishing parts, dropping them into the water
below. It takes seven to eight months to grow a viable plant from this
point, including a new root system able to reach soil. Other methods of
propagation are ineffective and simply lead to rot. This unusual method
is possible due to the oceanic environment and has aided in the spread
of viollera around the entire globe.

As beneficial as it is beautiful, the Akalif use the plant for medicinal
purposes, although it is toxic if consumed. After much experimentation

the Akalif found the flowers can be ground into a poultice that acts as
a disinfectant, used to clean minor wounds, scrapes and other such
ailments. By adding five millilitres of water to 20 flower heads enough
will be made to cover a large scratch. The poultice is ineffective against
viruses and bacteria already infecting the wound, however. Travellers
wishing to use it to clean a minor wound or scrape receive DM+1 to
Medic checks.

**Signs of Inadequate Care**
•  Wilted leaves – This plant is too cold.
•  Leaves turning lilac instead of deep purple – This plant is receiving
too much light.
•  Blue spots on the underside of leaves – This plant is storing water,
as it is not receiving enough.
•  No growth – This plant needs to be moved to more nutrient rich soil
or is currently dormant.

The high level of care needed to house the viollera and difficulties in its
acquisition makes it a rarer collection piece for the home-botanist.

##### Divine Intervention

By Lawrence Schick and John Harshman

**Location:** Pavabid (C6678D8-6), District 268, Spinward Marches
**Required Skills:** Electronics (computers), Investigate, Mechanic,
Recon, Stealth
**Reward:** Cr700000

**Mission:** Deliver the device to the palace of Orobid in order to convince
the Thearch to allow iridium mining

**Summary:** The adventure takes place on Pavabid, which is ruled by a
religious dictatorship. This deeply entrenched theocracy is a rigid offshoot
of the widespread Church of the Stellar Divinity. All activities are regarded
as religious in nature and the church has laid down rules of behaviour
for even the most mundane aspects of everyday life. Offworlders are
permitted on the planet only at the spaceport and trade enclave. This area
of four square kilometers is completely cut off from the rest of Pavabid by
hundreds of kilometers of wilderness and water, in order to prevent outside
contamination of pure Pavabidian society. It is staffed by only the most
loyal members of the thearchy and guarded by church troops.

The Law Level in the trade enclave is 8; in normal Pavabid society it is
9 or even 10. The Travellers' Aid Society classifies Pavabid as amber
(dangerous) because it is easy to run afoul of its many laws, even in
the trade enclave. Pavabid is potentially a rich world but its severe trade
restrictions have kept its' wealth and Tech Level lower than those of its
neighbors, Collace and Trexalon. Pavabid's near-average gravity, standard
atmosphere, temperate weather-systems and bountiful water make for
a physically pleasant world. However, Pavabid's population of about
700 million people live in a stagnant, rigid society. Since immigration and
emigration are illegal and information is strictly controlled, the majority of the
inhabitants can conceive of no other style of life. Most live in small towns built
around light industry, separated from each other by agricultural districts.

##### A Message from God

On a stopover at Collace (B628943-D), the Travellers are staying at the
Collace Down Starport Hotel. Returning to the hotel one evening, they
discover a stranger waiting for them in their room. He apologises for the
irregular manner of making their acquaintance but he wishes to speak
to them on a matter requiring extreme discretion. He represents certain
unnamed interests on Collace who require a group of experienced
troubleshooters with no known connections on Collace for an important
job. The mission involves a slight amount of danger but the Travellers
will be well paid for the risk; they will be lent certain valuable equipment

necessary for their task and will be allowed to keep it if they are
successful. The equipment would be worth several hundred thousand
credits on the open market and should be ample recompense.

##### The Pavabidian Church

The basic belief of the Church of the Stellar Divinity is that all stars are
gods, conscious beings of transcendental power. If a man worships
his sun, lives a good life and follows the teachings of the church, his
soul will acquire spiritual mass and upon his death will be drawn into
his sun, where it will join with the deity. The church is popular in the
Imperium, where it makes few demands on a worshipper's life and does
not compete with the government. The church on Pavabid subscribes
to what is known as the Pavabidian Heresy, claiming that a star-god
sometimes sends part of its consciousness to inhabit the body of a
man, who is called the 'Son of the Star' and who is therefore divine and
infallible. The first Son of the Star was Pavabid, who conquered his
world in a religious war and renamed it for himself.

A further tenet of the Pavabidian church is that the stars are not
brothers but enemies; people from other stars are enemies of God
and contact with offworlders is therefore forbidden to all except a
faithful few. Pavabid is only one jump from Collace. The industrialists
of Collace have always been frustrated by Pavabid's refusal to allow
outside exploitation of her abundant heavy metals but it was only
a minor irritation in the past, as Tarsus, Avastan and Inchin provide
enough raw materials to satisfy Collace's factories. Recently, however,
it became known through certain unorthodox channels that the
Pavabidians had discovered massive deposits of iridium (with some
platinum) on their world.

Iridium is relatively rare in the Spinward Marches and its industrial
uses make it extremely valuable. Certain elements of the thearchy
recommended exploitation of the deposits for the good of the Church
but they were vetoed by Orobid, the Son of the Star, Thearch and
Divine Ruler of Pavabid. Proper exploitation would require the help of
offworlders and unbelievers could not be allowed on the sacred ground
of Pavabid outside the trade enclave. The unnamed interests want to
see those iridium deposits exploited and by Collace.

The only way to accomplish this, short of conquest of Pavabid (an
action which a world being considered for membership in the Imperium,
as Collace is, would never undertake), is to persuade the thearch to
reverse his position. To that end, the scientists of the interests have
constructed a small device that will project the image and sound of
what a believer in the mysteries of the stellar divinity will think is a
message from God. The problem is that someone must deliver this
device to the inner sanctum of Orobid himself!

##### The Mission

The Travellers will be taken to Pavabid aboard a freighter making
a routine jump. Except for the one spaceport, Pavabid is a closed
world but the Travellers must be put down near the current location
of Orobid's palace without being detected. Pavabid's satellite warning
system was built by TTC (the Trexalon Technical Consortium), since the
thearchy's technology was not up to the task. Unbeknownst to Pavabid,
the Trexalonians built secret override circuits into the satellite system.

Unbeknownst to Trexalon, the interests on Collace, Trexalon's biggest
rival, have acquired full knowledge of the override system. Technicians
aboard the freighter will use this knowledge to override the defences of
the satellite that covers the area of the planet they will be penetrating. It
will be fed false data that show nothing unusual happening.

The Travellers will drop down to the surface in a launch, landing in
the wilderness at the beginning of the long Pavabidian night (Pavabid
has a 30-hour day and it is late summer, so the night will last about 14
hours). They are to conceal the launch and fly the remaining distance
by individual grav belts. These will be provided by the employers. The
Travellers should fly at tree-top level to avoid being picked up by the
palace radar. The group should reach the palace after flying due east
for approximately two hours. Strict radio silence is to be observed at all
times while on-planet.

Orobid's palace is a floating building, suspended in the air by hundreds
of null gravity modules. Anti-gravity is otherwise unknown on Pavabid,
so the palace guards should not be expecting a silent infiltration from

above. The employers are unable to supply the Travellers with plans
of the palace – the group will just have to find their own way around.
The Travellers should arrive at the palace one hour into the Pavabidian
sleep period, so all but a few guards should be asleep (native
Pavabidians live on a cycle of 10 hours asleep, 20 hours awake).
The Travellers must find Orobid's sleep chamber, place the message
device, activate it and leave. The real trick is that the group must leave
no physical evidence that they were ever in the palace. Anybody who
sees or detects the presence of the intruders must be stunned and
taken along when the group leaves. To aid in this, each Traveller will be
provided with an experimental stun carbine that is totally silent.

Noisy weapons are not to be used in or near the palace. The contents
of the divine message should help to cover for the intrusion. In addition
to praise for Orobid and his regime and the message that the iridium
is a divine gift to be exploited in the most efficient manner, the voice of
God will mention that he may choose to elevate some of the members
of the palace staff immediately and take them with him upon his return
to the Star. Also, the holy presence of the divine messenger may cause
some of Orobid's servants to have hallucinations of strange happenings
in the night. These minor distractions should be ignored. After the
message is delivered, the holographic projector will utterly destroy itself
in a blinding flash.

Certain Trexalonian elements seem to suspect Collace is planning
something, so the intrusion and placement of the device must take
place at the planned time, before the Trexalonians can interfere. The
Travellers must return to the launch and get back to the freighter before
dawn. If the Travellers are successful, they will be allowed to keep the
grav belts and stun carbines used in the mission. Secrecy is a condition
of their employment: if they ever speak of their mission to anyone, they
will come to regret it.

##### Equipment

If Travellers desire further equipment, they should inform the Collacians.
Using the Travellers' money, an official will be sent to purchase whatever
equipment they desire, and can afford, provided it is available.

**Individual Equipment:** Each Traveller will be given one of the following
for use on the mission:
•  **Grav Belt:** Personal anti-gravity transportation using a single
null gravity module and a personal harness (see Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 118). The harness is equipped with four extensible
straps and folding mini-harnesses for carrying additional loads. Such
additional loads are awkward and may inhibit the flyer's freedom of
movement, inflicting DM-1 to DEX checks whilst encumbered.

```
•  Helmet Recorder: Each individual must wear a black crash helmet
with a microsensor video and audio recorder built into the crown.
Recordings of the mission will be viewed after the Travellers' return
to assess their success or failure and to gather information about
the interior of Orobid's palace in case a follow-up mission should
prove necessary.
•  TL8 Stunner: As shown on page 129 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.
```

##### Referee Information

The 'unnamed interests' on Collace that want to see the Pavabid
iridium deposits opened up are several. The first is Colmetal, Inc., a
huge industrial combine that operates mines throughout the subsector.
Second is the government of Collace, which wants to make sure
that the money from the expected iridium boom passes through their
world. Third is the Imperial Navy, which wants to ensure that the
valuable metal finds its way into the Imperium. Collace has applied for
membership in the Imperium and although there are many formalities to
complete, the navy knows that Collace is unlikely to be denied.

The navy wants the iridium available for its own fleets, so do not
want Trexalon to be the developer of the deposits. Trexalon has
been developing long-range economic ties with the Sword Worlds
Confederation and a large percentage of the metal would undoubtedly
find its way there if Trexalon were to get the mining franchise. It was the
navy who arranged to provide the grav belts and stun carbines for the
group who would undertake the mission. Neither Colmetal, the navy,
nor the Collace government could use their own agents on this mission,
for fear that they would be identified as such by the efficient Trexalonian
spy network.

The Collacians received their information about Pavabid from a
renegade techpriest on the staff of the Pavabid Starport. He provided
the news about the iridium/platinum deposits and gave the Collacians
enough information about the church and Orobid that they could
confidently create the message from God. The techpriest was then
supposed to provide them with the plans for Orobid's palace but he has
now disappeared. The Collacians theorize that he was caught by the
thearchy and executed.

Actually, the techpriest was kidnapped by agents of TTC, the Trexalon
Technical Consortium. Although the techpriest died under interrogation
before revealing everything, the TTC now knows that something is up
and are on their guard. When the Pavabid defence satellite is tampered
with, technicians in the Trexalon embassy on Pavabid will notice the
momentary disruption. A TTC ship will lift within an hour and take up orbit
in the vicinity of the satellite. With some idea of what is going on, the
Trexalonians will send down a team of hitmen by air/raft to try to stop it
(see page 66). Like the Collacians, the Trexalonians must conduct their

operations in absolute secrecy, they cannot just blow the whistle on the
Collace team. If the thearchy thinks they are being manipulated by any
group of offworlders, they will close the whole planet and any chance of
ever getting at the iridium deposits will be lost.

SUCCESS OF THE MISSION
If the Travellers can plant the message without leaving any evidence of
having been in the palace, the mission will likely succeed. Orobid, like
99% of the thearchists, really does believe in his religion and the divinity
of his star. Naturally, it will come as a stunning surprise to receive a
message direct from the deity; such things are recorded in the sacred
writings but substantiated miracles in historical times are rare. On the
other hand, who else would the Plasma Angel appear to but Orobid?

The Collace psychotechs have done their job well and Orobid will be
inclined to believe the message in the absence of contrary evidence.
Roll 2D with DM-1 for each piece of solid evidence the Travellers
have left behind; this includes eyewitnesses, bullet holes, bloodstains,
machinery that has obviously been tampered with and so forth. On a
score of 2+, Orobid believes the message from God as a true vision.

##### The Floating Palace

The aerial palace of the Thearch was designed to be the most
impressive technological object on Pavabid. The entire building is
supported in the air by hundreds of grav modules. The citizens of
Pavabid have been deliberately stagnated at Tech Level 6 and have
never heard of anti-gravity, so to them the palace is supported by the
power of God (as they have been led to believe). Actually, it was built at
the shipyard at Glisten (A000986-F) in 874 from an order by the then-
current thearch, Lenebid. It cost a great deal to construct and transport
to Pavabid, and it is expensive to maintain, but the thearchy has the
tithe-taxes of an entire world to draw upon.

The thearch uses the palace as a continuous reminder to the areas it
passes over that God (and the state, which represents the divinity on
Pavabid) is always watching. Wherever it may be, the palace is always
in continuous telecommunications contact with the capital city, so the
business of governing Pavabid will not be interrupted. At the time of
the mission, the thearch is vacationing and his palace is drifting slowly
across the wilderness.

The palace is circular, just over 50 meters in diameter, with the first
deck shaped like a flat ring. This ring is surmounted by a golden dome,
33 meters in diameter. The second through fourth decks curved around
the rear of this dome and are topped by a tall broadcast tower. The
underside of the ring is wrapped in a gleaming grating, which acts as
a catwalk and support for the engineers who must maintain the grav
modules. Spaced evenly around the underside are folded hydraulic

support legs, used when it becomes necessary to land the palace
for refuelling or in harsh weather. The topside of the ring in front of
the dome serves as a landing area for helicopters. The entire palace
gleams with all the colours of the noble metals; nowhere are there any
visible windows.

ENTRY POINTS
The three primary entrances to the palace are on deck 2: the large
double doors leading into the dome (44) and the two hatches leading
into the enclosed rear portion of the deck (41 and 43). There are also
two lift shafts from deck 1 that surface on deck 3 (42). Finally, there
is a maintenance hatch on the underside of deck 1 (9). Each of these
potential entry points is described under the number noted.

STANDARD INTERIOR FEATURES
Since the aerial palace was built in a shipyard in the Imperium, many of
its interior features are identical to those found on standard starships.
In most cases, interior walls are merely soundproofed light metal
partitions. If it should prove necessary or desirable to blow a hole
through an interior wall large enough for a person to pass through, this
will require 100 damage from an energy weapon (not a stunner) or
explosive. Bullets are less effective and 1,000 damage is needed from
bullet-firing weapons to do the same job.

•  **Bulkheads:** The outside walls and decks (including floors and
ceilings) of the palace are bulkheads, the structural components
that form and support the building. These are far stronger than
interior walls. Creating a hole in a bulkhead large enough for a
person to pass through requires 1,000 damage from an energy
weapon (not a stun carbine) or explosive. Bullets fired at bulkheads
do negligible damage (although they do leave obvious marks).
•  **Doors:** All doors set in interior walls are standard sliding doors.
They may be blasted open by weapons, taking the same damage
as interior walls. Sliding doors are powered and open completely
(assuming the power is on) when a stud on the wall next to the door
is pressed. Such doors may be locked from the inside or the outside
if one knows the proper code to press into the studs on the stud
plate. A red light shows on the stud panel when a door is locked.
During sleep periods, all of the staff and crew staterooms will be
locked on a 2D roll of 2-11 (12 indicates that the occupant forgot). By
removing the stud plate, a person with electronic skill can unlock a
door upon success of a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check,
this may be done once every 10 minutes. Most doors are numbered
but some are labelled and these are so noted.
•  **Maintenance Hatches:** There are several maintenance hatches
in the floors and ceilings of the palace. These allow maintenance
personnel access to the utility systems that run through the
bulkheads between decks. They also serve as emergency
passages in case of power or lift failure, so they are unlocked. All
are labelled 'Maintenance or Emergency Only'.
•  **Iris Valves:** Iris valves are pressure-tight automatic portals set in
bulkheads. A valve functions much like the iris of a camera; many
panels retract into the frame to leave an open passage or extend
to block the portal with solid metal. Iris valves are opened and
locked by stud controls, like those on sliding doors, and cannot be
forced closed if already open. Gunfire and explosions will simply
block the valve tighter. Valves are tough to open once fully closed.
A Very Difficult (12+) STR check with the following DMs must be
succeeded to force them open: DM+2 if the power is off, DM-3 if
wearing a vacc suit, DM-8 if the valve is locked.
•  **Staterooms:** Most staterooms in the palace, whatever their shape,
have standard interior fittings: a folding bed, chair, desk/dresser,
wardrobe and toilet facilities. Others include additional luxury items,
typically a couch, table, several extra chairs and a television/music
set. A third type has the same fittings as standard staterooms but is
intended for double occupancy and has two bunks.

```
•  Lights: All interior ceilings are fitted with glow panels. The lights in
the hallways are automatically regulated by the palace computer.
During the waking period (20 hours) they provide light equal to
summer sunlight; during the sleep period (10 hours) they are
dimmed to approximate dusk. Lights are off in all rooms when
entered unless the occupants are awake.
•  Intercom System: There is an intercom in each room of the palace.
Any intercom can call any other. There is usually a number/room
listing posted next to each intercom. An announcement through all
intercoms simultaneously can only be made from the bridge.
•  Viewscreens: Several rooms in the palace have viewscreens that
simulate windows. A person outside the palace will not realise that
there are viewscreens at certain places inside unless he is close
enough to notice the camera lenses, which are set flush into the
hull. Travellers floating around outside the palace on gravbelts
might be noticed by those inside and never realise it. At the time
of the mission, the only people who might notice the intruders are
the 2nd officer on the bridge (1) and the guard in Orobid's living
chamber (62). If any Travellers pass in front of these rooms on the
outside, they must succeed a Very Difficult (12+) Stealth check.
```

DECK 1
The ring-shaped lowest deck includes the bridge, power plants, kitchen,
sick bay and quarters for most of the crew.

**1. Bridge** : Labelled door. All movement and communications are
    controlled from this chamber. The palace computer is also located
    here. The information in the computer will read out only in the secret
    code language of the Datapriests. There are four large viewscreens
    mounted on the forward wall of the bridge, one of which always
    shows the view from in front of the palace. The screens can be
    adjusted to show views from any side of the palace, above or below,
    including the copter deck. There are two control couches, each
    surrounded by instrument panels and controls. On the starboard
    wall is an aviator's map of Pavabid and on the port wall is a diagram
    of the palace (which shows the location of Orobid's chambers on
    deck 3). If the palace is not under way, the only person on the bridge
    during the sleep period is the 2nd officer.
**2. Guard Post:** Standing in a small pool of light outside the door to
    the bridge is a palace guard wearing cloth armor and armed with
    a submachinegun. He is not particularly alert and will have DM-2
    on initiative, unless he knows there is some kind of trouble afoot.
**3. Datapriest's Stateroom:** This is a standard stateroom, occupied
    by the primary datapriest. In the event of fighting or an alarm, he
    will stay in his stateroom, avoiding conflict.

**4. Communicator's Stateroom:** This is a standard stateroom,
    occupied by the palace communications officer. He is a non-
    combatant but is very curious. If there is sufficient noise nearby to
    wake him, he will undoubtedly poke his head out the door to see
    what is going on.
**5. Captain's Stateroom:** On the outer wall of the stateroom is a large
    viewscreen. When it is activated, it shows what is directly outside
    the palace at this point, giving the appearance of a window. These
    'window' viewscreens are common in the staterooms of officers and
    high officials. Each is connected to a sensor on the outside hull. The
    captain is asleep. If he hears or is informed of any trouble he will
    head straight for the bridge, taking his automatic pistol as he goes.
**6. 1st Officer's Stateroom:** This is a standard stateroom, with
    furnishings fancier than average. The 1st officer is asleep here.
    He is somewhat impetuous; if aroused by trouble, he will head
    for the source of the trouble rather than the bridge, taking his
    weapon with him.
**7. Storage Room** : Labelled door, accidentally left unlocked. This
    room is crowded with tools, spare parts, maintenance equipment
    and personal belongings. Both good cover and good hiding places
    may be found in his room.
**8. 2nd Officer's Stateroom:** This is a standard stateroom, currently
    unoccupied, as the 2nd officer is standing watch on the bridge.
**9. Maintenance:** Door is labelled 'Maintenance' and 'Emergency
    Exit' and is unlocked. In this room equipment is stored for adjusting
    and repairing the null grav modules that lift the palace. In the floor
    is a hatch, labelled 'Maintenance or Emergency Only' that leads
    through the bulkhead to the underside of the palace. Underneath is
    the metal safety grid that enables workers to service the null grav
    modules. The gaps in the grid are large enough for one person to
    pass through. Opening the hatch from the inside is no problem;
    from the outside, it requires a Difficult (10+) Mechanic check.
**10. Chief Engineer's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. The engineer
    is asleep. If he is awakened by trouble, he will go to the starboard
    power plant (11) to protect it. He will attack anybody who tries to
    damage it, using brass knuckles stored under his pillow.
**11. Starboard Power Plant:** Labelled door. The main controls are in
    the forward half of the room. If one of the two power plants is shut
    down, all nonessential functions will shut off, lights will be kept
    on dim and all of the remaining power will be used to slowly bring
    the palace down to ground level. The hydraulic support legs will
    automatically extend before landing.
**12. Maintenance Personnel Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with
    double bunk. Two janitors sleep here. Both are non-combatants if
    trouble breaks out.

**13. Maintenance Personnel Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with
    double bunk. Contains two more janitors, as previous.
**14.** Guards' Stateroom: Standard stateroom with double bunk. This
    stateroom is empty, as both guards are on duty.
**15. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    currently occupied by two sleeping guards. Each has a
    submachinegun and cloth armor in a locker near the door. If
    alerted, each will grab a gun but will only don the cloth armor on a
    2D roll of 8+.
**16. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    occupied by two sleeping guards. Each has a submachinegun and
    cloth armor in a locker near the door. If alerted, each will grab a
    gun (and the first his dagger) but will only don the cloth armor on
    a 2D roll of 8+.
**17. Kitchen Personnel Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    occupied by two sleeping kitchen workers. If awakened by trouble, they
    will stay in their stateroom, hoping nothing happens to them.
**18.** Kitchen Personnel Stateroom: Standard stateroom with double
    bunk, empty. Both kitchen workers are on duty in the kitchen (20).
**19. Kitchen Personnel Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double
    bunk, currently occupied by two sleeping kitchen workers. Both will
    avoid trouble if they can.
**20. Kitchen and Staff Mess:** Labelled door. Most of the palace's
    needs are usually supplied by whatever area it is passing over.
    Thus, most meals are catered from outside the palace, however
    all food is organised and dispensed from the kitchen complex.
    When the palace, as now, is not over a civilised area, frozen food
    from storage is prepared here. The two small rooms to the port
    of the main room are, respectively, a walk-in freezer and walk-
    in refrigerator. The two starboard rooms are food preparation
    rooms. The large room doubles as the staff mess and here the
    lesser palace workers eat their four meals a day in rotating shifts.
    The room is currently occupied by two kitchen workers who are
    beginning to prepare for tomorrow's breakfast. If they hear any
    trouble, or if they are intruded upon, the first worker will try to reach
    the intercom by the door to alert the bridge. The second worker will
    attempt to hide in a food prep room, in a large bread cabinet.
**21. Steward's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, fancy. The head
    steward is awake. He is worried because the kitchen supply of zao
    kibbles, Orobid's favorite snack, is running low. If he hears any
    excitement, he will stay in his stateroom for five minutes, trying
    to decide what to do, and then finally poke his head out into the
    corridor to see what is going on. If he sees nothing, he will go back
    to his stateroom and worry some more. If he sees intruders, he will
    try to notify the bridge.

**22. Kitchen Personnel Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double
    bunk, currently occupied by two sleeping kitchen workers. Both will
    avoid trouble if possible.
**23. Stewards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk.
    Two stewards sleep here. They are responsible for serving upper
    deck guests and staff. If awakened by trouble, the first will hide in
    the stateroom but the second will panic, convinced that the palace
    is going down. He will flee for the emergency exit (9), taking the
    easiest route around the deck.
**24. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk, currently
    occupied by two sleeping guards. Each has a submachinegun and
    cloth armor in a locker near the door. If alerted, each will grab a gun
    but will only don the cloth armor on a 2D roll of 8+.
**25. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk. This
    stateroom is empty, as both guards are on duty.
**26. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    currently occupied by two sleeping guards. Each has a
    submachinegun and cloth armor in a locker near the door. If
    alerted, each will grab a gun but will only don the cloth armor on a
    2D roll of 8+.
**27. Engineer's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. If awakened by trouble,
    the engineer will stay in his stateroom and try to avoid conflict.
**28. Engineer's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, currently empty, as
    the engineer is in sickbay.
**29. Port Power Plant:** Labelled door. Identical to the starboard power
    plant (see 11).
**30. Pilot's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk. This is
    where helicopter pilots are put up overnight. One pilot is asleep
    here; he has dosed himself with an illegal drug and nothing will
    wake him before morning. The pilot is a secretive and untrusting
    fellow. He has removed the distributor cap from 'his' helicopter and
    hidden it in the dresser under some clothes.
**31. Medic's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. Here sleeps the doctor's
    assistant. In an emergency, he will run to the sick bay (35).
**32. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    currently occupied by one sleeping guard as the other is on duty. A
    submachinegun and a suit of cloth armor are in a locker near the
    door. If alerted, the guard will put on the cloth armor before leaving
    the stateroom with the submachinegun. Once he is in an actual
    firefight for the first time, this guard will have a sudden stunning
    realization that he could be killed. Consequently, he will throw away
    his weapon, lie down and surrender.
**33. Guard Captain's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, fancy. If
    alerted, the guard captain will grab his submachinegun and blade,
    ignoring time-consuming armor.

DECK 2
This deck consists mostly of the helicopter landing pad, plus offices and
the library. The floor of the dome is also on this level.

**34. Guards' Stateroom:** Standard stateroom with double bunk,
    currently occupied by two sleeping guards. Each has a
    submachinegun and cloth armor in a locker near the door. If
    alerted, each will grab a gun but will only don the cloth armor on a
    2D roll of 8+.
**35. Sick Bay:** Labelled door. These facilities are well equipped to
    handle minor medical problems and to provide good emergency
    care in case of major problems. Major medical care is handled in
    ground hospitals. An engineer lies in a drugged sleep on one of
    the beds, attached to various diagnostic equipment. The doctor
    believes that the engineer may have suffered a minor stroke
    during the day.
**36. Doctor's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, fancy. If awakened
    by an emergency, the doctor will proceed directly to the sick bay
    and stay there.
**37. Datapriest's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. The secondary
    datapriest is asleep here. If awakened, he will try to avoid trouble.
**38. Communicator's Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. The secondary
    ship communications officer sleeps here. If awakened by trouble,
    she will stay in her room and hope it passes.
**39. Forward Lift Shafts:** These lift shafts are non-standard; a
    hydraulic lift raises and lowers a square platform through the lift
    shaft. The platform is usually on deck 1. When the platform rises,
    a sliding hatch on the open 'copter deck above opens to reveal the
    lift shaft. The platform rises until flush with the 'copter deck. The
    entire process takes 30 seconds.
**40. Aft Lift Shafts:** These are standard spaceship lift shafts; pressure-
    tight lift cars that move in a shaft between decks. The doors of
    the lift shaft will not open on deck 3 unless the proper code is
    punched into the stud panel by the inside lift door (they can, of
    course, be opened by a person at the outer stud panel in the deck
    3 hallway; no code is required). The inner lock can be electronically
    unlocked in the same manner as those of standard sliding doors.
    In the ceiling next to each of the aft lift shafts on deck 1 is a hatch
    labelled 'Maintenance or Emergency Only'.
**41. Guard Post, Hatch and Helicopter:** A guard paces this area,
    wearing cloth armor and armed with a submachinegun. He moves
    in a regular routine, from the hatch to the lift shaft (where he can
    see the dome doors), to the ring edge (for a glance at the ground)
    and back to the hatch, circumnavigating the helicopter as he

```
goes. Each trip takes about three minutes. If the guard is attacked
from above, there will be DM-2 to a surprise check, as this is
unexpected. If he hears any trouble from the guard post and hatch,
he will run to check it out on a 2D roll of 7+. Otherwise, he will stick
by his post and notify the bridge. There is an intercom (with no
room number listing) set in the wall by the hatch. The guard reports
to the bridge every half hour. The hatch is electronically locked,
with a far tougher lock than those found on the interior sliding
doors. By removing the stud plate, a person can unlock the door on
a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check. The helicopter
is fastened to the deck by cables to prevent it from moving if the
deck tilts. It will not fly without its distributor cap, which is in the
possession of the pilot.
```

**42. Forward Lift Shafts:** See 39. There is a panel of control studs
    set flush with the deck but the operations are locked in the same
    manner as the interior sliding doors.
**43. Guard Post and Hatch:** A bored guard leans here against
    the dome where he can keep an eye on both the hatch and
    the lift shaft. He is wearing cloth armor and is armed with a
    submachinegun. This guard will have DM-1 to his surprise roll if
    attacked (DM-3 if attacked from above). If he hears any trouble
    from 41, he will run to check it out on a 2D roll of 5+, otherwise, he
    will simply notify the bridge.
**44. The Dome:** The huge double doors at the forward end of the dome
    room are locked from the inside with a mechanical lock. A Traveller
    can get the door open by dismounting the lock upon a Very Difficult
    (12+) Mechanic check. The doors open inward. The first thing a
    person entering the dome will notice is that the floor is completely
    transparent. The floor is made of spotless structural glass, so
    people standing in the dome appear to be hovering in the air, with
    nothing between them and the countryside below. The second
    thing a person will notice is the walls.

```
Both the inside and the outside of the dome are golden in colour
but the inner dome is covered with exquisitely graven designs and
bas-reliefs, depicting scenes from the Book of the Stars and the
life of Pavabid. At the aft end of the wall, four meters from the floor,
a golden iris door is set in the wall of the dome. Glowing sunrays
extend from it in every direction. One large ray extends directly
down; a golden sliding door is set into it at floor level. The designs
extend below the level of the transparent floor, decorating the inner
ring wall of deck 1 and heightening the impression of standing on
air. Two more sliding doors are hidden among the wall designs at
floor level, each about 45° to port and starboard of the aft door.
```

```
These doors will not be discovered from the dome side without a
Difficult (10+) Investigate check of the wall. Both the iris door and
sliding doors are locked with standard interior door locks.
```

```
Orobid conducts mass and other holy ceremonies inside this dome.
Here he also bestows his benedictions on visiting groups whom it
would be a good idea to impress. Orobid, Son of the Star, appears
at the iris door and steps out into space to bless his flock, supported
only by his faith and holiness (and the hidden gravbelt under his
robes). A pocket amplifier and the acoustic properties of the dome
give the Thearch's voice great power and authority. Hidden in the
designs at the roof of the dome are many powerful lights. When
turned up all the way, these send a great golden beam down from
the palace to the ground below. This holy light is reputed to have
beneficial properties for whatever area it blesses. It also looks very
impressive as it lances down from the floating palace.
```

**45. Mens' Washroom:** Labelled door, unlocked.
**46. Meeting Room:** Labelled door. A polished wood table dominates
    this room. There are 20 wood chairs around the table and several
    other matching pieces of furniture line the walls. The outer wall is
    covered by a large viewscreen. When activated, it shows an image
    of the view outside the palace at this point.
**47. Anteroom:** Unlocked. This room is used for storage of furniture
    and materials not currently in use in the meeting room.
**48. Minister's Office:** This is the office of the minister of conformity
    (see 59) and his staff. There are four desks in here, including the
    minister's large desk, each accompanied by an appropriate chair.
    The port wall is lined with filing cabinets. All sensitive information
    therein is written in the ministry code.
**49. Audience Chamber:** Labelled door. This is where Orobid conducts
    actual business with those important enough to see him. The entire
    outer wall of the room is a huge 'window' viewscreen. The port and
    starboard walls are lined with comfortable chairs, which may be
    brought forward for important visitors or long sessions.
**50. Guard Post:** Here a lone guard sits on a stool, waiting out his
    shift. He wears cloth armor and is armed with a submachinegun.
    The guard reports to the bridge by intercom every half hour. He is
    supposed to patrol the corridor but since nothing ever happens,
    he does not bother. If he hears a lift shaft door or a hatch opening
    (which always makes noise unless care is taken), he will march
    down in that direction to investigate, in case it is his captain coming
    to check up on him.
**51. Ministry Office:** Each of the other six ministries (trade, education,
    industry, agriculture, health services and planetary defence) has a
    desk here for the times when people from their sections must work

```
at the palace. As these desks are not currently in use, there is no
information of real value to be found in or on them.
```

**52. Library:** Labelled door. The library is actually a storage area for
    the data needed by the executives of Pavabid's government. It
    contains a desk for the librarian Datapriest, a half-dozen microfilm
    viewers and many storage shelves. A person trying to find specific
    types of microfile reels would first have to figure out the library's
    numerical filing system. This information is contained in the film
    reader on the librarian's desk. Sensitive materials are listed with
    the notation 'Special Section'.
**53. Special Section:** Door labelled 'Authorised Personnel Only'. The
    door lock has an alarm attached to it. Normally, a separate code
    must be punched in first to bypass the alarm before the lock can
    be opened. A person tampering with the lock will notice the alarm
    circuit only if he is looking for one, on a Difficult (10+) Recon check.
    If the alarm is tripped, the bridge will be alerted and a loud bell will
    start ringing in the library.
**54. Womens' Washroom:** Labelled door. The hatch in the ceiling
    outside this room is labelled 'Maintenance or Emergency Only'.

DECK 3
This deck is furnished much more luxuriously than the other decks and
contains the quarters of Orobid and his chief minister.

**55. Corridor:** This hallway is deeply carpeted and the walls are
    covered with detailed historical murals. It is also patrolled at night
    by three trained wahroos.
**56. Wahroo Kennels:** Labelled door. Here sleeps three more wahroos
    and their trainer. These animals form part of the Thearch's personal
    guard during the day. Orobid is particularly fond of the smallest
    wahroo. If the trainer is awakened by trouble, he will let out these
    three wahroos. The hatches in and outside his room are labelled
    'Maintenance or Emergency Only'.
**57. Guest Room:** This finely-furnished stateroom serves as a guest
    room for any ministers of state that may have to stay overnight at
    the palace. It is currently unoccupied.
**58. Guest Room:** Identical to 57.
**59. Kanaleb's Quarters:** This is the living chamber of Kanaleb, the
    Minister of Conformity, Prime Satellite of the Thearch. His position
    is as hereditary as the Thearch's; Kanaleb's ancestors have been
    chief advisors to Orobid's ancestors for centuries. Kanaleb is the
    chief of all police on the planet, including the feared Attitude Police.
    Through them, Kanaleb wields great power; those whose attitudes
    are determined to be counter-productive or 'dangerous to social
    morale' are simply terminated, without appeal. The Ministry of

```
Conformity has grown in power under each successive Thearch,
until now Kanaleb is responsible to none but Orobid. The Ministry
of Conformity has made fear and paranoia a way of life for every
person on Pavabid. This carpeted room contains several chairs, a
couch, a desk, two bookcases, a television and a large viewscreen
on the outer wall. Various objets d'art decorate the walls and
bookcases. Several minor decrees, signed by Kanaleb, rest on the
desk. These should indicate to smart Travellers that these are not
Orobid's quarters.
```

**60. Kanaleb's Bedchamber:** There is a large viewscreen and more
    comfortable furniture in this room. Kanaleb's large bed sits in the
    opposite corner from the door. Just inside the door, at ankle-level,
    is Kanaleb's night defence: a thin electrically charged tripwire.
    Anyone touching it will suffer 1D damage and an alarm will wake
    Kanaleb. The Minister of Fear lives in fear of assassination, so
    sleeps lightly, with an autopistol in his hand. If the tripwire alarm
    is set off, Kanaleb will come up firing. The tripwire will be broken if
    anybody actually trips over it.
**61. Valet's Room:** Standard stateroom, fancy. This is the stateroom
    of Orobid's now sleeping personal valet and servant. If he is
    awakened by trouble, the old man will look out to see what is
    going on but will then stay in his stateroom. This room also
    serves as Orobid's dressing room for those times when he
    dresses in his robes of state to impress the citizens. In addition to
    the valet's meagre furnishings there is a large open wardrobe full
    of Orobid's golden robes. Hanging behind the robes is Orobid's
    grav belt, the only one on the planet. Only Orobid, the valet and
    Kanaleb know about it.
**62. Orobid's Living Chamber:** The door to this room has no alarm
    on it but inside is an alert guard wearing cloth armor and armed
    with a submachinegun. He reports to the bridge by intercom every
    half hour. Under no conditions will he leave his post. If he hears
    trouble out in the hall, he will notify the bridge. The carpeting and
    furnishings of this room are works of art. Furnishings include a
    dining table, chairs, bookshelves, a couch and a miniature garden
    in one corner. The entire outer wall is a huge viewscreen showing
    the outside world.
**63. Orobid's Bedchamber:** For extra protection, the walls of this room
    are made of bulkhead material. As a result, the room is completely
    soundproofed from whatever happens outside of it. Orobid sleeps
    heavily on a large circular gold-coloured flotation bed in the center
    of the room. Soft noises, such as the sound of the iris door opening
    and closing, will not wake him but other sounds might; the Referee
    must judge the chances. If awakened by intruders, Orobid will hit
    the intercom built into the bedframe and call for help. He will then

```
pretend to faint, hoping this will confuse the intruders until aid
comes. He is not a personally aggressive man and will not fight
unless he feels he is about to be killed. Many luxury items clutter
this chamber. Both outside walls are covered by large viewscreens
that show the outside. Both are now turned off.
```

DECK 4
The small upper deck includes quarters for Kanaleb's staff, a TV studio
and quarters for the Techpriests who run the studio.

**64. Staff Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, luxury. A member of
    Kanaleb's staff sleeps here. He will avoid trouble if possible.
**65. Staff Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, luxury. Another member
    of Kanaleb's staff sleeps here. He began his career in the regular
    police. If he is awakened by trouble, he will grab his auto pistol and
    go out to arrest the troublemakers.
**66. Staff Stateroom:** Standard stateroom, luxury. Another member
    of Kanaleb's staff sleeps here. He was once in the Attitude
    Police. If he is awakened by trouble, he will try to spy out who the
    troublemakers are, report to the bridge and then keep on their trail.
    He will run if confronted.
**67. Television Studio:** Labelled door. Orobid makes his planetwide TV
    announcements from this room. In here are backdrops, cameras,
    lights, microphone booms and so forth.
**68. Control Room:** The wall between this room and the studio has
    a large glass window set in it. From here the technicians' control,
    monitor, produce and edit Orobid's TV messages.
**69. Storeroom:** Equipment not currently in use is stored here. The
    room is about half full and has many good hiding places.
**70. TV Staff Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. A TV techpriest sleeps
    here. He will avoid trouble if possible.
**71. TV Staff Stateroom:** Standard stateroom. Another TV techpriest
    sleeps here. If awakened by trouble, he will stay in his stateroom.
**72. TV Staff Stateroom:** This is also the stateroom of a TV techpriest.
    He is awake, reading an illegal one-page underground paper. He
    is very much afraid that the Attitude Police suspect him of being
    unreliable. If he hears any trouble, he will poke his head out of his
    stateroom to see what is going on. If he sees intruders, he will run to
    them, begging to be taken along when they leave. He is fully familiar
    with the layout of the palace and can lead the group to Orobid's
    chambers if they so desire. However, he is no good in a fight.

##### Referee's Information

This adventure presents two very different challenges to the Travellers.
The attempt to plant the message projector in Orobid's palace requires
stealth and restraint; the goal is to avoid being seen or heard. The
attack of the TTC hitmen during the return journey, on the other hand, is
a simple test of combat skills.

AROUSING THE PALACE
The Travellers' first difficulty in completing their mission is the danger of
someone in the palace becoming aware of their presence:
•  **Awakening the Sleepers:** If the Travellers encounter any of the
palace personnel, this could result in noise that may awaken
nearby sleepers, even through interior walls. Gunfire outside a
sleeper's door will awaken them on a 2D roll of 6+, with DM-1 for
each meter the noise is distant from the door. Shouting will wake
someone upon a 2D roll of 8+, with the same DM. Most walls and
ceilings in the palace are covered with sound-deadening materials
to cut down the noise level in these cramped quarters.
•  **Security Reactions, General:** The bridge is the coordinating
center for the palace. All intruder reports will be called to the
bridge. In the event of trouble, the officer on the bridge will always
notify the guard captain first. If it sounds like a minor problem,
the guard captain will send two of his men (the two in room 26)
to check it out, while he goes to the bridge to await reports. If
it looks like a major problem, the guard captain will personally
lead six of his men (the guards from rooms 15, 16 and 24) to the
scene of the trouble and the palace captain will be called to the
bridge. All of the other guards will then be awakened and put on
alert. Guards who stop to put on armor when called out will be
delayed one minute (four combat rounds). If the guard captain
calls for help, all the remaining guards will be sent (except those
at guard posts) and the palace captain will radio the nearest
police/military base for reinforcements; these will arrive by
helicopter in one hour. If the Travellers are still in the palace at
this point, they are probably doomed.
•  **Security Reactions, Specific:** There are four guards at guard
posts who must check in with the bridge every half hour. If any of
these guards fails to call in at the proper time, the officer on the
bridge will wait an extra five minutes and then notify the guard
captain. The guard captain will consider this a minor problem and
send two men to investigate (as outlined above).

GUARD SCHEDULES
The first time one of these post guards is eliminated, roll 1Dx5. This
will show how many minutes were remaining before he was to check in
again. Put all of the other guards on the same schedule and keep track
of elapsed time so you can tell when the palace security apparatus
will swing into action. A guard encountering intruders will usually first
command them to identify themselves or surrender. In practice this
gives the initiative to the intruders. Guards who are attacked will defend
themselves, retreating, if possible, to a place where they can call for
aid. Although most of the palace guards were in the regular or Attitude
Police, few if any will ever have encountered opponents who shoot
back, since civilian possession of weapons on Pavabid is punishable
by death. Overwhelming or unusual attacks may cause their morale to
break suddenly and completely. However, guards defending the person
of Orobid will fight to the death.

THE TTC HITMEN
Somewhere on their trip back to the launch, the Travellers will
encounter a group of hit men hired by the Trexalon Technical
Consortium. If there are few Travellers, and/or they are wounded from
their palace encounters, only one air/raft should be used. For tougher
groups use both air/rafts. Each air/raft has a crew of four but one must
always be flying the air/raft rather than shooting.

Assuming both groups are flying low to avoid radar detection, they will
encounter each other at normal distances, with DM+3 to the encounter
range roll (see Traveller Core Rulebook, page 83). The hit men will
open fire and attempt to close. If the Travellers hide in the forest below,
the hit men will try to flush them out by landing three men to march
forward in a line. If at any point the hit men are obviously losing the
battle, they will run for it after one more round. If the hit men win the
battle, they will take all bodies with them; the Travellers would be well
advised to do the same.

##### Omicron: The Mythical Weaponsmith

By Veselin Mitev

There are rumors circulating among mercenary groups, about a
legendary weaponsmith who makes custom weapons. An observant
individual can spot an exceptionally well made custom weapon here
and there, which the owner claims they received from a mystical
figure called Omicron. Further digging reveals they have obtained
it via some hidden auction, an illegal trading platform, as a gift from
their colleagues, loot or anything other than obtaining it directly from a
mythical figure. Regardless of the lack of evidence, many mercenaries
still believe the rumor is true.

It works like this – somehow a mercenary obtains an obscure safety
box address location, usually at a station in a nearby parsec. They ship
a short description of the weapon they want, attach a significant sum
of Credits, usually at least double the market price of a similar weapon.
Then they wait. Maybe three months pass when they get their package
back – a custom weapon, remarkably close to what was described, of
exceptional quality... or their money returned. However, journalistic
investigations have not found a single case of anyone receiving their
weapon in this way or, if they claim so, that the claim is real.

Many have attempted to pinpoint Omicron but all fail. Due to the
exceptionally low volume of trade, authorities have not spent much
effort to unveil who is behind the operations. Some claim Omicron
is an organization, others that it is an individual. There are some
bizarre versions out there – like it is the spirit of a well-known but dead
mercenary. Journalists have also revealed several impostors who either
tried to scam mercenaries or tried replicating the work but, unlike the
true Omicron, they were quickly discovered and dealt with – either by
authorities or disgruntled customers.

**AN-154 A-CAU:** The AN-154 is a custom weapon of unknown origin.
Due to the design of the weapon, some speculate it was created by
a low-tech society attempting to fight a more advanced enemy. The
weapon is designed to fight armored combat suits. The automatic fire
correction system makes micro adjustments that target weak spots or
predict evasion maneuvers, based on the identified armor.

The weapon has the Smart trait against most combat armor. The
operator can upload more schematics to increase the coverage of
possible engagements and can update the fire correction system up
to TL13 (for the purposes of the Smart trait). While there are far better
weapons at higher Tech Levels, updating this system is far easier for
users without high technology manufacturing capabilities.

Decryption methods so far have failed to break the firmware of
the weapon but gather some data, including a trademark called
'Omicron'. Some believe this is one of the first products of the mythical
weaponsmith; others that the mechanism was stolen and repurposed.
Either way, experts agree that the designer made sure the decryption is
top drawer – something uncommon in improvised weaponry.

- An important quirk of the weapon is the that the AP 3 trait only works
when the operator fires in burst mode.

**Omicron Laser Carbine:** The Omicron laser carbine is three weapons
in one. The major advantages to the user are convenience and 'swag'.
The weapon catches the eye with its custom design made from
selected rare alloys. While it is arguable if the flashiness brings any
utility or what message it coneys, owners of the carbine wield it proudly.

The weapon comprises three components – two are set in the holster
and one worn on an expandable sling across the chest. Depending
on how the operator unholsters the lower part, they get a stunner or
laser pistol (unholstering upwards produces the stunner, unholstering
down snaps the pistol extension into action) and as a minor action
they can unlock the extension on the sling and assemble the carbine.
Disassembly requires another minor action.

The power pack is connected to the stunner component. Using the
pistol or stunner consumes one charge, while the carbine consumes
two charges. The weapon comes with various straps and slings, to fit
even the most extravagant wearing styles. It is also secured with either
a biometric reader or encrypted proximity chip that render it inoperable
by unauthorized personnel.

While the weapon is considered durable, it requires regular maintenance
to ensure unobstructed connections between. Some users consider this
required time with their weapon a privilege of ownership.

**Omicron Support DMR:** The Omicron support DMR is two weapons
in one – a long range ballistic rifle and machine gun, combined with a
complex feeding mechanism. Similar to other weapons from the same
source, this one is made especially well. It has a completely non-
reflective coating, making it good for covert operations.

The weapon is designed with gyro stabilization, making for stable single
and multi-round fire. The alloys also disperse heat very efficiently,
allowing the weapon to sustain high rates of fire for longer periods of
time, without accuracy or reliability issues.

The scope uses holographic sights, which provide DM+1 to single shot
attacks over ranges of more than 50 meters.

However, the most prominent feature is the ability to use three separate
magazines at the same time, changing between ammunition types quickly
and easily during battle. Switching between the magazines is a free action
but a single attack action will only use one type (i.e. the operator cannot
fire one burst with different magazines). The mechanism allows switching
the magazines without a round remaining in the chamber. The drawback is
that the rifle only works with custom magazines.

**Omicron Airburst Rifle:** This is a rifle specialized for medium distance
urban combat. It is specifically designed to have an intimidating look
and, upon firing, makes a distinguishing sound intended to instil fear in
those who have been on the other end of the barrel before.

The airburst rifle allows the operator to mark the cover of their target
and use the airburst round to detonate a few meters behind it. Marking
the cover requires a minor action. After that, each round fired from that
position will bypass the cover. If the operator or target changes position,
the cover must be marked again.

##### Talking about Turrets

By Steve Gorski

Quad Turrets Can Make For A Good Day

_I flew into one of my frequently visited starports with a few more_
holes in my spaceship hull. As usual, Liam was overseeing the cargo
unloading. He was what one would typically call a working supervisor
and I suppose a friend of sorts. After old eagle eyes spotted me a good
_distance off, he expertly spun his large exosuit cargo loader in my_
direction and chased me down so fast that the electric motor sounded
like it was pleading for mercy. Pulling up alongside as I was making
my determined march by foot to the nearest landing terminal he called
out 'Those holes are goin' ta cost yee more than a few pints mate,'
displaying one of his patented grisly toothy smiles. I just kept walking,
pretending I didn't hear him, knowing full well it was not going to work.
Liam, undeterred in the slightest, easily matched my speedy pace with
_his equipment now whirring at a sane level and offered 'Yee know I
got folks that can fix that up right like... and for a good price mind yee',
he added in attempt to make the offer sound better. 'I need a drink,' I_
replied, not slowing my pace one bit.

'How dem new turrets work out fer yee?' Liam pressed switching
topics deftly. I stopped suddenly. To his credit Liam did too after only a
_couple more steps, clearing showing his expertise with his machine. I_
looked up at him with a straight face as he rotated towards me and said
'They saved my butt Liam. I'll meet ya at the bar.' If Liam's smile was
any bigger it would have wrapped around his head. He spun around
_and took off so fast I felt a whoosh of air from the maneuver while I_
resumed my march to the local watering hole we both knew well. This
time, I'd be buying.

_Showing a little kindness to those around you can really pay off in
unexpected ways. Take Liam for instance. In shooting the breeze_
over some drinks a few months ago, he recommended that I upgrade
my turrets to popup quads. 'Single, double, triple, quad, what's the
_difference?' I asked, not convinced it was worth the cost. Liam smoothly_
replied 'Punching power, mate'.

_Giving him my best questioning raised eyebrow look he explained_
further. 'Look, even pirates with unarmored ships are willing tee take
a few shots te get what they want but they don't want te lose their
ship. Ships cost big Credits. So, what I'm sayin' here is that even with
a couple of quad turrets and the right weapons you can hit them hard
enough that they are going to rethink about you being easy prey. And
_even pirates that ain't so smart can see the difference between two,_

_four, six or eight weapons firing at them. Even a small 200-ton trader_
that suddenly pops up eight weapons ready tee go and it's like, whoah,
we might not come out of this so well, aye?' He paused to take a long
draw on his frosty beer before continuing 'And if the lads are bold
enough to try... well, a few broadsides should do enough damage
where they start thinkin' that if they'd like tee keep breathin' air and
make it back alive then your cargo might not be worth diein' for aye?'

You may be wondering what weapons you should put in your quad
turret. That depends. A lot depends on personal preference but some
suggestions follow.

For sheer destructive power against armored opponents, missiles are
probably your best bet. You do need to replace them and you do need
extra tons for storage. They also can be shot down with lasers and
reduced with jamming but if you unleash batches of four or eight missiles
the chances are pretty good that you will hit with multiple warheads.

Fusion guns come in as a close second and can dish out an impressive
4D+12 plus radiation damage for a set of four of these puppies. Double
that for two quad turrets. They use a lot of power and range is limited,
so keep that in mind. Hank, a gunner friend of mine, says that he's
started glowing at night after manning fusion guns for several months
so if you are engaging in some family planning it may be worth paying
for a gunner or computer software. Just sayin'.

For maximum range, you can't beat particle beams. If your ship has
the thrust to keep your opponent at distance this may be your best
option. These babies do cost mucho Megacredits. As with most things,
however, you tend to get what you pay for.

Then there is perhaps the best overall weapon, and my personal
favorite, the plasma-pulse cannon. Why? Because you have the
most options when using it. You can fire it as a single shot weapon
for 2D damage. Single shot for all four weapons in a turret results in
2D+6 damage. Single weapon burst is 2D+4 damage, while burst for

four weapons results in 2D+10 damage. Full auto potentially multiplies
damage. This weapon gives you the most flexibility, and is effective
against all but the most heavily armored ships, but most Imperium or
Major Race ships that have thick armor are larger or capital sized ships,
which you are probably not going to entertain a battle with anyway.

Additional tips are to check the Tech Level of weapons and see if you
can obtain more advanced versions. This will allow you to do such
things as reduce power usage, increase range or increase accuracy. All
good stuff. While it is generally beneficial to use multiples of the same
weapon in a turret for extra damage, there is nothing wrong with putting
different weapons in the same turret; for example, having a long range
weapon, short range weapon and maybe a defensive weapon. Another
consideration is balancing between weapons that use power and those
that don't. Missiles don't use power and is a sort of 'fire and go get
a snack' strategy. Tech Level could be a limiting factor in addition to
power and cost so you'll need to carefully consider the best options with
what is feasible for you.

Now I get questions like 'If quad turrets are so good then why isn't the
mighty Imperial Navy using them?' Good question and I'm glad you
asked. Some years back a successful GeDeCo (General Development
Corporation) navy sales rep was singing the praises of the new quad
turret. As luck would have it, the annual Navy Ship and Armament show
was happening and the prospective Imperial Navy agent wanted to see
the quad turret in action before making a purchase decision. Go figure.

At any rate, par for the course, our sales guy was selling essentially
vapourware. Technically speaking, there was a quad turret being
developed in GeDeCo's R&D department but, more often than not,
money and profits drive corporate decisions and not always for the best.
So, push came to shove and GeDeCo installed a couple of quad turrets
on a small escort ship in time for the show. During the demonstration
some sort of mishap occurred with the turret system, overloading the
power plant, which then critically failed resulting in an explosion that
ignited the ship's fuel and destroyed the vessel. Needless to say this
wasn't the result GeDeCo was looking for and, to nobody's surprise,
there wasn't any interest in purchasing the quad turret system.

The rumor mill suggests this event may have had something to do
with why GeDeCo was 'volunteered' to receive a contract working in the
Imperial Fringes; pure speculation, of course. Further rumors, which
perhaps peg closer to the truth, suggest that GeDeCo sold the patent
for the quad turret to a small ship design company that posed no real
business threat, which now provides this great piece of technology to
the small guys like you and me.

So, there you have it. Fly safe. Fly well-armed, and fly safer.

##### Ynchaeir

By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli
(Corium Alatum Bestiam)

The ynchaeir are colossal animals that plague the skies of high-gravity
planets, their domed skull and blunted beak allowing them to defend
themselves with brute force. They kill their prey by trapping it underfoot
with long claws designed to impale and repeatedly smashing the chest
cavity with their beak until it collapses. Caution is advised when they
are seen nearby, as humans have often been targets of attacks.

Standing up to three meters tall, they are an imposing sight when
flocking at the edge of an ocean in preparation for a hunt, preferring to
eat the larger aquatic animals under the surface, rather than the squat
mammals found on land. Their immense wingspan allows them little
dexterity and when hunting prey smaller than cattle they are distinctly
clumsy. The coating of minute feathers over their wings allows them
some form of waterproofing, being too dense for any water to penetrate.
This makes them formidable when encountered in the oceans, as they
are able to travel at surprising speed underwater.

The muscular nature of their wings allows them to be used as
propellors of a sort, to quickly dive below the surface in order to find
prey. Due to high air pressure, their skeletons are dense, lacking the
hollow bones of low-gravity avians, with skin restraining a tightly coiled
mass of muscles, tendons and viscera.

Mating rituals performed by the ynchaeir are intense, often violent
displays of strength and beauty, lasting for up to 14 hours of constant
screeching, flapping, preening and tearing apart of prey. The males do
this in order to entice a mate, who will often watch three or four displays
before settling on a partner. The small feathers of the wings can be
puffed up in order to increase perceived size and common practise is to
extend the neck as much as possible to increase height. Displays begin
in the second year of the ynchaeir's life, with the species able to mate
once or twice. Clutches of 7–10 eggs are constantly supervised by the
male whilst the female hunts.

Infancy only lasts a matter of weeks and young ynchaeir are self-
sufficient from three months of age. After this they are booted from their
home nests and left to fend for themselves; many dead young can be
seen underneath roosts. If the young make it to adulthood, they spend
the first two years of their life exploring and hunting before finding a mate.

##### The Pink Diamond

By Andy Sykes

The Pink Diamond is a modified Type-Y yacht, with the hull painted to
represent a pink diamond and its name emblazoned in platinum. The
Pink, as its crew refer to it, can be encountered in any starport.

As well as the alterations made to the Pink itself, the ship's boat is
painted platinum with the logo 'Baby Pink' stamped on the front. The ATV
is pale pink with the logo 'Baby Pink Two' in platinum and features an
expensive entertainment suite, wet bar and three pools in the work area.
The turret contains a mount for a vulcan machinegun, usually stored
in a secured locker in the docking bay along with three magazines of
ammunition. The neon pink air/raft also has an entertainment suite and
wet bar, with the logo 'Baby Pink Three' on the side.

OWNERSHIP AND CREW
Having had many owners throughout her years, the Pink Diamond
has been tweaked and improved by successive caretakers. With each
having a different use for her, she is a patchwork of the visions of her
owners. The present owner, the Marquis Zander Druniman, did not
implement any of these designs. He won the ship at a gambling table in
the Regina starport three years ago; the previous owner had obtained
it in a similar manner six years before that. The crew of the Pink is
as interchangeable as most of its parts, led by the Marquis, they are
nothing more than a motley collection of drifters and criminals.

MARQUIS ZANDER DRUNIMAN
Zander Druniman comes from noble blood in the Spinward Marches. He
is slim, with his greying hair kept shoulder length and oiled back. With grey
eyes and an olive complexion, his manner alternates between disarming
charm and aloofness, depending on whom he is addressing and his whim.
Zander has done nothing but wander since he turned 18, leading a dilettante
lifestyle. He is known as a scoundrel in polite society.

```
Zander has not really educated
himself beyond his well
delivered younger schooling,
leaving him of average
intelligence. His main passion
is gambling, in which he is
remarkably successful. Having
no real interest in money
(although he has plenty), he
likes to gamble for possessions
and people; most of his crew
are little more than indentured
servants obtained over the
gambling table. Service aboard
the Pink is not odious by any
means and all crew members
live as well as any favored
guest. Zander is a skilled
swordsman and, although he
is now less sprightly than his
younger years, he still practices
with his companions. Cooler
in manner with age, he can
still take offence if he feels he
is not given the respect his
status deserves. The Marquis
surrounds himself with people
who defer to him, using them
to feed his ego. Occupying
the yacht's luxury stateroom,
the walls are adorned with
blades of all kinds, along with
many curios won in gambling
matches. He wears a diplo vest
and if any trouble is expected,
Zander will arm himself with
a TL12 static blade. His
nightstand contains a loaded
pink gauss pistol and a spare
magazine. His wardrobe also
contains a boarding vacc suit.

LUCY ROGERISTTEIN
Lucy is intelligent, attractive,

and fair skinned. She is
Zander's lover and shares
his stateroom. Lucy started
out as a corporate worker,
in which she was successful
in becoming manager very
quickly. Losing herself in
gambling after work, the
debt she obtained led her to
embezzling company money.
This ended with her spending
eight years in prison, where
she operated as a fixer
behind bars. Six months
ago, she met Zander in a
casino and they have been
inseparable since. Whilst she
may appear as Zander's eye
candy, she is actually the
more intelligent of the couple,
often advising him on the
various activities within which
they partake. She carries a
pink coloured body pistol at
all times but is unskilled in its
use, although has had a lot of
training in unarmed combat.

TREVOR GYTE
Trevor is a gargantuan man with
a weightlifter's physique and a
shaven head. His olive skin is
covered in prison tattoos, with
only his golden-brown eyes
shining through. Won from
another noble at a gambling
table, Trevor has been in
Zander's service for six months
now; an experience beginning
only a day after his release
from prison. Before prison he
was an enforcer for one of his
home planet's most notorious
gangs, although he now counts
himself as the ships 'first mate'.
Trevor likes life aboard the Pink,
it being easy in comparison to
his previous way of life and with
a lot more personal space than
the prison cell he was previously
in. Considering himself head
of security, he wears a stunfist
whenever he can. For more
serious altercations this is
replaced by a piston fist and an
assault shotgun. Trevor wears
a platinum-coloured protec suit
with the arms removed, leaving a
whorl of his tattoos on show.

ANDON BLISOR
The Pink's pilot is a willowy man
with a crop of bright blue hair,
which contrasts sharply with
his almost translucent skin. His
catlike movements often scare
the rest of the crew, as he sneaks
up behind them when they are
not paying attention. A pirate by
trade, Andon was offered the
position by Zander after hearing
word of the young man's skill.
When working, Andon wears
TL10 cloth armor and carries
a laser pistol and dagger. The
rest of the time, he can be seen
sporting a jewelled cutlass on a
belt worn over an exaggerated
'pirate' costume. Andon spends a
lot of time with Candy and fancies
himself as her partner, despite
the fact she is a skinjob.

BAV FUALKS
Headhunted by Zander, Bav
is the ship's engineer, tasked
with ensuring that the years of
modifications are in working order.
With her grey hair pulled back into
a tight bun, her two decades in
the Imperial Navy are clear thanks
to the stress etched into her face.
The work is made easier (with
minimal unnecessary interruptions)
by the hatchet sheathed on her
back and the visible presence of
scars dotted over her body. When
on duty Bav wears old and torn
overalls, holdovers from her time
in the navy. Like all matelots,
Bav loves to party and on special
occasions she can be seen
sporting an entirely pink suit found
in her stateroom. Her scarred
figure belies a keen mind and light
sense of humor; something the
rest of the crew still find at-odds
with the rest of her mannerisms.

'DOC' JULIAN HARTARN
'Doc' is short and fat, with an ill pallor to his skin, his blue eyes stained
with age. Taking the position on the Pink after losing a bet to Zander,
he has been working aboard the ship for two years, in which time his
hairline has receded at a great rate. After university, Julian spent 24
years as a physician specialising in the research and study of a variety
of diseases. After his retirement he tended to waste his time (and
money) gambling in a variety of haunts throughout Charted Space. Now
working off his debt and trying to save some Credits for anagathics,
his view on drug usage has dramatically changed thanks to feeling the
effects of his own advanced age. Too proud to ask Zander for money,
he will try to obtain funds at any chance he gets to sit at a gambling
table. In a vain attempt to try and remain fit he spars with Zander and
Bav but this is merely an exercise in futility. He wears a diplo vest, and
can arm himself with a rapier from his stateroom, but normally carries
a body pistol. Friendly and well mannered, 'Doc' is liked by all aboard
the Pink. Unbeknownst to the rest of the crew, he is secretly planning
to steal the ship, sell it and abscond with the Credits needed to buy an
exorbitant amount of anagathics.

MISSY MITCHELL
Missy signed on 3 months ago as a general hand and gunner, her small
frame surprisingly adept with a large amount of weaponry. She worked
a few years on a free trader, then found religion; The Gospel of Free
Expression. The church taught her the ineptitude of other organised
religions and after a number of years of service was promoted into the
militant sect known as the 'Release'. This sect takes a more direct route
against other religions by assassinating their preachers. In her work
gear of an old pair of coveralls, scruffy hair and plethora of various dirt
and grime on her face, Missy often stands out against the rest of the
neon pink ship. Keeping her religion under-wraps is key for her, as she
does not want it to cause any issues for her surprisingly comfortable
job aboard the Pink. Due to the nature of her job, Missy wears a diplo
vest at all times, covered by a bandolier containing multiple magazines
of ammunition for her body pistol (with suppressor), shotgun and
knuckleblaster. Scattered throughout her stateroom are four neurotoxin
grenades and two complex chemical charges.

CANDY
Candy is a skinjob who has
become the steward of the
Pink. Won by Zander five
years ago, Candy's pink
hair matches the exterior of
the ship, accented by her
platinum jumpsuit. She has
recently taken to cruising
about the ship on a pair of
glittery silver powerboots, a
gift from Andon. Candy was a
pleasure model programmed
with Carouse, Steward and
Diplomat skills, and knows a
large number of songs and
dances famous across the
Imperium. Whilst Andon is
of little emotional interest to
Candy, she does reciprocally
gift him a variety of things;
including the jewelled dagger
he carries. If there is trouble,
she will attempt to resolve
it non-confrontationally and
in self-defence will attempt
to disengage or flee. The
crew treat her as just another
member of the ship and are
injurious to any guests who
treat her with disdain.

THE PINK DIAMOND (TYPE-Y YACHT)
Different to your usual noble's pleasure-liner, the interior is pink
and platinum, soft furnishings are silk and velvet, and three extra
staterooms have been added, replacing some of the common areas.
Equipped with two pop-up turrets, one dorsal and one ventral, these
are accessed via extensions to the deck access tubes. The dorsal
triple turret contains three beam lasers. The ventral turret contains a
sandcaster, missile rack and pulse laser.

**POSSIBLE ENCOUNTERS**

- Zander invites the Travellers aboard the Pink for a party,
    dinner or a lift to the next system.
- One or all of the Travellers lose at the gaming table to
    Zander and become indebted.
- The Travellers upset Zander and will be expected to duel
    him. Whatever the outcome, the Pink Diamond can become
    a recurring encounter.
- 'Doc' Julian attempts to convince the Travellers to assist him
    in stealing and selling the ship.
- Missy attempts to convert the Travellers to her cause or attempts
    to assassinate a Traveller if they have a religious belief.
- Andon believes that the Travellers are being too kind to
    Candy and starts a fight.
- In need of some extra help, Zander hires the Travellers to
    staff the spare gun, amongst other things.

With frugal accommodation for passengers, the BB-2 provides relatively
cheap and fast transport over distances limited only by the endurance
of those it carries. It requires a good road network to attain best
performance but operators balking at the upfront purchase cost of the
BB-2 are likely to be mollified by extremely low running costs. Income
is often bolstered by visiting company-owned stops during a journey
where passengers can be charged over the odds for refreshments and

#### ALIENALIEN

##### Halkans

**By Christopher Griffen**

The Halkans are a human Minor Race native to Halka (Trojan Reach,
Menorial). Much like their more illustrious neighbors on Floria a mere
five parsecs away, the Halkans came from human stock transported
from Terra by the Ancients in approximately the year -300,000.
However, while the Florians were genetically engineered, gifted with
advanced technology and given the trappings of civilization, the
Halkans were left in a primordial state by the Ancients, who allowed
them to evolve naturally over the eons into their current state.

After first contact, the Halkans were initially thought to have been
affected by albinism, due to the lack of pigment in their skin, but they are
not true albinos. As the denizens of a planet that orbits a dim red-giant
star, there were no inherent advantages to developing higher levels
of melanin in their skin so mutations that might otherwise have been
weeded out by evolution were allowed to propagate in the gene pool. In
addition to light pigmentation, Halkans have white or light blonde hair and
their eyes are almost universally limited to shades of grey, sometimes
almost white. Having evolved on a world of relatively light gravity,
Halkans are of slight build but taller than most other humans.

Halka is a world of mysteries. Its primary star is an M9 III red giant
called Wuak, an enormous star whose swollen photosphere extends
outward beyond 3 AU. Wuak was once a much smaller main sequence
star, perhaps a yellow dwarf, that has made its way along the red giant
branch over billions of years, consuming its inner planets and cooling
considerably. As in other star systems, its expansion has warmed what
were once its frigid outer planets, including Halka, which is perched
in what is now the habitable zone of the system, nearly 40 AU from
Wuak's core.

Whilst most outer-system planets and gas-giant satellites are far too
cold to develop life of their own, Halka is rife with living things and
features a complex ecosystem ranging from microbes to a broad
array of plants, proto-fish and even some land animals. Just where
this all came from is a bit of a mystery. The fossil record has not been
studied well enough to determine if these life forms were brought to the
planet by the Ancients when they seeded it with the proto-Halkans or
whether life somehow made it to Halka from what was once the system
mainworld during the pre-red-giant phase. The latter seems improbable
but there is evidence that bolide impacts within the system might
have transported living matter between its worlds in ancient times.
Regardless of the mechanism by which it occurred, the fact is that
Halka has a great deal of life, which enabled the Halkans to develop

agriculture. Hunting was not seen as a viable means to obtain food due
to a dearth of large fauna. As such, weapons were not developed for
hunting but strictly for warfare between tribes of Halkans who competed
for agricultural resources.

For most of their history, the Halkans have led pastoral lives, achieving
no higher than approximately TL2. This changed with the arrival of
Florian colonists in -50. The Florians are a dimorphic human species,
including the small, weak and highly intelligent Barnai, who serve as
leaders, and the large, immensely strong but rather dim Feskals, a
ready-made servile labour force. Contact between the colonists and the
natives was minimal until a more official colonial development of the
world was undertaken in 211.

While the discovery of alien visitors was shocking for the primitive
Halkans, they accepted Florian dominance of their world with little
resistance. Meanwhile, the Florians took Halkan passivity as a sign
that they should be subjugated. Accustomed to the genetically coded
dimorphism of their own species, it seems likely that the Barnai
thought of the Halkans as simply another human Minor Race that was
designed for them to control, just like their own Feskals. Alternative
theories posit that the two Minor Races were so physiologically
different from one another that neither may have initially thought
that the other was human. What little documentation exists from the
colonial era seems to bear this out, although Florian scientists later
proved that the two shared a common genome and were indeed two
separate branches of Humaniti.

For more about the Florians, refer to Volume 4 of the Journal of the
Travellers' Aid Society.

The Halkans were enslaved by the Florians and made to work the
fields, much as they had for millennia, and their pastoral existence
became a thing of the past. Their labour was now for the benefit of the
Florian League and most of its largesse shipped off world for the benefit
of the League's numerous colonial expeditions. While Feskals willingly
accepted their role as subordinates to the Barnai, the Halkans did not
believe that it was their intended role to serve. However, their inclination
was to accept subjugation with minimal resistance. Other than toothless
entreaties for mercy and the right to maintain their own language and
traditions, the Halkans did little to plead their case.

A caste system developed, putting the Halkans clearly at the bottom
rung of society. They became a source of cheap, if somewhat reviled,
labour for the Florians. The Barnai could clearly see that they lacked
the physicality or eager acquiescence of the Feskals, yet the Halkans
also submitted to Florian authority. For the Florians, accustomed as
they are to binary roles, it must have been exceedingly confusing to be
given servants that were deficient both physically and mentally. In spite
of all this, the Florians willingly made a place for the Halkans in society
and exported them to similar worlds with agricultural plantations, where
they could provide a source of labour. In fact, they did so in such great
numbers that even today relatively few native Halkans remain on Halka.

The Halkans accepted their lot in life until the Florians abruptly made an
about face in approximately 900, taking a more enlightened approach
after centuries of oppression. As with so many things Florian, it took
outside influences to reshape their thinking.

In the mid-800s, the porous coreward border of the Florian League was
often violated by outsiders: raiders, pirates, slavers and colonists from
various pocket empires and independent worlds. The Florians were
similarly beset on their rimward border by Aslan ihatei. Slave raiders from
the independent human world of Viceroy began to regularly attack Halka,
taking slaves for their industrial enterprises. Viceroy had established
trade ties with the nearby Strend Cluster but found that they could not
keep up with demand without enhancing their labour pool. Without their
Barnai masters, captured Feskals made terrible slaves.

Much as the Aslan discovered in their wars with the Florian League,
Viceroy discovered that bereft of the Barnai, Feskals became violent
and destructive, and completely uncontrollable. See _Pirates of Drinax:_
The Trojan Reach or The Glorious Empire for more information about
the Man-Brutes of Ouiyloi. However, the Halkans were easily captured
and controlled, and had been culturally conditioned by the Florian caste
system. After centuries of allowing sporadic slave raids by Viceroy,
the Florian League had suddenly had enough of it and bolstered
their defences to prevent further incursions. In addition, the Florians
launched dozens of raids on Viceroy to reacquire their lost citizens but
there is little evidence indicating whether they were successful or not at
liberating the lost Halkans.

The transformation from oppressive dictators to beneficent partners
was gradual but by 900 the winds had changed and the Florian
League disbanded the caste system, granting Halkan citizens equal
rights in Florian society. In modern times, Halkans may be found on
many Florian worlds, occupying roles previously held only by Barnai;
diplomats, merchants and business owners for the most part, with
military careers being a rarity. Halkans are now included in the Florian
governmental lottery system on many worlds, allowed to serve four-
year terms just like the Barnai.

Unfortunately, seven centuries of brutal subjugation under the caste
system did a great deal of damage to Halkan culture. The shift from
the bottom rungs of society to equality has not been felt evenly and the
majority of Halkans have been left behind. Many are destitute, living in
the slums and backwaters of the Florian League, unable to find their
place despite promises of equality. Substance abuse, poor financial
prospects and suicide are rife in Halkan communities, especially those
that have developed off Halka itself. Halkan ghettos are depressing
places, seemingly bereft of hope. For their part, the Florians do not
seek to hide these blemishes on their society. Most are rather upbeat
about the Halkans, believing that there is 'nowhere to go but up' for
most of them.

The Halkans on Halka itself seem to have the brightest prospects. The
people on their world have been liberated from the oppressive caste
system for over 200 years and they have established themselves
as valued members of Florian League society. To outsiders, the
Florians are often seen as odd. They are remarkably industrious but
to unfathomable ends. They are a high-tech society, nowhere more so
than on Floria itself, but they often use their technological prowess for
strange purposes and projects. Their military forces are quite powerful,
and highly capable of defending their modest empire, but they are
distributed poorly, making them vulnerable on many fronts. It is not
unknown among the Florians to take on massively involved, complex
and often expensive projects, just to abandon or redirect them after
a short time. To the Halkans, however, this is just the cost of doing
business. Their fate has made them Florians and they mean to serve
in a manner that best represents League interests even when their
Barnai leaders are at cross purposes with them. Halkans are a peaceful
and pragmatic people whose steadying influence is an asset to the
Florian League, not a detriment. Neutral observers have noted that the
caprices of Florian society are sometimes mitigated by the steady hand
of Halkan administrators. They are a distinct minority in Florian space,
yet one that provides a valuable service to the League.

Many Halkans have taken it upon themselves to help lift their people up
by their bootstraps. Philanthropic Halkan groups may be found on any
Florian world that has a destitute Halkan minority. Such groups focus on
finding suitable shelter and occupations for their people. The Florians
have not made it entirely clear what paths to prosperity they might have
and Halkans who have enhanced their station do their best to help those
who have not. More ambitious Halkan groups set up cultural centres that
feature native Halkan art, language and literature programs as well as
hosting fundraisers to help their people get back on their feet.

```
The Halkan Diaspora took them far and wide but almost entirely
within the confines of Florian League space. While Halkans can be
found on virtually all Florian worlds, historically most have gravitated
to agricultural worlds where they participate in various farming
industries. Other than Halka itself, the worlds where Travellers are
most likely to encounter Halkans include the following:
•  Bolsush/Trojan Reach
•  Boronu/Trojan Reach
•  Eptid/The Beyond
•  Mis Noam/The Beyond
•  Tibolt/Trojan Reach
•  Zimt/Trojan Reach
```

HALKAN TRAVELLERS
Despite their outward appearances, Halkans are not terribly unlike
standard Vilani or Solomani humans. The Ancients brought them to
Halka from Terra and much like the many other human Minor Races,
they have evolved to survive on their adoptive homeworld. As described
above, Halkans' skin is virtually devoid of pigment, making them look
almost albino. They are taller than the average human but slenderer
and with a tendency to hunch when standing.

Halkans are generally peaceful and avoid resolving conflicts with
violence whenever possible. During Traveller creation, any receipt of
Melee, Gun Combat or Heavy Weapons skills should be rerolled. If the
reroll results in another combat skill, it is taken as normal.

Characteristics
Halkan Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their
characteristics: END+1 and EDU-1.

Their enhanced END score reflects Halkan fortitude and toughness,
acquired from their evolution on a challenging world. Halkans tend to
have a narrow focus and most are not privy to knowledge of the wider
universe. Their reduced EDU characteristic reflects this but can easily
be remedied should an individual Halkan seek out knowledge or higher
education opportunities.

Traits
Halkan Travellers all possess the following trait:

**Reduced Light Vision:** Halkans do not see in the infrared or
ultraviolent spectrums but their eyes are able to pick out details in the
visible light spectrum with enhanced acuity. Halkan gain DM+1 when
making Recon and similar perception checks in all but total darkness.
Likewise, Halkans are sensitive to bright light and receive DM-1 when
making checks under such conditions unless they wear protective
sunglasses to shield their eyes.

Careers
Almost all of the careers listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook are
suitable for Halkan Travellers but most gravitate to Citizen, Drifter and
Entertainer careers, with some taking roles as Scouts in the Florian
equivalent of the Scout Service. Since no direct analogue exists to the
Imperial Express Boat Network, Scout careers should be limited to
surveyor and explorer assignments. The most common careers for a
Halkan are Citizen worker or colonist. Those who pursue either of these
careers gain Profession (farming) 1 as a bonus skill during their first
term of service.

##### Care Package

By David Sansom

**Location:** Canisus (0330 C4317BA-8), Star Lane subsector, Deneb
**Recommended Skills:** Mechanic, Persuade and Recon
**Reward:** Cr100000 (potential bonus of Cr100000 for additional
information of Mandal's release)

**Mission:** Deliver the care package to the SMH Operative, collect
the recorded video and deliver it to the SMH office on Aosta (0332
A669236-C), Deneb

CANISUS
Canisus is a dry and somewhat inhospitable planet blessed with
abundant mineral wealth. Vast dry plains swathe most of the planet,
dotted with sprawling cities which pop up wherever a rich mineral seam
is found. The very thin atmosphere requires the use of a combination
mask, whilst outside, and most homes and buildings are partially
pressurised for comfort.

The ruling dictatorship relies on revenue from the numerous mining
operations on the planet, some operated by the state, with many
leased to offworld corporations. Life is tough for those that work the
mines and the divide between the workers and the ruling elite is a
constant source of friction.

Sternmetal Horizons has several mining concessions on Canisus but
the ever-changing political situation has become more concerning
throughout the years of operation. Most of its workforce are locals
employed by the state and subcontracted to SMH so it has little control
over their compensation or rights, which are being alarmingly eroded.
The ruling dictatorship has been struggling with increasingly more
militant workers' rights movements, some of which have developed into
domestic terrorist groups. To counter this the intransigent leader, First
Minister Leopert Anttisaari, is pushing an ever more hard-line stance in
dealing with the dissidents. This is exemplified by the construction of a
contentious offworld prison on the neighboring planet, Krida.

REFEREE INFORMATION
The Travellers are approached by Reve Salla of Sternmetal Horizons
(SMH) with an offer. They need independent consultants to help with
the imprisonment of one of their employees on Canisus. One of their
SMH worker relations operatives, Mandal Mahalla, had been working
with a peaceful protest group called the Miners' Rights League.

Unfortunately, she was arrested during a clampdown on worker
gatherings and incarcerated on Krida. Mahalla has been cut off from
communications for over three weeks but the company has found a
way to get in contact.

The Canisus authorities will permit independent charitable
organizations to deliver care packages. SMH want the Travellers to
act as members of a welfare organization and to make contact with
their operative. They are to deliver a care package and request Mandal
record a video message for proof of her wellbeing. Afterwards, the
recording needs to be delivered to an SMH office on Aosta as quickly
as possible. Completing this task will net the Travellers Cr100000.
Additional information leading to Mandal's release will net a bonus,
depending on its value, of up to a further Cr100000.

Sternmetal Horizons will provide medium passage or running costs
for their own ship from Trin (or other nearby system) to Canisus
and return. A cover organization named Deneb Convict Care and
Welfare has been set up, which should get them access to Krida
Prison. Travellers will be provided with suitable identification and any
reasonable equipment they need, bearing in mind the high Law Level
(10). If something prohibited is vital, SMH will arrange for it to be
delivered to the local scout base for collection.

ARRIVING AT CANISUS
Arriving at Canisus the Travellers will find a busy industrial starport,
most of which is dedicated to handling bulk transport of products from
the mining industries. The remainder, supporting passenger traffic, sees
mostly corporate staff and those looking for work. Tourist traffic is light
but some come for adventure holidays exploring the wild landscape.

By nature of the high Law Level, security on entry is tight, with body
and luggage scanners and physical spot checks common. Offworld
visitors are permitted with suitable paperwork, with limitations imposed
on where they are permitted to travel. Generally, this means that
access to government facilities, mining operations and any regions
considered 'unsafe' due to terrorist activity are off-limits without specific
permits. Additionally, apart from designated visitor enclaves in the city
centres, they will need a 'guide' provided by the state. Surveillance and
propaganda are ever-present, drones and state police are a frequent
reminder of the state's control.

The Travellers' documents, which SMH have provided, will be
thoroughly scrutinised on arrival. This leads to a considerable, and
possibly nerve-wracking, delay but they will eventually be approved and
even given a permit to visit the prison at Krida.

Onor, the city beyond the starport, revolves around mining and related
industries and has a typical gritty, utilitarian industrial feel. It does
have a number of local head offices for various offworld corporations,
including Sternmetal Horizons, although Reve Salla recommends
Travellers avoid direct contact with this office unless absolutely
necessary, to preserve their cover. The city provides all the normal
facilities and retail outlets but the extreme Law Level means weapons
and armor are not available. Items of TL9 or more may be found but
they will be very expensive and of limited availability. Black market
items will be difficult to find, with a high cost and low Tech Level,
typically TL6 or less.

If the Travellers try to contact the Miners' Rights League, they will find
the small office in town is closed with a government order posted on the
door declaring it a banned organization. Asking around, a successful
Streetwise check will reveal members of the group are all either
arrested or have gone into hiding.

For their visit to Krida prison a routine shuttle service is available, which
typically takes 18 to 36 hours depending on planetary orbital positions.
The service mostly caters for prison staff and delivering supplies but
also takes a small number of visitors. The in-flight service is adequate
but basic, with entertainment being limited to state-sanctioned material
only. State news and propaganda are all that can be seen playing in
common areas. Thankfully, the bar is cheap. A faster alternative would
be to charter a small craft, taking 8 to 15 hours, but this would be
considerably more expensive.

Travellers with a ship will be permitted to use their own transport if it
is unarmed. An armed vessel will be issued a permit under agreement
that turrets be locked down, with physical clamps and anti-tamper
devices fitted. These devices could be removed with a few hours work
but will trigger an alert broadcast unless a successful Very Difficult
(12+) Electronics (comms) check (1Dx10 minutes) is made.

A shuttle to the scout base is also available from the downport run by
the IISS. This is service governed by Imperial law and access is not
restricted by the local government.

KRIDA PRISON
Krida is a small planet with a thin atmosphere, in orbit of the Canisus
main world. Gravity at the surface of Krida is 0.3G, the day cycle is 35.6
hours, equatorial surface temperatures range from 20oC to -120oC.

Krida prison complex is largely underground with just docks and a
terminal level on the surface. The docks consist of three landing pads
arranged around a central terminal building. The dock pads all have
physical docking clamps to hamper unauthorized departures. Extendable
docking tunnels provide access from vessels to the terminal.

To deter unwelcome visitors, there are turret mounted defences
consisting of two missile racks, six heavy autocannons and four
sandcasters. To monitor the local area the prison operates civilian
grade sensors (lidar and radar).

Security is visibly present throughout the docks, terminal and prison
complex, with numerous cameras and prison wardens on show.
Scanners and physical inspection are used to detect contraband and
weapons on any visitors or personnel passing through the terminal.
It will be difficult to get even a body pistol through (but not impossible
with some ingenuity).

Underneath the surface terminal, the complex consists of several
subterranean levels. Dug into the rocky interior as a series of tunnels
and chambers, the buildings are all lined with drab grey plastic-
composite panels to insulate from the freezing rock and provide heating
to living spaces.

The first level is used as staff accommodation, admin/security offices
and the security control center. Level two is for daily services, including
the reactor control room and backup generators, as well as general
maintenance. The main fission reactor is housed in a separate shaft
about 300 meters from the complex, in which there is a maintenance
access shaft from here to the reactor house.

XXHIDDENSECTION
```

Underneath this are three levels of cell blocks. The first of these
includes a duty guard barracks and the visitation rooms. For visitors
and guards, one elevator shaft runs down from security to the bottom
level of cells. Prisoners are walked down the main stairwell, which has
remote controlled cameras and suppression devices in the ceilings.

Between the second and third level is a hidden level, only accessible
from the main stairwell. Its existence is not apparent but the
observant may notice there is an extra landing on the stairs between
these levels. The extra landing between services has a concealed
door and RFID panel for access. No prison staff have access to this
level, even the warden.

VISITING MANDAL MAHALLA
On arrival, the Travellers will be under constant escort by at minimum
one guard. They will be escorted from the landing pad to the terminal
and pass through security checks, before being taken down to the first
level security center. From there they will be taken down by elevator
to the upper cell block level and a visitation room. The room is divided
in two by a thick Perspex wall, with a microphone and speaker system
to allow communication between the two sides. A locked hatch on one
side, controlled by guards, allows sanctioned care package items to be
passed through. Several chairs are arranged on the visitors' side and
one on the inmates' side.

Once the Travellers are seated, Mandal will be brought in and they will
be allowed to communicate with her. One guard will remain on duty on
each side of the room.

During their meeting Mandal will answer any questions the Travellers
ask but avoid revealing anything that might be incriminating. If they
forget, she will prompt them for the video message recording. She
seems reasonably calm at first but during their meeting it becomes
clear she is hiding her anxiety. There are a number of rumors involving
inmates going missing whilst here and she is worried she might share
the same fate. The rumors claim various stories about what happens
to the missing but the end result is that they do not return... She will not
voice these concerns whilst a guard is present.

The video message she records has a number of pre-arranged code
phrases weaved into an otherwise innocuous 'proof of wellbeing'
message. The Travellers listening notice some odd phrases with an
INT check and can derive the intent behind the phrases. The meaning
remains unknown but the intent to pass information clandestinely is clear.

THE KICKER
An extremist group called the Canisus Freedom Fighters (CFF) have
planned an audacious jailbreak, which will unfortunately derail the
Travellers' plans. The CFF have been earning a reputation through a
number of retaliatory attacks on state security forces and branded a
terrorist group by the government.

Over a year ago they managed to steal a number of low-tech reaction
engines, normally used to push icy asteroids into useful orbits for
recovery. They have pushed several sizeable rocky asteroids out of
their orbits into a sling shot aimed at Krida, specifically at the prison;
there is a considerable margin of error, hence several rocks.

The CFF's intention is to knock out the communication antennae, the
defence turrets and to breach the terminal building. A flotilla of mining
ships carrying CFF fighters following in the rocks' shadow will then land
and stage the escape. The craft are typically small, old and repurposed
for hauling ore but can still generate a good 3G of thrust. Once the
rocks have done their job, CFF forces will advance into the prison
aiming to liberate as many prisoners as possible. This will take several
hours of close quarter fighting before the extraction can begin.

The plan works a little too well. The defence turrets are low on
ammunition and lack of practice by the guards operating them means
they have a limited effect against the incoming rocks and a lot more
damage is done than expected.

The defence turrets and all communication equipment are destroyed and
a remote emergency beacon is activated, which will draw the attention of
the scout base and local government system defence boats.

The Imperial Scout base, orbiting between Canisus and Krida, will
respond with two small craft and a scout ship. These arrive in 6 to 10
hours, the faster craft first. The vessels sent are a modular cutter (Thrust
4) with a field hospital module, a pinnace (Thrust 5) and a scout/courier
(Thrust 2). The pinnace, arriving first, will monitor the situation, providing
analysis and coordination of the aid or rescue efforts.

The system defence boats (see page 123) are old units, refurbished
and not well maintained. They are spread thin across the system and
will arrive at 12 hours, 24 hours and 36 hours respectively.

```
•  Initial impacts are minor, coming from the debris of the lead rock
shattered by the autocannons.
•  Following this, four larger impacts will be felt throughout the
complex like earthquake shocks, breaching the docks, terminal and
down into parts of the first level, blocking some of the emergency
exits. This triggers automatic lockdown of the prison and all cells
and prisoner accessible rooms seal. Guards can override these but
will not without a very compelling reason.
•  The last impact, from a dense nickel-iron rock hits hard,
penetrating the hardened cap protecting the main reactor. This
causes significant damage to the fission reactor coolant system,
starting a cascade of failures that eventually cause a reactor
meltdown if not stopped.
•  Coolant failure alarms start sounding after an hour. The carbon
rods, meant to dampen the fission process in an emergency, are
jammed. The seismic shocks have shifted the rails guiding the rods
and they cannot fall into the chamber.
•  Evacuation alarms sound six hours later unless work is done to
restore coolant but that will not happen without help. There are not
enough engineers to do the work in time and fighting between the
CFF and prison security hampers access.
•  After eight hours without attention, the core melts and drops
through to dispersal channels down into the bed rock. With the
fuel uncontained, this causes a spike in radiation levels within 500
meters. Anyone in the service tunnel or below will suffer 2Dx3 rads
as a burst of radiation, which is released as the chamber breaches
and before the dispersal channels separate the core enough for it
to cool down.
•  Meanwhile, the high temperatures and pressure in the ruptured
reactor chamber will cause a plume of radioactive material, steam,
gases and particulates to billow from the decimated reactor cap.
Anyone on the surface within the affected area will suffer 2D
rads/20 minutes of exposure, unless within an intact building or
spacecraft. The plume spreads out over the surface covering
several square kilometers.
```

TIMING OF EVENTS
The impacts start as the meeting with Mandal is concluding. A gentle
tremor shaking the room and then a distant, repeating, 'thump'
noise are the initial signs of something being amiss. A Routine
(6+) Recon or Heavy Weapons check recognizes it as autocannon
fire. The entire prison shakes with each impact, gently at first but
successively more dramatically.

The guard on Mandal's side steps out at this point to find out what is
going on, locking the door behind him.

On the first main impact an alarm starts to sound (for the lockdown,
only the guard knows this). After each successive impact tremor,
fracture lines appear on the walls and ceilings, with the lights beginning
to flicker. On the fourth impact all lights go out and the alarm is cut off.

Dim emergency lighting kicks in after a few moments. The guard
accompanying the Travellers lies unconscious, having been struck by
falling cladding from the ceiling.

ESCAPE!
As soon as the dust settles from the impacts Mandal calls out to check
the Travellers are okay. Noticing the Perspex screen now has a crack,
she starts trying to break through using her chair, but is not strong
enough to do it alone. The doorframe behind her is buckled and looks
to be jammed shut.

The window separating Mandal from the Travellers is heavily fractured
but still in place. To break a chunk away from the Perspex big enough
to climb through requires a Difficult (10+) STR check (1D minutes).
Multiple Travellers can assist, working as a task chain using STR.

The guard is unconscious and has a minor concussion but will come to
in 2Dx3 minutes. Testing the doors finds them locked. The guard has a
key card, it is not immediately visible but a quick Recon check will find
it. Once awake, the guard will not unlock the door unless convinced
they are in imminent danger (or receives orders to do so). His radio is
not able to reach control as it was heavily damaged.

The guard's name is Matatrik Aosaari. He has a stunstick, a stunner
sidearm, a set of restraints and a radio with earpiece. If Mandal has
been released, he will insist on putting the restraints on her.

THE ROUTE OUT
The normal exit from the visitation rooms would be the lift but this is not
operational on emergency power. The lift itself is locked in place as the
automatic braking system kicked in halfway between the first and second

level. Four guards changing shifts are trapped in the lift. Over time
they get desperate and will try to escape. The lift's roof and floor have
maintenance access panels but without proper tools it takes the guards
two hours of determined effort before they can open the roof panel. If
anyone breaks through the floor during that time, they will assume it is
escaping prisoners (and will stun them), unless convinced otherwise.

In the event of an emergency, signs indicate routes to the main stairwell
from the cell blocks. Getting about in the barracks and visitation rooms
is not too hard, although doors are jammed due to shifted frames
and rooms are littered with debris from the ceiling, blocking some
routes. However, most of the area can be reached one way or another
(breaking partition walls or smashing windows).

The doors between the guards' area and the cell blocks or stairwell
are locked tight with dead bolts that were thrown when the first alarm
went off. This means manually retracting them or breaking the door
down. The latter is only viable where impact damage has weakened the
frames. To be released manually, the dead bolts require specific tools,
stored in the barracks armory or guards' stations. Without this tool, a
good mechanic with decent tools can figure out a way to open them but
it is harder and takes longer.

```
DEAD BOLT CHECKS
•  Using dead-bolt release tool: Average (8+) Mechanic check
(1D minutes, STR).
•  Using regular tools: Difficult (10+) Mechanic check (1Dx10
minutes, STR).
•  Using improvised tools: Formidable (14+) Mechanic check
(1D hours, STR).
```

Unless the Travellers can avoid them, guards in this area will insist
that visitors take shelter in the barracks until help arrives. After three
hours without contact from the control center, they escort visitors for
evacuation via the main stairway. However, on reaching the stairwell it
becomes clear there is trouble in the cell blocks below. Shouting and
banging can be heard echoing in the ventilation ducts. Shortly after, a
guard in the cell blocks manages to get a radio message through to the
guards on the barracks level. Many prisoners have escaped their cells
and a full riot has broken out.

At this point most of the guards will head down to respond to the riot,
leaving just two guards to escort the visitors out. The route up passes the
'hidden' section of the complex and the exposed door has an emergency
light over it. The guards will be reluctant to enter and if the Travellers
insist, they will refuse to accompany them and continue the evacuation.

Anyone evacuating will soon hear sounds of gunfire from the CFF
forces above trying to reach the cells below. By this time, fighting has
breached through the first level and a path is being cleared to the cell
blocks on the lower levels.

Trying to climb further up is halted by a blockage in the stairwell and
evacuation has to be done by going through the second level in order
to reach the service stairwells leading up. This will require evading
or dealing with Krida guards trying to repel the attack and/or the CFF
forces pushing through to the cells.

The second level is mostly intact but passing through risks conflict with
the CFF and/or prison security. Also, there are many areas in which
rooms and corridors have partially or completely collapsed.

If Traveller's can safely reach the first level, they find it in a bad way.
Many sections are sealed off by emergency pressure seals or blocked
with debris. CFF forces and the remaining security have sporadic
clashes, making finding a way out even harder.

The following incidents can be used during the Travellers' escape
through this level.

INCIDENT 1
A group of four security personnel armed with tactical riot gear are
checking the corridor ahead for intruders. With a successful Recon
check the Travellers hear them approaching and can attempt to hide
in a side room. An opposed Stealth vs Recon check determines if the
Travellers avoid detection. If spotted they will be apprehended and
vetted to ensure they are visitors, not escapees. Any visible weapons
on the Travellers will be taken and they will be escorted to a nearby
rescue shelter and told to wait there. Investigating the refuge will reveal
1D emergency softsuits (see Central Supply Catalogue, page 21) and
a TL8 medikit in the storage locker. The suits provide no significant
protection against damage or radiation but are good for four hours of
life support.

If the Travellers resist, whoever they encounter may use stun weapons
to subdue and restrain them before taking them to a rescue shelter.

INCIDENT 2
Traversing a quieter corridor, Travellers can see significant damage,
with several wall panels cracked or dislodged and partially obstructing
the way. After clambering through the wreckage they arrive at a sealed
pressure door. It looks like a typical emergency safety door that would
drop if a breach was detected (but may have just dropped due to the
tremors or the lockdown). A small inspection panel in the door shows a
dimly lit and damaged corridor leading to another closed pressure door
30 meters beyond. The pressure doors, which drop down from above,
have a manual override to crank the doors open and a latch to release
them to drop back down.

When trying to raise the door it quickly becomes apparent that the
space beyond has been breached, as the air in the corridor shrieks as
it is sucked through the gap. Without a vacc suit, one could realistically
work in the vacuum for up to 15 seconds and it would take about five
seconds to run to the far door. The breach in the tunnel is relatively
small and if the first door is left open, enabling complex atmosphere
inside, they could work significantly longer. This would allow the
Travellers about one minute to cross the section and escape through
the pressure door at the far end. After 20 seconds another emergency
door further down the corridor will shut to limit the air leak.

If the Travellers take this route they can bypass the worst of the
fighting, skipping Incident 4.

INCIDENT 3
Approaching an intersection, the Travellers hear a wet coughing that
sounds like someone struggling to breathe. The smell of cordite lingers
in the air. Turning the corner, they see two dead security guards and a
third bleeding out from a gunshot wound to the chest.

If they are quiet rounding the corner, they surprise a belter wearing a
vacc suit (TL8) with a CFF logo painted onto it, who is rooting around
in the jackets of the dead for ammunition. If he hears anything unusual,
he will be prepared, standing over one of the bodies with an autopistol
levelled and ready to shoot. If threatened he will shoot, then quickly
retreat down a side passage if possible. He can be convinced to leave
and catch up with his CFF squad.

If they try talking to the wounded Krida guard he will splutter a few
words about terrorists attacking them, before passing out. A successful
Average (8+) Medic check (1D rounds) will stabilize him providing
suitable equipment is used. Without suitable supplies the task is
Formidable (14+). A search of nearby rooms may find a first aid station
with suitable materials with a successful Average (8+) Recon or
Investigate check (1D minutes) but each passing minute inflicts DM-1 to
the check.

Checking the bodies uncovers two autopistols with spent magazines
and three full spare clips. There are also two stunners (TL8) with
full magazines. If the Travellers wait for the 'terrorist' group to leave
before approaching, the dying guard has expired and the spare clips
are gone. Either way, a key card can be found in the front pocket of
one of the guards.

INCIDENT 4
Approaching an open concourse, the Travellers walk into chaos. Debris
from the impacts litters the area and a plume of dark smoke is pouring
out of a retail unit, making the air hazy and acrid. Visibility is poor but
the remaining signs on the walls indicate the exit to the upper level
being across the concourse. At first all seems clear but when they are
halfway across the room running feet can be heard from either side. A
moment later shouts ring out and partially hidden figures on either side
start exchanging gunfire with the Travellers caught in between.

As the first volleys fly, each Traveller should roll 2D; on 5- they
are hit by a stray round (3D-3 damage), on 6+ they are only hit by
shrapnel (D3 damage).

Now pinned down, they can try to shoot their way out or try to run.
There are a number of solid objects that can provide cover but it
requires a series of dashes while under fire to get out either side.
If joining the firefight, Travellers will need to injure or incapacitate
enough targets to open an escape route. There are four prison guards
to one side and six CFF fighters on the other; if either side takes two
casualties they will retreat. The CFF have a mix of revolvers and
autopistols, whereas the guards have an autopistol and stunner each.

If they decide to wait out the fight, each Traveller should repeat the
previous roll once more before the shooting stops. Roll 1D. On an odd
number the CFF win the fight, on an even number prison security do.
If the CFF win, they will move on to continue with the jailbreak. The
prison security will detain the Travellers as unknown threats, locking
them in a room with wrist restraints fitted and any weapons taken.
Once the guards have left, escape will not be hard as the door can be
shouldered open with an Average (8+) STR check (1D rounds) check
but the restraints may hamper their progress.

GETTING OUT
Once clear of the fighting and chaos on the first level, the Travellers
need to find a way to reach the surface and a way offplanet. The main
route to the terminal building is breached and partially blocked. To
escape that way requires a vacc suit and a Difficult (10+) Vacc Suit
check (1Dx10 minutes) to navigate without issue. A failure will mean a
breach in their suit from jagged debris.

Alternatively, Travellers will see signs indicating several other emergency
exits. This will require finding a route through to each of these, requiring
an Average (8+) Navigation or Recon check (1Dx10 minutes), then
checking if the exit is breached or blocked. Roll 1D. On 1–3 it is intact, 4
it is breached, 5 it is blocked and 6 it is breached and blocked.

A breached exit needs a vacc suit to be used. A blocked route means
that 1Dx10 minutes is spent attempting to get through, before finding a
dead end. If the first two exits are unusable, the third should be clear.

When Travellers reach the surface, they will need to walk from the exit
to a vessel on the landing pads. For those without a suitable suit, 1D
emergency softsuits are available at the exit of the terminal building for
evacuating personnel. Crossing the surface will expose the Travellers
to the radiation fallout from the broken reactor and they will need to
either steal a ship or make a deal with the CFF forces. Once they have
a way offplanet, the final challenge is to get to safety (see Flight from
Krida on page 122).

THE EASTER EGG
Some of the Krida prison guards are aware of the 'hidden' section to
the complex. They have no idea what goes on inside but it may offer an
alternative exit or safer shelter. After the pounding of the bombardment,
the panel hiding the door on the stairwell will have buckled and shifted,
partially revealing the door.

The buckled panels will allow access to RFID wiring and the door
frame. Opening the door can be achieved by various means. For any
attempt, other Travellers can help as part of a task chain.

Once through the door Travellers enter what appears to be a guards'
station but the guard has clearly left. A discarded magazine lies by
the desk with the monitor showing static. The security door into the
complex beyond is ajar.

The complex is a black research facility run by the state authorities. It
is currently being used to experiment in human augmentation, the aim
being to modify convicts to work as drones in hazardous environments
without needing expensive life support systems.

Whilst there has been some success, those experimented on would
probably not agree. Several failed experiments can be found in autopsy
and survivors are distressed, confused and violent. Thanks to the
bombardment, they are also loose in the complex.

The following incidents can be used during the Travellers escape
through this level:

INCIDENT 1
The battered bodies of scientists will be found in rooms that have
clearly been trashed by someone or something, perhaps in rage or
panic. A wounded man in a white coat with the nametag Tullus Rophas
can be discovered hiding in a store cupboard. He will not divulge details
but be panicked enough to reveal that 'some of the subjects escaped
containment' and 'they tore out their restraint modules'. If questioned
about exits, he will recall an emergency evacuation exit but insist on
being taken rather than revealing the location.

Mandal will want to take footage or other evidence of the laboratory and
the atrocities within as leverage against the regime.

INCIDENT 2
At some point shots will be heard nearby and a brief scream. This was
a security guard, who will be found with a broken neck. The autopistol
near the body has two rounds left, with another full clip on his belt.

```
RFID PANEL CHECKS
•  Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check with toolkit or
Formidable (14+) without
•  Difficult (10+) Mechanics check with tools or Formidable
(14+) without
•  Very Difficult (12+) STR check with suitable lever or
Impossible (16+) without
```

Another body lies near the far door with multiple gunshot wounds. The
large man has a number of major, clearly experimental, augmentations
and appears to have undergone a number of surgeries from the amount
of visible scars. He is partially clothed in disposable hospital garments.

Spots of fresh blood form a trail to another room, in which another large
man with experimental augmentations is rummaging through medical
supplies, looking for drugs, wound patches or medikits. He is bleeding
from a gunshot wound to his arm. If the Travellers enter, he turns and
they can see his lower jaw, mouth and nose have all been heavily
augmented with some sort of breather modifications. His unblinking
bloodshot eyes burn with malice and he charges.

INCIDENT 3
A stocky woman in disposable hospital garments is groping her way
down the corridor. A large shaved patch can be seen on her head on
the left side, with an open wound oozing blood. A bloody chunk can be
seen on the floor behind her, with a trail of blood spattering the floor as
she stumbles away

She is largely unresponsive unless touched, in which case she lashes
out wildly. Seeing her face will show she has ocular augmentations,
although they have both been badly damaged where she has tried to
dig them out. She is partially blind, traumatised, in need of medical care
and more dangerous to herself than others. Although if provoked, she
will go berserk, attacking anyone in the vicinity.

INCIDENT 4
Further in, a door is found that shows the section beyond still has
normal power. It is on an independent emergency power source. If
the laboratory assistant is with them, he will confirm the emergency
evacuation tunnel is beyond that door. Any ID of laboratory staff, or
guards, will open the door.

The area beyond is less damaged than other parts of the level. Through a
window in the first door, the Travellers can see a laboratory with a scientist
at a workstation, behind whom lies a sedated and secured patient. The
patient has several experimental augmentations connected to monitors.
Opposite the laboratory is another door labelled 'morgue'. This holds the
remains of about a dozen people, victims of earlier experiments.

GETTING OUT
If the laboratory assistant Tullus is with them he can direct them to the
emergency exit. This part of the hidden level is a grid of corridors and
various rooms.

Wandering the corridors they will find a number of personal quarters, a
few common rooms, various storerooms stocked with supplies (general,
food, medical and electronics) and a workshop.

The exit is a secure airlock and needs a pass key to open or a Difficult
(10+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes) to bypass. Once
through the inner airlock door, the room beyond is long and narrow.
Down one side is a rack holding 12 vacc suits (TL8), opposite which are
12 ejection cocoons (see Vehicle Handbook, page 57). These are largely
automatic and have few controls for the occupant, except an emergency
canopy release to vacate the cocoon. Each is mounted in a launch tube
that will take it up to and above the surface, activating an emergency
beacon. The cocoons do not reach the velocity required to leave the
atmosphere and will drift back to the surface nearly a kilometer from the
prison docks, with braking thrusters cushioning the landing.

The beacons will be picked up by the IISS pinnace, prison control
center and the CFF. The prison control will dispatch an ATV with a
few well-armed guards to retrieve what they assume are evacuated
guards. However, the CFF will also respond, hoping to capture high-
value targets. If the Travellers are captured by the CFF, they will initially
assume their captives are state agents but once proved otherwise they
will look to how they can be used advantageously. If captured by the
guards, they are likely to face incarceration, especially if they have any
incriminating evidence.

Given the chaos, there should be opportunities for the Travellers to
escape their captors and steal a ship. Alternatively, they can bargain
with the CFF to be evacuated as soon as possible or try contacting the
IISS and be rescued as Imperial citizens.

FLIGHT FROM KRIDA
Fleeing the planet in a CFF mining ship, a stolen shuttle or the IISS
pinnace could coincide with the arrival of the first system defence boat.
This would lead to a dramatic chase with the Travellers helping the
crew or, if in a stolen boat by themselves, desperately trying to evade
capture. If the situation gets desperate, the scout ship could move in
to save them, broadcasting warnings to the SDBs about endangering
Imperial citizens and using their laser turret as point defence if needed.

On board the scout ship is an Imperial Agent, Rabina Fawan, who is
using the emergency to gather intelligence on the prison. She will be
eager to question Mandal and the Travellers, and be very interested in
material evidence of illegal practices if divulged. Rabina would be in a
position to help them all escape the system should they cooperate with
her investigations.

Escaping the system with the information will require avoiding detention
by the state forces. The Travellers will need to get onto the starport
or the IISS base where they can claim protection under Imperial
jurisdiction. From the starport, getting passage offworld may be tricky if
they have made trouble for the authorities. Many operators will be wary
of taking a fugitive on board. If the Travellers make it to the IISS base,
they may be able to convince the commander there to quietly take them
in one of their scout ships to a nearby system.

MISSION COMPLETION
The Travellers' primary task was to deliver the care package and return
with the 'proof of wellbeing' evidence. However, the actions of the CFF
have changed the situation and Mandal will want to use the opportunity
to escape the system. Ideally, she wants to return with evidence of the
mistreatments of the miners, specifically of effective 'chattel slavery',
which is forbidden by Imperial High Law (under Article VI of the Warrant
of Restoration).

Evidence of chattel slavery will invoke a response from the Imperial
nobility, possibly as high as the Archduke Norris. Depending on the
findings, this could mean anything from sanctions to military intervention.

Sternmetal Horizons will undoubtedly seek to turn events to their
advantage but has no desire to get mired in allegations of complicity in
slavery. If presented with this evidence, it takes a strong public stance
of supporting Imperial led actions against the regime.

Getting back to the SMH offices at Aosta with 'proof of wellbeing' will
fulfil the Travellers' contract and net their expected pay-out. Returning
with credible evidence of 'chattel slavery' would trigger the bonus of
Cr100000 and bringing Mandal home would receive a similar bonus.

###### MODIFIED SYSTEM DEFENCE BOAT

```
This is the modified version of the System Defence Boat.
Running on minimal maintenance, these ships are clunky, with
weapons attached that are more suited to less strenuous use.
This has the added benefit of reducing maintenance costs,
which the local government of Canisus appreciates. Not the
most well-maintained ships, they still pack a punch and are
relatively well armored.

##### Giant Scuttlefish

By Tim Heiderich

The giant scuttlefish is a filter-feeder found deep in the atmosphere of
gas giants, massing around 10-tons. It is an ectothermic invertebrate
with low intelligence and has an amorphous, semi-transparent body
trailing sticky tendrils over 100 meters long. Its sensory organs have
a heightened ability to detect hydrocarbons, its primary source of
nourishment. This includes the dense accumulation of liquid hydrogen
that makes up starship fuel. Scuttlefish have been known to adhere to a
starship in an attempt to penetrate fuel tanks with their rasping tongue.

Due to their method of propagation, the species' origin is unknown.
Upon encountering a solid object, an adult scuttlefish sprays out a
cloud of 2Dx10 gelatinous polyps, each about 50 centimeters wide,
which attach themselves like barnacles to any available surface. There
they remain, even under the hostile conditions of space, until awakened
by the presence of a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, wherein they inflate
and detach to aimlessly glide among the clouds, feeding on complex
hydrocarbons until they grow into adult scuttlefish.

Their respiratory system filters hydrogen from the atmosphere and
sequesters it in an inflatable sac used to control buoyancy. The entire
body is flexible and its only bones the chitinous teeth on its tongue,
used for feeding and self-defense. The cold-blooded circulatory
system allows it to blend in with the thick clouds where it feeds and
makes it adaptable to the coldness of space, where it deflates and
enters a state of torpor.
