Aran Ashkashkur is the head in [[Aramis subsector]] of [[Tukera]]'s covert operations agency, the [[Tukera#Vemene|Vemene]]. Amoral and devious (traits almost essential for anyone with his job) Ashkashkur has developed increasingly expensive tastes in life, to the point where his high salary is insufficient. For several years he has been embezzling moderate amounts from his department's budget; as his expenses have risen, it has become more difficult to conceal his crimes from the company. Now he plans one final theft, which should net enough to last the rest of his life.
