# VICTORIA

Victoria lies in the [[Abyss Rift]], just off the [[Lanth]]-[[Ghandi]]-[[Dinomn]] x-boat route. It is one of three [[Red Zone]]d worlds in the subsector and maintained by [[Imperial Navy]] vessels out of [[Lanth]] or [[Ghandi]]. There is almost always a guardship in the vicinity of the world, plus interdiction satellites that monitor traffic. Occasionally, additional vessels sweep other parts of the system, probably as part of the Navy's routine internal security operation.

The guardship is usually a small vessel such as a patrol cruiser or close escort. The subsector fleet has a huge section of the [[Spinward Main]] to patrol and the Sector Fleet is mainly concerned with the [[Sword Worlds]], just a few parsecs away. Neither can spare large numbers of vessels to monitor an unimportant planet in the middle of nowhere.

Victoria is a very old world orbiting a venerable star, deficient in heavy minerals and metals. Despite this, it has a dense atmosphere, which carries a taint capable of defeating most conventional filters. Fortunately, this taint exists mainly at low altitudes and above 1,000 meters the atmosphere is safe to breathe. Below this, an oxygen supply or fully sealed environment suit is needed.

The human population numbers about 10 million, dwelling on high ground in a region known as the Mesas. There is no world government; different groups have their own way of doing things that can range from oligarchies and dictatorships to democracies and even voluntary anarchy.

The Law Level 2 is an estimated average. Some areas have very strict laws; most do not. Similarly, technology varies from place-to-place, although always limited by the scarcity of metals. Balloons and dirigibles, sometimes powered by hand-cranked propellers, have made travel possible between areas previously cut off by low ground.

Victoria was probably colonized around -1450 and isolated for a long time. Even after the [[Imperium]] settled [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], the world received few visitors as a result of its remote location. In [[IY901]], the [[Scout Service|IISS]] made a survey of the world and shortly afterward a [[Red Zone]] was declared. While the Navy does not discuss the reasons for Red Zoning, the [[Scout Service]] is a little more forthcoming. In the case of Victoria, the given reason was to protect the people of the world from outside influence as they struggled to deal with their metal-poor environment.

However, there is something else interesting about Victoria and this may be why the Navy monitors the [[Red Zone]] rather than Scouts, although Scout vessels do sometimes visit. Normally, a [[Red Zone]] imposed at the request of the [[Scout Service]] is monitored by their vessels and personnel; the reasons are usually protective or scientific. [[Imperial Navy|Navy]]-monitored Red Zones are normally for political or security reasons, or to keep people away from an area of strategic importance to the [[Imperium]].

Around 300,000 years ago, at a time coinciding with the disappearance of the [[Ancients]], Victoria was heavily bombarded from space by asteroids used as deadfall ordnance, the technical term for dropping a heavy object from orbit. The bombardment resulted in immense craters, some of which are seas or great lakes today.  Others are not obvious, as they lie on the seabed. The Mesas area was caused by a strike that cracked the planetary crust and caused lava to surge up before cooling, creating the unusual pattern of high areas separated by chasms, which are quite deep but often only 500-2,000m wide.

The best asteroids for planetary bombardment are rocky or, better, nickel-iron cored ones. Thus, significant deposits of metal are probably present at the center of each crater. However, most craters are now submerged and all lie below the taint level, making access extremely difficult. Some craters have a central upraised point (a common feature of large impact craters) and these could be found and mined more easily. However, the great distances involved mean that such an expedition is far beyond the means of the local population.

It is possible to obtain a permit to visit Victoria, although not by any easy means. Such a permit includes strict clauses about trading metal or metal goods to the locals and specifically prohibits access to Victoria's moon, Albert. Permits make it perfectly clear that permission to visit the moon has not been granted and that lethal force may be used, without warning, against any vessel approaching it. No explanation for this has ever been given.

Albert is large enough to have an atmosphere and appears to even have surface water. It is officially listed as uninhabited but there have been reports of a stone-built (or, more fancifully, 'crystalline') city on the surface. Official charts make no mention of this, nor of any colonization effort or history of habitation on Albert.

Like most vehicles on Victoria, this example is a one-off build. It consists of a large gasbag under which is slung a propulsion gondola and crew accommodation pod. The latter has a set of bunks and a galley capable of serving the crew. The vessel normally operates with a crew of

DESCRIPTION



16-20, with crewmembers hot bunking, sleeping in shifts when they are not working. The galley serves a very limited selection of high-energy foods, capable of sustaining the crew throughout their voyage.

Propulsion is by means of hand-cranked propellers. The main propeller is directly aft of the working gondola, just beyond the end of the gasbag, supplemented by four steerable propellers that provide some manoeuvring capability. Landing is typically an all-hands-to-the-cranks affair, with the whole crew operating propellers under the direction of the vessel's master.

The main propeller is shaft-driven from a flywheel, which is brought up to speed gradually and with great effort, despite a gearing ratio designed to make it possible for even a single person to eventually build up some momentum. Once the flywheel is in motion, it essentially stores energy for the propeller to use at need and it is theoretically possible to spend a long time accelerating the flywheel, then make a flight with a minimal crew aboard.
