## POLITICAL ROLES

The Imperial bureaucracy and the nobles who serve within it manage the 11,000 worlds of the Imperium. The practice of enfeoffment grants them land holds of various sizes. Nobles rent and tax the land under their purview but ultimately it still belongs to the Emperor and can be taken back at his whim. For the most part, noble patents do not indicate actual rulership of worlds, subsectors or sectors over which nobles preside. As mentioned elsewhere, the Imperium largely governs the space between worlds and not the worlds themselves. That task falls mostly upon the people who live there, many of whom are citizens of civilizations that have been present for centuries, if not millennia.

The role of the noble is to maintain an aloof presence, be a caretaker for the Emperor but not one who interferes in the daily governance of worlds other than to ensure that the flow of trade is unimpeded and citizens do not violate Imperial law. Should the latter occur, the noble has little direct power to influence a preferable outcome. While some nobles maintain household troops – some of whom are so well geared that they could indeed take over a small planet – the primary recourse of the noble is to call upon the diplomatic corps or, if necessary, the Imperial military to resolve conflicts.

There are, of course, circumstances in which nobles do take a role in government. When civilian governments collapse, are in a state of transition or the world simply has so few inhabitants that there is little need for a complex governmental structure, members of the nobility may be called upon to lead. Most who do so take only an interim role with the provision that should the civilian inhabitants of the world eventually strive for self-rule, the noble shall step aside and let them form the government of their choice. When this happens, there is usually a peaceful transition but there have been a few incidents in which nobles have been reluctant to concede power. This can occur for a number of reasons: the noble is using the land for resource extraction or other forms of wealth generation and does not want to risk local interference; the new government-in-waiting has bad relations with the noble or possibly even the Imperium at large; or the noble in question simply enjoys the power of rulership and does not want to give it up. Regardless of the reason, Imperial law is clear: civilian governments should be given the right of self-determination and any fiction that dictates otherwise must ultimately be removed. Like so many Imperial laws, the rules are left vague in order to prevent the Emperor from being bound by precedent but nobles who resist this tradition do so at their peril and that of their noble patent. Nobles reluctant to give up power have found themselves on the wrong side of an Imperial Marines invasion whereupon their regime is put down in cursory fashion and rule is granted to the locals.
