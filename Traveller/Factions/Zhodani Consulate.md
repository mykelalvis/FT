### The Zhodani Consulate

Over the next tens of thousands of years, the [[Zhodani]] struggled to survive an ice age triggered by the bombardment and, as conditions improved, began to spread out across the planet. By approximately -24000 (by the modern Imperial calendar), the Zhodani had evolved into their modern form and became increasingly reliant on agriculture rather than nomadic hunting.

Imperial scientists believe that there was once a large population of [[Chirper]]s on Zhdant. They might have been put there by the [[Ancients]] or could have been native. In either case, human contact resulted in the discovery that these Chirpers had [[psionic]] abilities. [[Zhodani]] humans may or may not have gained their initial insight into psionics from the [[Chirper]] population; what is known is that from the time humans and Chirpers encountered one another, Zhodani humans began to display psionic abilities.

Zhodani sources are vague about the Chirpers; they all died out during recorded history. There is also evidence that around -8000, the Zhodani suffered massive depopulation, probably due to a plague. There may be a connection between these events.

Civilization was rebuilt slowly and not without difficulty.  However, by -6731 a technological society existed on Zhdant. This was the date of the first Psionic Games, the beginning of modern Zhodani society. The Psionic Games established a path for a psionically talented commoner to join the nobility and helped find the most powerful psionic individuals in each generation.
The period between games (three local years) is still a fundamental concept in Zhodani society.

The Zhodani are thought to have begun (some sources say regained, which has interesting implications) space travel around -6400. Within 400 years, they were launching sublight exploration missions to neighboring systems.  The Zhodani were willing to undertake very long-term operations; they created colonies in several systems and sent out exploration ships on missions lasting decades.  The Zhodani Consulate was founded in -5823 and comprised worlds as far as four parsecs from [[Zhdant]].

In -5415 the Zhodani developed jump drive technology and rapidly expanded their territory, encountering sentient species along the way. They met the [[Vargr]] around -2800 and the [[Vilani]] in about -2000. However, Zhodani exploration was unusual in one very significant way; they were fascinated by the galactic core.

Since -4000, the Zhodani have launched seven major, and many more minor, Core Expeditions. These have gradually pushed towards the galactic core, establishing a chain of refuelling and repair bases, and establishing relations with species met along the way.

The expeditions are limited to a region of about 30 parsecs wide, with occasional offshoots, and extend over 8,000 parsecs. Imperial scientists do not know the purpose of these missions but suggest, given the time and expense involved, they must be considered very important.

The Zhodani Consulate expanded rapidly from -4000 to -1000, at which point it halted. Unlike the Imperium, there is no 'border creep'; the Consulate has been stable for two thousand years. According to the Zhodani, it has reached the largest size that can be effectively governed and further expansion is both unnecessary and counterproductive.

Although it holds a few worlds in the [[Spinward Marches]], the Zhodani Consulate did not push into the sector and thus had a stable border when later arrivals appeared on the scene.


## Zhodani in the Marches

The Zhodani Consulate is the largest non-Imperial power with an interest in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. Its holdings are small, confined to a couple of subsectors along the spinward-coreward edge of the sector, but the influence of the Consulate reaches much further into the sector than this.

Zhodani military ships are unlikely to be encountered in Imperial territory except as escorts for consulate officials or valuable cargoes. They are occasionally active in neutral areas and routinely transit a narrow corridor through Imperial space to the [[Sword Worlds]] for 'diplomatic purposes'. Access is permitted by treaty for a small tonnage of vessels each year with the [[Imperial Navy]] shadowing the Zhodani vessels during transit.

Zhodani merchants and couriers are seen somewhat more often, and range more widely, but as a rule they tend to stay out of Imperial space. There is a persistent theory that the first three [[Frontier Wars]] (the fourth was an accident) were fought because the Zhodani felt threatened by the [[Imperium]], and that if there is no perceived threat then there will be no more war or interaction. The Zhodani do not seem interested in what happens outside their own extensive borders.

There are those, of course, who take the opposite view. They contrast the lack of Zhodani ships in Imperial space with the way Imperial vessels routinely trade into the Vargr Extents and neutral space beyond, as well as into the Consulate itself, and suggest it is the ships they do not see that are the problem. There are also claims that the Consulate is sponsoring anti-Imperial sentiment within [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

The Consulate is not inclined to comment on these matters. It maintains a strong naval and military presence along the border and is not receptive to Imperial vessels crossing into the Consulate. Permits are required and boardings are not uncommon. While vessels are not harassed, they are not welcomed either.

Exactly how negative an image this creates depends greatly on the outlook of the ship crew in question. Those who dislike the Zhodani speak of this lack of welcome as a deliberate attempt to discourage Imperials from entering the Consulate. Those with a more neutral viewpoint feel the Zhodani simply do not care one way or the other and that Imperial ships with the right paperwork are as welcome as any others.

It would be surprising if the Zhodani Consulate did not have intelligence gathering apparatus within Imperial space. The availability of psionic powers grants extra capabilities but most likely the Consulate uses a mundane system of agents, informants and couriers like other states. Its own counter-intelligence system seems to be very effective, when it works.

The rest of the time, Imperial agents in Zhodani space seem to be able to operate undiscovered. Asking why this might be leads to the conclusion that perhaps the Zhodani are content to leave most agents in place and only remove those who are troublesome.

The Zhodani Consulate has a maximum TL14 and enormous industrial power. The size of its fleets are unknown but, based on previous conflicts, they are likely to be huge. Certainly, large numbers of patrol craft have been sighted along the border and these seem to be very efficient.
