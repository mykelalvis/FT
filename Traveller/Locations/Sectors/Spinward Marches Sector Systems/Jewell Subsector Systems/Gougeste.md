Gougeste Gougeste 0109 C372510–A 0109 C372510–A NANA This small, dry, world is home to a minor outpost of the Arkesh Spacers. Reports of pirate activity have led the Imperium to classify the system as an amber zone.

Gougeste is the only planet in the system and occupies the second orbit. There are also three planetoid belts. Many have speculated that the planetoid belts are the remains of planets destroyed by the Ancients, which poses the question, how and why did Gougeste survive?

Gougeste 0109 C372510A NA This small, dry, world was uninhabited until 892 when it was colonized by the expanding Arkesh Spacers corporation. The population of 125,000 all live in a single city consisting of three pressure domes that were built to provide a comfortable living environment for the Arkesh employees. Many inhabitants who are not directly employed by the Arkesh Spacers are still important to the corporation by providing services and facilities to the small population.

In recent years, some member companies that operate in the Jewell subsector have established offices and workshops on Gougeste to further benefit from their membership. As a consequence, this has brought more trade to this backwater world and has helped to cement the Arkesh Spacers commercial standing in Jewell.

Gougeste is not a self-sufficient world, relying on trade from neighboring systems for most food and essential supplies. Unfortunately, recent reports of pirate activity have led the [[Imperium]] to classify the system as an Amber Zone, which has lead to a small drop in trade.

### ATTITUDES

The people of Gougeste are hard working. The corporate atmosphere, coupled with their reliance on trade makes most people here friendly. However this welcoming attitude is largely superficial, for behind every smile is the promise of trade and profit.

### LAWS

Anyone is permitted to land on Gougeste and there are no cargo or trade restrictions.

### PLACES OF INTEREST

## Norkash City

This is the only settlement on Gougeste. The city has three interconnected pressure domes, allowing access by small vehicles or the public transport tubes. The Habitat Dome contains the majority of the housing and domestic facilities. The Garden Dome is largely given over to hydroponics but it also has a number of parks and recreation areas. The Commercial Dome caters to the commercial and security aspects of the corporation and is also home to a number of member companies.

## Starport

The starport is a modest facility that serves the needs of the Arkesh Spacers. It is situated between the three domes and is connected to all three via transport tunnels.
