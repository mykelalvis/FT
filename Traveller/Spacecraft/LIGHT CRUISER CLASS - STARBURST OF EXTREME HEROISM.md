### LIGHT CRUISER CLASS: STARBURST OF EXTREME HEROISM

The Starburst of Extreme Heroism -class, or SEH - class for short, is a common sight throughout Imperial space and may be found serving in many of the empire's numbered fleets. It is essentially a more rounded and streamlined version of the larger Ghalalk -class cruiser. The form factor of the two ships is basically the same with less space for bays and other accoutrements on the SEH.
