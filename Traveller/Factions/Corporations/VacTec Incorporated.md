# VacTec Incorporated

VacTec was once known as ‘Unified Space Technologies and Related Industries’, which whilst not a catchy name does encapsulate the firm’s business interests. VacTec is a major supplier of vacc suits, rescue gear and components intended for use in space. These are not only supplied to starship operators or constructors; they are found at starports, aboard satellites and on rockball outposts all across the sector.

VacTec is best known for its range of vacc suits and survival equipment, ranging from emergency softsuits through standard shipboard and heavy-duty suits all the way up to armoured rescue and work suits. One of the firm’s most popular products is its ‘Crew Wear’ branded
‘enhanced duty uniform’. This is basically a standard coverall as worn by many ship crews, available in a range of styles and colours. It is more expensive than a standard coverall, but provides protection from partial vacuum and will enable the wearer to survive long enough to self-rescue even in total vacuum. To function, the coverall is paired up with a set of gloves, a hood and an emergency mask. VacTec suits are worn by many shipboard personnel and also portside workers who might be exposed to vacuum, such as cargo handlers at orbital stations.

There are numerous competing brands in the same market niche of course, but VacTec equipment is well respected and is often considered a market leader. This makes it a common trade item for ships visiting remote installations. The benefits of workwear that enables survival in an emergency do not need much talking up by a trader, and a container of VacTec gear can often be broken up and sold on an individual item basis for a good profit.

VacTec also makes a range of vacc suit compatible tools and accessories, most of which are commonplace items such as wrenches and vacuum-capable welding kits. The firm does market some highly specialist equipment, largely for hostile environment use, and undertakes considerable research in this field. VacTec sponsors a number of hostile-environment scientific projects or record-setting attempts either to gain publicity or in many cases by way of a field test. The firm is also amenable to constructing one-off equipment sets for specific purposes, though the cost tends to be high unless a deal is struck whereby VacTec offsets the cost against some other benefit such as an exclusive supply deal or a high-status project garnering significant media interest.

VacTec is something of a household name, and whilst it cannot compete with the Megacorporations it does have a significant market share which seems to be slowly expanding. It is highly likely that any given starship has something aboard built by VacTec; the firm’s logo is recognised right across the sector and is generally seen as a guarantee of quality at a reasonable price.
