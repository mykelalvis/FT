The Five Sisters were first explored by the merchant captain Ignaz Ruffleran, who named the worlds of [[Mirriam]], [[Jone]], [[Penelope]], [[Karin]] and [[Ucella]] after his daughters. When an official subsector designation was assigned, these worlds gave what had previously been District 267 its name.

Lying beyond the [[Imperium]] proper and connected to it only by a tenuous link through the [[Sword Worlds]], the subsector was not heavily colonized at first. A coordinated effort was implemented in [[IY0740]] under the auspices of Emperor [[Paulo I]] but was curtailed half a century later after little success. That efforts to colonize a region close to two worlds inhabited by the psionics-using [[Droyne]] coincided with the [[Psionics Suppressions]] has not escaped notice.

Since that time, the subsector has remained an isolated territory under the administration of the [[Imperial Navy]]. It is the responsibility of the [[208th Fleet]], which is unusual in having capital ships permanently assigned to it, more likely to do with the interdiction of [[Andor]] and [[Candory]] than protection of the few Imperial assets in the region, although why battleships are needed to enforce a [[Red Zone]] remains a mystery. [[Droyne]] ships are not normally stopped â€“ the [[Red Zone]] seems to be there to keep people out of [[Andor]] and [[Candory]], not keep the [[Droyne]] in.

The [[208th Fleet]] has its headquarters at [[Iderati]], the subsector capital, plus six other bases in a ring around [[Andor]] and [[Candory]]. These are home to patrol ships and vessels that enforce the interdiction within the [[Red Zone]] systems and also heavier non-jump capable defence squadrons. These are deployed widely and may be in place to catch vessels trying to slip through to [[Droyne]] worlds. The fact that the base systems are [[Amber Zone]]d helps to deter visitors, however it seems to have more to do with the danger of intruding into a heavily defended system than anything else.

[[Andor]] and [[Candory]], as already noted, are both [[Red Zone]]s and [[Droyne]] worlds. As well as the base systems surrounding the interdicted area, there are three other Amber Zones in place at [[Jinx]], [[Lakou]] and [[875-496]]. Of these, only [[Lakou]] is an [[Imperial]] member. It seems likely that the [[Imperial Research Station]] at [[Froin]] (designated Research Station Zeta) is involved with research connected to the [[Droyne]] but, as usual, the authorities refuse to comment.

There are 10 non-Imperial worlds in the subsector, not counting those of the [[Droyne]]. Most are located to rimward of the Imperial zone, in the direction of what some Imperials call the Outrim Void, despite it being only rimward of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and hardly a void. The term was first coined in an entertainment show and seems to have stuck. In any case, travel 'outrim' into Menorial via Five Sisters is discouraged by the authorities. Despite this, exploratory trade missions occasionally crawl along the [[Spinward Main]] all the way to Five Sisters and then head out into the relative unknown in search of new markets and a hoped-for big score.
