Nominal "Imperial Law" within the [[Imperium]]

A low law level.

There are few laws, covering only important areas. There may be few or no law enforcement officers, the expectation is citizens will bring law breakers to the attention of the Judicial system. Legal proceedings will be fast, with few people involved. For interactions outside of the framework of the laws, cultural norms dominate.

[[Body Pistols]], [[Explosives]], [[Nuclear Weapons]], and [[Poison Gas]] are typically regulated or prohibited.
