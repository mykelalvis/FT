# INTRODUCTION

The Trailing Frontier lies directly to trailing of the Core.
A natural border exists, in the form of a choke point
between the end of the Lesser Rift and the Delphi Rift.
This area is navigable but stars are sparse, creating an
astrographic and more importantly economic barrier to
Imperial expansion. Beyond the choke point is a region
of strategic interest to the Imperium but one into which
it is difficult to project power.

About half of the region known as the Trailing Frontier
is Imperial territory. This lies in the Ley sector with a
small enclave projecting rimward into the Glimmerdrift
Reaches. Ley is the seat of the Imperial Archduke
of Gateway, whose area of responsibility is named
Gateway Domain despite it directly controlling no
territory in Gateway. This reflects traditions based
upon plans to expand into that region and the strategic
importance of Gateway.

Gateway lies to trailing of Ley and, whilst it contains
no Imperial worlds, the sector is of great strategic
importance. This is due to the presence of the Lords of
Thunder, a sect of K’Kree so militant they were driven
out of the Two Thousand Worlds. The Lords of Thunder
have expressly stated their intention to expand into and
across Gateway and to wipe out all G’naak – meat-
eaters, or ‘vermin’ – in the cosmos. Keeping the K’Kree
away from the Imperial border is an important strategic


aim for the Imperium but it has many other concerns.
Plans to ‘harden’ the region against K’Kree expansion
have rarely produced significant results and it may be
that the measures taken by the archdukes of Gateway
are far too little, far too late.


The region was settled by humans during the Rule
of Man, with slow colony ships arriving even after
the Long Night had descended upon the territory of
the First and Second Imperium. These populations
developed largely in isolation, sometimes interacting
with each other or the local species. Those that did well
eventually created starfaring civilisations which already
had a long history of change and conflict when the
Third Imperium arrived in the region.


The Trailing Frontier is thus an extremely varied region.
Ley is solidly Imperial territory and has more of the feel of
an internal sector than a frontier. Gateway sector on the
other hand is open territory with numerous small powers.
It is subject to external influences but these are for the
most part distant. The people of Gateway want to chart
their own paths but, ultimately, they are caught between
the Imperium and the Lords of Thunder. If they can
put aside their differences, they may be able to remain
independent but, history has shown this to be a turbulent
region. Subservience to an outside power might actually
be preferable to alliance with an old enemy.


# A HISTORY OF THE TRAILING FRONTIER



Astrographically, the Trailing Frontier consists of
two sectors – Ley and Gateway – both containing a
projection of the Lesser Rift. Ley includes part of the
Delphi Rift, creating a choke point easily navigable by
ships of jump-3 or greater capability only. Ley is almost
entirely Imperial territory, whilst Gateway lies entirely
outside the Imperium. Both sectors had a long history
before the coming of the Imperium.

Human habitation in Gateway began around 300,
years before the founding of the Third Imperium,
when a race of non-human beings referred to as
the Ancients transplanted genetically engineered
human stock to various worlds throughout what
is now known as Charted Space. Their purposes
remain unknown, although it is generally accepted
that groups of humans served the Ancients in some
capacity. The Ancients vanished long ago, leaving
only fleeting traces of their existence, but some of
their transplanted populations remain.

## THE DISTANT PAST

It is possible that several human groups were
transplanted into Gateway. The expanding empires of
successful groups may have absorbed the remnants
of these populations. However, the fate of two such
groups is known: The Luriani and Sydites. Both
species underwent extensive genetic modification but
can be identified as sub-species of Humaniti by their
modified characteristics.

The Sydites got off to a slow start on their new
homeworld of Sopater (now known as Khuur to Imperial
citizens). Having been bred as tough and obedient
workers, they were well suited to survival in low-
technology conditions but had little drive to develop
complex social systems or technology. The Sydites
rose to dominate their planet but for millennia never
advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage.

Eventually, simple agriculture and animal domestication
became available to the Sydites and small states based
around good farmland grew. Sydite civilisation was fairly
peaceable due to their engineered psychology but their
few wars were devastating due to the single-minded
obedience of Sydite warriors. Whole regions were
depopulated and then gradually taken over by the victors.


Such wars were quite rare and did not produce the drive
towards innovation and technological advancement
typically found elsewhere. When not massacring one
another the Sydites were for the most part content to till
the soil and fish the coastal waters. There was little need
to innovate or develop and, since Sydite culture was
built around respect for hard work and team spirit, few
reasons to fight. Technology developed slowly as most
communities were content with simple devices built to
reliable, time-honoured designs.


The Sydites reached Iron Age technology (TL1) around
-120,000. By -30,000 a few enclaves had attained
TL2. It is thought that a sudden climate change around
-25,000 threw the Sydites’ placid society into turmoil.
Technological advance began to accelerate and the
various small states coalesced into a single world state
by about -10,000. This state systematically and almost
feverishly colonised all areas of Sopater and began
slow but determined technological development.


The Luriani, seeded on the water world of Daramm
and adapted for life there, developed more quickly.
On a world whose only land was a few scattered
archipelagos, the Luriani rapidly developed long-
distance sea travel and by -250,000 were fishing deep
waters far from their island homes.


By -150,000, Luriani civilisations had flowered on almost
all the archipelagos of their homeworld, linked by a
tenuous web of trade and commerce. Over the next
50,000 years, ocean-going trade grew in importance
until a true world economy existed. Government was
still decentralised but the vast distances between island
chains reduced the possibility of conflict to almost
zero. The Luriani maintained this peaceful lifestyle for
100 millennia, during which time a caste of permanent
ocean-dwellers arose. These linked the land-based
communities, plying the trade lanes aboard their city-
rafts. The Luriani might have gone on forever in this way,
had the Vilani not contacted them.


The Luriani did advance during this time. By -28,
they had developed land-based agriculture and began
domesticating animals soon after. Metalworking was
achieved in -15,000. By the time they were contacted
by the Vilani Imperium, the Luriani had a TL6 society.


## THE RISE OF THE VILANI

As the Vilani expanded throughout Charted Space, they
contacted many other subspecies of Humaniti. All were
absorbed into the Vilani Imperium, either slowly by
cultural assimilation, or rapidly by economic or military
conquest. Some species which had developed space
or interstellar travel attempted to fight the Vilani and
were crushed by the young empire.


At the time of the Vilani exploration of the Gateway
region, the Luriani had achieved a stable TL
society, based around technological versions of the
traditional raftships. Contact with the Vilani around
-7500 changed Luriani society very little. Perceived
as a backward species and no threat, they traded
a little with the Vilani, borrowed a few technological
ideas and were allowed to go on with their peaceful
existence unhindered.


However, offworld contact did spark an increase in the
rate of technological growth among the Luriani. The
Vilani undertook a cursory exploration of Ley but were
more concerned with events nearer home. At this time
the borders of the Vilani Imperium were far distant and
the occasional trade ships who made the journey made
a small profit at best. Thus, the Vilani did not witness
the technological explosion that took place over the
next 300 years or so.


Mariners by nature, the Luriani were fascinated by the
concept of voyaging among the stars. Within 50 years
of first contact, the first crude Luriani spacecraft made
their uncertain way into orbit. By -7400 the Luriani had
constructed an orbital staging post for exploration of
their own system and in -7200 their first migration ship
left the system.


The migration ships were a spacegoing version of the
raftships that plied the oceans of Daramm. Crawling
through space at sublight speeds, they spread out
among the local cluster and set up colonies wherever
they went. Most took settlers to other worlds but as
was the nature of these spacegoing mariners, some
continued their journeys. These voyagers linked the
new colonies with the homeworld as their seagoing
ancestors had done on Daramm.


By -6000, as the Vilani pushed their borders into Ley
sector, the Luriani had settled about 30 worlds. Migration
ships linked these far-flung colonies, spending decades
in deep space at a time. Despite some surprise that the
Luriani had advanced so far, the Vilani perceived no


threat and simply informed the Luriani they were now a
client state of the Vilani and thus bound by certain border
agreements. The Luriani accepted this happily enough
and life went on as before.


Everything changed in -5450 when the Luriani obtained
jump drive technology. It is not clear where this came
from but strong similarities suggest it was derived from
the system used by the Vilani. The Luriani quickly
converted some ships to jump capability and began
operating them among the colonies. In -5435, a large
trade and contact fleet belonging to the Sharurshid
bureau of the Vilani Imperium passed through the
region and noted the Luriani possession of jump drives.


Up until this point the Vilani had paid little attention to the
new subjects and their quaint sublight starships. They
had refused to release the secret of rapid interstellar
travel, which was the key advantage they held over
their competitors and since communication between the
Luriani worlds took decades there was little chance of
concerted disobedience. As a low-threat backwater, little
exploration had been undertaken in the region.


Fortunately for the Luriani, the Vilani had just
prototyped the jump-2 drive. This, and the fact that
they had become very complacent about the Luriani,
prevented much of a reaction. Nevertheless, officials
in the Vilani Imperium decided to monitor the situation
and find out where the technology had come from. In
-5421, a jump-2 expeditionary force composed of new
and powerful ships proceeded through Luriani space,
making it very clear the Luriani were no match for the
Vilani Imperium and its fleets.


The jump-2 fleet moved into Ley without divulging its
mission to the Luriani people. Over the next few years,
horribly mangled ships limped back through the region,
sometimes assisted by the Luriani vessels they had
come to impress. By -5402, the remnants of the fleet
had returned to Vland; at least, all the ships that could
come back. The fate of the rest remains unknown, at
least to the general public.


## THE CONSOLIDATION WARS

Shocked at their defeat in Ley, the Vilani leaders
launched a series of massive campaigns to integrate
and subjugate all potential rivals. The Consolidation
Wars, as these campaigns were collectively known,
were fought on all borders of the Vilani Imperium and
even within it as suspect worlds were pre-emptively
squashed. Beginning in -5400, the Consolidation
Wars took Vilani fleets out far beyond their borders,

A History of the trailing Frontier


creating a cleared zone in which no potential rival
would be tolerated. Those that did not surrender and
agree to limitations of technology and military power
were exterminated.

The Consolidation Wars did not really come to
Ley sector until -4700. Before that, small raids and
scouting missions occasionally took place but no major
campaign was undertaken. The Vilani fleets bypassed
the Luriani cluster and carried out operations in the
neighbouring subsectors, with the occasional deeper
foray. Vilani expansion more or less stopped at the
natural frontier; the trailing-rimward edge of Ley sector.
Officially, the region was of no great importance except
to create a buffer zone. However, rumours persist
to this day of forward patrol bases and long-range
scouting missions into Gateway.

During this time, the Vilani negotiated with the
Luriani in the hope of incorporating them into the
Imperium without the massive ship losses involved in
a campaign against a multi-world power. The Luriani
were seen as a minor threat since they had always
cooperated happily with the Vilani during their long
period as a client state. Only the fact they had a
large number of ships that conceivably could be used
against the Vilani – however remote the possibility –
made them any threat at all.

Ironically, the determined efforts of the Vilani negotiators
to nullify the Luriani threat was what created it. For
almost 120 years, the Luriani had negotiated in good
faith but were becoming increasingly alarmed at the
Vilani posture – and what they were doing in the
surrounding subsectors. The Luriani quietly began
expanding their fleets and putting defences in order.

In -4582, the Vilani decided to terminate the Luriani
military build-up before it went any further and
launched the Luriani Consolidation Campaign. Facing
the vast fleets of the First Imperium, the Luriani were
doomed from the start. Nevertheless, they fought
to defend their worlds and it took the mighty Vilani
Imperium some 35 years to conquer them. The
fighting was bitter, both planetside and in space. One
reason for this was the aquatic nature of the Luriani.
Natural 3D navigators, they had a feel for space
combat that somewhat balanced the technological
advantages of the Vilani.

Another reason for the cost of the war was the fanatical
nature of Luriani resistance. As the war dragged on and
it became obvious they would lose, the Luriani changed
their combat style. Unable to keep pace with losses,


their shipyards changed production from well-protected
battle ships to small, fast but lightly defended strike
ships. The strategic emphasis of the campaign shifted,
with the Luriani no longer seeking to hold their worlds
and defeat the Vilani. Seeing this was impossible, they
instead sought to make each victory cost the Vilani as
dearly as possible.


The Luriani never actually employed suicide ships but
their standard mode of combat was extremely risky.
Nevertheless, there was no shortage of volunteers
to undergo scanty training and crew the strike ships.
Less than 50% of these vessels survived their first
battle but the damage they inflicted in their reckless
attacks was impressive. Often built around a single,
oversized weapon mount or with the sole purpose of
getting a pair of torpedoes (short-range missiles with
heavy warheads and high acceleration) close to a
capital ship, the Luriani ships were shot out of the sky
in droves, yet they blasted huge holes in the vastly
superior Vilani fleet.


Some historians have suggested the Luriani must have
received aid from an unknown source during this war,
since the Vilani could not possibly have been held off

A History of the trailing Frontier





for so long by a mere 30-world power. Curiously, there
is no record of any such assistance in either Luriani or
Vilani histories of the time.


The Vilani undertook little ground fighting, except
where it was completely necessary. Normally,
once space superiority was established, orbital
bombardment and weapons of mass destruction were
employed to crush opposition, unless (and sometimes
even if) unconditional surrender was forthcoming.
Eventually, in -4547, Daramm fell and the remaining
Luriani worlds surrendered.


As soon as the Ziru Sirka had a firm hold on the
Luriani worlds, investigators moved in and carried
out some kind of purge. Exactly what was done is
now unknown, suggesting the purge was a complete
success. These events took place in -4546, which is
now known as the Year of Woe.


Elsewhere in the region, great events were also
unfolding. By -4305, the K’Kree had properly unified their
homeworld and continued technological development
led to the creation of grav vehicles by -4228. Shortly
thereafter, the K’Kree launched a campaign of genocide
against a species of intelligent carnivores inhabiting their
moon. The war was brought to a successful conclusion
in -4167 with the extermination of the carnivores and
the declaration of the Axavktrr!xur, or fundamental
principles of survival which demand the extermination
of all carnivores that will not permit themselves to be
converted to vegetarianism.


The K’Kree exploration of other star systems
began in -4142 with the invention of the jump
drive. Expansion into neighbouring systems was
of course accompanied by extermination of their
native carnivores. It is not known how many primitive
omnivorous or carnivorous species were forcibly
adapted or exterminated in the process.


The Hivers developed a crude proto-jump drive in
-4698, and began exploring local space. This drive was
flawed and tended to break down after a small number
of jumps. By -4212, a superior drive was available
(which did not break down) and the Hivers were able to
begin exploring further afield. This led to contact with
the Ithklur in -3986. The Ithklur were the first advanced
species contacted by the Hivers and the most violent
they ever met. The Ithklur were already exploring their
home system when the Hivers arrived and the Hivers
were terrified by the thought of these dangerous aliens
rampaging around nearby space once they discovered
the jump drive.


The Ithklur were thus subjected to a blockade and 1,000-
year manipulation project intended to somewhat curb
their homicidal lunacy. The Hivers claim this project was
a success; the Ithklur became less violent and also a
little less smart. The Ithklur say they are no different to
the way they were then. Whichever is true, the Ithklur
eventually became a subject race of the Hive Federation
and have acted as its shock troops ever since.


## THE FALL OF THE VILANI

Once the Consolidation Wars ended, the Vilani settled
into comfortable dominance of their vast empire, which
became known as the Ziru Sirka or Grand Empire
of Stars. Minor incidents were easily put down and
expeditions ranged beyond the borders to ensure no
‘barbarian’ people gained access to jump-2 drives.
For centuries the Vilani were successful and no threat
arose to shake their deepening complacency. By -4000,
exploration by the Vilani had all but ceased. The Ziru
Sirka reached its greatest size by -3500 and began to
stagnate, although to its members it seemed they were
living in a golden age of peace and prosperity.


The long peace was shattered in -2422 when the
Terrans, exploring out from their homeworld in primitive
jump-1 ships, made contact with the Ziru Sirka. Within
15 years, the Terrans were at war with the Vilani
Imperium, whose immense size they did not even
suspect. The early wars forced the diverse people
of Terra to unite and the Terran Confederation was
established in -2398.


The initial clashes between the First Imperium and the
upstart Terrans caused the merest ripples as far afield
as the Trailing Frontier. Even as the wars dragged on
and the Ziru Sirka began to disintegrate, Vilani holdings
in the region remained loyal. Centuries of firm rule
had thoroughly squashed the idea of rebellion and
independence. A series of short wars and brief periods
of peace ensued. These at first concerned the Ziru
Sirka little. Dealing with a few barbarians was a matter
for provincial forces and even these were slow to react.
Internal politics distracted the Vilani commanders and
centuries of decay and complacency sapped the will
and ability of local commanders to act. The provincial
forces concealed the extent of their losses, fearing
political repercussions, which in turn prevented them
from receiving adequate reinforcements.

Meanwhile the Terrans absorbed Vilani technology
and developed their own, constantly surprising the
Imperials with their ingenuity. The next two centuries
saw the Terrans striking ever-harder blows against
the Ziru Sirka, which was beginning to crack under
A History of the trailing Frontier


internal stress. Even as the extent of the colossus they
were battling finally dawned on the Terrans, it became
apparent that the Ziru Sirka was dying. A combination
of internal decay and external hammering caused the
Grand Empire of Stars to totter and finally fall. Terran
fleets slashed through collapsing defences, ripping
what remained of the heart out of the carcass that had
once been the Vilani Imperium.

## THE RAMSHACKLE EMPIRE

The collapse of the Ziru Sirka came swiftly, in historical
terms. The end of the First Imperium and its replacement
by the Second (The Rule of Man) is officially dated as
-2204, but it was some years before the repercussions
were felt in what is now the Trailing Frontier.

During the collapse of the Vilani Imperium the Luriani
allied themselves with the Terrans and sent forces
to fight alongside the advancing fleets. Despite
this assistance, the Second Imperium did not grant
the Luriani autonomy and resentment over this
eventually led to a rebellion in -2186. Within six years
the revolt had been put down by a combination of
Terran and Vilani forces.

The Luriani failed to win their autonomy by military
means but were able to secure it through their unique
culture. As Luriani art and music became popular in the
Rule of Man, sympathy for their cause grew. The Second
Imperium formally recognised the Luriani Cultural Region
in -1932. Solomani governors were appointed but the
Second Imperium remained determined to preserve
the unique culture of the Luriani people. Over time the
loosely defined cultural region became today’s Luriani
Cultural Association, the nearest thing to a multi-world
power within the Imperium.

Although thoroughly subjugated, the Luriani people
retained much of their cultural identity throughout
their long membership of the Ziru Sirka. As the
economic and governmental apparatus of the Imperium
collapsed, the Luriani did not turn on the millions of
Vilani living among them, instead accepting them as
part of Luriani society. These Vilani-Luriani became
known as the Mmarislusant, which means victims of
history. The Mmarislusant were encouraged to retain
their traditional Vilani culture and way of life, and in time
became an important part of Luriani society.

The Second Imperium made contact with the Sydites
in -2174, and even set up a small trade mission on
Sopater, as the Sydites then named their homeworld.
The Sydites were able to purchase a few examples
of jump-1 technology and over the next few years


established a number of colonies. However, they could
not maintain this technology without outside help and
as the Ramshackle Empire disintegrated, the Sydites
vanished from the cosmic stage.


Meanwhile, the Hivers had met the K’Kree. Contact
came in -2045, and the aggressive K’Kree quickly
occupied several Hiver worlds. The resulting war lasted
from -2029 to -2013, and saw the Hivers defeated at
every turn. The Hiver fleet was little more than a police
force and exploration service, and could not stand
against the K’Kree onslaught. Driven back deep into
their territory, the Hivers faced defeat. The story of how
they snatched victory from the jaws of defeat varies
depending upon who is telling it.


The K’Kree rarely speak of what made them surrender
to the Hivers but it is known they sterilised four worlds
that had been occupied by their ground forces, and
that these systems remain interdicted to this day. The
Hivers claim they showed the K’Kree evidence they had
manipulated the K’Kree inhabitants of those worlds into
becoming carnivores and threatened to do the same
to the rest of the K’Kree species. The Ithklur claim the
Hivers bluffed the K’Kree into believing this was the
case, merely taking advantage of some events that had
occurred involving Ithklur and K’Kree ground forces.


Whatever the truth, the K’Kree agreed to an armistice
that became a permanent treaty and the Hiver-K’Kree
war ended in -2013. The peace that has existed since
has been threatened many times but open war does
not seem desirable to either party. While there is
some debate about exactly how the Hivers defeated
their enemy, it is known that K’Kree philosophy was
somewhat amended at this time. The Law of Reason
remained in force but the fundamental principles
were overturned, resulting in a somewhat more
moderate K’Kree society. Many K’Kree still followed the
principles, however.


During the conquest of the First Imperium by the
Terrans, many groups sought to escape the rampant
militarism and social upheavals taking place. Colonist
groups set out to find a new home. Many went rimward,
or out to trailing or spinward, beyond the great powers
of Charted Space. The fates of many are unknown.
Those that settled in Gateway sector were eventually
recontacted after many decades of isolation.


## THE TWILIGHT

The Vilani Imperium was deep in decay when the
Terrans over-ran it. Opinions are divided as to whether
the Terrans hastened the fall of interstellar civilisation,

A History of the trailing Frontier





or granted it a new (if short) lease of life. Whichever is
true, the Solomani rulers of the Second Imperium, as the
Terrans now styled themselves, were unable to prevent
the slow disintegration of their empire. The collapse
was gradual and it is hard to place an exact moment at
which the Rule of Man reached the point of no return.
Historians normally cite the economic crisis of -1776 as
9PM, the point when night became inevitable.


Yet even as the Ramshackle Empire collapsed, colonists
forged out into the deeps of space, scattering across
Gateway, Crucis Margin and the Glimmerdrift Reaches.
Records are patchy at best but it is thought that in
Gateway, colonists reached as far as Tharver, Bremen
and Salur by -1700, and that by -1511 (confirmed as
the date of founding of the Carlton colony) established
trade routes existed across the sector. Groups settling in
Crucis Margin and Glimmerdrift Reaches sectors found a
variety of fortunes.


In Ley, refugees from the collapsing Rule of Man
created a nation-state based on Shanape, which
they named Matarishan. This state, the Matarishan
Federation, was founded in -1770. It survived for a
time but by -1550 no functional starships remained.
Without contact between its members, the Federation
effectively dissolved, although some traditions and
a feeling of affinity between the member populations
survived throughout the Long Night.


## THE LONG NIGHT

The period between the collapse of the Second
Imperium and the rise of the Third is generally referred
to as the Long Night. During this time, interstellar trade
and travel more or less ceased and many worlds slid
back into barbarism or died out completely. However,
the images of the Long Night as a vast period of
emptiness are incorrect. Taken as an average across
Charted Space, the amount of interstellar travel was
virtually zero when compared to the Imperial period but
it did not cease entirely. Nor did night fall instantly.


The twilight period saw the gradual decline of
interstellar civilisation, the dwindling of trade and the
collapse of interstellar government. During this period
of decline and increasing lawlessness, some small
interstellar polities clung on to their technology and
society. One such was the Sylean Federation, an
alliance of 30 worlds which remained a starfaring power
throughout the Long Night and eventually founded the
Third Imperium. Another was the Terran Mercantile
Community. A third was the Luriani Federation.


The Luriani (and their absorbed Vilani population)
gained a third population segment and a vital strategic
asset in the form of a Second Imperium fleet. As
it became obvious the Ramshackle Empire was
collapsing into darkness, the fleet assigned to protect
and pacify the Ley sector took a courageous decision.
Those ships that could be spared departed for various
regions of the collapsing Imperium with crewmembers

A History of the trailing Frontier


desperate to try to get home. Those who remained
(the vast majority) pledged their courage and lives to
continue the work of the Imperial Navy – defending
interstellar civilisation.

The Solomani fleet under Governor-General Martinez
traded base rights and protection for citizenship. In
so doing, they became the Verasti Dtareen, or Terran
Protectors. Thus was born the Luriani Protectorate. As
the people of Luriani cultural region struggled to stave
off the encroaching darkness, their Solomani protectors
defended the spaceways and made the survival of the
cluster possible. In time, they too were absorbed into
a culture that, while dominated by Luriani people and
Luriani values, was strengthened by the traditions and
talents of both the Vilani and Solomani people.

Other lights shone out or flickered in the darkness.
Several times minor powers made the leap to
starfaring status but most fell back and were forgotten.
The Long Night dragged on and on, gradually
extinguishing the few remaining beacons until the
Luriani became convinced they were alone in the
night... and their own glow was flickering. The last
handful of Verasti Dtareen vessels wore out by
-1183, and the Protectorate ceased to exist. The only
contact between the Luriani worlds was maintained by
migrating caravan ships. Effectively the situation was
as it had been before the coming of the Vilani.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the region that would become
the Trailing Frontier, other small interstellar states
survived and even grew. Throughout the Long Night,
a handful of states retained starflight and many more
rose for a brief period before falling back into the
darkness. The stories of these states are probably lost
forever, although archaeologists continue to search for
clues. One recurring legend speaks of an emergent
civilisation in the coreward end of Gateway shattered
and obliterated by an unknown catastrophe that seems
to have claimed several worlds at once.

THE PRE-DAWN YEARS
Isolated from much of human-occupied space by
astrography and distance, Gateway charted its
own path through the Long Night. As new states
rose and fell, some remained throughout the Long
Night, although they saw many changes during the
period. One of the states that remained in existence
in one form or another was Tharver, one of the
original colonies in the region. Tharver’s culture and
government survived, albeit with various upheavals,
right through the Long Night. In the final years before
the Dawn, Tharver was in a period of growth.


This period is often referred to as the Corporate Sector
Wars, as the various Tharver-based corporations
skirmished and occasionally fought pitched battles in
space or on the surface of their various commercial
colonies. The wars sputtered and sparked from about
-150 to 70 Imperial, although they did not stop the
corporations of Tharver from expanding into new
territories, bringing trade, industry and ultimately
civilisation to worlds increasingly far out from the
homeworld. Some projects undertaken by these
corporations were impressive, such as the creation
of an artificial worldlet in the system now known as
Gateway. Gateway Station (now called Gateway Prime)
remains an important trade hub to this day.


In -200, a vessel belonging to the Tharver-based
corporation Galastrian Metals made what is thought
to be the first human contact with the K’Kree of the
Two Thousand Worlds. Initial excitement at the trade
possibilities now opening up became disappointment
and in some quarters dismay, as the nature of the K’Kree

- and their lack of interest in trade – became apparent.


In Ley, the Matarishan Federation was recreated in -27,
when dissident Syleans, heading out into the unknown
to escape the changes sweeping through the Sylean
Federation, made contact with the former worlds of
the Matarishan Federation. The Federation gradually
regained jump capability and began to re-unite its
people, only to be caught between the Luriani and the
Sydymic Empire. Worlds changed hands between these
three powers for centuries, until Imperial annexation of
the region imposed an external settlement.

THE COMING OF THE THIRD IMPERIUM
The Third Imperium was founded in what is now known
as Year 0 but its forerunner, the Sylean Federation,
had been sending out long-range exploration and trade
missions for at least 20 years before. Those missions
increased in range and capability as the Federation
became the Imperium and found its feet. Although
expansion of the Imperial border was fairly slow – one
to three parsecs per year was typical at that time –
the influence of the new Imperium and its powerful
commercial entities was felt far beyond its borders.


Some clusters and individual worlds readily became
Imperial client states. Some particularly important
systems were forcibly annexed as outposts until
the border reached them. Some worlds opposed
the Imperium and fought its expansion as alliances
or alone. For these and other reasons, The Trailing

A History of the trailing Frontier





Frontier was not the scene of rapid Imperial expansion.
However, the effects of the Imperial Restoration (since
the Third Imperium claims direct lineage from the First
and Second, it was restored rather than founded) were
profound. One of the most important events was the
chance meeting of a Luriani vessel and a Sylean long-
range scout. This occurred in -30 and had important
ramifications, although it was not until -16 that a Sylean
ship actually entered Luriani space.


News they were not alone galvanised the Luriani
people. Trade with the Sylean Federation led to more
formal agreements and even the establishment of a
Sylean Federation Scout Service base in Luriani space.
Concern was expressed in some quarters when the
Federation declared itself the successor of the First
and Second Imperium, and crowned its leader Cleon
Zhunastu as Emperor Cleon I. However, at that time
the fledgling Imperium was far away, connected only
by tenuous trade corridors through a wilderness of
space... and the Imperium was every bit as friendly as
the Federation had been.


The Second Luriani Protectorate was declared in -29,
and within 45 years it controlled a 5-parsec region
around Daramm. Contact was made with the various
polities in Gateway, although this was intermittent
and little meaningful trade took place. Indeed,
Gateway was sliding into something of an economic
depression, which really began to bite around year

50. Even contact with the young Imperium, which
for Tharver came in Year 64, did little to improve the
situation. Imperial resources were at that time greatly
stretched and expansion into an apparently poor and
non-threatening region of space were placed very low
on the list of priorities.


## IMPERIAL EXPANSION

Naturally, the Third Imperium did expand, its borders
creeping out at a couple of parsecs a year. Most
regions were assimilated bloodlessly through a
combination of diplomacy, economic pressure and
a reputation for fair and honourable conduct. Some
worlds were eager to accept the protection of the
Imperial Navy but others resisted. This period of
often-forcible expansion is collectively known as the
Pacification Campaigns and is generally considered to
have taken place in the period 76–120.


The Third Imperium was involved in a number of naval,
ground and peacekeeping campaigns at any given time
in its early expansion. One of the most notable was
the Arnaki Rebellion of 91–99, which drained Imperial


resources considerably. During this time, tension
between the Second Luriani Protectorate and the Third
Imperium increased. Negotiations broke down and the
Imperial Archduke Ishargi, assigned to oversee the
region, decided to strengthen his hand with a show of
force. Leading a considerable fleet, Archduke Ishargi
began a flag-showing tour through the region, intending
to deliberately flout Luriani sovereignty to underscore
his vast advantage in terms of strength.


However, in one of those flukes of history, the bulk
of the Protectorate fleet was conducting exercises
in the Rurur system when Ishargi’s force arrived.
The resulting battle was a resounding defeat for the
Imperials and Archduke Ishargi was killed aboard
his flagship. This sparked the Luriani War of 93–96.
At first the Imperials, distracted by the Arnaki
Rebellion and the minor insurrections it inspired
were unable to make much headway against the
talented Luriani crews. However, in time the scales
tipped increasingly in favour of the Imperials and in
96 the Protectorate surrendered, accepting Imperial
annexation without condition.


Incorporation of the Protectorate into the Imperium
was not completed for another century. For no sooner
had the Imperials broken Luriani resistance than they
were sent to engage other foes; first the remnants of
the Arnaki Rebellion and later a new empire deemed
to pose a threat to the expanding Imperium. In the far
rimward-trailing region of Ley lay the Sydymic Empire,
a powerful interstellar state ruled by another minor
human race. This was the empire of the Sydites,
who had slowly and painfully climbed back onto the
interstellar stage after rediscovering jump drive in the
last years of the Long Night and now ruled parts of
four subsectors.


Skirmishes between Imperial ships and Sydite vessels
had taken place since 73 but with the Luriani blocking
Imperial expansion, it was not until about 100 that real
conflict began. The next 20 years saw a series of small
but bitter fleet clashes along the Sydite borders. The
Sydites proved to be unimaginative but very determined
fighters; their inferior technology compensated for by
the fact that the Imperials were operating at the end of
long lines of communications.

When the Pacification Campaigns officially ended,
the Imperials had made no real headway against the
Sydites. Unwilling to go to the lengths required to
crush them, the Imperials simply drew back a little
and adopted a defensive stance, more or less ending
the conflict. This had the effect of further curtailing
Imperial movements towards Gateway, which was
A History of the trailing Frontier


still struggling although some very hard times. The
Imperials had been aware of the K’Kree for many
years and had even opened tentative communications
when the first official meeting of ambassadors took
place on Mneonon in the year 103.

## IMPERIAL CONSOLIDATION

The Third Imperium continued to expand, albeit at a
slower pace, after the Pacification Campaigns. This
created considerable tension in other regions and the
occasional war. Most notable among these was the
Julian War of 175–191, which is notable mainly for the
fact that it ended in an expensive stalemate.

One factor in the Imperial decision to seek a peace
was the destruction of the Fornast and Ley sector
naval depots by deep-raiding Julian fleets. These
fleets brought the war to Ley sector for a time and
significantly weakened the Imperial position in the
region. Nevertheless, the Luriani cluster was formally
absorbed into the Imperium in 200–220. After a long
period of negotiations, an acceptable settlement was
reached and formalised by the Treaty of Daramm. This
included the formation of a new Luriani Cultural Region
administration to oversee the integration which existed
from 202–217, and disbanded once its work was done.
The Luriani culture was absorbed into the Imperium
with little disruption.

Imperial expansion beyond the Luriani cluster has
been fairly slow since 220, although over the next
300 years the border gradually crept out. Several
worlds of the Sydymic Empire were annexed during
this period, mainly through economic conquest.
Crises elsewhere in the Imperium – and the periods
of reconstruction after each – tempered the Imperial
inclination to annex the Sydymic Empire by force,
while on the Sydymic side fear of Imperial weapons
technology, coupled with internal divisions, prevented
any serious attempts at resistance.

Meanwhile in Gateway, the hard times finally resulted
in upheaval. Starting with Gateway Station, dozens
of worlds demanded independence from Tharver.
The War for Gateway Independence, which lasted
only a few months and took the form of a few minor
skirmishes, was the catalyst for these worlds to break
away. At this time, Gateway Station was converted from
an industrial base to a world in its own right, requiring
several projects of considerable ingenuity. In 252 the
world changed its name to simply Gateway (although it
is usually referred to as Gateway Prime to distinguish it
from the system that also carries its name) to reflect its
status as an independent world.


Gateway gradually became the hub of a number of
important trade routes among the independent worlds
and when a workers’ uprising on Tharver finally broke the
homeworld’s influence over the local region, Gateway
became the centre of a commercial entity known as
the Galian Trade League. The league at its largest
comprised around 80 worlds and although a rather loose
organisation it was extremely influential for many years.
The worlds which today comprise the Galian Federation,
Trindel Confederacy and the Plavian league were all
members of the Trade League in the past.


## UPHEAVAL IN GATEWAY

Although Imperial influence in Gateway was minimal
in the years leading up to the Imperial Civil war, all
was not calm and peaceful there. A workers’ revolt
on Barclaron which spread to other corporate worlds
created the Collective in 320 and 425 saw the rise
of the Hochiken Republic along the coreward border
of the sector. Despite being established by another
workers’ revolt, the Republic was a democratic
moderate state until a second rising in 590 placed
a military government in power. Now known as the
Hochiken Peoples’ Assembly, the HPA is repressive
police state wracked by suspicion and paranoia.


The pirate bands of Gateway, many of whom had
their origins in the privateer groups of the Corporate
Sector Wars, established several pirate haven
states at this time, some of which became legitimate
governments, their pirate vessels the basis of a
real navy. Most either threw out their overlords or
remained havens for the raiders.


## THE SYDYMIC WAR

In 604 the Third Imperium was plunged into a civil war
which raged for 18 years. As the fleets were pulled
from the frontiers to fight for various claimants to
the Iridium Throne, the Sydites saw their chance to
regain their lost territory and perhaps even gain some
additional systems.


Initial clashes went heavily in favour of the Sydites, who
rapidly drove the weakened Imperial fleets out of the
Frontier Worlds subsector. Captured Imperial technology
was pressed into service and when in 640 the Imperial
fleets returned in force to the region, striking from bases
in the Ley and Glimmerdrift Reaches Sectors, they found
they had a major fight on their hands.


Even with the captured Imperial systems, the Sydites
were overmatched. The Imperials had better and
more integrated technology, more ships and years of

A History of the trailing Frontier





fleet combat experience. The Sydites had only the
advantages of interior lines of communication and
their characteristic doggedness. In fact, the Sydites
were aware they could not win a campaign on purely
military terms. Their strategy was based around
forcing the Imperials to accept a peace treaty as
an alternative to immense bloodshed. It might have
worked at another time but after the horror of the Civil
War, the Imperium had little patience and was more
or less numbed to casualty figures. Every world of
the Sydite Empire was heavily fortified and most of
the Sydite ships stationed in important systems were
non-jump-capable vessels. Not only were these ships
more capable than starships of comparable size, but
they could also not retreat and seemed disinclined to
surrender. Once the system defences were broken,
orbital and ground weapons engaged the invading
Imperials and then the ground campaigns began.


As the Sydite leaders had hoped, the war proved to be
bloody and costly for the Imperials. The Sydymic troops,
with their strength and size advantage, were able to hold
their own against the highly trained Imperial marines.
The Imperium lost tens and hundreds of thousands of
troops for each world they fought for and gained but fight
and take them the Imperial forces did.


The Sydymic leaders were dumbfounded that the
Imperials would tolerate such staggering losses in each
campaign and still continue. No matter how high the
cost to the Imperium, they kept coming. The Sydites
watched as their new conquests slowly fell, then their
former colonies, and for the first time they witnessed
one of their core worlds fall to Imperial forces as
they finally broke through and regained control of the
Frontier Worlds subsector in 672.


The Sydymic Empire tried to sue for peace in 673,
only to lose two more worlds to the Imperium before
the Imperials finally accepted a temporary cease-fire.
The cease-fire continued for the better part of the
next year as the Empire squirmed and negotiated with
the Imperium, attempting to avoid the unconditional
surrender the Imperials were demanding. On the first
day of the new year following Holiday week in the
Imperium, the Imperials demonstrated they had again
lost patience with the Sydites. A massive Imperial
fleet arrived in the homeworld system of the Sydymic
Empire, Sopater, and began to deploy for a siege.
However, the siege was a ruse.


As the Sydites settled into a defensive routine,
the Imperials launched an all-or-nothing planetary
assault. Despite heavy resistance, the homeworld of


the Sydites and the Empire fell in less than a week.
When news began to break across the other worlds
of the Empire chaos ensued and the Sydymic Empire
unravelled. By the end of the year 675 the emperor
was dead, he and his extended family assassinated
by the Sydymic Fleet Admiral Asmocchek. As the
acting head of state, Asmocchek began earnestly
negotiating with the Imperials in an attempt to prevent
what he feared to be severe Imperial sanctions and
reprisals against his people.


It took less than a week for an agreement that
Asmocchek himself admitted was far more conciliatory
on the part of the Imperium than his people had a
right to expect after inflicting such heavy losses on
the Imperial forces. The Sydite homeworld would
remain under Imperial protection as a Client State,
along with some other Sydite colonies. All remaining,
uncaptured former worlds of the Empire were given
their independence and some were offered true Client
State status with the Imperium. Some chose to ally with
their former enemies and others took the opportunity to
take control of their own destinies but most core worlds
of the Empire chose to realign themselves into a trade
confederation rather than have anything more to do
with the Imperials than necessary. This confederation
eventually developed into the Khuur League in 778.


THE POST-CIVIL WAR YEARS
After the Sydymic War, the Imperials undertook a
period of consolidation that lasted for three centuries.
Formal annexation of the Highlord subsector in 648 put
an end to the constant friction between the Matarishan
Federation and the Luriani, although the annexation
had to be rammed down the throats of the Federation
members. In the years that followed, resistance by
former Federation members flared up from time-to-time.
By 900, the majority of citizens had become content
with Imperial membership and use the Imperial name
Shanape for the old Federation capital Matarishan.
However, factions of the population do still resent the
annexation and a small but determined Matarishan
Freedom Movement continues to oppose the Imperium
by whatever means seem appropriate.

As the years passed, the Imperial border continued
to creep slowly outwards but at no great pace. The
region became a backwater, an area of little concern.
Some cynics suggest that this was a deliberate policy
intended to put off the day when the Imperial border
might butt up against that of the Hive Federation
or – far more seriously – the Two Thousand Worlds.
Whatever the reason, Imperial interest in the Gateway
region was lacking and the economy gradually
A History of the trailing Frontier



K’Kree leader L’lluii!pri’vguurlg

stagnated. By 990 the Ley sector economy was in
decline, strangled by the self-serving agendas of a
clique of major nobles and business leaders.

Gateway had its own troubles. The Viyard Alliance,
formed of nine worlds formerly part of the Galian trade
League, broke away in 750 and defeated Galian naval
forces sent to reclaim them. The Alliance was then
absorbed into the Collective, which became known as
the Viyard Concourse. One important factor in these
difficult years was the rise of lawlessness and piracy
in the sector. Interstellar trade became increasingly
risky and expensive, forcing some corporations out
of business and damaging others. The Galian Trade
League, based on interstellar commerce, suffered
badly. Despite the best efforts of the League to
destroy pirate bases and provide adequate security
for vessels and installations, almost the entire region
became what amounted to a pirate haven. Particularly
bold bands began raiding into Ley from about 850
onwards and it has been suggested the Solomani
Confederation backed and encouraged these groups.

Imperial response was sluggish and mainly defensive
in the form of escorts and anti-piracy sweeps. However,
the worsening situation did prompt several cross-border
raids. Some of the early ones were embarrassing
failures but eventually the Imperial Navy and Marines
made piracy within Imperial space or along its borders
a very dangerous occupation. However, the raids
had taken their toll and continued almost unabated in
Gateway. The Galian Trade League finally fragmented
under internal pressure, with the Galian war beginning
in 911. This war pitted the league against itself, as
rebel elements seized important installations and
fleet units threw in their lot with the various factions.
Trindel and Plaven declared independence in 912 and
915 respectively, creating their own small interstellar
polities as they did so. In fact, these worlds had been
independent for several years and remained League
members in name only.

As of 915, the Galian Trade League had ceased to
exist. Gateway remained an important commercial
centre throughout the war and commercial influence
was a driving force in the reorganisation of the League
remnants. The Galian League became the Galian
Federation in 925 and although much reduced in size,
actually became more prosperous.

The K’Kree remained a distant threat and
considerable influence in Gateway for many years
but in 874 a new and disturbing event took place.
A K’Kree leader named L’lluii!pri’vguurlg embraced
the discredited Fundamental Principles and began


advocating a return to the crusade of extermination
against the meat-eaters. This action led to friction
with the existing leadership and his followers being
expelled from the Two Thousand Worlds. In 885 they
founded Xuruk’xaar’keer!, known by humans as the
Xuruk Empire or Lords of Thunder, beyond the Two
Thousand Worlds and on the fringe of human space
where their militant attitudes made them a direct threat
to the non-vegetarian races of nearby space.


Within the Imperium, certain important events took
place which, although distant, had effects felt far and
wide. The Psionics Suppressions, beginning in 800,
were marked by a wave of anti-psionic feeling which
swept through the citizens of the Imperium. Psionic
Institutes across the Imperium were shut down and, in
some cases, their members arrested or even lynched.
A wave of psionic refugees swept across the border,
headed out of the Imperium and to whatever worlds or
states would have them.


## THE SOLOMANI RIM WAR

The outbreak of the Solomani Rim War in 990 threw
Gateway into turmoil. Increasing tensions with the
Solomani Confederation (far beyond the Gateway
region, to rimward) had already drawn off a proportion
of the Imperium’s naval strength, leading to a small
rise in smuggling and piracy. For the Trailing Frontier,
the most important consequence was the exposure of
corruption within regional administration.

A History of the trailing Frontier





Archduke Nells, overseeing a relatively quiet region
which attracted little official attention, had allowed
an unacceptable level of cronyism and corruption to
arise in the higher levels of Ley’s economy. Imperial
contracts went to friends and allies rather than firms
better placed to provide goods at competitive prices.
In peacetime this might have gone unnoticed but with
the emperor touring the region to personally request
money and initiatives to strengthen the Imperial
fleets, Nells’ inability to deliver on his promises would
inevitably be noticed.


Accounts of what happened vary according to the
source but it seems that Imperial contracts were offered
on generous terms and Archduke Nells made sure
they went to his own followers. In addition to causing
a new wave of disaffection and resentment throughout
the sector, these contracts produced sub-standard
goods which were not delivered on time, if at all. New
classes of inexpensive combat craft were crashed into
production and delivered before their fundamental flaws
were discovered and vital weapons components never
went into production at all.


The resulting shambles resulted in the rise of a
consortium of less well-connected businesses and
leaders, led by one Marcus Aaron Erechs. It may be
that he promised too much but the emperor decided to
give him a chance. The title of Archduke of Gateway
Domain was stripped from Nells and passed to
Erechs, who plunged into the task of purging the
sector’s economy and delivering the necessary
contribution to the war effort.


Erechs undertook a number of radical reforms, starting
by declaring the Imperial Trade Cluster right at the edge
of the Imperium and moving the Domain capital there.
Money the regional economy did not have was poured
into entrepreneurial endeavours whilst the monopolies
of Nells’ sympathisers were smashed. The subsequent
years became known as The Great Free-For-All and
were characterised by boom, bust and general chaos.
The sector’s economy could not be fixed overnight but
trade figures did, on balance, improve considerably.


However, Erechs was riding a tiger. Many of those
benefiting from reckless levels of investment exceeded
their capabilities in order to grab as much as possible
before the bubble burst – or genuinely thought they
could control the situation. Some did succeed and
many of today’s major firms have their origins in the
Great Free-For-All – although not always under their


original ownership. Erechs’ enemies also benefited
from the same investment and inevitably the blame for
every failed venture was placed at his door.


As the Solomani Rim War raged on, Gateway Domain
became an increasingly troubled region. On the
one hand, business was booming and there were
opportunities for all. On the other, the political situation
was in chaos and with increasing numbers of navy
ships being drawn off to fight the war, piracy and
commerce raiding by long-distance Solomani raiders
was on the rise. Agents and agitators attempted to
spark rebellion and insurrection on dozens of worlds.


Although the Solomani Rim War did not directly affect
Ley, agitation and occasional raiding added to the
general turmoil. By the time the war ended in 1002, a
large proportion of the Imperial Navy strength assigned
to the sector had been drawn off and huge amounts
of money and materiel intended for use in Ley had
been redirected. Obsolescent warships replaced
front-line units and were themselves pulled away as
losses mounted. As a result, the Ley fleet was vastly
understrength and composed for the most part of weak
or obsolete vessels.


THE POST-WAR YEARS
The turbulence caused by internal politics and war did
not end when peace broke out. Indeed, for Ley this
was the beginning of almost a century of difficulties.
Boom-and-bust economics continued for many years
and Imperial money was not forthcoming. Not only
were the central coffers strained by the need to rebuild
after the extremely costly Solomani Rim War but the big
promises made by the new archduke now came back
to bite. He had asked for and been given the chance to
fix the corrupt economy and the emperor’s inclination
was to let him get on with it.


The Great Free-For-All is generally considered to
have ended in 1029, although conditions had been
steadily improving for some years before that. The
death of former Archduke Nells in 1021 and his
replacement as sector duke by a supporter of the
current archduke stabilised the internal politics of the
region, at the price of disaffection among the Luriani.
Overall, the outcome was a generally fairer system of
competition between businesses and the emergence
of many smaller corporations where previously a few
big players had dominated market sectors. Many new
firms and business groups now existed, along with
remnants of the old order, which in some cases still
possessed enormous assets.

A History of the trailing Frontier


The political and economic situation in Ley gradually
stabilised over the next 50 years, with programmes
to strengthen the Imperial Sector Fleet making slow
headway. The Gateway region was a low priority
for those controlling the Imperial Navy’s budget, in
particular very few new capital ships were assigned.
The debate raged for many years over whether the
available funds should be spent on warfighting assets
or smaller, lower-capability vessels better suited to
keeping the peace.

The peacekeeper faction argued that Ley – and
therefore the largely fictional Domain of Gateway –
faced no external threat. The Lords of Thunder were
a source of worry but they were far off. Someday the
domain would need a major fleet to deter or meet
an attack but in the meantime it needed security
and stability. Battleships were no use if raiders and
pirates were interdicting the trade lanes. In addition,
the stability created by a good security force would
increase prosperity which would ultimately pay for
the capital ships. This was a pretty good argument,
although the warfighters pointed to the distant K’Kree
and shook their heads.

In reality, there was only one way forward. Warship
money went into patrol and security ships for the most
part, with plans to build capital vessels endlessly
deferred. One result is the Ley Sector Fleet of the
Imperial Navy today has a different composition to the
standard model; another was a series of controversies
which contributed to the fall of the archduke in 1076.

Imperial attention was almost entirely absent from
Gateway during these years, although some trading
corporations maintained regular links. These became
effectively mercantile ambassadors to the worlds and
states of Gateway. Their position has never been
formally ratified but provides a useful conduit for
back-channels diplomacy. Since around 1040, the
Galian Federation has been pursuing closer links
with the Imperium, albeit in a haphazard manner.
The first Imperial Trade Missions were set up in the
Galian Federation in 1048 and two decades later
a genuine discussion about Imperial basing rights
began. However, this eventually came to nothing. It
seems that trade is always welcome, especially high-
technology goods, but enthusiasm for political links
seems to wax and wane.


## THE PLUNGE

By 1060, it seemed the politico-economic situation in
Gateway Domain was under control. This, it turned out,
was an over-optimistic illusion. The period from the late
1050s through to the end of the 1080s is sometimes
referred to as The Plunge or The Overdue Plunge.
Although the prognosis seemed good, there were
serious cracks under the surface. The old guard of
business owners and political figures who had suffered
in the economic reforms at the end of the previous
century had been replaced by new generations with
ambitions of rebuilding their fortunes. The result was
the emergence of the Ley Sector Commercial Alliance,
which included some formerly big names and a few
new faces. Conspicuously absent from it were the
Luriani, who had been gradually edged out as a result
of their opposition to Archduke Erechs.


The LSCA was more unified than the rest of the
commercial sector and its members were willing to
help one another out. Notably, they were willing to
cause adverse economic circumstances in the short
term. This had the effect of forcing some mid-sized
independent firms out of business, whilst LSCA
members propped one another up. The intent was to
take advantage of the upturn when it came and in the
meantime clear the field of competition.


Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the LSCA’s
emergence coincided with a demand from the emperor
that the Archduke of Gateway start rebuilding a proper
navy. Funds were offered but on a contribution-
matching basis. A promise of lavish spending attracted
a big investment and the main construction yards
were expanded. Keels were laid down and everything
appeared to be going to plan. However, locally raised
funds were not available in time. The emperor’s money
went mostly on infrastructure, refurbishing yards that
had been largely idle for decades and on a first round
of major warships. Subsequent builds were deferred,
orders reduced, and by 1065 the sector administration
had to admit they could not meet their commitments.


The programme was not a total failure. Money trickled
in and ships were commissioned but the new yards
stood empty much of the time. Rather than boosting the
local economies, the shipbuilders were forced into a
cycle of hire-and-fire which weakened confidence and
at times caused real disruption.


A second crisis struck in 1069, in the form of a huge
political and legal scandal surrounding the Imperial
Trade Missions in the Galian Federation. Some, or
perhaps all, had been allegedly dealing in restricted

A History of the trailing Frontier





goods such as high-technology manufacturing
equipment and military hardware. This sold for
excellent prices to the Galians, who sold it on for
even more. A flurry of lawsuits alleging regulations
were being flouted or business was being conducted
in an unfair manner provoked an investigation by the
Imperial Ministry of Justice. The inquiry found many
of the allegations were correct but also uncovered
an illegal arms conduit providing hardware to
groups aligned against the Lords of Thunder. Whilst
popular opinion was in favour of such a move, some
groups being armed were unsavoury or involved in
peripheral activities that might destabilise Gateway. In
addition, money intended to support warship building
programmes was being funnelled into these projects.


At the same time, a series of social and political
problems was coming to a head. The Luriani
were increasingly disaffected and – rightfully – felt
themselves to be victims of a generally negative policy
on the part of the sector and domain administration.
Skilled workers across the sector were suffering
upheaval as they moved to take up lucrative contracts
in the supposedly expanding shipbuilding industry
then found themselves out of a job and far from home.
This had a knock-on effect throughout the industries
that fed the shipbuilders – everything from mining
and heavy industry to precision engineering. When
the archduke was found to have diverted shipbuilding
money, support collapsed and a wave of unrest
spread across the sector.


## THE RECOVERY

In 1076, the archduke was removed from office and
replaced by Count Brandon Minomoru of Daramm,
a Verasti Dtareen who had steadfastly championed


the Luriani cause. His reception was lukewarm in
many areas but a policy of fair dealing and the subtle
injection of Imperial money in the form of long-term
loans gradually smoothed the situation out. By 1090,
the Gateway Domain economy was stable and
expanding at a modest rate. Those who liked their
financial affairs to be a bit more exciting were directed
into the Gateway Sector Project, a broad programme
of private investment and local trans-border initiatives
with the twin goals of increasing Imperial influence in
the spinward end of Gateway and giving the hotheads
a playground away from the serious business of
rebuilding the Domain’s fortunes.


For the next decade and a half, Ley enjoyed a period
of stability and increasing prosperity, and the new
archduke has become extremely popular. However,
there are increasing fears that the Lords of Thunder
might advance rapidly across Gateway. Rumours
abound that their forces are massing for an invasion
of the Renkard union. A small but extremely noisy
minority is demanding the deployment of naval assets
to protect the Union – defending ourselves in someone
else’s yard – although this is blatantly impracticable for
multiple reasons. It is obviously only a matter of time
before the K’Kree establish themselves in Gateway and
begin pushing spinwards. No official position has been
put forward by the archduke.


Meanwhile, there is no sign of unity among the
polities of Gateway. In 1098, the Trindel Confederacy
and the Viyard Concourse fought a war over
possession of the world of Coralee. The Peace
of Farnoc which ended the war did not contain
an agreement on ownership of the world, which
remains under occupation by the Viyard Concourse.
Skirmishing continues between the Plavian League
and the Hochiken People’s Assembly and there are
those who believe outright war is long overdue.

A History of the trailing Frontier



The Trailing Frontier is generally considered to be,
politically speaking, two very different regions. It
might be more accurate to say it is multiple different
areas, one of which is much larger than the others
and contains sub-regions. Imperial citizens typically
use the simplistic Imperial and not-Imperial definition
whilst non-Imperials or those who travel around a lot
are more likely to acknowledge the greater variety.
Political reality has far more influence on local
conditions than species, although some species are
polities unto themselves.


Most sentient people in the region are humans of one
sort or another. Various sub-groups are represented,
some of which are native to the region and rarely
encountered elsewhere. Genetically engineered
human groups pose something of a quandary to those
seeking a simple and clear-cut description. Some are
interfertile with ‘mainstream’ humans and some are
not. Others are interfertile with some other engineered
human variants, or can breed with difficulty and a high
chance of defects.


The easiest way to cut through all of this scientific
confusion is to ignore it. Political and social groupings
are much easier to categorise and will generally
suffice for most purposes. This is particularly the case
when a social grouping includes members of various
human variant races. The grouping generally thought
of as the Luriani, for example, actually contains
people of Luriani, Terran and Vilani descent. What
matters to most outsiders are their cultural behaviour
and economic preferences rather than the details of
their gene sequences.


A number of non-human races of Terran origin are
also represented in the Trailing Frontier. These
include Dolphins and the Ursa, a race of genetically
uplifted bears. In some cases these non-humans
live in mixed communities with humans; in others
they are separate. One common mistake made
by Travellers is to assume that all members of a
particular species must belong to the same social
or political grouping. This is absolutely not the case.
There are Dolphins in the region who consider
themselves Luriani, others who belong to local
political groupings – mixed and all-Dolphin – who

## TRAVEL ZONES

The Travellers’ Aid Society, or TAS, uses a
system of codes to indicate danger to Travellers.
Most systems are considered green and have
no code assigned. These systems are by no
means entirely safe but the absence of a special
code indicates that no unusual hazards exist.
However, TAS has only a minor operation
outside the Imperium so codes cannot be relied
upon beyond the Imperial borders. A few worlds
do have codes assigned but many dangerous
localities do not. Travellers are advised to treat
any system outside the Imperium as green-to-
amber at least.


Amber Zones
TAS uses an Amber Zone to show that a world
is unusually dangerous. The reasons vary
considerably, from local war or unrest, through
harsh laws to dangerous animals or weather.
Travellers are advised to use caution when
visiting an Amber Zone.


Red Zones
Red Zones indicate worlds to which access is
denied or subject to very heavy restrictions.
Within the Imperium, Red Zones are interdicted
by the Navy or Scout service for safety, political
or cultural reasons. Beyond the Imperium,
Red Zones are worlds which TAS considers
extremely dangerous to visit. A Red designation
might also indicate local interdiction even if TAS
has no information on the world.


do not get along at all with Dolphins from other
groups. There are also various non-human, non-
Terran species present. These include the Droyne,
who have homeworlds all over Charted Space and
possibly beyond it and species local to the region.

## HUMANS IN THE TRAILING FRONTIER

The majority of humans in Gateway can trace their
ancestry back to colony missions launched during the
Rule of Man or the beginning of the Long Night. Even
those groups that retained or regained interstellar
travel would only encounter other Solomani. As a
result, the bloodlines of the humans in Gateway are
more or less pure Solomani. This has some political
significance, as certain groups in Solomani space
consider it their right and duty to assist in the affairs
of their distant cousins. This idea has little traction
in Gateway itself, however. The humans who settled
there went their own way a long time ago. They might
accept assistance from the Solomani Confederation if
it were offered but for the most part Gateway humans
would wonder why the Confederation would help them
and what strings were attached.

Similarly, the human populations in Gateway have
diverged from the culture of ‘Old Earth’. Vestiges
remain but hundreds of years in a new environment
have reshaped the values and traditions of the
settlers. As a general rule, society is cosmopolitan and
accepting of differences among humans and aliens,
although there are prejudices born of experience.
For example, most humans in the trailingward end of
Gateway are fearful of the K’Kree and worry in a vague
manner about the possibility of conflict. This translates
for the most part to wariness rather than hate but there
are some groups who have had bad experiences and
harbour enmity as a result.

It is not uncommon for mercenaries or idealistic
volunteers to fight against the Lords of Thunder.
Those that return spread first-hand tales of K’Kree
atrocities against meat-eaters. For their part, the Lords
of Thunder would say they are merely exterminating
vermin as is right, proper and natural. The result is a
mistrust and apprehension directed towards the K’Kree
which could be construed as being along racial lines
but which stems from demonstrated behaviour and
assumed intentions rather than blind prejudice.


Humans in Ley and the spinwardmost parts of Gateway
are generally of mixed blood. There are some more or
less pure Solomani populations and a smaller number
of pure Vilani but most humans are of what might be
termed Imperial stock. Their ancestry includes many
centuries of interbreeding between strands of Humaniti;
mainly the Solomani and Vilani but also smaller
subgroups and populations isolated for a time then
recontacted. This mixed ancestry does not preclude
cultural affinity for the old Solomani or Vilani cultures
and indeed there are planetary populations whose
culture is heavily based on one or the other even if the
bloodlines of the population are mixed.


Most human societies in the Trailing Frontier have
recognisable vestiges of the old Solomani or Vilani
cultures. For the most part Galanglic is spoken as the
main language or at least as a lingua franca among the
worlds and peoples of the region. However, dialects
and local cultures vary considerably. It is entirely
possible to encounter groups whose culture is clearly
related to that of an alien race, such as a civilisation of
humans that follow the K’Kree way of life or who have
been heavily influenced by Vargr culture. The opposite
is also possible; aliens who have a very Terran outlook
due to centuries of cultural pollution.


The Referee can use this cultural diversity to make
the worlds that Travellers visit unique and interesting;
it can also be used to create fascinating characters
and opportunities for Travellers to put their foot in it.
Cultures and societies should always make sense; that
is, they must be internally consistent – but that does not
mean they have to be comprehensible to an outsider.


A variety of cultures exist within Ley, although most
outsiders would consider the whole region to be
overwhelmingly Imperial-Standard other than within the
Luriani Cultural Region. Ley has the feel of an old or
internal Imperial region rather than a frontier for most
of its extent. As a Traveller reaches the outer trailing-
rimward corner this changes somewhat but for the
most part Ley might as well be deep in the Imperial
heartland. The K’Kree and even the polities of Gateway
are distant and of relatively low importance to the
average citizen of Ley.


Some variant human races are represented in the
Trailing Frontier. These include the Sydites, the Luriani
and the Jonkeereen.

People of the trailing Frontier




THE JONKEEREEN


The Jonkeereen are the product of genetic
manipulation carried out by the Third Imperium. The
experiment was a success, in that it created a species
of humans adapted to extremely arid environments
who could breed true. The first population was
introduced to Jonkeer in Deneb sector, where they
thrived. Since then, groups of Jonkeereen have been
seeded on a number of worlds including some in
the Trailing Frontier. This was not always popular;
Jonkeereen have rebelled on occasion against forced
transplantation or after being placed on a world, and
there is a small but vocal lobby group which demands
better treatment for their species.


On average, Jonkeereen are tall and slender with dark
skin. In addition to being able to shed heat effectively,
Jonkeereen retain water extremely well. This translates
to a need for only about 20% of the water required by
a standard human. Similarly, Jonkeereen digestion
is excellent at getting nutrition out of almost any kind
of food. Their eyes are protected by an additional
membrane which keeps out sand or dust and acts as
a UV filter. However, Jonkeereen are short-lived by the
standards of other humans, averaging 60–65 years.


There are official populations of Jonkeereen in the
Trailing Frontier, often dwelling alongside normal
humans and working in jobs requiring tolerance
of desert conditions. It is not known how many
Jonkeereen have quietly drifted away from the places
they were settled and created their own unofficial
communities. Their ability to survive in the harshest
of environments has at times enabled them to simply
walk away from the technological assistance it was
assumed they would come to rely upon. These fringe
populations for the most part just want to be left alone
but will trade with friendly starfarers or fight interlopers
if they have to. There are also rumours of mixed
victims of genetic engineering communities which
welcome those who feel they have been wronged. In
such places it is possible to find uplifted apes, ursa
and other people engineered from animal species as
well as modified humans such as Sydites, Luriani and
Jonkeereen. Curiously, Vargr tend not to gravitate to
such communities. The reasons for this are not known,
and asking a Vargr will get only a puzzled look and an
inquiry as to why someone would think they identified
with misfits rather than their own kind.

THE LURIANI


The Luriani are easily categorised as humans
genetically adapted for an aquatic environment. As
soon as inspection moves past this simplistic point,
the situation becomes a lot more complex. The Luriani
can mean one of two things; either people who are
generically Luriani or members of the Luriani culture.
The latter is actually made up of genetic Luriani plus
humans of both Solomani and Vilani descent who were
absorbed into their culture. Physical information relates
to the Luriani race; social data applies, with some
variation, to all people within the Luriani culture.


The Luriani were modified by the Ancients to suit
a water world. They have webbed hands and feet,
and layers of fat to retain heat in cold water. Luriani
also have a greater volume of blood than a human of
equivalent mass and can regulate their blood supply.
This enables a Luriani to reduce blood flow to less vital
organs, permitting longer underwater action and even
survival in an airless environment for 20–30 minutes.
Luriani are considered almost capable of breeding with
other humans. Without scientific assistance the chance
of a child is very low but it has been known. Even with
assistance, it is difficult, although partnerships of a
genetic Luriani and a non-Luriani are quite common.
Social convention allows for relationships outside the
partnership subject to certain rules and it is considered
very impolite to wonder how a particular couple
produced their children.


## JONKEEREEN

Characteristics
Jonkeereen Travellers have the following
modifiers to their characteristics: END +2.


Traits
Jonkeereen Travellers all possess the following traits.


Desert Survival: Jonkeereen can breathe most
tainted atmospheres without a mask due to their
engineered ability to filter out or tolerate most
impurities. They gain DM+3 to all Survival checks
in a desert or similar hot environment. This DM can
also be applied at the Referee’s discretion to tasks
that would be impaired by desert conditions such as
dust or light with a strong UV component, offsetting
the difficulties imposed by such conditions.

People of the trailing Frontier


Luriani are extremely emotional people. Although
society is extremely polite, outbursts and displays of
affection are the norm. Friendships are tactile, with
hugs and kisses – and an amount of snuggling-up and
casual non-sexual touching that can make outsiders
uncomfortable – an essential part of social interaction.
Flouncing out as a way of ending an argument is
something of an art form. This makes many observers
believe the Luriani as individuals and as a society
are unstable but this is far from the truth. Expressing
emotions is healthy, and allows others to accurately
gauge the seriousness of the situation. At least, those
who understand the Luriani can do so. Those who ‘get
it’ have a chance to take appropriate action but those
who do not may be alarmed and escalate the situation
instead of bringing it under control.


About 35% of Luriani society are not genetically
Luriani but humans of either Solomani or Vilani
descent. These joined the Luriani at different periods
of history, making themselves useful and therefore
welcome. Those of Terran descent are known as
Verasti Dtareen. They tend to have a very Luriani
personality and temperament, and make up a
disproportionate percentage of Luriani military and
naval forces. Those originally of Vilani descent
are known as Mmarislusant. They tend to be less
emotional than other segments of society and retain
many of the trappings of traditional Vilani society.
However, where the Luriani have a deep mistrust of
anything Vilani – for very good historical reasons – the
Mmarislusant are a trusted part of Luriani culture.

THE SYDITES


The Sydites are one of the most divergent of all
the human sub-species. They show clear signs of
genetic engineering, being very large (2.5 metres tall
on average) and possessing four arms. Sydites are
unimaginative and not great thinkers, although they
cannot really be described as stupid – they did manage
to reach the stars and create a lasting empire, after
all. However, the strangeness of the Sydite body form,
plus their slab-like, ugly features, causes many humans
to dismiss them as lumbering brutes. Sydites cannot
interbreed with other human species or subspecies, as
their genetic makeup is very different.


The Sydites were modified by the Ancients as workers
or perhaps expendable warriors. The project does
not appear to have been a great success, however.
Although the Sydites can breed true and even created
a modestly powerful interstellar state, their physiology
is rather awkward. The upper pair of arms is larger
and more muscular and can apply greater force, whilst
the lower ones are intended for fine work. However,
the muscle groups that operate both sets are
interlinked. As a result, it is hard for a Sydite to make
movements or apply strength with the lower arms
without moving the upper ones as well. Sydites have
a characteristic ‘fold the lower’ gesture whereby they
lock their lower arms in place, gripping one another
across the torso, whilst they undertake fine work
with their upper hands. The same gesture is used
symbolically before embarking on any task requiring
concentration or thought.


Small enclaves of Sydites have been founded
throughout the region but for the most part they
are confined to a region around their homeworld
of Sopater (which is called Khuur by everyone but
Sydites). This was once the capital of a considerable


## LURIANI

Characteristics
Luriani Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics: DEX +1, END +1,
SOC -2


Traits
All Luriani Travellers have the Histrionics trait.
Genetically Luriani have the Aquatic Adaptation trait.


Aquatic Adaptation: Trueborn Luriani can
dive to a depth of 500 metres (assuming normal
atmospheric pressure) without artificial aids and
can survive without breathing for up to an hour.
This becomes increasingly unpleasant after 20
minutes or so, however. They gain DM+2 on all
Survival checks made in an aquatic environment
and DM+2 on all checks involving swimming or
underwater activity.


Histrionics: Members of Luriani culture (even
Mmarislusant, to a lesser degree) are prone to
displays of emotion and sudden outbursts. Any
time a Luriani wants to conceal their feelings,
DM-2 applies to any Persuade or similar checks.
DM+2 applies to any situation where the Luriani
wants to draw attention to themselves. This does
not make them more persuasive, only more
noticeable. For example, a Luriani actor could
steal the scene with a sudden outpouring of
emotion but that does not mean their portrayal of
King Lear will impress critics.

People of the trailing Frontier





interstellar empire destroyed by the Third Imperium.
It was replaced by a trade federation known as the
Khuur League.


Sydite Society
The Sydites were never intended to think for themselves
all that much. They were to be workers, not leaders, and
suffered badly after being abandoned by their Ancient
creators. This had the effect of naturally selecting for
superior intelligence and leadership ability – as far as
the Sydites possessed these traits – and kickstarted
a gradual increase in intellectual capability which has
never really stopped. In short, the Sydites are becoming
smarter – albeit at an extremely slow rate.


Organisational structures tend to be personal rather
than formal. A Sydite who is a good leader will attract
followers and may in turn pledge support to a higher
leader. Superficially, Sydite society has a lot in common
with the Vargr. However, loyalty runs deep among


## SYDITES

Characteristics
Sydites Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics: STR +2, END +2,
DEX -2, INT -3, EDU -3.


In addition, when working with the upper limbs
a Sydite’s STR gains +2. When undertaking
fine work with the lower limbs, DEX gains +2,
offsetting their DEX penalty.


Traits
Sydites have the Resilient trait and most have the
Plodding Along trait. Travellers will not have this
trait, at the Referee’s discretion, and nor will those
in a leadership position.


Plodding Along: Sydites are unimaginative and
slow to work through the process of figuring out
that ‘something needs to be done... I know what
it is!’. As a result, they are likely to just go about
their obvious tasks at the expense of anything
requiring organisation or leadership. Any Sydite
nearby will realise the fire has to be put out and
try to do it but organising an effective team is
beyond the capabilities of most. Sydites with this
trait suffer DM-4 on Leadership or Tactics checks.
Conversely, they will often stick at a task long
after others would have quit – simply because
they lack the initiative to give up. In a situation
where a Sydite is plugging away at a necessary
task, DM+4 applies to checks to see if they avoid
becoming demoralised or discouraged. This
includes morale checks in combat.


Resilient: Sydites are big, with large and
powerful muscles. This makes them more
resistant to harm than most human-type
species. Sydites are considered to have one
point of natural armour (Protection +1) which
applies against most physical damage. They
are particularly resistant to electric shocks, heat
and cold, and gain DM+2 on checks to avoid or
reduce damage from these sources. This can
be translated into an additional Protection +1
against attacks of this sort if appropriate.

People of the trailing Frontier


the Sydite people and support, once given, is rarely
withdrawn. Sydites will carry out a task they have
agreed to perform, to the death if necessary. They
are fatalistic about this – if their choices lead them to
disaster they will go to their doom with grim resignation.

It is probable this attitude goes all the way back to the
original abandonment. Those Sydites who could see
what needed to be done and could get others to work
with them were the literal saviours of their species. Even
today a ‘leader-doer’ is a figure of reverence and deep
respect as Sydites know these people hold the fate of
their species in their hands. This reverence may or may
not be extended to outsiders who hold high rank. The
Sydites cannot understand how merely being born to the
right family or having a lot of money somehow makes a
person admirable and someone who is not admirable is
not a leader. Outsiders must earn trust and respect by
their actions and few have ever done so.

All organisations and communities are built according
to this groups of groups model but it manifests itself
in different ways depending on local conditions. Large
communities or organisations can come to resemble
the more formal versions used by other species but are
capable of breaking down into small teams at any time.
This makes Sydite society extremely resilient; so long
as there is someone capable of leading there are plenty
of followers willing to fatalistically get the job done, no
matter the odds.

NON-HUMAN RACES
Several species of sentient non-humans exist in the
Trailing Frontier. Some are native to worlds in the
region whilst others may have migrated or set up
enclaves. Others might be encountered visiting or
passing through on business.

THE AKEED

The Akeed are native to the world of Akeen in Gateway.
They rule a multi-world state called the Akeena Union,
in which many humans live happily as partners of
the Akeed. Humans often describe Akeed as lovably
yucky and get along well with them. Akeed are highly
intelligent and sociable. Humans find their damp, slimy
appearance unpleasant at first, although their natural
smell is rather pleasing to most people. Their sharp wit
and irreverent sense of humour usually win over those
who interact with the Akeed for any length of time.

Akeed are very alien creatures, who derive
nourishment directly from the minerals found in soil
and water around them. Akeed physiology is thus


rather strange. The lower body is a boneless blob,
rather like the foot of a snail or slug, but rounder than
that of a snail. The upper body, containing the brain
and other important organs, bulges upward from the
centre of this foot. The upper body is also the base for
two pairs of tentacles on each side, which end in four
boneless fingers. The head of an Akeed is protected by
a cartilaginous case. The eyes are on the side, semi-
extended on short and broad stalk/protectors. Akeed
have no sense of smell or taste, nor a mouth as such,
although their breathing hole can make intelligible
sounds and – to the amazement of many observers –
Akeed are excellent singers.


Akeed feed by drawing up nutrients from the soil
through openings in the base of the foot. They can
propel themselves slowly through water by pulsing
the foot and much faster for short periods by drawing
in water and squirting it out under pressure. It is not
known whether Akeed can breathe water or they store
oxygen in their tissues but they can remain submerged
for long periods; how long is unknown to humans.

People of the trailing Frontier





Akeed stand about 75 centimetres high and can surge
on their foot to a stable height of about 1.25 metres,
and a little higher for short periods. They cannot move
while surging up, however. Movement is slow; 4m
per round. Akeed cannot traverse vertical faces but
can stick to a steep slope of up to 70° (so long as the
surface is smooth, such as a starship hull) and move
at 1m per round with no check necessary. The upper
body does have some sort of cartilaginous skeletal
structure, plus bands of erectile tissue that allow
the Akeed to bend and twist in any direction. While
amazingly flexible, this structure is rather light, making
them somewhat weak.


Little is known about the Akeed social or governmental
apparatus. Most visitors to their worlds interact with
humans, however it is thought that the Akeed have
underwater cities where millions or even billions reside
in some unusual but harmonious way. Akeed are
pleasant, social people who normally settle disputes


DEBATES AND MEDIATION
When two Akeed want to settle something they
debate for hours or days, sometimes while doing
other things or with breaks caused by necessary
activities. The tone of such a debate may be
irreverent, serious, offhand, intense or just plain
silly. What seems to matter most is the ability to
keep on dragging up vaguely related arguments
or quibbles without straying beyond a vague
and elastic limit of relevance. The Akeed that
first runs out of arguments or who first mentions
an argument that falls outside the bounds of
relevance, loses.


Akeed are also excellent mediators, although
their approach is a little unusual. Quite often,
an Akeed mediator will gather the envoys from
both parties together, then distract them with
jokes, puns, amusing little songs and sudden
interruptions or quibbles with the minutiae of their
language, until the envoys become obsessed
with reaching an agreement despite the
mediator. Some observers believe that the Akeed
are masters at drawing the best out of people
by subtle and rather bizarre means. Others are
of the opinion they are just having a joke at the
expense of the rest of the galaxy.


AKEED
Characteristics
Akeed Travellers have the following modifiers
applies to their characteristics: STR -2, END -2,
INT +1


Traits
Akeed Travellers all possess the following traits.


Akeed Debate: Akeed receive DM+2 on
all checks to argue a point or convince
someone they are right. This ability can be
creatively stretched to other situations, such
as confounding investigators questioning the
Akeed. Where two parties are trying to reach a
settlement mediated by an Akeed, DM+2 applies
to checks made with the intention of creating a
mutually fair and agreeable outcome.


Akeed Friendship: An Akeed may attempt to
form a close bond with a human or Vargr. Only
one attempt can be made on a given person
and only one at a time. The Akeed must interact
with the target for several (2D) hours, not
necessarily all in one go. At the end of this time,
the Akeed may make a Difficult (10+) Persuade
check. If the target is unwilling, their INT
modifier is applied to this check as a negative
DM. If successful, that person develops a bond
with the Akeed which will never be forgotten.
This is similar to a deep friendship but more
compulsive. The target will always miss his
Akeed friend when they are apart and cannot
bear to see the Akeed come to harm. Akeed
apparently feel a similar bond for their alien
friend and will be genuinely happiest in their
company. This translates to a blanket DM+1
to all checks which benefit the friend. If the
Traveller wants to act against them or let them
come to harm, they must make an Average (8+)
INT check to convince themselves this is the
correct course of action.

by means of long arguments that continue until
someone admits defeat. They rarely allow a situation
to deteriorate to the point of conflict and most actual
fighting done by the Union is undertaken by the human
population. While they argue among themselves in a

way that seems arbitrary and more dependent upon
staying power than on actually being right, Akeed
understand humans well enough to act as an effective
mediator in most circumstances and are sometimes
hired to help resolve disputes.

**THE CAPRY (REMNANTS)**

The Capry are native to the world now known as
Basternevis in Gateway. They are bipedal and
generally humanoid in appearance but covered
in soft feathers and possessing a prehensile tail.
This ends in a curious appendage which appears
to be a cluster of brightly coloured feathers of
unusual density. These feather-fingers can grip and
manipulate objects, although not strongly. The tail is
often used to pick up small items of food and bring
them to the individual’s mouth whilst they work with
their two conventional hands. Capry are smaller and
more lightly built than humans, typically standing
around 1.4–1.6 metres high.

The Capry have three biological sexes, each of
which is predisposed to a given mindset and physical
characteristics. Females tend to be dextrous and
technically minded, whilst big males are physically
robust and powerfully built for their size. Small males
are agile and smart but in an abstract, scientific manner
rather than the technical abilities of the females. These
are trends rather than certainties and Capry do not
seem to have any hard-and-fast rules about which sex
performs what sort of task.

Females require fertilisation by both male sexes in
order to conceive, after which they bear live young.
Families are typically complex groupings of pairs

- usually a female and one of the male types but
sometimes one of each male sex. Pairings of two
Capry of the same sex are almost unknown. A pairing
is usually a lifetime partnership but it is not the same
as a family. At least two pairs are needed for a family
and more typically three to five pairs of Capry form
a grouping. This is a solemn and important matter,
perhaps best considered as a marriage-of-married-
pairs. Recreational sex among members of a family
is commonplace but since a mating to produce
children requires three Capry, breeding is a more
deliberate business.

The complex family structure of the Capry played
a major part in their downfall. Possibly assisted by
human colonists, their society advanced rapidly to
gain a starfaring capability sometime during the late
Long Night period. Capry established colonies on a
few worlds but these grew slowly. Meanwhile, their


explosive industrial progress began to cause severe
damage to their homeworld. As food supplies were
increasingly destroyed, the Capry fought over what was
left. In so doing they further wrecked their world and
destroyed their ability to construct the starships which
might have permitted some to escape.


Today the Capry are extinct on their homeworld
and most of the colonies have failed. Two thousand
years have covered the ruins and craters where
cities once stood, although traces remain here
and there. The surviving population are scattered
on worlds across Gateway or in small enclaves at
starports. Their small population is still in decline
and may have already passed the threshold for
inevitable extinction. In the centuries left to them,
groups of Capry and the occasional individual make
the best life they can, sometimes serving aboard
starships bound for far-off places.

People of the trailing Frontier





Many Capry find the prospect of annihilation strangely
liberating; their species is doomed and there is nothing
they can do about it so they experience as much of
the cosmos as they are able without ties to homeworld
or pressure to have children. Ever since the Capry
were encountered by human explorers after the Long
Night they have been known as the Remnants, as their
general situation was obvious. Few know the full story,
however, including many Capry.

THE DROASHAV


Droashav are six-limbed pseudoreptilians found on
Trevannic in Gateway. It is likely the Droashav are not
native to Trevannic since there are no other six-limbed
creatures on the planet and no evidence to suggest
the Droashav evolved there. There are also folk tales
among the Droashav of how their ancestors wandered
among the stars. It is thus possible that other enclaves
of Droashav exist somewhere, possibly possessing
high technology and starships.


Droashav stand 1.5–2 metres tall on their hind limbs,
with two pairs of arms. Droashav feet are clawed and
can be used in close combat. Their greeny-brown hide
provides a measure of natural protection and Droashav
are generally tough and uncomplaining. The majority of
their population live as TL1 desert nomads, with a TL4
civilisation in the northern reaches of their planet. A few
enclaves of higher-tech Droashav also exist, often in
mixed communities with humans. It is not clear whether
the humans brought technology to Trevannic or if the

Traits
Capry Travellers all possess the following traits.


Liberating Fatalism: The knowledge their species
is doomed could cause an individual Capry to
despair but they have developed an incredible
ability to distract themselves from the prospect. A
Capry may choose three areas of special interest,
which can change over time, and gain DM+1 any
time they carry out a task benefiting from their
near-obsession with this area of interest. That
might be diplomatically smoothing over a dispute
with a loved one, building a model starship out of
matchsticks, programming the most perfect orbital-
mechanics model ever produced, or any other
appropriate activity at the Referee’s discretion.


Third Hand: All Capry can use their feather-
fingers for simple tasks like eating or opening
a door but they are not strong enough to wield
a weapon or support the Capry’s weight alone.
The third hand is an assistant for the other two
rather than a complexly functional appendage.
Whenever a Capry can benefit from having a third
hand to steady something or assist in a task – for
example by holding a component in place during a
delicate repair – DM+2 may be applied.

People of the trailing Frontier


Droashav somehow developed a small technological
base without distributing it. Droashav items tend to be
optimised for them rather than for humans, suggesting
at least some of their tech is homegrown or derived
from remnants of a fallen civilisation.

It is suspected by some scientists that the Droashav
might be related to the K’Kree in some way, since
they have a similar six-limbed physiology. Others
have gone as far as to suggest the Droashav are the
original G’naak thought to have been exterminated by
the K’Kree. If so, the Lords of Thunder would make it a
priority to find and destroy the last of their ancient foes.
How the Droashav escaped the genocidal campaign of
the K’Kree remains a mystery, with most proponents of
the theory suggesting generation ships of some kind.

THE FAAR

The Faar are native to Alphaaric in the Gateway sector.
They are, broadly speaking, humanoid but are clearly
not related to Humaniti in any way. Coming from a
high-gravity world, the Faar are squat blocks of muscle
and heavy bone who only rarely reach a height of 1.7
metres, 1.5 metres being the average for males and
females alike. They are otherwise humanoid but their
internal structure is subtly different. In particular, Faar
hips and shoulders are constructed differently to those
of humans. Faar have very pale skin and no body hair
of any kind, and their eyes are also very pale, usually
blue or green. They are warm-blooded, bear live young
and have two sexes.


The Faar have a high-technology society but are
content to remain on their homeworld. Individual
Faar do travel, for example to deal personally with a
business matter, but as a species they have no interest
in space or interstellar travel. Some, who claim to have
insider knowledge, say the Faar are deeply frightened
of something ‘out there’ and seek to hide on their world
rather than confront the terrifying mysteries of the
universe. Faar are not particularly talkative and away
from Alphaaric become even more close-mouthed and
single-minded about their business, as if they cannot
wait to get home.


Faar technology is greatly superior to most of that
available in Gateway. They trade electronics and
recreational technology with a few select groups,
mainly traders from the Galian Federation. They

never sell weapon systems or starship components.
Technology is generally geared towards supporting
a comfortable and pleasant lifestyle. Outsiders who
have visited Alphaaric claim the Faar are a hedonistic
people, with a great love of art, music and theatre, who
spend as much time as possible enjoying themselves.
They are said to work very efficiently to get work
done, so they can get on with the serious business of
enjoying life to the full.


The Alphaaric system is also home to a sizeable
human population, who live in an orbital city named
Faarview. Faarview orbits Mashan, the system’s
primary gas giant, rather than Farr itself. Although only
a short hop by interplanetary shuttle, most visitors do
not go to Alphaaric itself but meet with humans and
Faar representatives on Faarview.


UPLIFTED SPECIES
A number of species of Terran animal have been
uplifted to full sentience, mostly by Solomani scientists
during the Rule of Man. As the Rule of Man collapsed
into the Long Night, colonies founded with the
assistance of these species went their own way and
in some cases the uplifted species came to be the
dominant sentient species on a particular planet. In
other cases, the uplifted beings created their own
society away from humans, and occasionally truly
integrated civilisations were created.


While the uplifted species retain the physical
characteristics of their parent species, they now
breed true, and are generally as intelligent as any
human. Some social characteristics carry over from
the animal instincts of the uplifted species but for
the most part they have fully developed societies
adapted to their local conditions.


The Solomani are known to have also attempted genetic
manipulation of humans beyond what was necessary to
fit them to harsh environments. Reports of a gene war
between humans and some sort of ‘supermen’ persist,
although even within the Solomani Confederation little is
known about exactly what happened, outside of secret
government archives. It is thought the Solomani became
nervous of any species that could replace or supplant
humans in their normal environment – the so-called
‘supermen’, the Apes and the Ursa, among others – and
took steps to eradicate them. These efforts were not 100
percent successful in all cases. It can be assumed the
Rule of Man-era Solomani did not feel threatened by
Dolphins and Orca, since these species have become
quite widespread.

APES


The Solomani uplifted a number of species of
Terran ape to partial or full sentience. However, few
communities survived the Long Night and thus ape
colonies are very rare. Some may exist in a wild or
primitive state in undeveloped regions of some worlds.

DOLPHINS AND ORCA


Foremost among the uplifted animals were Terran
dolphins. A number of worlds still have large numbers
of dolphins living in their seas, sometimes integrated
with an aquatic or semi-aquatic human society.
Dolphins like most humans but tend to react badly to
Luriani. Most cannot explain why; they simply feel a
subconscious discomfort in the presence of Luriani
people. Luriani do not feel any such emotion, although


FAAR
Characteristics
Faar Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics:
STR+1, END+1, DEX-1.


Traits
Faar Travellers, who are rare, all possess the
following traits


Closed Book: Away from home, Faar are
taciturn and rather unfriendly. They are difficult
to read by non-Faar. Thus, all skills involving
understanding a Faar’s reactions or emotions,
including psionics, suffer DM-2.


Homesickness: A Faar who must spend any
time away from home, even at Faarview, is
prone to bouts of intense homesickness. Every
2D days they must make an Average (8+)
END check or fall into melancholy. This applies
a blanket DM-1 to all tasks not connected
with immediate danger or survival. The
homesickness lasts 1D days.

People of the trailing Frontier


some find dolphin voices incredibly irritating and their
sonar songs inane. Dolphins normally live in large
extended-family groups and are prone to wandering
around the seas of their homeworlds. They naturally
find it rather difficult to travel offworld, although
special travel tanks are available to those who have to
undertake a journey.

Solomani engineers also uplifted a large number of
Orca for much the same reasons as dolphins. Orca are
less friendly than dolphins and tend to live apart from
humans. They are in general not unwilling to co-operate
with land-dwelling creatures but neither do they have
much interest in developing relations with non-aquatic
beings. Orca get along as well with Luriani humans as
with any others – in other words, they are only distantly
courteous but have no natural antipathy.

URSA

Uplifted from the Terran brown bear, Ursa are
large and powerful but few in number. Adapted for
colonisation of high-gravity worlds, the Ursa have
a particularly unfortunate history. Feeling the Ursa
project was a dead end, the Solomani corporation
GenAssist closed down its operations and attempted
to terminate all specimens. Some Ursa escaped
and rescued many of their kind, but the slaughter of
around 80% of their species has left an indelible mark
upon the Ursa. Most just want to be left alone to live in
small communities in the countryside.

Ursa enclaves are ruled by family elders, who would
be considered quite young by humans. Ursa live
relatively brief lives; another tragedy resulting from
their unusual origins. Ursa seem rather stern and
intimidating to outsiders and they do not give their
trust lightly. However, once befriended they are loyal
and – perhaps surprisingly – jovial and fun-loving.
Perhaps as a reaction to the ease with which they can
deal out violence, Ursa are great craftsmen and love
to make fine things. They take great joy in jobs that let
them create something, which can range from farming
through carpentry to naval architecture, but they
intensely dislike to destroy anything.


URSA
Characteristics
Ursa Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics: STR +4, END +2


Traits
Ursa Travellers all possess the following traits.


Claws and Teeth: Ursa have powerful claws and
jaws, which they can use to fight if they must.
Claws deal 1D+3 damage in close combat but can
also be used to climb and grip, granting DM+2
on checks to negotiate natural surfaces. Ursa
also use their claws and teeth – with surprising
dexterity – as tools.


Sore Head: Ursa are prone to be angry at the
injustices their species has endured. In their
home communities this is offset by the warmth
of companionship and their innate sense of fun
but when interacting with humans Ursa tend to
be surly and ill-tempered at best. This translates
to DM-2 applied to all social interactions with
humans, except those who have become like
family to the Ursa.

VARGR


Technically, the Vargr are another uplifted species but
the engineering that turned them from Terran canines
into sentient beings took place millennia ago. Vargr
are by far the commonest non-human species in the
Third Imperium and they are reasonably common in
the coreward end of the Trailing Frontier. In Ley, very
few worlds have a predominantly Vargr population but
many human-populated worlds will have a significant
Vargr minority (1–10% of the population, typically).
Vargr may live separately in enclaves, or may be fully
integrated within local society. Further to rimward,
Vargr become less common.


Vargr in Gateway tend to have shorter, flatter snouts
than their cousins to coreward. Fur is predominantly
sandy or tawny. Pure black Vargr are rare anywhere


and in Gateway they are almost unheard-of. The Vargr
in Gateway have no overall political structure. They
are members of whatever society exists on their home
worlds and owe allegiance to their local and planetary
rulers with no considerations of species.


ARE WANDERERS A MAJOR RACE?
The commonly accepted facts about the
Wandering People are inaccurate or just plain
wrong. The Wanderers actually originated in
the Trailing Frontier. Like the Luriani they built
huge sublight vessels and sent them out to
explore and expand across the cosmos. These
distant communities survived the destruction
of the Wanderers’ homeworld by the Vilani
Imperium. It is widely believed the Vilani
found the Wanderers had developed a jump
drive superior to their own and eliminated the
Wanderers as a potential threat. If this were
true it would make the Wanderers a Major
Race but the reality is quite different.


Exactly what happened between the early
Vilani explorers and the Wandering People is
lost to history but it is now thought the Vilani
expeditionary force which met with disaster in
the region was launched in response to some
incident. It is likely a Vilani official overreacted
to an event or perhaps panicked upon finding
the Wanderers on multiple worlds. Perhaps this
is the origin of the myth that the Wanderers
invented the jump drive. Whatever the reason,
the Wanderers’ civilisation was exterminated in
a savage war.


A few survivors escaped, using jump drives
taken from disabled Vilani Imperium ships. They
eventually found others of their kind and taught
them how to build their own drives. It is not
known how many enclaves of the Wandering
People exist, or if any of the original sublight
worldships are still active, but a number of their
sublight super-vessels have been encountered in
Gateway and Ley.

People of the trailing Frontier


THE WANDERING PEOPLE

The name used by the Wandering People, or
Wanderers, for themselves is unpronounceable
by humans but is thought to translate as the usual
'thinking people' or 'us'. Humans have applied the
label Wanderer and the Wandering People do not
seem to care. Their insectoid origins are obvious and
the way their bodies are constructed results in a way
of moving that constantly surprises and seems wrong
to human observers. Their language is also rather
difficult to translate. As a result, most Wanderers that
interact with humans adopt a common human name
like Bob, Alice or Eneri rather than attempting to
translate their own.

The Wanderers are a mysterious people, who do not
discuss their society or religious beliefs (if they have
any) with outsiders. Thus, what is known about them is
mainly based upon observation and speculation, and
may be inaccurate. It is widely thought the Wandering
People entered the Gateway region around year 320
after crossing the Lesser Rift in their worldships. These
are gigantic non-jump-capable vessels, each home to
a large community of Wanderers. From the worldships,
jump-capable vessels range across the region, trading
and visiting various worlds. The Wanderers have set
up a number of small enclaves on various worlds, from
which they conduct trade. Humans are very rarely
invited into these enclaves.

Wanderer technology seems to be equivalent to
Imperial TL12, although few devices have been
examined by experts. The Wanderer way of doing
things is very different to the approach used by humans
and most other sentients. The exception is their jump
drive, which is clearly derived from the original Vilani
type. They do not trade their technology with anyone
and are rather secretive about it.

Wanderers are peaceable people who will fight in
self-defence but more normally respond to threats
with negotiation and/or a withdrawal. When they do
fight, their warriors are ferocious and not deterred by
casualties. It is thought the vast majority of Wanderers
have an overwhelming sense of community and
cannot bear to be isolated from their kin. However, a
small proportion seem to be quite happy to leave the
company of their fellows and to travel independently.
These individuals are referred to as rogue Wanderers.
Their motivations are largely unknown.

by observation and interpersonal skills such as
Persuade. Their apparently erratic movements can
also throw off attempts to aim, imposing DM-1 to
those unused to their physiology when attempting
to hit a Wanderer with a ranged weapon.

People of the trailing Frontier



The Third Imperium is subdivided into Domains, each
administered by an archduke. Domains are nominally
four sectors in size, although in some cases part of this
area lies outside the Imperial border. In such cases
the archduke only has control over Imperial territory
but is responsible for overseeing Imperial activities in
the rest of their area of interest. This is the case with
the Imperial Domain of Gateway. Only one sector,
and not all of that, is actually within the Imperium. The
remainder is defined as an area of archducal interest.


Ley sector is mostly Imperial territory and therefore
the direct responsibility of the archduke. The
trailing-rimward corner of the sector lies outside the
Imperial border but close enough that Imperial-based
companies are highly active there and security is a
major concern for the Imperial authorities. Gateway lies
entirely outside the Imperium, with Imperial influence
waning quickly away from the border. Similarly, the
Glimmerdrift Reaches has only a few Imperial worlds at
its coreward end, with a zone of economic and security
interest beyond. The extent of this zone depends on
political and commercial factors and can vary over time.


Glimmerdrift Reaches also includes a second group
of Imperial worlds but these lie on the other side of
the Delphi Rift. This makes it impossible to administer
these worlds from Ley. They are thus considered part of
the Domain of Sylea and administered from Delphi. The
remainder of Glimmerdrift Reaches, and all of Crucis
Margin, are technically part of the archduke’s area of
interest but are too far away to receive much attention.
Diplomatic missions and the occasional long-range
naval expedition represent the limit of official Imperial
involvement, although intelligence-gathering and
private commercial activity are ongoing.


THE IMPERIAL DOMAIN OF GATEWAY
It is probable that expansion into Gateway and
Glimmerdrift Reaches was expected when the Domain
was named, and projects aimed at pushing the borders
out a few parsecs have at times been mooted. However,
the Imperium reached its present borders in the region
about 300 years ago and while a few worlds have
applied to and joined the Imperium since, there has been
little deliberate expansion in the past three centuries.


Thus, while still a frontier, Gateway Domain is also a
settled area. There is some friction along the frontier
but for the most part the worlds and states close to
the Imperial border are used to their status as clients
or independent worlds. Relations are not always
cordial but understandings have been developed.
Cross-border trade and travel is common, and many
businesses operate on both sides of the border. Law
enforcement agencies usually co-operate, much
to the detriment of criminals seeking refuge on the
other side of the line.


THE LURIANI CRISIS
The Domain of Gateway is in some ways the least
attractive of the Imperial domains, although Sol has
a strong claim to this dubious honour. It is fair to say
that Gateway is not a proper domain in that most of
its nominal territory is outside the Imperial border and
thus not subject to the archduke’s rule. A part of the
Domain’s official territory is so difficult to reach due
to the Delphi Rift that it is administered elsewhere.
However, what there is of Gateway Domain gives the
archduke plenty to do.


The internal politics of the domain are complex, not
least due to the presence of the Luriani Cultural
Association. Once incorporated into the Imperium,
the Luriani were good citizens who made little trouble.
Despite a mistrust of all things Vilani, they were willing
to cooperate with Imperial initiatives and indeed at
times actively pushed projects forward despite minimal
benefits for themselves. Their loyalty was never in
doubt and it may be that some of the former archdukes
took the Luriani’s support for granted.


The rise to power of Archduke Brandon has its origins
in the troubled era just before and after the deposition
of Archduke Nells in favour of Marcus Aaron Erechs.
Nells, for all his cronyism and corruption, was a
Luriani and protected the interests of his people
alongside those of his business partners. When
he was replaced in 993, the domain gained a non-
Luriani archduke. As an outsider, Erechs did not really
understand how the Domain’s internal politics worked.
He simply assumed the Luriani would support him as
they had his predecessor, even as he embarked on
policies that alienated them.

# THE THIRD IMPERIUM


Moving the domain capital from Daramm to
Annapabar was seen as a slap in the face by many
Luriani, although they took comfort in the fact that
Nells was still duke of Ley Sector and based much
closer at Dukh. The chaos of the Great Free-For-
All and the enmity of the sector duke and archduke
created tensions across the domain, with the Luriani
unwilling to support archducal projects. Had Erechs
courted the Luriani he might have won them over
but his attention was elsewhere and their growing
disaffection went unnoticed.

The situation deteriorated further in 1021 upon the death
of former Archduke Nells. Archduke Erechs made his
own appointment of sector duke from among his loyal
supporters. This helped reduce the political infighting in
the domain, for a time, but was opposed by the Luriani.
Measures to curb their interference saw other nobles
replaced. Luriani influence in the sector and Domain was
greatly reduced, and their resentment grew.

By 1050, the worlds of the Luriani Cultural Association
were suffering a severe recession. Imperial contracts
almost always went elsewhere and as the Ley Sector
Commercial Alliance grew in stature its members
competed ever harder against Luriani companies.
Disaffection reached new heights in 1071 when
Archduke Stephen, grandson of Archduke Erechs,
disbanded the leadership of the Luriani Cultural
Association and replaced it with individuals loyal to
himself. Not one of them was a Luriani.

The response of the LCA was one of passive
disobedience supported by military preparations. The
LCA board did not refuse to accept their dismissal; they
simply ignored it and carried on with their duties. At
the same time, Luriani naval and military forces began
undertaking large-scale exercises. These forces were
one of the few multiworld militaries within the Imperium
and posed a significant threat if the LCA moved into
open rebellion. By 1074 it was apparent this was
going to happen sooner or later, so Archduke Stephen
attempted to have the Imperial Moot revoke the Treaty
of Daramm. This would make possession of armed
forces by the LCA illegal and was almost certainly a
precursor to a campaign of pacification in the region.

Civil war was averted by the intervention of the
emperor. Throughout the whole process Count
Brandon Minomoru of Daramm had been a tireless
advocate of the Luriani but also a voice for fairness
and reason. His appeal to the emperor brought about
a radical solution but one deemed preferable to war.
Archduke Stephen was deposed and replaced by
Count Brandon, along with a major realignment of


noble positions in Gateway Domain. Many of the
families that rose under the Erechs dynasty lost some
or all of their titles, whilst others were either won over
or given reasons to accept the new situation.


Since his installation in 1076, Archduke Brandon has
performed wonders of diplomacy, reintegrating the
Luriani into the Domain’s economy and social structure
with surprisingly little friction. The Luriani remain at
odds with the Ley Sector Commercial Alliance in terms
of competing for big contracts but their relationship is
one of business rivals rather than political opponents –
although the two come uncomfortably close at times.


Although he now dwells at the Domain capital at
Annapabar, Archduke Brandon retains strong links with
his homeworld of Daramm and visits when he can.
He is a strong advocate of Luriani culture and values,
bringing a different flavour to the archducal court than
his predecessors. He is extremely popular at present,
not just among the Luriani, for bringing stability to
the region and ushering in an era of steady growth in
contrast to the boom-and-bust of previous decades.


POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN
As with all Imperial territory, the worlds of Gateway
Domain are self-governing. Each planet provides for
its own defence as best it can, selects its own style
of government, and administers its own laws. Trade
agreements and other treaties between worlds are
permitted but no multi-world armed forces. Some
worlds do possess starfaring warships; these are
assigned to the Colonial Fleet that backs the Imperial
Navy when not employed on the business of the
owning world.


All member worlds are required to recognise Imperial
authority in some matters. All worlds are required
to recognise and uphold Imperial High Law, which
is a relatively small body of law dealing mainly with
sentients’ rights and freedom of trade within the
Imperium. Imperial agents have jurisdiction in matters
of High Law, although as a courtesy they usually work
with or through their local counterparts.


Each world has one or more Imperial Nobles
associated with it. These nobles are not usually
planetary rulers and in many cases, they are not even
native to their world. Their function is to represent
the world’s interests at various levels of Imperial
administration; in effect serving as liaison between
the planetary government and the emperor or his
archduke. Depending upon the status of a particular
world, its representing noble may be a knight, a
baronet, a baron or a marquis.







Several levels of Imperial representation exist. Groups
of 3–4 worlds have a count associated with them.
This powerful individual maintains a court where
representatives of the worlds in the group can interact.
Local problems are often dealt with at this level;
agreements reached or deals thrashed out by nobles
representing local worlds. Nobles from outside the cluster
represented by the count will often come to his (or her)
court to represent their interests to the group as a whole.


If a matter cannot be adequately settled at the court of
the local count, it can be taken to a higher court. Each
subsector is the responsibility of a duke, a very powerful
individual whose court is responsible for settling matters
occurring within the subsector, and is also a place where
representatives of worlds outside the subsector come to
deal with cross-subsector issues.


Above the subsector dukes is the sector duke, who has
his court at the sector capital. The situation in Gateway
Domain is unusual since the archduke governs only
one sector. This means the sector duke apparently
has the same area of responsibility as the archduke.
There are, however, some important differences. The
sector duke is responsible for the Imperial worlds
within Ley, whilst the archduke must consider Imperial
interests beyond the border. The usual arrangement
is for the duke to handle internal matters and the
archduke to provide light oversight whilst dealing with
wider concerns. This includes relations with the rest of
the Imperium as well as the states and worlds beyond
its borders. Much depends upon the personalities
involved; some archdukes and sector dukes have
made an excellent team; others seem to have elevated
treading on one another’s toes into an art form.


Notably, political direction of the Imperial armed
forces stationed within the sector is the responsibility
of the sector duke, whilst the archduke is concerned
with operations outside the sector. Neither directly
commands the assigned forces, which answer to
military officers through the proper chain of command.
Instead the nobles provide political direction and make
requests which the generals and admirals interpret as
they see fit. Both can make a lot of trouble for a senior
officer, so requests are generally granted to the best of
the force’s ability. When the duke and archduke are in
accord, matters generally run smoothly. When they are
not, the Imperial armed forces have to tread a difficult
path through a minefield of conflicting agendas.


Until 993, the ducal and archducal capitals were both
located on Dukh. The archducal capital was moved to
Annapabar in that year. This controversial move has


at times reduced friction and/or increased the time lag
inherent in setting up coordinated action. It has been
suggested – and dismissed as alarmist propaganda –
that the movement of the archducal capital to the very
fringe of Imperial territory was an indicator of intent to
expand the borders in the near future and also a major
security risk. Neither came to pass but one consequence
of the move is that matters that cannot be resolved at the
ducal level and have to be taken to the archduke’s court
require longer travel times than before.


Many worlds maintain a representative only at the next
highest court – usually that of the count associated
with the local cluster of worlds – although some have
a representative noble at each level, right up to the
Imperial court itself. The normal practice is to present
a case to the count, whose representative takes it
to the duke if needed. The duke will take it further
if necessary. This responsibility to represent lower
nobles, even in the case where the count or duke
disagrees with them over the matter at hand, is one of
the fundamentals of the Imperial system.


Many Imperial nobles are directly involved in
representation at various levels. Others have
different duties and represent corporations or other
organisations. There are also many nobles who hold
titles and even have holdings on particular worlds
but are not involved in representing them. These
individuals have other duties or may simply be
hereditary title-holders.


Whilst the Nobility will represent and act for a world,
they do not rule it and can do nothing more than
advise the world government of the situation and
the best course of action. Worlds rule themselves;
the Imperial government structure exists to facilitate
relations between the worlds and ensure that nobody
is shooting at the member worlds as they get on with
their business. However, worlds that ignore Imperial
High Law are corrected using any and all resources the
archduke can bring to bear. The Imperial Navy is the
usual means by which correction is applied; measures
range from economic sanctions enforced by Naval
vessels to planetary assault.


Imperial jurisdiction begins 100 diameters out from
a world. Beyond that limit, local forces have no
automatic jurisdiction, although there is a blanket
permission in place to secure, police and defend
the whole star system. Some ethically questionable
merchant ship captains think local naval assets
cannot stop and search them once they cross the
100-diameter line. This is not the case; local forces
in this situation are representing the Imperium rather




than their homeworld and it is not in the interests of
the Imperium that they be barred from enforcing local
laws. There are some interesting legal questions
about who gets custody of a smuggler apprehended
104 diameters out but the boarding and search that
apprehends them is entirely legal.

Some goods are illegal on certain worlds but not in
the wider Imperium. Carrying such goods through a
system whose mainworld has made them illegal is
protected under Imperial free-trade laws, although
how these are interpreted is one of those questions
that often ends up at the archduke’s court. Most
worlds accept a system whereby cargo that remains
aboard a ship, even one landed at a port where
the goods are illegal, is ignored unless it poses a
direct hazard. However, from time-to-time a local
government will try to suppress certain goods and
will make it an offence to enter its jurisdiction with
them. This is acceptable within Imperial law but only
enforceable within the 100-diameter jurisdiction limit.
Governments will sometimes try to push this issue and
some get away with it, at least for a while.

In the 10–100 diameter region, Imperial forces share
jurisdiction for most purposes and within 10 diameters,
a world government has complete jurisdiction, with
one exception. Starports, defined as the system’s
main port, are considered Imperial territory. They may
be owned and operated by the local government,
a corporate body, or any other suitable agency, but
the port itself is an area of Imperial jurisdiction. This
means that law level may be different from that of the
host world. Most ports have a standard law level of 3
but this is not carved in stone.

Starports are often (but not always) guarded by a
detachment of Imperial Marines, who also protect
diplomatic and bureaucratic staff assigned there.
Marines do not normally conduct law enforcement
however; portside security or Ministry of Justice
personnel are assigned to this task. A world may
have multiple spaceports. and there could be others
throughout the system, but unless multiple polities exist
there will only be one designated starport.

There is no unified Imperial Customs Service. Customs
inspections and contraband seizure is a task shared
by port operators, the Imperial Navy and local naval
forces, plus the Ministry of Justice. The Imperial
Navy trains personnel from all services in common
techniques but since there are many jurisdictions
in Imperial space the Navy only conducts searches
in deep space or upon suspicious vessels. Routine
customs work is a matter for local forces.

IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION


AND OTHER SERVICES
The Domain administration is backed up by a number
of official bodies. The most important, although the
last one to be considered by most people, is the
Imperial Bureaucracy.


THE IMPERIAL BUREAUCRACY
The Bureaucracy employs thousands of people across
the Domain, serving on the staff of various nobles,
at starports and in regional offices that deal with the
minutiae of government – census figures, taxation,
legal matters and so forth. Many of these people are
archetypical faceless bureaucrats living comfortable if
unexciting lives, collecting a good salary and benefits,
and just keeping the administrative apparatus moving
along. However, some bureaucrats have much
more exciting lives. Some are assigned to frontier or
backwater worlds and some belong to offices that see
a great many incidents. The Imperial Taxation Audit
Service, for example, has such an eventful career that
its members are sometimes jokingly referred to as
assault accountants.


The Ministry for Trade and Commerce (a sub-office of
the Bureaucracy) is also very important in the Trailing
Frontier. Its personnel are responsible for resolving
trade disputes and ensuring the quality of goods on
sale throughout the Imperium. MTC personnel also
include some Starport brokers, although most brokers
are freelancers. Beyond the Imperial border the
MTC maintains official trade missions which may be
wholly funded by the Imperial coffers or operated in
partnership with private enterprise.


THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
Alongside the Bureaucracy, the Diplomatic Service
tries to keep the peace between worlds and with non-
Imperial neighbours. Most personnel are advisors and
attaches but some belong to fire brigade squads who
are rushed in to defuse crises before they become more
serious. These individuals are sometimes exposed
to considerable danger and service in the Crisis
Management Office is a traditional role for nobles, or a
route into the nobility for talented commoners.


THE IMPERIAL COLONIAL OFFICE
The Imperial Colonial Office is responsible for
overseeing new colonies, as its name suggests. There
have been very few of these in the past few hundred
years and ICO is more concerned with investment
in developing worlds. Most of the money for these
projects comes from private sources, so ICO must often
act as liaison between investors and those receiving
the money. The Colonial Office vets investors carefully,
and monitors the uses investment money is put to.


THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
The Ministry of Justice has jurisdiction throughout
Imperial space where breaches of Imperial High
Law are concerned but is not permitted to intervene
in local affairs. However, significant grey areas and
shared jurisdictions do exist, allowing the MoJ to assist
local law enforcement personnel where appropriate.
If a criminal has broken only local laws and can get
offworld, they are normally safe unless they return to
the world where the crime was committed. However,
there are two cases where the MoJ may choose to
pursue the felon and return them.


The first case is when extradition is requested and the
MoJ feels that, although High Law has not been broken,
it is in the best interests of the Imperium to return the
criminal for trial. This happens when a felon is known
to have committed a number of crimes and moved on,
several times. Since it is highly likely the criminal will go
on offending on each new world, arrest is justified. The
second situation occurs when a wanted criminal reaches
a starport. Since starports are Imperial territory, they are
subject to Imperial rather than local law.


However, since many felons will use this loophole to
escape justice, then sit around comfortably waiting for
a ship offworld, the MoJ and other Imperial authorities
will sometimes make an arrest on behalf of the local
government and hand the felon over. Note the MoJ has
authority to make an on-behalf arrest only in Imperial
territory (at a starport or beyond the 100-diameter limit),
in areas of shared jurisdiction (between 10 and 100
diameters) or where co-operation has been granted to
or offered by local law enforcement. MoJ personnel can
make an arrest in regard to Imperial High Law almost
anywhere but when operating on-planet they are bound
by local laws except in certain, special, situations.


MoJ personnel provide security for Bureaucracy
personnel in some cases and occasionally provide
guards to other important installations or starships.
Some starports and frontier colonies have MoJ
personnel deployed to train local security, or actually
providing security and law enforcement. Uniformed
personnel are assigned the title of Marshal or Deputy,
while detectives and other non-uniformed personnel
are ranked as Agents.


THE IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE
The IISS has a number of important tasks in the
Trailing Frontier, none of which is strictly military.
Most importantly, Scout personnel man the x-boats
and x-boat tenders that carry information and news
along the main communication routes and the fleets of
couriers that spread the news wherever it needs to go,
off the major routes. Keeping the information flowing
is a full-time job for thousands of scouts and even so
some worlds only get news every week or two when
a free trader comes in from a port that gets a regular
courier service. On the main routes, a daily x-boat is
the minimal service, with some worlds (especially those
that lie on a junction of two or more routes) receiving
one as often as every 2–3 hours.


The Scout Service’s other two main offices, survey and
exploration, are both active in the region. Generally
speaking, exploration missions operate outside the
Imperial border, charting systems and exploring
worlds. Survey missions then follow up with a more
detailed survey of the area and also operate inside the
borders, cataloguing asteroids and other hazards to
navigation, updating planetary and astrographic charts,
and monitoring population and other demographic
figures. The Scout Service also has large numbers
of personnel assigned to its bases and way stations,
acting as advisors to colonial projects, and on detached
duty – in other words wandering about the region doing
whatever they like.


THE NOBILITY
In addition to their service as representatives of various
worlds and corporations, the Imperial Nobility has other
roles to play. Many nobles serve in the armed forces
or the diplomatic or bureaucratic services. Others have
no specific duties but are expected to act in the best
interests of the Imperium and its citizens at need. Most
of these non-assigned nobles are knights or baronets, as
higher rank usually brings with it greater responsibility.




Some nobles receive their titles in recognition of
service to entertainment or science; such people are
rarely suited to take charge of a situation and are not
expected to do so. However, hereditary nobles and
those ennobled for service in the field are normally
resourceful individuals, and are expected to use the
authority and influence their title brings to get what
needs to be done, done.

There is no legal requirement to obey the orders
of a noble during a crisis unless they have specific
authority such as over their own household but there is
an assumption of trust and leadership inherent with a
noble title; if a noble steps forward to lead, the majority
of people will instinctively follow. Not all nobles are
good people but most know their duty and will act as
they think best if the need arises.

THE IMPERIAL NAVY
The usual model for the Imperial Navy is a two-tier
system, in which the sector fleet fights wars and the
subsector fleets keep the peace. Larger and more
potent warfighting assets such as battleships and large
carriers – and their necessary supporting and escort
elements – are concentrated under the command
of the sector fleet, with smaller vessels assigned to
the subsector commands for patrol and commerce
protection duty. This setup reduces operating costs and
protects the fleet assets against defeat in detail if an
unexpected conflict arises.

Vessels and indeed whole squadrons can be passed
back and forth as needed. In times of war a subsector
fleet might be reinforced with capital ships for local
defence, or the sector fleet might borrow some escorts
for a mission. Vessels sent out over the Imperial border
are always under sector fleet command but this is a
convention rather than a regulation. In addition, forces
belong to a world government, corporation or noble but
are subject to mobilisation if necessary to form what is
anachronistically known as the Colonial Fleet. Moves
to replace this term with something more accurate
such as local reserve fleet have always been rejected.
Colonial vessels serving outside their home system will
usually be under subsector fleet command.

The Ley Sector Fleet follows this general model but
its makeup is different from most other sector fleets.
It is normal to allocate one fleet unit to a sector per
subsector it contains. A fleet unit has a nominal strength
of one BatRon (squadron of battleships or battleship-
equivalents) and one CruRon (squadron of cruiser
sized vessels), plus escorts and support vessels.
These are not dispersed in penny packets across the
sector, although sometimes a single capital ship might


be deployed as a guardship. Instead, the sector fleet
concentrates its warfighting assets at a few bases and
leaves routine security operations to the subsector fleet.


The subsector fleets of Ley are fairly conventional in
makeup. Most vessels are small escorts and patrol
ships, with a significant deployment of naval couriers
and auxiliaries which handle the Navy’s invisible
tasks. Subsector flagships are usually cruisers or an
equivalently sized carrier, with a few squadrons of
destroyers operating either individually or as part of a
task force. It is rare for a subsector fleet to have any
capital ships.


The sector fleet is identified by the sector’s name,
whereas the subsector fleets are numbered. It is
primarily responsible for dealing with major threats
and each sector fleet serves as a reserve for others.
Squadrons may be transferred to a trouble spot or
deployed out of sector. It is not uncommon for internal
sectors facing little threat to contribute a portion of
their sector fleet to a reserve force based a sector
or so back from a border with a major power. There
is no such border in Ley, although there is an open
frontier into Gateway and Glimmerdrift Reaches. With
no immediate threat requiring battleships, Ley is a low
priority area. It is supposed to have a standard force
but financial realities over the past century or so have
resulted in a different allocation of warships.


The sector fleet has a much smaller complement of
capital ships than usual. Some of these are brand-new,
built and paid for with money from the Imperium as a
whole rather than the Domain. The majority of the new
ships are technically on loan from other fleets or on
a temporary deployment to Ley before transferring to
their intended operator. These vessels, whilst welcome,
are a constant reminder that the emperor had to step
in to strengthen the sector fleet because the archduke
had failed to do so. Other capital ships are very old.
These were either built in the sector long ago or bought
cheaply when another fleet replaced them. These, too,
are something of an embarrassment.


Ley Sector Fleet has more cruisers and carriers
than the typical sector fleet. Some of these are
relatively cheap designs purchased to get enough
hulls out on the spaceways. It was intended they
would be replaced but instead they soldier on for lack
of anything better. A proportion of the cruiser and
carrier strength is modern and of effective designs,
including some vessels specifically designed to
operate on the far side of the Gateway choke point.
Despite pressure to build some proper battleships,
the current archduke maintains that cruisers are







the most effective means of securing the region. An
Imperial heavy cruiser is a match for the best ships
the polities of Gateway can muster.


There are those who constantly ask what the archduke
would do if the Lords of Thunder came charging across
Gateway sector instead of slowly expanding as they
have done up to now. The answer is that the archduke
would know about it months in advance thanks to an
extensive intelligence gathering network in Gateway
and forward-deployed warships. In the time taken for a
K’Kree fleet to cross Gateway, reinforcements from the
neighbouring sector fleets could mass to meet them.
There is no chance of a devastating surprise attack; the
real threat is the gradual establishment of K’Kree bases in
Gateway. The counter to that, according to the Archduke
of Gateway, is diplomacy backed by a force of cruisers.


Although the Ley Sector Fleet has a greater
complement of cruiser-class vessels than most similar
forces, destroyer-class vessels do most of the sector
fleet’s daily work. These range from cheap patrol
vessels through multirole destroyers and high-end
fleet units. They are backed up by a variety of corvette
classes which escort the larger ships of the sector fleet
and carry out most of the subsector fleet’s patrols.
Overall, this force is weak in terms of warfighting but
adequate for its security role and to project a little
power out into Gateway and Glimmerdrift Reaches.


THE IMPERIAL ARMY AND MARINES
The Imperial Army and Marine Corps are separate
commands. The Marines have their own starships,
most of which are support, transport and logistics
vessels plus a few escorts. Marines conduct space-
related operations including installation security and
boardings as well as spearheading assaults on hard
targets. The army is focused on longer-term campaigns
and large-scale battles against an organised enemy.
Thus whilst elements of the Marine Corps might be the
first into a warzone it is the army who slog it out and
deal with any insurgency that may emerge afterwards.


The army’s main warfighting units are concentrated at
their bases or permanently deployed to protect major
installations, with smaller formations scattered around
potential trouble spots or acting as a rapid-response
force. A significant proportion of units deployed in
Ley are relatively lightly equipped and trained for
Operations In Support of Peace. This means security
and counter-insurgency work combined with providing
local assistance in the aftermath of a conflict or
disaster. These units are often encountered on long-


term deployments or assisting a local government in
projects intended to stabilise an area. The engineering
component of such a force might be called upon to
build roads and bridges whilst combat units sweep the
surrounding countryside for insurgents.


THE IMPERIAL FORCES IN GATEWAY
The Imperium has no member worlds in Gateway
sector but maintains a forward deployment of army,
marine and naval assets at friendly worlds. Anti-piracy
sweeps into neutral space are a common task for the
navy, whilst ground combat formations mostly provide
training, support and security as requested. Operating
outside the frontier is always tricky and the Imperial
authorities generally tread lightly. Whilst a given
problem could be solved quickly with force this would
set back relations with others. Diplomacy, economic
pressure and displays of military capability are far
more common than direct intervention and when that is
required every effort is made to obtain local approval or
a suitable justification.


Although funds are short and enthusiasm is not great,
the hardening of Gateway has been an Imperial goal
since the K’Kree were first encountered. Ideally, the
Imperium wants control over the astrographic choke
point created by the end of the Lesser Rift, with all
worlds in the zone incorporated into the Imperium
and heavily fortified. Beyond this will be a zone of
friendly states which can resist a K’Kree advance with
Imperial support but – hopefully – without committing
the Imperium to direct war against the K’Kree. This
plan is practicable with sufficient effort but the internal
troubles of Gateway have always prevented much
progress being made.


The Imperium has no firm allies in Gateway but
maintains generally good relations with the Galian
Federation. Imperial ships are more likely to be
encountered in its territory than elsewhere and are
granted visiting friendly warship status at Galian naval
installations and most starports. A significant force of
small carriers, light cruisers and destroyers is routinely
deployed out of the Galian naval base at Tharver or an
ersatz forward operating base at Gateway, enabling
Imperial vessels to show the flag right across Gateway
sector – at least from time-to-time. This arrangement is
controversial and not liked by the Galian Federation’s
rivals but the Imperial position is that the Galians are the
rightful successors to the old Galian Trade League and
the breakaway states of Trindel and Viyard are somehow
less legitimate. Imperial interests would be furthered by a
reconstitution of the Trade League but no overt action to
this end has been taken by Imperial forces.




The Lords of Thunder, or Xuruk’xaar’keer! in their
native language, are a particularly militant – even by
K’Kree standards – polity built around exiles from the
Two Thousand Worlds. Ostensibly, their determination
to destroy all G’naak (meat-eaters, or vermin) is
so extreme that even the Steppelords of the Two
Thousand Worlds could not tolerate them. It is more
likely their exile was due to internal politics rather
than a moral objection to the stomping of vermin. The
extreme mindset of the Lords of Thunder appeals to
many K’Kree and it is entirely likely the Steppelords
feared losing support of their most militant followers.

Whatever the reason for their exile, the Lords of
Thunder have been advancing spinwards for two
centuries and have now established a frontier on
the border of Gateway. It is only a matter of time
before a new advance begins. For those in the way,
there are at most two options: death, or subjugation.
Conquered or surrendered populations are not
always spared; even those willing to convert to a
vegetarian lifestyle and accept K’Kree overlordship
might be exterminated if the Lords of Thunder
consider them a future threat – or sometimes just to
demonstrate a particular leader’s fanaticism.

The Lords of Thunder officially still owe allegiance to
the Grand Steppelord of the Two Thousand Worlds.
They will usually make a show of deference towards
ambassadors but in reality think they are the real
K’Kree society and everyone else has gone soft.
Perhaps the Lords of Thunder are as much a threat to
the Two Thousand Worlds as they are to the G’naak
states to spinward of their territory. The position of the
Two Thousand Worlds towards the Lords of Thunder
is something of a mystery. Perhaps they hope the
exiles will weaken themselves slaughtering G’naak
and cease to be a problem.

Most outsiders know little for certain about the Lords of
Thunder and there is considerable doubt as to whether
any given emissary is actually from the Two Thousand
Worlds or the Lords of Thunder. Representatives
routinely claim to speak for the main K’Kree society and
are quite happy to create an inflated impression of their
power in this manner. The waters are further muddied
by the fact the Lords of Thunder are not unified. They
are an association or alliance of powerful leaders

# THE LORDS OF THUNDER


all trying to out-fanatic one another, with no overall
leadership except on occasions where someone has
rallied sufficient support to lead the Lords of Thunder
as a whole for a short while. This disunity might be the
salvation of meat-eaters but ultimately all K’Kree of
the Lords of Thunder have the same mission and are
passionate about it.


Unlike their human neighbours, the K’Kree are
unwilling to colonise rockball and iceball worlds, and so
maintain little more than outposts on any world without
breathable air and plenty of open space – unless of
course they have a good reason for being there. They
will set up new herds on conquered garden worlds,
often driving the local population into marginal terrain or
simply killing them. The pattern for a K’Kree-ised world
of this sort is one of small cities interspersed with wide
plains, with herds of K’Kree roaming freely wherever
they please. These herds will contribute contingents
to offworld endeavours and welcome home those who
have been serving elsewhere when their time is done.


The establishment of such paradises is part of the
mission taken on by the Lords of Thunder and both
facilitates and inspires further advances. Knowing the
wide plains of home await at the end of their mission
and that their mission might result in the capture of
more wide plains to wander, drives many young K’Kree
onwards. Although worlds without open lands are
incorporated within the territory of the Lords of Thunder,
they are not always occupied. If the population is small
they may be relocated if it is deemed worth the effort or
kept isolated and largely ignored. In such cases a small
contingent is usually maintained to control the starport
and monitor the population for dissent. This is an
unpleasant duty, often used as a punishment or given
to those who have not pleased their clanlords.


Economically valuable worlds lacking a K’Kree-friendly
environment require a garrison. Where possible this is
made up of personnel from subject species, many of
them humans, overseen by a small K’Kree contingent.
These security forces are lightly equipped and could not
withstand a serious attack but are mostly sufficient to
keep the population in line. Any attempt at an uprising is
met with savage reprisals; the Lords of Thunder seem to
take it rather personally when a world population forces
them to fight on terrain they do not like.





The result of these policies is that the territory of the Lords
of Thunder consists of K’Kree-friendly garden worlds and
industrial hubs with low-population worlds in between.
Many have just enough people to create an economy
capable of supporting the starport and are of little
economic or strategic value. Internal security is less of a
problem than for most conquerors due to the willingness
of the Lords of Thunder to savagely punish or simply
exterminate the population if they prove difficult to control.
In most cases the response to unrest is to close off the
starport and effectively place the planetary population
under siege. If they surrender and accept punishment
before the Lords of Thunder get around to forcibly
pacifying them they should consider they got off lightly.


POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE
The political structure of the Lords of Thunder is similar
in most ways to that of the Two Thousand Worlds,
with certain exceptions. Social structures are built
around extended families led by a patriarch who owes
allegiance to his clanlord and above him a steppelord.
Within a clan some families have specialist functions
such as warriors, merchants or ambassadors but
no family is composed of only one profession. For
example, a merchant patriarch might have multiple
clerks and administrators in his family but there will
also be the odd warrior. A warrior family might be the
other way around, with most of the males specialising
as warriors but sufficient merchants and administrators
to ensure the extended family can function as a self-
contained unit. This is inefficient in many ways but does
mean a K’Kree extended family is a resourceful and
resilient social entity.


The social hierarchy of the Lords of Thunder is typical
of K’Kree everywhere. A dominant male leads a small
family consisting of around 6–24 individuals. About
half of these will be the wives of the patriarch and his
immediate followers, who are likely to be his relatives or
offspring. Six to twelve small families form a big family
lead by the most senior patriarch. These are grouped
into field families, commonly referred to as herds. A
typical herdlord leads 300–800 K’Kree, including big
families specialising in various different roles.


Two or more herds – usually 3–6 – form a pasture
family, or clan, which is ruled by a clanlord. Clanlords
are the lowest rank permitted to have diplomatic or
mercantile dealings with outsiders, although they
rarely interact directly. More commonly an extended
family specialising in commerce or diplomacy will be
sent to handle affairs. This does mean that receiving
an ambassador from the Lords of Thunder means a
visit from over 100 large creatures, all of whom need


considerable space and who cannot cope with being
separated from the group. A diplomatic reception is
not a small affair.


Groupings of clans, usually numbering 10,000 or
more K’Kree, are known as plain-families and are
led by a senior noble known as the lieutenant-of-
the-steppelord. Two or more plain-families form a
steppe-family led by a steppelord. Typically, a steppe-
family will consist of two or three plain-families living
a traditional lifestyle as nomads and a smaller plain-
family which has the task of operating a city. These
are sometimes known as city-families and are of lower
status in the steppe-family than those who can wander
freely. Their main task is to ensure the nomadic
groups are kept supplied with vehicles, clothing
and technological items so they can enjoy their
traditional lifestyle with the added comfort of advanced
technology. Outsiders often make the mistake of
assuming the city associated with a steppe-family is
its capital. This is not the case at all. The steppelord
commands from wherever the steppelord happens to
be, which is usually on the move out under the open
sky. He will visit his city as rarely as possible.


Above the steppelords of a given world is the lord-of-
steppelords, effectively the planetary ruler. In the Two
Thousand Worlds the lords-of-steppelords answer
to the grand steppelord, and officially this is also
the situation in the territory of the Lords of Thunder.
However, unofficially their leaders have begun
styling themselves the overlords-of-the-innumerable-
thundering-hordes, or more simply as the Lords of
Thunder. Although they pay lip service to the authority


K-Kree
clanlord




of the grand steppelord, the Lords of Thunder consider
themselves to be autonomous. Each commands a
following of several lords-of-steppelords and wields
their resources as seems best.

The Lords of Thunder do not seem to have ever agreed
on an overall political structure. Some act as if they
are sole leader of the exiles whilst others recognise
an unspoken hierarchy within which a handful of
the greatest overlords stand above the rest. Some
outsiders think there is a ruling council among the
Lords of Thunder but in fact the situation is much
looser. The power, prestige and influence of any given
leader dictates to what extent they can push the rest
of their society in any given direction. Some simply
act, knowing their fellows will not leave them to face
a G’naak backlash alone. Thus, the one thing that is
known for certain about the Lords of Thunder is that
they are a threat to everyone around them.

FOREIGN POLICY

AND MILITARY ORGANISATION
The Lords of Thunder know very well that the Imperium
is a powerful state which would almost certainly react
to a campaign of extermination by the K’Kree against
humans or other creatures in Gateway. It might or might
not intervene in an attempt to seize territory in the
non-aligned area. A prudent leadership would keep its
operations fairly low-key, working mainly by intimidation
and the slow creep of borders that also characterises
Imperial expansion. The Lords of Thunder sometimes
operate this way but at any given time there will be one
or more leaders who want to lead a thundering charge
rather than creeping up on the enemy. This can lead
to setbacks and eclipse but it is only a matter of time
before someone else takes the lead.

Foreign policy is thus rather muddled and subject to
cross-cutting agendas. The careful plans of several of
the Lords can be overturned when some hothead goes
trampling straight through their area of operations.
Only when the most powerful leaders are in accord on
something and are prepared to squash anyone who
interferes in their plans can a coherent foreign policy
be said to exist. At most times, the situation is a mess
of diplomatic and economic gambits counterpointed by
raids or military posturing and extravagant demands.

K’Kree ground forces are very different from those of
most other species, both in terms of how they fight and
their organisational structure. Forces are organised
on a semi-feudal basis as bands of warriors, which
are very loyal to their leader and may be demoralised
if he is killed. Larger forces are simply warbands-


of-warbands. Leaders of these larger warbands are
usually charismatic and influential nobles who may or
may not have a good grasp of strategy.


K’Kree warriors are essentially cavalry and prefer
to fight in the open with personal weapons. Their
warbands are augmented with robotic weapon
platforms which manoeuvre alongside the hoof-soldiers
and provide support as necessary. Use of cover and
fortifications are minimal; K’Kree generally do not
care much for terrain objectives either. Their aim is
the destruction of enemy forces, ideally by means of a
sweeping charge and pursuit of a defeated foe.


Whilst amateurish by the standards of most human
polities, this method of fighting plays to the strengths of
the K’Kree. Prowess and bravery are rewarded with status
and no K’Kree could stand to let the herd down. Their
forces are thus excessively valorous and will often keep
trying to win a battle long after a sensible commander
would have fled. This can bring about immensely costly
victories but the Lords of Thunder are not stupid. Their
better commanders excel at skirmishing and retreating,
ideally drawing the enemy out of their positions into a
disorganised advance. On many occasions a K’Kree
retreat has suddenly become an all-out charge from the
front and the flanks, and some of their opponents have
implemented an extreme caution on the advance policy
which in turn imposes strategic limitations.


Since K’Kree cannot stand being confined, their
armoured vehicles are huge and crewed by multiple
warriors. They generally resemble large fighting
platforms or mobile forts rather than tanks or strike
vehicles. Mounting multiple powerful weapons,
these platforms can provide mobile fire support to
the troops on the ground. They are large targets
but well protected. Similarly, military starships are
large and rather inefficient. They are organised
similarly to ground forces, along semi-feudal lines.
Individual crews are generally skilled but complex fleet
manoeuvres are rarely very successful.


This problem is offset by two factors. One is the
ships themselves, which tend to be tough and
individually capable. The other is the use of robotic
fighters. This echoes the use of robotic fire support
platforms in ground combat. Fighters are directed
rather than controlled, with operators selecting tactics,
formations and targets, allowing the fighters to operate
autonomously. Losses are entirely irrelevant to most
K’Kree commanders, which is just as well since the
fighters are invariably handled with more aggression
than finesse. The fighter swarm is backed up by missile
salvoes, with orphaned craft and munitions transferring
to the herd of another command ship when necessary.





None of the other powers in the region is particularly
large or powerful. Most are primarily human states
which have grown up in Gateway from Rule of Man-era
colonies. The only non-Imperial multiworld power in Ley
is the Khuur League.


THE KHUUR LEAGUE
The Khuur League is a trade federation dominated
by the Sydite people. It is a remnant of the Sydymic
Empire, which was smashed long ago by the Imperium
and is not a major player on the cosmic stage. Its main
political asset is an accident of astrography. Lying in
the middle of the astrographic choke point between
Ley and Gateway, the worlds of the League provide
a jump-2 link to those permitted passage. This has
led to constant arguments with Imperial officials over
tariffs and transit rights, which occasionally lead to
concessions and sanctions. The Khuur Transit can be
closed off at short notice, making it something of a risk.
The benefits of not having to transit around to rimward
of the League are generally considered worth it.


The League has always traded freely among the
independent worlds beyond the Imperial frontier and
with worlds once part of the Empire now absorbed by
the Imperium. In recent years, the League’s members
have begun to look farther afield for new markets and
have begun to invest in Imperial worlds along the border.
Trader ships now ply the Imperial commerce routes quite
frequently and many Sydite businesses have opened
offices on Imperial planets. While it would be foolish
to discount the possibility of some kind of economic
masterplan, especially on the part of a conquered
people, it is known the Sydites are not particularly subtle
or inventive. It is far more likely the recent moves are
motivated by economic factors within the League.


LEAGUE MILITARY
The treaty imposed by the Imperium at the surrender
of the Sydymic Empire prohibits the League from
possessing military forces, although individual
member worlds are permitted a defensive force and a
few escort ships for commercial protection. Member
worlds mostly rely on orbital fortifications and flotillas
of system defence boats for protection, backed by
ground-based weapon systems. Ground forces vary
in size and capability.

# LOCAL POWERS


Other than a handful of small patrol ships, the only
starfaring assets possessed by the League are the
fleet of armed merchant cruisers operated by various
members. Incapable of standing up to a real warship,
these AMCs would make pretty fair commerce raiders
or a reasonable deterrent to one. The League does
build small warships for export, mainly large and
rugged escort vessels that find a ready market in the
Gateway and Crucis Margin sectors. These vessels
are built the way the Empire used to build its warships

- heavy and solid, with the emphasis on close and
middle-range weapons. Such vessels are well suited to
unimaginative Sydite battle tactics; they are designed
to close with the enemy and stubbornly slug it out.


Traditionally, most major Sydite ships were built with
a second, jump-1 capable, drive buried deep in the
hull. This allowed them to take horrific punishment
and still escape for repairs. It is likely that most if not
all of the Sydite merchant cruisers follow a similar
practice. Hardening procedures of this sort are
used in most fields; where an Imperial settlement
might have a single large reactor for efficiency a
Sydite equivalent will have two or more. These
will be separated as much as possible to increase
survivability in the event of a disaster.


THE GALIAN FEDERATION
Comprising 32 star systems lying at the spinward
end of Gateway sector, the Galian Federation is a
remnant of the old Galian Trade League. It remains
one of the most important polities in Gateway. Close
to the only jump-2 link into Ley sector, the Federation
has considerable contact with the Imperium.
Relations are reasonably friendly, although with
the Khuur League lying on the direct route into the
Imperium, traffic sometimes has to go a long way
around through non-aligned space.


The majority of the population are humans, with a
sizable Sydite minority. As a long-term stable state,
the Federation has received considerable numbers
of refugees from wars elsewhere in the sector. Some
are desperate evacuees but for the most part it is the
wealthy who can relocate, taking with them their staff
and hangers-on. One result of this is a steady influx of
well-off people seeking to set up a new business. In


times of uncertainty elsewhere the Galian Federation is
an attractive bolt-hole and many businesses maintain
at least some holdings there just in case.

Several worlds of the Galian Federation are host
to Imperial Trade Missions. These are not always
sanctioned by the authorities across the border and
it can be hard to tell the difference between a private
venture which has tacit approval to act as a diplomatic
conduit and a rogue merchant seeking to legitimise
their trans-border dealings. On the whole, the trade
missions contribute to good relations and improve
stability in the region. They also make it much easier
for Imperial vessels to obtain permission to move
through Galian territory, including warships operating
farther out in Gateway.

Relations are generally polite to good with the Khuur
League, subject to the occasional closing-down of
trade routes to impede Imperial operations. Conflict
in the past has been replaced by increasingly strong
trade links which have in turn benefited the worlds in
between. Tradeships undertake long voyages outside
Galian space, bearing not only goods but influence and
the Federation remains a potent force in the politics of
Gateway. There are many who believe the breakaway
states could and perhaps should be re-integrated,
by force if necessary. This is more a response to the
threat posed by the Hochiken People’s Assembly than
a counter to possible K’Kree aggression but many
Imperial diplomats seem to be in favour of the move.

The Federation maintains links to the trailing states
of the sector, primarily the Megusard Corporate and
Renkard Union via the Gateway-Sardis Run, a trade
route through non-aligned space where pirate attacks
are common. Whilst in theory it would be possible
to route trade through the Trindel Confederacy, the
Federation prefers not to pay passage fees, nor to rely
on passage through even a friendly state. The risks
inherent in the Gateway-Sardis route are outweighed
in the mind of the Federation by the advantages of
keeping foreign influences out of Federation trade.

The Federation’s industrial and technological base is
at Tharver, Salur, Hanumisk, Cresta and Wolden, while
some worlds remain under-developed. Refugees are
currently being offered quite generous grants of land
and property to settle on frontier worlds like Thermal
or Basilisk, in the hope of creating a decent economic
base on these planets. Considerable investment has
been generated by a convoluted process, whereby
those wishing to relocate into Federation space are
permitted to open businesses on the main worlds in
return for putting up money for development of the


frontier worlds. It is often said, although inaccurately,
that providing employment for 100 people on Basilisk
buys an office for four on Tharver.


GALIAN MILITARY
The Galian Federation is also the most powerful state
in military terms in the Gateway sector. Its forces are
mainly deployed to counter the threat from the HPA
and the Viyard Concourse. These forces are built
on TL9 hulls and backup components, with TL10
systems shipped into the yards for weapons, drives
and electronics. This system is somewhat vulnerable
to disruption but allows capable warships to be
constructed by worlds possessing only TL9. This is
most of the Federation. Designs are standardised
throughout the Federation.


For the most part, the Federation operates a balanced
navy, with a good mix of cruiser-sized major units
and light anti-piracy vessels. Tharver and Salur
host the main naval bases and it is here the battle
squadrons are based. Lighter forces patrol the rest
of the Federation, while long-range vessels (with
tanker support) conduct anti-piracy sweeps far
beyond Federation borders, mainly along the troubled
Gateway-Sardis Run. Imperial vessels are also
sometimes based in Federation space, with joint naval
exercises becoming increasingly common.


THE TRINDEL CONFEDERACY
Once a part of the Galian League, the Confederacy
comprises three small states across 12 star systems
roughly in the centre of Gateway sector. These worlds
form a very loose organisation with no central capital

- the three states that make up the Confederacy
have their capitals at Taravesh, Trindel and Ashton.
Confederacy politics are something of a nightmare,
with the internal affairs of three states spilling over into
the internal and external politics of the Confederacy
as a whole. As a result, an excess of compromises
hamstrings most attempts to get anything done,
while occasionally the need to push a measure
through results in agreements to all sorts of projects,
concessions and operations.


The Trindel Confederacy lies very close to the Galian
Federation and is strongly influenced by the Federation
even although it is officially independent and neutral
in the Federation’s ongoing dispute with the Viyard
Concourse. The industrial worlds of Trindel and Taravesh
provide most of the Confederacy’s technology and
Trindel’s central position makes it the natural choice for
what passes for a capital. It is a base of operations, if not
always the headquarters, of many of the Confederacy’s







corporate concerns. The Imperial megacorporation
Sternmetal Horizons LIC has offices on Trindel and is
involved in a number of investments within Confederacy
space. Sternmetal is the only Imperial concern to make
much of an impact in the region.


CONFEDERACY MILITARY
The Trindel Confederacy has no real military of its own.
Its navy consists of ships loaned to a central command
structure by the three states of the Confederation,
which in turn receive them under loan from individual
worlds. Therefore, a Confederacy vessel might
be serving under its world flag, state flag or the
Confederacy flag and be subject to different priorities.
There are few standard ship designs and most vessels
are in the light cruiser size range or smaller.


THE PLAVIAN LEAGUE
Another fragment of the defunct Galian Trade
League, the Plavian League comprises 21 systems
on the fringe of the Lesser Rift. The Heptad, a cluster
of seven worlds centred on Tash, represents the
dominant economic power. The League also consists
of an alliance of smaller states but is generally more
cohesive than the Trindel Confederacy. The League
capital is situated at Plavis, with regional capitals
at Tash and Bremen. Industrial and technological
capability is high across the League and as a result
political weight is fairly equally distributed. Due to the
threat of full-scale war with the Hochiken People’s
Assembly (HPA), the various league factions are highly
co-operative with one another.


The League is openly hostile to the HPA. Skirmishing
has taken place for over a century, with long lulls
of near-peace between incidents. In recent years,
however, tensions have increased and live-fire
incidents are becoming common once again. Requests
for aid from the Galian Federation have been countered
with unacceptable conditions, raising the price of
Federation assistance too high for the League to
pay. Recent declarations by the HPA that it intends
to capture the Heptad are thought to be posturing
but funds are being diverted to a modest increase in
defensive capabilities.


LEAGUE MILITARY
The League maintains a centralised Navy and Support
Force, divided into three regional commands and
a reserve which are unequal in size. Forces are
heavily committed among the Heptad worlds and


at Prevarren, where the HPA threat is greatest. Any
advance into the League’s territory would have to
arrive by way of Prevarren or the jump-2 transit into
the Heptad by way of Concord.


The League’s mostly TL10 navy is primarily a defensive
force of heavily armed and armoured but not very
manoeuvrable, cruisers and heavy units. A few fast
expeditionary units are maintained in the hope that
the threat of retaliation will deter an aggressor. A naval
base is under construction at Bremen and a large force
of light anti-piracy vessels is being worked up to use it.


Many worlds, mainly those of the Heptad, also have
heavy orbital and ground-based defences including
aerospace interceptors, heavy missile emplacements
and orbital forts. These are not intended to defeat an
attacker, merely to free the battle units to manoeuvre
without being too closely tied to planetary defence.
Thus far, the system has worked. Few HPA raids have
succeeded in even closing with a major target, although
commerce raids are a problem.

THE HOCHIKEN PEOPLE’S


ASSEMBLY (HPA)
Originally a democratic state, the HPA is now a military
dictatorship whose internal politics are characterised by
political and military manoeuvring. The state lies on the
fringe of the Lesser Rift. To coreward is a client state
of the Two Thousand Worlds which is not thought to
have ties to the Lords of Thunder. The HPA’s renewed
aggression towards the Plavian League suggests it
does not feel threatened by this state, although the
exact nature of relations is unknown.


Governance of the HPA is handicapped by the fact
many worlds of the HPA are separated from the rest by
a three-parsec rift. Even without this problem the central
government, situated at Granth, is relatively weak and
has trouble controlling the powerful admirals of the HPA
fleet. A number of factions are jockeying for position and
while the central government is able to contain them
individually, an alliance could probably topple the present
government in a civil war or, more likely, a coup.


Several rising stars amongst the HPA military
leadership are strengthening their powerbase by
gaining prestige in unofficial military actions. These
include commerce raids into Plavian space and
anti-piracy sweeps that may or may not be aimed at
crushing pirate bands. At least one former pirate haven
is under the control of an HPA taskforce, a move that




would win favour with the interstellar community were
the place not being turned into the private fief and
fortress of the HPA commodore responsible.

Incidents along the border with the Plavian League
are increasing in frequency and it is only a matter of
time before they spill over into full-scale war. However,
since the HPA is one of the most powerful states in
the region, the League is doubtful about its ability to
survive such a conflict and thus seeks to stave off the
confrontation as long as possible.

HPA MILITARY
The HPA maintains a powerful TL10 navy, which
includes vessels of up to battleship size and a strategic
reserve composed mainly of TL9 monitors and gunships.
The strategic reserve provides system defence and can
also undertake mobile operations when transported
by large jump-capable carrier/tenders. The military of
the HPA is well-trained and efficient up to the squadron
level but rivalries and political mistrust tend to hamper
operations at higher levels, unless a particularly
charismatic admiral is in charge.


The HPA vessels commonly seen outside Assembly
space are large missile destroyers and combat tenders.
The latter also mount heavy missile armament and can
deploy squadrons of 600-ton strike corvettes. Tenders
also carry a contingent of ground troops and their
associated shuttles. These general-purpose vessels
conduct patrols and border duties, and can call on support
from fleet units using their jump-capable courier boats.


THE VIYARD CONCOURSE
The Concourse was formed from fragments of the
collapsed Galian Trade League and another failed
polity named the Collective. The capital is at Viyard but
the old Collective capital at Barclaron is also extremely
important. The average Tech Level of Concourse
worlds is 9-10, although industrial capacity is rather
low. Astrographically the Concourse is rather scattered,
with worlds grouped in twos and threes separated by
two-parsec gaps. This has prevented the development
of local-hub economies.


For several decades, the Concourse and the Trindel
Confederacy were loosely aligned against the Galian
Federation. This was mainly a matter of economic

conflict and collective diplomacy, and was never a
formal military alliance. Relations soured towards
the end of the last century, culminating in a war
which saw Coralee conquered by the Confederacy.
Although peace has officially been declared resistance
continues on Coralee, with intermittent and patchy
support from the Concourse.


The Concourse is also engaged in a dispute with
the Galian Federation over the ownership of worlds
lying between the two, a dispute that has led to many
free-fore incidents and occasional war-like situations.
Tensions are not likely to relax in the near future and
trade between the two is almost non-existent. Long-
standing enmity with the Galian Federation has led the
Concourse to seek allies elsewhere but a treaty with
the HPA proved short-lived and of little value. There
does remain a possibility that Concourse policies may
be coordinated with those of the HPA in order to distract
and separate the attentions of the Galian Federation
and their Plavian allies.


CONCOURSE MILITARY
Industrial capacity in the Concourse is relatively low,
which precludes the building of large, sophisticated
ships except in certain yards. As a result, the
Concourse builds its navy around the concept of task
groups centred on a large flag cruiser supported by a
flotilla of simpler, smaller vessels.


The majority of Concourse vessels are frigates in
the 2–4,000-ton range and of various types: escort,
missile, strike and patrol classes being most common.
Each task group also contains an intelligence ship
designed to control and direct the remainder, and a
handful of larger fleet frigates which are equivalent to
small destroyers. Concourse task groups are efficient
and effective so long as control is maintained. Once
cohesion is lost, individual vessels tend to perform
poorly due to a lack of initiative among commanders
used to receiving detailed instructions.


THE AKEENA UNION
Comprising 11 worlds in the trailing end of Gateway,
the Akeena Union is dominated by the Akeed, a non-
human minor race originating on Akeen. Most Union
worlds have a large human minority population, which
conducts the majority of diplomacy and commerce with
outsiders – with one exception. The vast majority of
direct meetings between Akeena personnel and K’Kree
are conducted solely by Akeed.


The Union is officially and determinedly neutral in the
affairs of human polities. The great majority of the
human population is similarly disinterested, although
some firms have strong leanings. Relations with the
K’Kree are fairly good, since the Akeed do not eat
meat in any form and are careful to keep humans who
might away from visitors. Trade with the Two Thousand
Worlds is considerable, going by way of Crucis Margin
sector or even through the territory of the Lords of
Thunder. This creates an avenue for human-K’Kree
trade and diplomacy that might otherwise not exist. It
would also be a useful way of gathering intelligence if
the Akeed were willing to do so but they politely ignore
suggestions from other powers. The Union is thought
to have some kind of defence agreement with the two
Thousand Worlds. While not amounting to a full mutual
defence pact, the Union can expect aid of some kind
from the main K’Kree polity in the event of harassment
by the Lords of Thunder and from the Lords of Thunder
if hostilities commence with other states of the region.


Akeed itself possesses a solid TL12 industrial base,
making it fairly advanced for the region. Technological
items are disseminated throughout the Union but the
technological base away from Akeed is rather lower.
The various subject worlds have not built up a major
industrial or technological base and do not seem
to be keen to do so. Akeed technology is generally
incompatible with systems used by other powers,
although much of it is built to be used by humans.


UNION MILITARY
The Akeena Union maintains a small fleet of
fairly advanced jump-2 vessels. Since the Akeed
are interested only in defending what they have,
vessels are intended to operate on interior lines
of communication. No system is more than 2
jumps from the fleet base at Akeen. Small tripwire
squadrons are stationed in all systems, with the main
fleet elements based at Akeen.


Actual capabilities and armament of Union vessels
are a closely guarded secret. Reports indicate
a preponderance of light-cruiser sized vessels
armed with oversized particle accelerator weapons,
supported by swarms of close escorts that may or
may not also have a strike role.


SWANFEI INDEPENDENCY
The Swanfei Independency lies at the trailingward
end of Gateway. Its worlds were originally settled by
a minor human race known as the Swanfeh about
2,000 years ago, during the Long Night. It is generally




believed they did not come from Terra but migrated
from other systems to eventually settle Carlton. The
Swanfeh thrived here and achieved a starfaring
culture of some power, spreading out to control 30 or
so worlds before gradually losing their technology over
a period of centuries.

The Swanfeh were isolated on several worlds when the
region opened up again and either allied with or were
conquered by various opportunist groups that arrived
over the last millennia. The pirate bands operating in
the region found the Swanfeh worlds to be ideal havens
and gradually came to dominate what became known
as the Pirate Worlds. For centuries, Carlton and the
surrounding worlds were little but freeports for pirates
and smugglers but over time the profits of piracy were
used to create legitimate business. Now the Swanfei
Free Worlds are a recognised interstellar polity, albeit a
rather dubious, rough-and-ready one.

The Independency, to use the official name, is a major
centre for business, particularly arms trading and
mercenary operations. According to rumour, almost
anything can be bought and sold in the Independency,
and pirates can still find a safe haven there. However,
the veneer of legitimacy and the fact that pirates do not
blatantly operate out of the Free Worlds has allowed
the interstellar community to accept it and prevented
much in the way of retaliation.

INDEPENDENCY MILITARY
The armed forces of the Independency are clearly
descended from pirate bands, although these days
they have the trappings of legitimate military forces.
Vessels are typically small, heavily armed and fast,
with contingents of troops aboard for boarding
actions. Command structure is rather loose within
the Independency and rather more dependent upon
influence and power than actual rank. Therefore, the
Free Worlds Navy has many Admirals who command
only a ship or two, and bickering among subordinates
is a common factor.

Ships and even whole squadrons are often detached
for mercenary duty in the service of independent
worlds, corporations or large states, allowing the crews
to gain considerable combat experience and perhaps
covering the odd sly raid. The navy undertakes anti-
piracy sweeps – some say merely to remove the
competition – but rumours persist that Free Worlds
Navy vessels have been involved in raids and outright
piracy on several occasions.


At present, several squadrons are in service with
the Renkard Union. It is widely hoped their presence
might help deter the threat of aggression from the
Lords of Thunder. However, given the opportunistic
and undisciplined nature of Free Worlds ship
commanders, incidents are inevitable. Already there
have been clashes which were blamed on the Free
Worlds. Its leaders insist they are being used as
scapegoats by those who want escalation or deniable
strikes against the K’Kree.


THE MEGUSARD CORPORATE
Comprising 11 worlds at the trailing end of Gateway,
the Corporate was once a large corporation –
Megusard Interstellar – based out of Sardis. Megusard
Interstellar made the transition to a full interstellar
government over many years, mainly as a response
to the rise of piracy in the region and the breakup of
the Galian Trade League. Although the Corporate
has ceased to be a monolithic commercial institution,
many trappings of corporate operation remain.
Individual worlds hold a status rather like owned
subsidiaries of the Corporate rather than being
considered political entities as such. Worlds have
considerable autonomy but must submit detailed
reports of their activities to central government.
Accountability is high.


The Corporate structure is highly efficient, with a
premium placed upon education and innovation.
Members of the Corporate’s interstellar government
and its bureaucracy tend to take the corporate
lifestyle to extremes but for the majority of citizens the
standard of living is high and services run efficiently.
The Corporate maintains strong links with the Galian
Federation, mainly along what is known as the
Gateway-Sardis Run. The Run extends through a
corridor of neutral systems and, although troubled by
piracy, is kept open because it avoids major powers
and the interference with trade that might result from
crossing into and out of such a region.


The Corporate maintains close trading links with
the neighbouring Renkard Union and has recently
implemented a policy of backing the Union’s
stand against the encroaching Lords of Thunder.
This policy does not extend to sending forces but
corporate money has financed numerous mercenary
contracts, hiring ships and troops to bolster the
defences of the Union. The Corporate also heavily
subsidises warship construction for the Union, which
takes place in Corporate yards.







The Megusard Corporate has some trade links with the
Mercantile Concord to rimward in Crucis Margin sector,
although the Concord’s increasing friendliness with the
Lords of Thunder has cooled this relationship.


CORPORATE MILITARY
As a small power, the Corporate operates no military
vessels larger than a destroyer. Most ships are much
smaller, intended for piracy suppression rather than war-
fighting. One innovation is the Self-Escorting Merchant
Ship (SEMS) project. This is simply a ruggedised
merchant vessel armed with numerous missile bays and
carrying a fighter wing. Ideally, the fighters are used as
pickets and to guide a missile strike launched at long
range. SEMS vessels cannot hope to stand up to a
real warship but can destroy most corsair craft before
they can close to energy range. Other projects include
Q-ships; heavily armed vessels constructed on merchant
hulls intended to surprise enemies after pretending to be
harmless merchants.


The military of the Corporate is fairly effective but is
not inspired by any real warrior spirit. Cost-efficiency
rather than outright capability is paramount, resulting in
a number of self-limiting policies. However, in terms of
beating off pirate raids, the Corporate Defence Force of
Megusard, as it is known, is highly successful. It would
be swept aside by any real military force, however.


THE RENKARD UNION
The Union comprises 20 systems on the border
between Gateway and Luretir!girr sector to trailing. It
is a loose organisation based upon trade and mutual
interests. The Union’s member worlds also paid lip
service to a vaguely-worded mutual defence treaty – at
least until recently. The obviously expansionistic nature
of the Lords of Thunder in Luretir!girr has forced the
Union to close ranks and begin presenting a unified
front in the hope of deterring K’Kree aggression. This
has in turn led to the creation of a Union Navy and a
central defence policy.


Opinion in the Union is sharply divided as to whether
it is best to deter, appease or ignore the Lords of
Thunder. Differences of opinion are so violent that
rioting has become commonplace as the Central
Defence Policy is implemented and more than one
world government has collapsed. Some individual
worlds have threatened to secede from the Union
altogether, although this has not yet occurred.


The Union maintains strong trade links with the
Megusard Corporate to spinward and conducts some
long-distance trade with the Two Thousand Worlds.
This has recently been stepped up, in the hope of
improving relations and influencing the Two Thousand
Worlds to exert some sort of restraint over the Lords of
Thunder. This hope is thought to be wildly optimistic,
but nevertheless the Union is trying.


Whether the rapid militarisation of the Union will
provoke or deter the Lords of Thunder, or indeed if it
will have any effect at all, remains to be seen. What
is certain is that the cost is beginning to bite and this,
as much as differences of opinion over the policy, is
dividing the Union at a time when a united front is vital.


UNION MILITARY
The Union can deploy a very mixed range of forces.
There is a great deal of legacy equipment in use, left
over from the days of the decentralised and inadequate
naval policy. Most ships are old, poorly designed and
best suited to patrol work or escort duty. They are
supplemented by a range of mercenary craft which
are mainly small vessels and forces deployed by
other powers. The vast majority of these are from the
Swanfei Independency.


The real hope for the Union is the new navy coming off
the slips in the Union and in the Megusard Corporate.
These vessels, constructed at TL10, are armed with
missiles shipped in by the thousand from Megusard.
Destroyers, system defence monitors and missile boats
join the fleet almost weekly but many feel that it is too
little, too late. In addition, even taking up crews from
mercenary units, the merchant service and anywhere
else they can be found, there is a desperate shortage
of trained starfarers in the Union. This is creating
a situation where highly complex ships are crewed
by half-trained personnel and commanded by over-
promoted officers. What the Union needs is time to
shake down the ships, the squadrons and the fleet into
a useful defensive tool.


Time is something the Renkard Union may not have.
Incidents with hot-headed leaders from the Lords of
Thunder are increasingly common and intelligence
suggests forces are massing for an invasion of Renkard
space. It may be a matter of months or even weeks
before the trigger is pulled, whilst the Union needs
years at the very least.





Several very powerful organisations exist within the
region. Some are legitimate businesses with their
own agenda, which may or may not be in line with the
prevailing political climate, while others are semi-legal
or even illegal organisations. Some of the Imperial
megacorporations wield more power than any states
of the Trailing Frontier other than the Imperium and
indeed may have more ships and personnel than a
multiworld state. However, this power is scattered
across Imperial space and the region just beyond it.


Many of the organisations detailed here are based in the
Imperium. Others have a home on one or more worlds
beyond the Imperial border. While most have some
loyalty to their parent or host state, some transcend
political barriers. Certain corporations, for example, see
themselves as an uber-state with holdings on many
worlds across the territory of various states and non-
aligned worlds. Indeed, some corporations legitimately
own one or more planets. Others are the power behind
the throne on several worlds.


THE CHURCH OF STELLAR DIVINITY
The Church of Stellar Divinity is the predominant
religion in Gateway. Most worshippers are human
but other species are welcomed into the faithful. The
Church believes stars are the physical manifestation of
the gods, although there are a number of heretics that
interpret this basic belief in various ways.


The Church has no central authority or main holy figure
but there are plenty of local factions and holy people who
claim to be the central and main authority, a fact that
creates some friction between branches of the church.
Likewise, worshippers vary in all the ways sentient
beings do. Some are good people inspired by the
Church’s basic tenets of tolerance, mutual understanding
and avoidance of conflict but zealots do exist and some
of the infighting between heretics can be vicious in the
extreme. There are also powerful religious leaders who
use their influence for political ends or for personal gain,
and the odd messianic lunatic.


Despite this, for the most part the Church is a
powerful voice for peace and tolerance in the region
and beyond. Many world governments have adopted
the Church as their state religion; others listen to

# NON-STATE ORGANISATIONS


the Church leaders’ advice although it has no official
place in government. A few world governments are
actually composed of Church officials and some
worlds feel the need to export their version of Stellar
Divinity at gunpoint.


RIGHTEOUS STEVE
The individual styling himself Righteous Steve is
a middle-aged Vargr, who almost certainly took
the name after reinventing himself at least once.
According to rumour he is a reformed pirate or
perhaps a corsair lord, fleeing his dark past or
vengeful enemies in the Vargr Extents. He claims to
have found salvation and his calling to preach whilst
passing too close to a certain star during an ill-fated
voyage and has dedicated himself to good works in
the hope of finding redemption. This is in all likelihood
nonsense but Steve is an eloquent speaker with a
huge following on many worlds. He is disliked by most
leaders of the Church of Stellar Divinity for multiple
reasons. Among them are a tendency to take himself
less than seriously and an ability to attract donations
and converts than more conventional preachers.


Righteous Steve typically dresses in stylish
business-casual clothing and corrects anyone who
tries to address him as a minister, priest or other
formal title. He was not ordained, he says, but
called. His wry wisdom and apparent understanding
of the problems ordinary people face make him a
popular character. Steve does not perform miracles
or engage in histrionics, although his presentations
are very well staged. If he is a charlatan, he is a
good one and the work done by his followers speaks
for itself. At any given time, Righteous Steve is
surrounded by an entourage of various species but
most of his following are sent to do good works all
over the sector. Some wander and preach, helping
where they can, but most go to well-funded projects
in backwater areas where they quietly spread their
religion and try to help those they can.


Steve himself is famed for his pulpit-bot style of
evangelism. He and his close followers will drive across
the countryside on tracked platforms, some of which
have a pulpit-like superstructure. A cloud of drones films
everything, including footage from quite distant areas,
as Steve delivers his rather casual sermon. Musicians





and singers riding the other pulpit-bots add to the
entertainment, sometimes assisted by dancers or other
entertainers. The whole thing is orchestrated in real time
by experts who also have to drive their bots. Whilst some
find the spectacle overblown or rather silly, Righteous
Steve has achieved superstar levels of popularity.


The Steve Show, as it is known, is a vehicle for
Righteous Steve’s teachings but more importantly
his requests for donations. Money pours into offices
located at starports across the region and how much
of it goes into Steve’s pocket is an open question.
Very large sums are definitely spent on good works,
however. In many cases this is low-profile work such as
assisting the homeless or providing teachers in remote
areas, but there are also several vessels – inevitably
known as Steve Ships – outfitted for disaster-relief
or other tasks. Occasionally a Steve Ship will touch
down in a remote area and set up a free clinic whilst
enthusiastic young people help with construction,
repairs or whatever else needs doing. On other
occasions they will plunge into the middle of a disaster
or even a war zone, offering medical assistance and
rescue to anyone who wants it.


There is much speculation about Righteous Steve’s
motivations. Some say he is merely a hugely
successful con-man, whilst others point out that even if
he is, his followers save and improve lives. There are
those who question his supposed past as a pirate,and
many more who seek an even darker backstory. Ex-
lovers, betrayed comrades and former associates


routinely emerge from the shadows to denounce Steve.
His usual response is to admit yet another round of
terrible sins and misdeeds and to remind everyone that
he is still seeking redemption. This, more than anything
else, suggests that Righteous Steve is a fake. Nobody
has so many misdeeds in their past and his willingness
to confess to almost any allegation is surely a poise.
Yet still the donations flood in and the convoy of pulpit-
bots rolls ever onward.


CORSAIRS, PIRATES AND PRIVATEERS
Most acts of piracy (including raids on ground targets)
in the Gateway Domain are carried out by lone
vessels often as a one-off opportunistic action. Many
such pirates go back to commerce or smuggling.
Those that do not usually fall afoul of the authorities
or other lawbreakers when they head for a notorious
pirate haunt to sell their gains. However, there are a
number of career pirates and organised groups that
continue their operations even although individual
ships are caught or leave the pirate trade. Given the
need for a safe port and reliable, discreet disposal of
the loot, these career pirates cultivate a network of
contacts and intimidated officials, and by this means
wield a great deal of power.


None of the corsair groups in the Trailing Frontier
is particularly large – rarely more than three or four
vessels – and they do not normally cooperate or
even communicate with one another. There is no




pirates alliance, other than in the form of corrupt world
governments and a couple of states founded with pirate
money. Therefore, the corsairs, while collectively an
influence on the region, are not a coherent political
entity. Their motivations are similar, so as a group it
can be said the corsairs are in favour of less diligent
patrolling and policing by naval units, corruption among
local officials and similar measures that allow them to
get away with what they do.

THE OWNSBEE RAIDERS
It is not clear what members of the Ownsbee Raiders
call their organisation; the label has been applied by
news outlets for some years now. Nor is it certain the
organisation exists at all. Pirate attacks take place all
across Ownsbee subsector and beyond, and cannot all
be connected. However, there is reason to believe an
organised pirate band is behind at least some of them.
Similarities in mode of operation and the fact members
have evaded capture suggests a degree of organisation
beyond that of the usual opportunist raider.

In fact, there is an organised pirate band that matches
the media impression of the Ownsbee Raiders. Its
origins lie in a hijacked cargo of life support and
manufacturing equipment intended for an outsystem
installation. Equipped with this, the raiders were able
to set up a small base on some rockball or planetoid,
enabling their vessels to disappear for weeks or
months at a time. This alone is not enough to create
a successful pirate operation but the cultivation of an
effective intelligence network has allowed the Raiders
to avoid retaliation and strike lucrative targets.

The Raiders operate an Imperial patrol corvette – lost
under unfortunate and embarrassing circumstances

- and a larger armed vessel of unknown type. These
ships greatly outgun their targets and can force
most merchant ships to hand over cargo. A loot ship
accompanies these vessels and acts as a support
vessel on longer voyages. Other ships operated by the
Raiders are clean and can carry their stolen cargo to
market on worlds with loose law enforcement.

In general, the Raiders will take cargo, or sometimes
hostages, and have been known to strip out
components from a ship if they have time. They
prefer not to destroy vessels or cause unnecessary
casualties, and have an agreement in place with some
merchant ship operators to leave them alone in return
for a financial consideration. It is clear the Raiders
are playing a long game, striking intermittently and in
various locations then lying low for a while. Cargoes
may be held for months or even years before appearing


on the black market, whilst hostages are ransomed
through helpful officials on certain worlds. Some of
these may be in on the racket but they have no useful
information on when the Raiders will be visiting or
where they are based. The level of discipline required
to operate in this manner and maintain secrecy is
beyond the usual thugs and robbers who get into

- and are quickly taken out of – the piracy game.
This suggests former naval personnel or perhaps
mercenaries are involved.


EQUAL SENTIENTS MOVEMENT
The ESM exists to ensure that all sentient beings within
the Imperium receive the equal treatment to which they
are entitled. ESM is a quiet, dignified organisation that
applies pressure against world governments that are
not treating their non-human citizens correctly. As might
be expected in the human-dominated Imperium, the
bulk of ESM’s membership is non-human.


The ESM is a primarily Imperial organisation but
has many adherents outside its territory. In regions
where racism is prevalent, ESM members may resort
to more vigorous means than the gentle campaigns
of protest and education by those in Imperial space.
The organisation is highly active on worlds that have
recently joined the Imperium and particularly those
that might be about to. Indeed, its activists are usually
among the most vocal in pushing for a membership
application since incorporation into the Imperium
means protection under Imperial Sentients’ rights laws.
The ESM is generally acknowledged as a force for
good but its adherents sometimes cause turbulence
in areas where other parties – notably the Imperial
authorities – would prefer to let the situation calm down.


THE IMPERIAL MEGACORPORATIONS
All of the Imperial megacorporations are active in the
Imperial part of the region but only some have interests
in Gateway. The megacorps are all hugely powerful
commercial entities, with a range of interests. Their
resources are beyond what any single world (or even
most subsectors) can bring to bear but are scattered
across a huge area.


The leaders of the megacorps are now all Imperial
nobles. The Imperium is built upon trade and economics,
so it is hardly surprising that many of its nobles are
businesspersons and that a megacorporate official has
not only their own company resources to deploy but also
personal troops, and of course a corporate noble has
the ear of others of similar rank. As a result, megacorps
have a habit of getting what they want.







Within Imperial territory, megacorporations generally
operate in an atmosphere of enlightened self-interest.
The Imperium provides a good environment in which
to do business, so disrupting it is not usually desirable.
Actions that damage Imperial interests or violate Imperial
High Law also tend to have serious consequences
and the megacorps have a lot to lose. However, rivalry
can spill over into Trade War and local megacorp
leaders may sometimes act at cross-purposes to the
political leaders of the Imperium. Corruption within the
corporations is not unknown, either.


Outside Imperial territory, the attitude of the
megacorporations varies. Some are simply there to
make money and will do whatever it takes to create a
short or long-term profit. Others are playing a longer or
more complex game, perhaps intending to develop a
region to benefit the Imperium as a whole and thereby
gain influence or support for some project elsewhere.


DELGADO TRADING
Delgado is the most recent of the Imperial
megacorporations to emerge. It was founded in
997 from a collection of huge firms and business
interests which coalesced to form a huge Business
Group. Delgado’s interests include military equipment
and minerals, plus general trading. The corporation
operates a fleet of large freighters and is notorious for
its employment policies, which favour a small number
of employees at the expense of the majority. Delgado is
fairly active in Gateway, running regular freighters into
the Galian League. Smaller but well-armed merchant
ships ply all the way out to Sardis in the Megusard
Corporate. It is an open secret that Delgado is doing
well out of the Lords of Thunder threat, with frequent
shipments of military hardware heading out to trailing
and finding their way into the hands of those most
afraid of K’Kree aggression.


GENERAL PRODUCTS LEY
General is a manufacturing conglomerate that deals
mainly in heavy equipment such as starships and
vehicles. General has a few plants in Ley, the largest
of which supplies the yards of its subsidiary, General
Starships Ley, with heavy components such as reactors
and hull sections. GPL has major shipyards situated at
Dukh, where they contribute considerably to the local
economy. This gives General Products considerable
influence with the sector duke.


GESCHICHTKREIS STERNSCIFFBAU AG
GsbAG, unofficially known as Gasbag, is primarily a
shipbuilding firm. It operates a number of small yards
throughout Ley, generally operating in the commercial
and general-purpose markets and building smaller
vessels. GsbAG has been repeatedly outbid or
otherwise lost out on major contracts for navy ships to
General Products and has developed a tendency not
to waste money trying to compete. Instead, it is highly
active in the private and world-government sectors.
The firm also operates a number of specialised
research institutes throughout the sector.


HORTALEZ ET CIE
Hortalez deals in finance, providing capital and
financial services to other businesses. Its operations
in Ley were based at Dukh until 1038, at which point a
move to the new Domain capital, Annapabar, began.
This was accomplished without serious disruption
to operations and was accompanied by the opening
of small regional offices outside the Imperial border
in Gateway and Glimmerdrift Reaches sectors.
Hortalez is known to be bankrolling a number of
projects along the Imperial frontier, most connected
with development of markets for Imperial goods or
suppliers of unusual items.


IMPERIALLINES
A shipping firm owned by the Imperial family,
Imperiallines mainly serves the major routes but
vessels are sometimes encountered on minor routes.
Vessels are very secure and of high quality; many
serve as reserve transports for the Navy and are
armed accordingly. Technically, Imperiallines is not a
megacorporation but recent growth suggests it will soon
achieve that status. Imperiallines runs only one service
outside the Imperial border in the Trailing Frontier, a
heavily escorted secure liner service to Gateway. It is
unlikely any significant profit is being made on this run,
suggesting it has a diplomatic purpose or is intended
to allow the transport of personnel and items without
attracting the sort of attention a naval expedition might.


INSTELLARMS
Instellarms deals in weaponry and trained mercenary
personnel. The firm offers an accreditation and
registration service for mercenary units and individuals,
and is renowned for its strictly legal dealings.
Instellarms deals mainly with bulk orders. Its subsidiary,
Portcullis Defence, manufactures and markets a range
of quality weaponry across Ley and on some worlds





STANDARD PRODUCTS LIC


SHARURSHID

H O R I Z O N S

in Gateway. Whilst Instellarms only occasionally
deals outside the Imperial border, Portcullis has a
whole chain of sales facilities and a few regional
manufacturing centres.

LING STANDARD PRODUCTS
LSP is active in the fields of mining, vehicles, weaponry
and high-technology equipment. The firm not only
manufactures equipment but in some cases operates
it; LSP has outsystem mining operations in several
areas of Gateway. These are rarely popular with local
governments, who routinely send protests to the
Archduke of Gateway that LSP mining platforms are
illegally operating in their outsystem. LSP usually cites
the defence that a government which does not secure
its own system cannot claim it as sovereign territory.

MAKHIDKARUN
A general electronics giant, Makhidkarun produces a
wide range of consumer products and is also a major
defence contractor, supplying electronic systems to the
Imperial armed forces. It has installations on several
worlds in Ley but is not known to operate outside the
Imperial border in this region. Shipments of advanced
electronics are sometimes sold to non-Imperial clients
by way of third parties at ports along the border.

NAASIRKA
Another electronics firm, Naasirka deals mainly in
computer equipment and robotics. The firm maintains
a major research and development facility in Ley and
has manufacturing plants on several worlds. Naasirka
is one of the most active megacorporations outside
the Imperium, with facilities on several worlds in
Gateway. These are typically operated under complex
co-ownership arrangements with local governments.


One result of these over-complicated arrangements is
that it is difficult to discern the exact level of Naasirka
involvement in any given economy.


SCHUNAMANN UND SOHN, AG
SuSAG is the market leader in chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. The firm’s facilities are widespread
throughout Ley and sponsored medical facilities can be
found on many low-tech worlds. There are no known
SuSAG facilities in Gateway, although products are
exported through third parties and can be found for
sale right across the Trailing Frontier. In Gateway, the
SuSAG logo is considered a guarantee of quality and
therefore worth a premium price, which has prompted
a number of small firms to start counterfeiting the
megacorp’s products.


SHARURSHID
Sharurshid is in business to do business. The firm
engages in trade rather than manufacturing and offers
a brokerage service at most large starports. Sharurshid
can be encountered anywhere where there is money
to be made. It maintains a few offices outside the
Imperial border, with roving brokers operating from
trade scout vessels across Gateway. These individuals
are constantly on the move, searching for a new market
or source of interesting goods. Their movements are
generally unpredictable but those with a similar eye
for potential profit can usually figure out where one will
show up sooner or later.


STERNMETAL HORIZONS LIC
Sternmetal is most famous for its mining equipment
and operations but is also active in power generation
and manufacturing. Sternmetal does not do things by
halves – if the firm moves into a region, it will bring in a
whole colony of workers and their families, and support







them while they get the job done. Whilst other Imperial
megacorporations have a small presence in Gateway
intended to produce profits back home, Sternmetal
Horizons is highly active. It has a major operation
based out of Trindel and is thought to be funding some
of the Trindel Confederacy’s endeavours.


TUKERA LINES
Tukera is the most famous shipping line. Its vessels
are encountered on major shipping lanes, conducting
regular services rather than speculative trading. Tukera
trains its people well and rewards loyalty. Vessels are
well protected by their own armaments and security
personnel. Tukera vessels are generally encountered
on the main trade arteries of Ley and almost never
beyond the Imperial border.


ZIRUNKARIISH
Zirunkariish is an investment firm which mainly funds
the development of mid-tech worlds and starports on
major routes. The firm owns and runs several ports in
Ley as subsidiaries. It has also invested in a number
of ports on the Ley-Gateway trade routes but does not
seem interested in pushing further trailingward.


THE LOYAL SECTOR GUARD
The Loyal Sector Guard emerged in the 990s as an
illegal but popular militia movement inspired by a range
of threats. Upheaval caused by internal division was
one oft-cited problem along with imminent attack by
Solomani or K’Kree agents. The organisation had some
powerful supporters, creating a difficult situation for the
archducal authorities. The leaders of the LSG were,
in some ways at least, astute. They put detachments
of well-spoken, friendly and impeccably behaved
young warriors in places the archducal administration
considered unimportant, and won small-scale support
by protecting the people there. Although illegal, closing
down the Loyal Sector Guard would have meant pulling
the protectors out and replacing them with nothing.


The stated purpose of the Loyal Sector Guard has not
changed in a century. It exists to defend the lives and
property of Imperial citizens from all threats. This is the
same mission as the Imperial armed forces and the
existence of the LSG is taken as an affront by some
senior military and naval officials. The LSG is formed
from assets donated by various members: noble
household troops, mercenary units, planetary armed
forces, corporate security units and some specially-
raised forces. It consists mainly of ground-combat units


equipped as mid-tech light infantry, optimised for a local
security rather than warfighting role. The organisation
does have a number of starships and battlefield-
capable military forces.


The LSG has its own rank and pay structure, a uniform,
and a strict code of conduct for its members, all of
whom take a personal oath of loyalty to the Imperium,
her citizens and the emperor. The order these are
phrased in is of concern to some observers, who –
not without some justification – claim the LSG is a
revolutionary army-in-waiting. Pro-LSG factions cite a
century of quiet, dedicated service to the people of Ley
even when the squabbles or money-grabbing of the
nobility worked against their interests.


Over the last century the LSG has changed
considerably. It was always illegal, since Imperial law
generally prohibits the creation of multiworld armed
forces paralleling the Imperial services but was
tolerated until 922 when it was declared a proscribed
organisation. The LSG reluctantly dismantled itself,
making sure there was a PR backlash against the
archduke and continued as a semi-underground
organisation. Investigation concluded the remaining
chapters of the LSG were harmless social groups for
well-connected misfits.


The LSG continued in this form into the 1050s,
when the proscription mysteriously ended. Nothing
happened at first but by 1080 numerous LSG chapters
were operating openly at universities across Ley.
What had been considered a rather sinister potential
revolutionary militia had become a drinking house
for fashionably unconventional individuals. Not
coincidentally, many were well-off graduates; the sort
who move on into important posts.


Today, the Loyal Sector Guard is perceived as a social
club for socially ambitious and rich people, who loudly
proclaim their loyalty to the people of Ley but generally
do little. Lower ranks of the organisation are generally
made up of those who want to get access to the rich and
influential figures at the top. The general atmosphere
is one of dressing-up and playing at being a political
movement. There are parades and festivals at which
members get to wear dashing uniforms and feel they are
part of something special. It is all rather harmless.


However, within the LSG is a group who consider the
Lords of Thunder to be an imminent existential threat
to the people of Ley and all of Humaniti. They have
enormous funds to work with, largely obtained from the
rich and influential members making all the noise at




the top of the organisation. Those who seem inclined
to do something are approached about really making a
difference and end up moving into an entirely different
Loyal Sector Guard. These members wear the same
uniform and attend the same parties but also disappear
for months on end. When they return, they have stories
to tell about adventures in Gateway, which sometimes
inspires others to take this route.

The Loyal Sector Guard, ironically perhaps, does
most of its active work in Gateway. It supplies the
same sort of security detachments as the original
incarnation, but to non-Imperial worlds. Technicians
and educators are also sent to those who need them,
generally at no cost. The organisation also operates
several general assistance vessels which fly around
Gateway helping anyone who needs it. They generate
considerable goodwill towards the Imperium as a whole
and the Guard in particular, which not coincidentally
translates into a grassroots intelligence network feeding
information back to Ley. It may be that the LSG knows
more about the real situation on some worlds than the
Imperial intelligence agencies and it is willing to supply
this information in return for money or favours.

It appears this effort is a genuine initiative to harden
Gateway against the Lords of Thunder. It is accompanied
by the raising and training of non-LSG troops under
the guise of the Gateway Legion. These personnel are
specifically trained to fight K’Kree and deploy to contested
worlds – not always with local permission – to assist in
their defence. The Lords of Thunder are aware of the
Gateway Legion’s backers and routinely demand the
Imperium close the Loyal Sector Guard down.

Gateway Legion forces are similar to those operated by
the LSG. Ground combat units are typically equipped
to TL8, with higher-tech aerospace and anti-armour
equipment available. Space forces consist mainly of
converted merchant ships operating as cheap fighters,
although there are rumours of powerful but obsolete
warships quietly bought up on the disposal market.

It has been suggested the LSG is deliberately trying to
provoke conflict between the Imperium and the Lords
of Thunder. Some of its adherents have been quoted
as saying ‘better now than in the middle of our next
civil war’ but it is unclear whether this is the view of
the true anti-K’Kree faction or just posturing by rich
faux-hawks. Similarly, there are those who wonder
if the LSG is using the situation with the K’Kree for
political or economic advantage within the Imperium

- risking an external war for internal reasons. Be that


as it may, the Loyal Sector Guard seems to have
reinvented itself as both a harmless social club and a
hardcore opponent of K’Kree expansion.


THE FREE PEOPLES ALLIANCE
The FPA was formed in the 700s as a counter to
Imperial expansion and potential aggression. It is part
political movement and part guerrilla force. The FPA
generally does not oppose Imperial interests directly
but instead provides small arms, cash and advice
to other organisations engaged in direct action. It is
known to have extensive criminal contacts within the
Imperium, who are willing to supply weaponry to those
with the cash to pay for it. This includes Imperial Army
equipment misdirected from its shipping destination.


The extent of the FPA is unknown. It is likely its core
assets are quite small but connections with various
power groups, commercial interests and dissident
organisations allow it to wield a great deal of power.
The FPA has a number of blockade-runners available,
mainly small merchant craft, used to deliver aid to
those fighting the Imperium.


LONG NIGHT REMEMBRANCE
A violently anti-Solomani movement, LNR’s title refers
to the collapse of the First (or Vilani) Imperium into the
Long Night, an event that the pro-Vilani members of
LNR blame entirely upon the Solomani. LNR was once
a noisy but peaceful political movement and as such
was tolerated by the Imperial authorities. However, in
the Solomani Rim War period its members carried out
a bitter campaign of murder, intimidation and terrorism
on several worlds, and the organisation is now officially
banned within the Imperium.


Numbers and membership of the LNR are of course not
known. It is likely the group has the backing of high-
up Imperial nobles of pro-Vilani leanings but thus far
nothing has been proven. At present the main function
of the LNR is to provide funding and a platform to
those with anti-Solomani leanings. As such, it is much
more active in the sectors neighbouring the Solomani
Rim than in Ley but there are always those keen to
denounce their opponents on vid shows and the LNR
supports them where it finds them. The organisation
has links to a movement within the Church of Stellar
Divinity which preaches that some stars are wrong and
that most of those can be found in Solomani Space.
This faction sometimes refers to Solomani people and
businesses as children of an evil star, and has gone as
far as to incite riots and persecution.







MATARISHAN FREEDOM MOVEMENT
The MFM promotes autonomy and even independence
for former worlds of the Matarishan Federation. It is
primarily a peaceful political movement which works
through rallies, political pressure and similar legal
means. However, the MFM does undertake more
dubious activities. Its legal experts are quick to offer
their services – for free – to anyone involved in a legal
dispute with Imperial interests and its expert agitators
will advise any dissident group on how best to (legally)
make a nuisance of themselves.


The MFM is thought to have funded more radical
activities at various times, such as sabotage or even
groups such as the Matarishan Liberation Army. The
MLA is a guerrilla, but carefully not terrorist, force that
attempts the occasional covert strike against Imperial
or megacorporate assets. This link has never been
proven and it is likely that the MFM as such is clean,
although quite willing to encourage others to attempt
armed resistance to the Imperials.


NON-IMPERIAL UPERCORPORATIONS
Huge mercantile or industrial conglomerates similar to
the Imperial megacorps do exist outside the Imperium.
Far larger and more powerful than any planetary
corporation, these supercorps are more limited in the
scope and distribution of their activities but can rival
the megacorporations in terms of local influence. In
addition, a great many supercorps smaller firms exist
across the Trailing Frontier. Those listed here are
the ones with enough economic power to make their
influence felt in political circles.


THE DEEPNIGHT CORPORATION
Normally associated with long-range exploration and
missions into areas of rift, the Deepnight Corporation
has interests in Gateway that go beyond the Lesser
Rift. In addition to two very large ships working the
Lesser Rift, the Deepnight Corporation has a number
of smaller ships collecting data and investigating
backwater worlds in Gateway.


FOUR SECTORS ARMS
Four Sectors is a large business group similar
to Instellarms in the Imperium. However, where
Instellarms deals in mercenaries as well as weaponry,


Four Sectors is purely a provider of hardware. Its sales
policies vary from region-to-region but are for the most
part rather loose. Four Sectors has even been known
to bankroll planetary insurrections for its own ends.


GATEWAY SHIPPING (GS)
Gateway Shipping is a sector-wide firm that constructs
starships, trains their crews and operates the vessels
on behalf of client worlds. Specialising in bulk trans-
ports and secure couriers, GS maintains offices at
many worlds of the former Galian Trade League and
smaller facilities elsewhere. The firm appears not to
have a political agenda besides gaining a monopoly on
the bulk shipping market.


GATEWAY METALS (GM)
A successor to the ancient and hugely successful
Galastrian Metals, GM is a major mining and industrial
concern based out of Gateway Prime. Its facilities can
be found across the sector and even in the coreward
end of Crucis Margin.


MAE LINES
Founded by Marcus Aaron Erechs before his eleva-
tion to the post of archduke, MAE Lines has long
been the foundation of the Erechs dynasty’s wealth.
It consists of numerous small and medium-sized
passenger ships and freightliners which tradition-
ally operated in the rimward end of Ley. Since the
deposition of Archduke Stephen Erechs, MAE Lines
has shifted its emphasis. Some vessels now serve
as auxiliaries for the Loyal Sector Guard and the
former archduke’s own forces in the region known as
The Gate. Those still operating as commercial ships
primarily carry out cross-border trade centring on the
former archduke’s new baronial seat at Zuge.


TRASARIAN FACTORS, INCORPORATED
Trasarian is an old firm with offices across Gateway,
Glimmerdrift Reaches and Crucis Margin. Trasar-
ian deals mainly in cargo brokerage, insurance and
finance. Its true worth is unknown but probably stag-
gering. Trasarian has several world governments in its
pocket and is well known for interfering in local affairs in
order to gain a greater profit margin.





Bounded to coreward-trailing and rimward-spinward
by areas of rift, Ley lies at the very edge of the Third
Imperium. The sector is a gateway into or out of Impe-
rial space, which along with the adjoining sector name
is a reason the Imperial Domain was named Gateway
and not Ley. This route is important to trade and other
missions directed towards the Hive Federation and Two
Thousand Worlds. Fornast, lying to spinward, leads to
the Imperial Core, while some trade comes in from An-
tares and Empty Quarter sectors to spinward-coreward
and coreward respectively. Other than a few worlds in
the Glimmerdrift Reaches to rimward, Ley has no other
borders with Imperial space.


Travel into Gateway, located directly to trailing, is
somewhat limited. The most practical jump-2 route
runs through independent space dominated by the
powerful world of Phoniwt. Higher-jump ships have
more choice but this fact of astrography still imposes
restrictions on Imperial interests in that direction.
Access to Glimmerdrift Reaches to rimward is much
easier. Several worlds in this sector belong to the
Imperium and Imperial trade ships move across the
border with considerable frequency.


Ley has certain distinct astrographical regions. The four
spinward-coreward subsectors (Ikhnaton, Nightmare,
Spearhead and Guadix Drift) have the greatest star
density of the sector and are unofficially known as the
Daramm Sphere. The majority of worlds in this part of
the sector lie in the Great Ley Cluster or the Reaching
Arm, a long main giving jump-1 or jump-2 access to
most of the sector. The Gateway Main enters the sector
from coreward of the Great Ley Cluster, giving jump-2
access to the large Riftsedge Cluster. Trade and infor-
mation from Antares Sector and the core of the Impe-
rium generally arrive in Ley along these two mains.


It is no coincidence the Daramm Sphere is the most
developed part of the sector, with much in common
with the Imperial heartlands. The fringes of Ley have
more of a frontier feeling to them but most citizens of
these four subsectors would consider themselves to
be far from the borders in terms of culture, outlook
and interest in what goes on outside the Imperium.
The exception is trading companies interested in the
transborder markets and Imperial officials charged with
keeping an eye on external affairs.


The sector economy is largely centred in the Daramm
Sphere, which have a number of highly developed
market worlds such as Rurur. This world is the head-
quarters for the regional operations branch of Tukera
Lines, which maintains a private repair and refit yard.
Tukera vessels operate mainly on the internal lines
between the major worlds of the sector and operate
services into Fornast and Antares sectors. Tukera has
little interest in the frontier regions of the sector and
virtually none in trans-border operations.


The region trailingward of the Daramm Sphere is
largely empty space forming part of the Lesser Rift
or the various Riftfingers. Isolated worlds lie in these
vast gulfs but the majority of inhabited worlds are
found in Titanstorm subsector. These mostly lie on
the end of the Reaching Arm or in the Riftsedge
Cluster. The Lesser Rift provides a safe border,
making this area very much an internal Imperial
region despite lying on its outer fringe. Culturally,
the region is mainly Imperial, although strong
influences still exist from the many years of isolation
and independence after the Long Night. Whilst most
worlds are loyal Imperial members, quite major
cultural variations do exist.


To rimward of the Daramm Sphere, stellar density is
much lower. Satyressia subsector in particular is very
sparse. This creates a barrier between this part of
Ley and the rest of the Imperium, and as a result the
area receives little interstellar traffic. Elsewhere there
is more trade but it is mostly local to the clusters with
the occasional large freighter connecting them to
the sector economy as a whole. The most significant
astrographic feature of this end of the sector is the
Serpent Main, which runs through Diamond-Prince
and Outreaumer subsectors. The Serpent Main gives
jump-2 access the Annapabar Cluster, which is one
of the most politically and economically important
areas of the sector.


The Annapabar Cluster was for a time designated the
Imperial Trade Cluster and is still unofficially referred
to as the ITC. This region was the focus of a great deal
of investment during the period immediately after the
Domain capital was moved there, although this focused
mainly on starport development and some supporting

industries. The cluster is the marshalling point for
most trade moving out of the Imperial borders towards
Gateway and for goods coming in by the same route. A
great deal of money is made from trade and commerce
in this area, but since the local worlds mostly have low
populations, their industrial base is insignificant.

The naval base at Zuge is almost entirely dedicated
to protecting Imperial interests in Outworld subsector.
It has a greater than usual complement of small
patrol craft and a few destroyers. These range across
Outworld or sit over worlds there as guardships.
Cruisers and larger patrol vessels stage through this
base as well, usually heading out into Gateway. The
base at Glen Murdoch is more concerned with securing
and defending the cluster. This mission includes
customs checks on vessels crossing the Imperial
border as well as ensuring the cluster is a safe place to
conduct commerce.

The trailing-rimward corner of Ley contains a
considerable number of non-Imperial worlds. The only
significant polity is the Khuur League but the world
of Phoniwt also wields considerable influence. These
worlds lie in a strategically important region, as far as
the Imperium is concerned, and are very much an area
of interest. How this translates to action and relations
depends on internal factors and can vary considerably.
So long as the trade lane out to Gateway bypassing
the League and Phoniwt remains open, the situation is
generally satisfactory. Long-term plans to annex and
fortify the area have progressed little in a century.

The sector capital and main naval base are at Dukh,
which lies close to the centre of the sector and
dominates the economy of the Dukh Cluster. However,
the Dukh Cluster is a little isolated due to astrography
and as a result much of the sector administrative
apparatus is at Daramm, five parsecs away. Petitioners
and protestors tend to head for Daramm due to ease of
access, a situation that suits the sector administration.
The systems around Daramm are designated the
Luriani Cultural Association and neighbouring worlds
are strongly influenced by Luriani culture. This influence
spreads out to the surrounding regions to some degree
but in most of the sector hundreds of years of Imperial
dominance have created a more typical Imperial-
standard-with-minor-local-variations culture.

Within the Imperial border there are supposedly no
multiworld powers but the Luriani Cultural Association
comes close to being one. Its unusual mix of Luriani,
Terran and Vilani culture is protected by Imperial laws
and along with traditional ties, creates an unofficial
internal alliance with significant political and economic


power. This loose but very well-established affinity has
resulted in the worlds of the LCA heavily influencing
the actions of the sector duke and the archduke – or
opposing them to the point of creating a protracted
power struggle. This is one of the factors restricting
development of the sector and expansion beyond.


The vast majority of people in Ley are human (of vari-
ous types) with the largest minorities being Vargr in Im-
perial space. Various minor species are present as part
of the Imperium or native to one of the worlds of the
region. The majority of the sector is Imperial territory,
with most of the remaining worlds either independent
or forming part of the Khuur League. Leaving Imperial
space to trailing or rimward (around the rift edges) will
take Travellers into a region of independent worlds,
pocket empires and client states. Some of these poli-
ties have a human population, some are alien and
many are mixed. This area lies between the Imperium
and the Two Thousand Worlds (to trailing) and the Hive
Federation (to rimward-trailing). Intrigue is common
among the minor states in the region.


The worlds of Daramm and Shamokin maintain large
naval yards capable of constructing Dreadnought-class
ships, although Shamokin specialises in cruiser and
destroyer sized vessels for the most part. Most of the
sector’s major naval units are concentrated around the
Dukh naval complex and the depot in the Ugiirkidan
system (1420). The sector fleet is understrength and
poorly equipped but the subsector fleets are up to the
task of protecting commerce and keeping the peace.
Lighter forces are maintained throughout the sector,
with elements of the Imperial Navy forward-deployed in
the territory of the Galian Federation.

The Ikhnaton subsector lies at the spinward-coreward
corner of Ley and is very much an internal Imperial region.
It contains 35 star systems with an average Tech Level of

8. Approximately 85% of the subsector’s population dwell
in a TL5 society on the world of Lousanne, with about a
billion people scattered across the rest of the subsector.
There are no uninhabited star systems but some are of
little economic or industrial value.


The majority of worlds in Ikhnaton lie on the Gateway
Main, with considerable jump-1 traffic moving up and
down on a constant basis. Security is provided by
the 17th Fleet, on paper a typical subsector fleet. The
bases at Amikell and Kiiriirshi are small, hosting patrol
craft and a few destroyers at most. Their remit is patrol
of the subsector, which is generally safe and secure.
The naval base at Secord, within the Luriani Cultural
Association, is a fleet base used primarily by assets
of the Ley Sector Fleet. It does host some subsector
fleet assets for local security but its primary function is
to support warfighting elements of the navy, such as
battleships and cruisers plus their support vessels.


The businesses of the Ley Sector Commercial Alliance
(LSCA) are highly active in Ikhnaton, competing as a
bloc against other interests. Their main opponents are
the Sharurshid and Tukera megacorporations, both
of whom traditionally have interests in the area. The
prize in their struggle is control of the lucrative trade
routes to and from the rest of the Imperium. For the
most part, the conflict is limited to business competition
and legal obstacles thrown in one another’s way but
the occasional covert operation by mercenaries or
elements of a security service will derail a plan or set
up a political and legal gambit. This sort of cut-throat
competition is acceptable to the Imperium so long as
the economy as a whole is not harmed.


KIIRIIRSHI
Kiiriirshi is a balkanised world with a total population
of around eight million. Its very thin atmosphere limits
plant life to lichens and similar forms, and might not be
sufficient to retain liquid water if the surface temperature
were not so low. The world lies on the outer edge of the
system’s warm zone and is only barely habitable without
sophisticated equipment. As a result, the world’s seas
are covered in a thick layer of ice which is broken in
places near thermal vents. Cities are small and widely
spread out, mostly located near a sea from which water
is desalinated to irrigate vast glazed-over farms.


The cities of Kiiriirshi are more or less self-governing,
each with its own spaceport connecting to the large
orbital highport. This is a stopover for shipping
plying the Gateway Main but the port itself is owned
by a commercial consortium rather than the non-
existent world government. A small percentage of
profits are shared between the city-states, providing
a modest income which is insufficient to support
major investment. The real ruler of Kiiriirshi is the
Imperial Navy, which placed the headquarters of the
subsector fleet in a large, purpose-built installation
near the equator.


Although the naval installation and associated city
represent the largest and most technologically
advanced community on Kiiriirshi, they are officially
offworld holdings and not considered part of the
planetary population. However, since its construction
the installation has provided mediators and assistance
in various crises and its commandant is generally
viewed as the closest thing to a planetary leader
Kiiriirshi will ever have. The world is effectively a
military dictatorship but a voluntary and peaceable one.


The groundside naval installation houses only a few
starships. Most are based at an orbital mooring which
orbits opposite to the highport. Facilities there are
basic since personnel can go planetside aboard a
constant cycle of shuttles. These also visit the city-
states, which derive additional income from personnel
on leave. Overall, the navy is well-liked on Kiiriirshi
and most cities have a pre-enlistment education

package run by naval personnel on secondment. A
surprisingly large proportion of the population end up
joining the navy or a supporting industry. This is not
really to the benefit of the cities, as most venturing out
into the wider universe never come back. This makes
Kiiriirshi one of the many worlds which contribute
more to the Imperium than they receive in return, but
on the whole the populace seem content this way.

LOUSANNE
Lousanne is an entirely habitable, if dry, world on the
spinward fringe of Ley. It is home to around seven
billion people, almost all humans, divided among
three planetary superpowers and multiple smaller
states. Lousanne’s history, almost since the day it
was colonised, has been characterised by friction
and outbreaks of violence. At any given time, there
are insurgencies or low-intensity conflicts going on in
several parts of the world, with major wars breaking out
less often but causing greater disruption.

In an effort to limit the violence, quotas have been
placed on the amount and type of military hardware it is
permissible to bring in, and mercenary operations are
subject to stricter rules than elsewhere. A division of the
Imperial Army is stationed at the downport to enforce
its neutrality, along with aerospace defence forces and
air units. Beyond the no-fly, no-fight zone, Lousanne is
something of a free-for-all but has not been given an
amber travel designation. This is mainly because the
port is very safe and visitors rarely venture beyond it.

The world’s Class C starport is large but basic. The
surrounding startown has military zones for Imperial
troops and a wider residential area with little industry.
The population has been steadily growing, as refugees
leave a troubled area and seek the safety of the port.
This is not a huge problem since the Imperial Army
spends a lot of money in the town, supporting a vibrant
entertainment industry. The port is becoming famous
for its bars, restaurants and even high-end theatres,
attracting a monied clientele from offworld. This has
created a sharp divide between the squabbling nations
of Lousanne, impoverished by over-sized militaries and
the startown population who enjoy prosperity so long as
the world’s troubles continue.


MONEY AND POLITICS IN IKHNATON
Ikhnaton is an internal subsector of the Imperium
and has the problems of one. Its markets and
starports are well established, with solid information
available on local conditions to anyone willing to
seek it out or pay for it. World governments are minor
players in the politics of the subsector compared
to the megacorporations and business groups that
dominate its economy and politics.


For those seeking a relatively safe and genteel place to
find a job or make a modest profit, regions like this are
attractive due to their stability. The big money, however,
is to be made from disrupting that stability. Markets can
be manipulated by interfering with trade ships, although
this is risky as various Imperial High Laws forbid
actions that damage the economy.


Military actions tend to be small and precise, favouring
commando units and strike teams rather than major
warfighting formations. Piracy and commerce raiding is
all but suicidal for those without connections but there
are opportunities for those who affiliate themselves with
one of the big players. The same applies to traders and
entrepreneurs; the megacorps have the major markets
sewn up but make use of ‘little fish’ here and there. As
elsewhere in the Imperium, commercial success goes
to those who can develop the right political contacts
and political success is the province of those with
money. Everyone else competes for the scraps along
the fringes – but those scraps can be very large by the
standards of the typical small-ship operator.

Nightmare borders Empty Quarter sector to coreward.
Despite its name, the spinward side of Empty Quarter
has an average stellar density. It is a developed region
and whilst most interstellar trade comes into Nightmare
by way of the Gateway Main there are better links to
Empty Quarter from the main grouping of worlds in
Nightmare than to trailing or rimward.


Most of the 31 star systems of Nightmare are part of
the Riftsedge Cluster, which has a significant internal
economy. Most shipping into the cluster comes by way
of the Gateway Main and a jump-2 transit between
Giann Osi and either 911-851 or Shaasi. Plans to
improve the starport at Shaasi have been mooted at
various times but always foundered amid wrangling
over some legal detail. In the end, the problem was
solved by constructing an independent port at 911-851.




The world’s own port is hardly worthy of the name but
Theralia Orbital is equivalent to a Class B highport with
no associated groundside facility.


The sector capital, Dukh, is located on the rimward
edge of Nightmare. With the surrounding five star
systems, Dukh is part of the Luriani Cultural Association
and is rather isolated from the rest of the subsector.
The highest jump range likely to be viable aboard a
commercial ship is two parsecs, making it necessary
to undertake a laborious transit to reach Dukh from
the Riftsedge Cluster. Few operators consider it worth
the trouble but there are regular if infrequent services
between Dukh and Kukugukhe.


Responsibility for securing the subsector rests with the
52 nd Fleet, which has its headquarters at Kukugukhe.
Elements of the fleet are based at Saala Kis to protect
shipping in the area, with a small force at Dukh. The
subsector admiral faces a difficult political decision
regarding this deployment. Dukh does not need a
subsector fleet deployment to provide security as it has its
own entirely adequate forces, and elements of the sector
fleet are based there. Nor do the surrounding systems
require a great deal of protection. On the other hand, the
52 nd Fleet is required to maintain a presence and the navy
does not want the sector duke or visiting dignitaries to see
old ships crewed by second-rate personnel. Therefore,
Dukh Naval Base receives the newest vessels and the
most politically savvy commanders whilst the rest of the
fleet does its best with what is left over.


The 52nd Fleet is also responsible for the handful of
Imperial worlds in Noir Deep. Forces deployed to this
subsector are based out of Kedakhume. The base there
was originally built as a sector fleet installation capable
of supporting squadrons of battleships. Much of it is
mothballed, with the small contingent of destroyers and
corvettes operating out of a secondary docking area.


911-851
911-851 is a low-value world in a strategically important
system. Offering a jump-2 link between the Gateway
Main and the Riftsedge Cluster, the star system is
officially listed as having a Class E starport since this
is the facility associated with the mainworld. 911-851
is not somewhere anyone would choose to visit; a
corrosive hell-hole valuable mainly for the materials
extracted from its atmosphere and seas. There is no
permanent population as such but around six million
workers and their dependents are resident at any given
time. Governmental services are provided by Varst
Chemicals LIC, which owns most facilities and allows
others to operate on a lease basis.

Extraction of useful chemicals is typically accomplished
by processing liquids drawn in from the seas, at large
static plants. A few facilities specialise in extraction of
gases from the atmosphere or solids from the planetary
crust. The latter requires quarrying of great masses
of rock in a promising area and transportation to a
processing facility. It has proven easier to make the
facilities mobile, mostly as great crawlers but in a few
cases grav mobility is used. Most facilities have their
own port, equivalent to a Class E starport with better
bulk loading capabilities. The mobile extraction rigs
are served by small shuttles or enterprising starship
operators, whilst the larger facilities typically have a
dedicated bulk shuttle with machinery to transfer a
cargo to a ship in orbit. Whilst entrepreneurs might be
willing to risk their ship in a corrosive atmosphere for
a good profit, those with vessels large enough to ship
materials in bulk are not usually willing to do so.


Normally, starport construction is the concern of the
mainworld government and given the location of 911-851
a decent quality port could make a great deal of profit.
However, Varst Chemicals has little interest in making the
investment. The problem was solved around 40 years ago
when a consortium of businesses was granted permission
to construct a facility in orbit around the system’s
innermost gas giant. Construction proceeded more
slowly than intended but today Theralia Highport provides
a jump-2 link out to the Gateway Main. Considerable
volumes of traffic pass through, completely ignoring the
mainworld. Meanwhile Varst Chemicals continues to
operate the mainworld as a corporate holding. It is unlikely
this situation will ever change; 911-851 does not even
merit a name let alone a major starport.




KUKUGUKHE
The unofficial capital of the Riftsedge Cluster, Kuku-
gukhe is a major exporter of foodstuffs despite its thin
atmosphere and dryish conditions. Farming is some-
what technology-intensive but this is not a problem
for the planet’s TL12 citizens. The planetary popula-
tion, numbering around 800,000, are mostly scattered
across the globe in communities of between 1,000 and
10,000, each with numerous outlying farmsteads. Gov-
ernment is by the Agriguild, once a collective bargain-
ing organisation designed to serve the farmers’ needs,
now a complete governmental apparatus.

Citizens are fairly content with their government, which
is not particularly intrusive. The Agriguild is inflexible,
and accepts no input on many subjects, but its rules
only affect certain aspects of life. Most of the world’s
laws and regulations have become a traditional part
of society and are accepted without thinking by the
populace. Indeed, no citizen would even consider defy-
ing the price-fixing edicts or standard reimbursement
clauses in their work contracts.

In addition to foodstuffs, Kukugukhe exports small
quantities of extremely high-quality agricultural ma-
chinery and farming robots through its Class A starport,
which is something of a commercial centre for the sur-
rounding systems. Most larger cargo vessels entering
the cluster head straight for Kukugukhe, bypassing the
lesser markets along the way. A great variety of goods
can be found for sale at Kukugukhe’s highport, much of
it bought up by small-ship operators serving the rest of
the cluster. The port also does a steady trade in refits
for these small merchant ships.

A number of successful firms are based out of Kuku-
gukhe, which offers home office facilities and tax breaks
to investors. Most notable of these firms is Universal
Factoring LIC, which specialises in facilitating the busi-
ness dealings of others. Universal actually owns nothing
other than offices at important trade ports, yet makes a
fortune out of trading on behalf of others. In the 990s, it
barely survived an investigation by the Ministry of Justice
regarding some irregularities in its dealings but has since
rebuilt its reputation and holdings.

REFUELLING FACILITIES
In some cases, the starport listing for a system apparently
does not make sense. A world lying on a main or major
trade route, with no useful starport, is an impediment to
trade which would have immense effects on the local
economy. This might reflect a recent disaster which will


cause temporary mayhem but economic realities would
not permit a break in the trade lanes for any length of time

- and such a break might make the economic status of
some worlds in the region nonsensical.


The answer is that the system UWP indicates the
starport of the mainworld, which might be rather
primitive. However, it is not uncommon for outside
agencies to create some kind of refuelling facility or
even a full port elsewhere in the system. Typically
this is in orbit around a gas giant, enabling fuel to be
skimmed by craft operating out of the port. Vessels
coming to the port for refuelling will usually conduct
some trade or buy services, generating an income
for the port’s operators. Alternatively, tankers may be
positioned in a strategic system to provide fuel and
little more in the way of services. This enables a jump-
1 trade route to get through a system with a desert
mainworld, Class E starport and no gas giant.


Both of these setups can be the death knell for a
planetary economy. Trade ships will bypass the mainworld
and its economy will stagnate. A deal may be negotiated
whereby the port operators pay a fee for the right to place
their installation in the mainworld’s system. This is usually
the case in the Imperium, where the economies of worlds
are protected by various laws which also regulate the
wider pan-Imperial economy. Beyond the Imperium it is
more a matter of capability. If a mainworld has the ability
to harass traffic using a port in its system, it can usually
negotiate a fee. If not, there is nothing that can be done
and the world will likely become a backwater.

Noir Deep contains seven star systems, all located
along its spinward edge. These systems are Imperial
territory but there is no assigned subsector fleet.
Instead, vessels of the 52nd Fleet provide security
patrols and elements of the sector fleet occasionally
pass through on the way to Zagrathian subsector.
The vast majority of the subsector’s population is
concentrated on the world of Damzi which, despite its
immense population base, remains economically and
politically insignificant.


Noir Deep is not really on the way to anywhere and
as such sees virtually no through traffic. A few trade
ships venture out to the very edge of the Imperium
but, overall, the subsector is very much a place where
nothing changes and little happens. The only incident
of note in recent years was caused by increased
interest in rift exploration. A handful of expeditions
went out from the trailing worlds, operating from
temporary bases which have now mostly been
dismantled. No great discoveries were made, at least
according to the public databases.


DAMZI
Damzi is an old colony that never stood a chance.
Damzi is a desert world with a very thin atmosphere,
home to around 90 billion people. Its cities are located
atop natural aquifers which are the only source of
water. Virtually the entire world’s industrial production
is used for subsistence, such as building machinery to
serve the vast irrigation networks required to grow any
sort of crops. The local diet is almost entirely vegetarian
due to the lack of animal species capable of surviving
in these conditions. Exports are minimal, meaning there
is no money for investment or to buy offworld goods.
As a result, Damzi is of little importance and merchant

Outsiders often ask why anyone would travel all the
way from Sol to colonise such a difficult world. The
simple answer is they did not intend to. Breaking off
from a convoy of Rule of Man era colony ships, the
mission that settled this world did so out of desperation.
With their ship suffering serious malfunctions and
nothing but open rift ahead, the colonists chose a
likely system and made one last jump. Their intended
destination is not known but they were unfortunate
enough to misjump into a system with a marginal world.
With their jump drive beyond repair the colonists landed
on what is now Damzi and tried to make the best of it.


They did very well considering their circumstances. This
was a double-edged sword; an expanding population
absorbed resources that could have been used to create
industry and make a better quality of life. Instead, the




population expanded to fill the available accommodation
as soon as it was ready, with ever greater efforts
required to produce enough food to support the
population. The colony ship was still spaceworthy
despite it no longer being able to achieve jump, and
alongwith subordinate craft was used to transport
contingents to different parts of the planet. Wherever
conditions were good enough, a settlement was built.


Spreading out like this might seem counter-intuitive
but it indicates the mindset of the colonists. They
accepted their position was precarious and chose not
to put all their eggs in a single basket. In short, they set
out to survive in the long term despite anything their
unwelcoming new home might throw at them. This
decision was probably wise since some settlements
did meet with disaster. The colony ship finally broke
down whilst evacuating personnel from one of the failed
cities, leading to great loss of life, and since then the
cities have endured as best they can.


Quality of life on Damzi is not bad. The world has a
modest TL9 industrial base, with reasonable medical
service and comforts in the form of labour-saving
appliances. Indeed, this is the main reason for
economic and industrial stagnation; the need to support
such a large population at an acceptable level absorbs
every scrap of effort. There are those who are pushing
for an austerity campaign, accepting a lower standard
of living for a generation in order to build an economy
capable of breaking the cycle. This is a non-starter,
ever since its initial advocates were discovered to be
spending government money on their own lifestyles
whilst calling for the general population to go without.


It seems likely that Damzi will continue in the
same manner until its resources are completely
overstretched. This may have already happened. Some
cities are struggling to maintain their infrastructure,
notably water recycling and waste management. If
this is true, there are grim times ahead for the people
of Damzi. Ling Standard Products have offered an
assistance package but it came with too many strings
attached to be palatable at the time. That may change
once the cities start breaking down.


DEAD-END COLONIES
Most colonisation of the Trailing Frontier took place
at the very end of the Ramshackle Empire era or the
beginning of the Long Night. Records from this time are
patchy and of course those that have survived show
only where the colony missions were intended to go.
Many ended up somewhere else or were lost either

en route or after settlement. There was little chance of
mutual assistance during the period after settlement;
most colony ships were worn out or used for in-system
operations. As a result, the fate of many colony
missions remains unknown.


It is possible to puzzle out what happened to some from
fragments of information found along their route. Old
records may show a colony ship passing through an
inhabited system and trading information gained along
the way for assistance. Some colony ships travelled
around Gateway for a while, stopping at established
settlements and either joining or trading with them. The
newcomers tried to take over and fought with those
already in place, or were ambushed and robbed of their
equipment. Later follow-on missions further muddied
the waters. Colonies that did well sometimes began
exploring the local region and even setting up additional
outposts or resource extraction programmes.


Those colonies that did well are, for the most part,
the basis of the modern human states in Gateway.
Evidence of others turns up from time-to-time, usually
in the form of ruins or starship wrecks. Not all of these
are on habitable worlds; sometimes a colony ship
began to fail and was hurriedly turned into a living-
place on the nearest rockball. The only hope for these
emergency settlements was for another ship to come
along and accept the population. This rarely happened
and without outside assistance these communities died
out long ago. Others made it to borderline worlds and
struggled to survive there. Of these, few communities
still exist. The majority were absorbed into more
successful states – usually with gratitude – and a
handful continue to struggle along in the modern era.





Zagrathian lies entirely outside the Imperial border,
although some of its governments are Imperial client
states. There is no internal economy to speak of and
virtually no interstellar trade. A jump-4 transit of the
whole subsector is possible but this does require going
by way of Khaanlisha in Osiris Deep. Imperial navy
vessels visiting these worlds almost always travel
with tanker support, which has occasionally been
extended to civilian ships taking part in a special project
sanctioned by the sector administration.


For the most part Zagrathian is irrelevant but its worlds
live close enough to Imperial space to be used as
a base by a foreign power. Leaving areas like the
coreward end of Ley lightly defended frees up ships
for deployment elsewhere but this is only possible
if regular intelligence gathering takes place. The
cheapest way to do this is to subsidise a few civilian
ships to operate in the area, feeding reports to an
intelligence office at Dafoe.


Zagrathian can be considered to consist of two
groupings of worlds. The four systems at the rimward
end are reachable by a jump-3 vessel out of Dafoe,
whilst the four at the coreward end are more isolated
but can be connected by a jump-3 ship. This area of
operations also includes Tapendra in neighbouring
Yashodhra subsector. Imperial presence in this area
is very limited, as the navy is more interested in
Darksky to trailing.


DAFOE
Dafoe appears, at first glance, to be a reasonable
prospect for colonisation. It has little surface water but
extensive – and very hardy – vegetation. Most plant

species are similar to cacti and other desert flora,
growing in thick, impenetrable beds which preserve
a little moisture in the soil beneath. These have
proven a real problem on Dafoe, as they grow quickly
but have virtually no nutritional value. They impede
movement and are difficult to remove, and to cap it
all they reproduce using spores which are toxic to
humans. Breathing Dafoe’s atmosphere without a filter
risks spore growth in the respiratory tract, leading to
breathing difficulties and sometimes death.


Unsurprisingly perhaps, the human population of
Dafoe is small and clustered in a ring of towns around
a single small city. Economically insignificant, Dafoe
derives most of its income from its naval base. This
is an expansion of the highport built specifically to
house a few vessels of the Ley Sector Fleet. Standing
deployment is a few couriers and a token escort or
two plus a tanker or supply ship but there is usually at
least one jump-5 capable cruiser in the region. This
vessel is rarely in port but instead makes long sweeps
to coreward by way of New Durbin or trailingward
through Isolation. The primary concern of the local
commander is the K’Kree client state to coreward of
the Hochiken People’s Assembly.


The Imperial Navy pays over the odds to be able to
stage ships out of Dafoe, a generally satisfactory
arrangement for all parties. Money spent keeping
a cruiser out in Zagrathian is vastly offset by the
savings permitted by not having to heavily garrison
the coreward end of Ley. Monitoring the ‘safe’ frontier
of Ley may be a boring deployment much of the time
but there is still the potential for excitement. The
worlds of this subsector receive so little traffic that



an Imperial Navy cruiser might be the only source of
assistance in a crisis. This, and the money spent by
crewmembers on liberty, makes the navy welcome in
most of the subsector.

RIFT EXPLORATION MISSIONS
Areas of rift are not entirely empty. They have no main-
sequence or giant stars which means the presence of
any sort of inhabited body is highly unlikely. However,
rifts may contain comets, rogue planets, unusual
phenomena and even brown dwarf sub-stellar objects

which may have moons. The feeble energy emitted
by such bodies makes them difficult to detect at any
distance but can be sufficient to make conditions
tolerable for extremely primitive life. Anything more
advanced than lichen found on such a body is almost
certainly imported, which may raise some questions.


Strategically, rifts provide a clear and usually safe
border, which can lead to the development of blind
spots. An enemy could – at least in theory – cross an
area of rift using pre-positioned refuelling points or
tankers to make a strike into a weakly defended area.
In practice, this is only feasible as a small-force raid
but there is a real possibility for damage. It is virtually
impossible to detect preparations for such an attack,
as the chances of stumbling on the vessels involved
is infinitesimally small given the volume of space that
would have to be searched. Likewise, chancing on a
suitable refuelling spot such as a cache or deep-space
icy comet is incredibly unlikely.


However, by monitoring known refuelling points such as
comets or the systems deep within a rift it is possible to
be reasonably sure no-one is sneaking across. For this
reason, the authorities are keen to ensure rift space is
properly charted. Official expeditions are occasionally
mounted but private exploration companies make
up the majority of the effort made to chart deep-
space rocks and comets. Occasionally something
truly amazing is discovered but for the most part rift
exploration is a matter of meticulously analysing long-
range sensor data and plotting a jump to what turns out
to be an unremarkable deep-space rock.





The worlds of Spearhead lie mainly on the Great
Ley Cluster or a rimward spur of the Reaching Arm
which terminates at Es Al Insi and Weston. Daramm,
at the centre of the cluster, is the Luriani homeworld
and capital of the Luriani Cultural Association. It also
serves as a secondary capital for the sector. More of
the sector duke’s business is conducted at Daramm
through proxies than actually comes to Dukh, largely
as a result of astrographic realities. Imperiallines
maintains a regular liner, freighter and VIP transport
link between the two worlds. The lack of high-quality
ports on a jump-2 or even jump-3 route prompted
the decision to set up a jump-4 direct route. This
is expensive but gives those who can afford it a
significant advantage over those who have to transit
two parsecs at a time through the backwaters.


Security for the subsector is the responsibility of the
124 th Fleet, which has its headquarters at Daramm
although most of its assets are based at Mur Mura
and Qaarz. The reasons for this are political rather
than strategic; such is the importance of Daramm that
the subsector admiral has to be there. This makes
the upper echelons of subsector naval command
available to the archduke’s proxies, who tend to have
a lot of requests for action. The subsector fleet’s
command squadron is based at Daramm but most of its
destroyers and escorts operate from the other bases.
Elements of the sector fleet are usually also present
at Daramm, typically a single BatRon or two CruRons,
although this can vary. Daramm’s shipyards produce
most of the sector fleet’s capital ships, so at any given
time there may be vessels undergoing trials in the
outsystem or half-built on the ways.


ASHMAZE
Ashmaze is a mid-tech world on the rimward spur
of the Reaching Arm. This part of the main does not
receive much in the way of through traffic compared to
the worlds of the Great Ley Cluster and there is not all
that much to recommend Ashmaze itself. An average-
sized world with a thin but breathable atmosphere, the
surface is mostly covered by wide oceans which are
both deep and very cold. The world itself is something
of an iceball with little animal life outside of the seas.
What life there is, is hardy indeed.

## SPEARHEAD SUBSECTOR


The most important sites in the system, including the
starport, are not located on the mainworld. Ashmaze is
orbited by two small satellites, Isek and Teill. Isek is the
site of the world’s small starport, owned and operated
by Sharurshid. The port is not extensive but has a large
startown used as an R&R facility by Sharurshid vessels
in the region. Personnel not working for Sharurshid can
use the facilities but employees receive preference and
discounted rates. Most vessels passing through the
system simply call at the port and never visit the planet.
The other moon has a small mining installation but it is
otherwise uninhabited.


The dwarf planet Ekamga, located on the fringe of the
innermost planetoid belt, is home to a scout base. In
addition to the usual information processing and chart-
updating work done at all such installations, Ekamga
Base is also an x-boat maintenance facility. Boats are
routinely rotated through the base after a few months
in service, rarely going back to the same route. The
base’s datanet site posts a list of the most well-travelled
x-boats and those farthest from their point of origin.
This data is surprisingly popular, with virtual x-boat
spotters on many worlds receiving updates by way of
the very boats the base exists to serve.


Ashmaze itself is home to a small permanent popula-
tion, numbering some 6,000 or so. The majority of
these are hunters and trappers who wander the plan-
et’s wilderness for months at a time before returning
to the one permanent settlement on the entire planet.
There, they sell their catch to offworld traders. The
settlement has a small spaceport equivalent to a Class
D installation. The locals have a basic TL7 economy
but their rugged lifestyle leaves them little time nor incli-
nation towards the possession of consumer goods.


Elsewhere on the planet, small prospecting outfits (pri-
vate and corporate) are searching for mineral and hy-
drocarbon deposits. These workers, numbering about
1,000, are transient and not counted as part of the
planetary population. Visitors to Ashmaze are advised
to obtain the services of a local trapper if they venture
afield; the local wildlife can be dangerous. Similarly, the
locals do not like offworlders killing fauna at random
since this affects their livelihood.

**SPINY-TAILED SEGGE**
The spiny-tailed Segge (pronounced ‘seg’, with a
hard g) is a typical example of Ashmaze’s ecosystem.
Roughly the size of a badger, the Segge has a ridge of
spines similar to a porcupine running down its back and
covering its tail. These bristle up when the animal feels
threatened, accompanied by hissing and tail-lashing
that leaves no-one in any doubt they are intruding.
Segges are herbivorous but territorial, and will attack
creatures larger than themselves to protect their range.
They are mostly solitary but a number of females will
usually have overlapping territories serviced by the
dominant male in the area. Fights between males are
common and usually fatal.

The Segge is adept at hunkering down in whatever
cover is available, using loose dirt to create partial
concealment, and will do so to keep warm for long
periods when food is scarce. They store food in
scrapes in the ground, which they will defend with a
vicious tenacity. The thick fur of the Segge is prized
by the luxury-goods markets offworld and by locals for
outdoor clothing, bringing trappers into the territories
of the Segge where they may encounter these ornery
beasts or the creatures that prey upon them.

WESTON
Weston is an important x-boat link on the route from
Daramm to the rimward end of the sector and ultimately
to the Domain capital at Annapabar. The world is
also important as a jumping-off point to the Shanape
Linkworlds and the Shanape Cluster itself. jump-2 ships
can reach Miip from Weston but most transit via Kerin’s
Tyr. The world also sees a lot of Tukera ships transiting
out of the Linkworlds after a refit at Sentry.


As befits an important system, Weston is protected
by a standing deployment from the 124th fleet, which
is assigned to defend the subsector. This deployment
is usually a single destroyer or a task force of three
or four corvettes and a support vessel. There is also
considerable Scout Service traffic in the form of x-
boats and tenders serving the communications route
and couriers carrying messages to worlds off the main
route. A small Scout base exists to support this activity.
It is situated on Weston’s only moon, Sura.


Weston is a warm, wet world served by a Class B star-
port. The population of 700 million are ruled by a Plan-
etary Governor. Originally a decisive, forward-thinking
individual, more recent governors have been well-en-
trenched, plodding bureaucrats who have led the world
to comfortable stagnation. The populace is subject to
strict laws, with enforcement personnel (along with
the governmental and mercantile portions) forming an
elite segment of the populace that enjoys the benefits
of imported technology. Everyone else makes do with
Weston’s sustainable Tech Level of 5, plus whatever
they can afford at inflated prices.







Visitors to Weston are normally awed by the rain, which
is almost constant and consists of some of the big-
gest droplets in Charted Space. An hour of sunshine
would be considered a drought on Weston. Once they
are used to the rain, visitors normally start to notice
how clean, neat and well-ordered the place is, and the
gloomy resignation of the bulk of the populace.

The Guadix Drift subsector contains 34 star systems,
almost all of which are in the Great Ley Cluster or
on the Reaching Arm. Most worlds are part of the
Luriani Cultural Association, with long histories
of trade, cooperation and occasional friction.
The worlds around Dukh are rather isolated and
underdeveloped, other than the sector capital itself.
As a result, relatively little shipping goes coreward
but trade in other directions is extensive. Bulk cargo
moves mostly aboard lumbering jump-1 freighters,
with urgent or high-value items carried aboard
smaller and faster ships.

Responsibility for security of the subsector rests with
the 129th Fleet, whose headquarters is at Ushtar.
Located one jump from the subsector capital, forces
from this base operate on the trailing side of the
subsector with a little overlap into neighbouring
subsectors. The Kha Amon contingent is responsible
for the spinward half of the subsector, whilst
Iseda is essentially an outpost of the sector fleet
headquarters at Depot. It is the final resting place for
many old Imperial Navy ships. In theory these are
mothballed for future reactivation but by the time a
major warship in Ley reaches a state where it is no
longer useful it is unlikely to be worth putting back
into commission.

Guadix Drift can be considered the heartland of
the Ley Sector Commercial Alliance, which has an
impressive headquarters on Daramm. Many of the
founding members of the LSCA were associates of
the former Archduke Nells, who was himself a Luriani.
Outsiders have joined the alliance but its spiritual
home is in the Luriani Cultural Assembly. There are
many who believe the LSCA is deliberately pushing
Luriani culture by economic means but its members
would say they are simply doing business, and any
cultural influence is just a bonus. The proximity of the
LSCA headquarters to the secondary sector court at
Daramm is certainly beneficial for its members and is
obviously not a coincidence.

ISEDA
Iseda lies just outside the Luriani Cultural Association
and was never a Luriani-settled world. Attempts were
made but the atmospheric taint is stronger in the
world’s waters. This makes them unpleasant to swim
in, especially for Luriani who are normally resistant
to such things. The taint comes from various species
of aquatic plants and is constantly renewed by huge
beds of floating seaweed. This does not mean Iseda
is unpopulated, merely that Luriani do not want to


settle there. A permanent population of Imperial
humans was established in the early 200s and for
many years did not expand greatly.


In the late 700s, the system was selected as the site
for a naval base specialising in the maintenance of
reserve vessels. This came with a modest payment
from the sector administration every 10 years and
was sufficient to finally allow expansion of the
world’s population and industrial base. A scattering
of settlements on the few islands that exist was
greatly increased by immigrants seeking work with
the newly established Iseda Corporation, which took
over governmental responsibilities from the previous
autonomous colonies.


Today, the world’s entire population is employed
by the Iseda Corporation or are dependents of
employees. The corporation’s official business
area is listed as seabed mining, aquaculture and
associated aquatic industries. This translates to
harvesting the seaweed rafts and processing them
for the pharmaceutical industry. Iseda’s products are
restricted in the Luriani Cultural Association as they
can cause skin or respiratory irritation in most Luriani
but are exported widely elsewhere.


The naval base is capable of accommodating ships
up to cruiser size but rarely hosts anything larger
than a destroyer, as the sector’s naval depot is just
a jump away. It does have a small force of system
defence boats, and a couple of monitors for defence,
but most of the naval assets in the system are

half-cannibalised or dead at their moorings. These
vessels are maintained as well as possible but over
the years any that could be put back into service
were fixed up and sent elsewhere. More of the ships
are gradually being moved to the beyond economic
repair section after being stripped of anything that
could be used to keep another vessel flying. Iseda
Naval Installation is a rather gloomy place, where old
ships go to slowly die.


THE ISEDA SUPPLEMENT
According to its marketing materials, the Iseda
Supplement is a revolutionary dietary component
which can slow ageing, promote healing and aid
restful sleep. It is completely banned on Luriani worlds
as it causes severe gastric distress, but non-Luriani
report various beneficial effects which may or may not
be imaginary. A container of 80 pills, to be taken twice
a day, costs an incredible Cr100 over the counter.
This makes the trade in Isada’s seaweed extremely
lucrative. Harvesting is difficult, and sometimes
hazardous, but it is well-paid and there are some who
claim the rafts are the healthiest place in the sector to
work (for non-Luriani) due to exposure to raw Iseda.
It is not clear how true any of this is but consumers
are lining up to pay huge prices for a bottle of pills
containing a small amount of pulped seaweed.


SHIRGEGGE
Shirgegge provides a jump-2 link between the Dukh
Cluster and coreward tip of the Reaching Arm in
Titanstorm subsector, and also allows jump-2 transit
into Nightmare. As such it is an important trade link. Its
high-quality Class B starport receives a considerable
volume of trade and, arguably, its population are
better informed about high-level politics than people
of most other worlds. This has prompted a number of
investment firms to open offices at Shirgegge. Hortalez
et Cie dominates the field but there is money to be
made by lesser players.


The world of Shirgegge is a fairly typical greenish
planet. Its hydrosphere is extensive but the thin
atmosphere means that rainfall does not penetrate


far inland in most areas. Semi-desert is common in
the interior of the continents, with a unique ecosphere
which has generally resisted the introduction of
foreign species. The 80 million inhabitants dwell in 12
large cities distributed across the globe, with smaller
settlements in between.


Life in the cities is pleasant, if subject to strict laws
and many civil regulations. Those who work in the
outback have a quite different experience, however.
Agriculture is hard work even with advanced robotic
assistance. Constant effort is required to support
the plantations of offworld crops needed to feed
the population, since most of the local species are
virtually inedible to humans. The world’s native
flora continually tries to reclaim the fields, to the
point where burning or cutting a dead zone around
the fields is the only viable solution. Despite this,
agricultural yields are good enough that a fair amount
of food is exported. A period of neglect as short as
10 years could wreck the economy of any given city.
This has only happened once in the world’s history
but farm managers are constantly reminded about the
need to keep the world’s invasive species at bay.

The majority of worlds in Titanstorm lie on the trailing
end of the Reaching Arm, which gives access to two
chains of worlds known as the Reaching and Broken
Fingers. Beyond the fingers lie a scattering of stars out
in the Lesser Rift. There is little traffic to coreward and
virtually none to trailing, with the vast majority of ships
in the region moving along the Reaching Arm. To ‘The
subsector has only one high population world but is a
major consumer of goods. As such it is important to the
economy of the sector as a whole.

The subsector is secured by the 191st Fleet, which
has headquarters at New G’Dansk. A scout base at
Hagim supports internal communications work as
well as expeditions into Osiris Deep. Scout ships
are more common than naval vessels, other than at
the three Imperial worlds in the subsector. Although
a frontier in the sense that it lies on the Imperial
border, Titanstorm has the general feeling of an
internal region. Political interest is directed inwards,
with worlds more concerned about their status in the
Imperium than events outside it.

FRIEDEN
Freiden lies at least two parsecs from any other
world, and was never colonised by the Vilani. The
first human settlements on-planet were set up by
Solomani settlers during the Rule of Man. These
settlements grew into an impressive culture during
the Twilight but had entirely died out by the estab-
lishment of the Third Imperium. A second wave of
colonists during the period 300–500 built over and
obliterated one of the cities of the old civilisation,
although others remain fairly intact.

A mid-sized world with little water and a dense, tainted
atmosphere, Frieden is a moon of the gas giant Vel-
law. The population of 30,000 is almost entirely housed


in a single city near the equator, on the shores of the
world’s only sea of any size. The locals have a high-
technology society and enjoy a good standard of living
but laws are strict and vigorously enforced.


Frieden is host to a number of archaeological teams,
most of whom are digging through the wreckage of
the original colony trying to discover exactly what
happened to the hundreds of millions of inhabit-
ants. The most likely theory is that a gradual loss of
technology resulted in an inability to maintain envi-
ronmental systems. Damage to some of the cities
suggests fighting, which in turn implies the collapse
was gradual. Perhaps the locals battled it out over
the surviving safe areas, or the victor in a long war
was so exhausted that civilisation could not be saved
even after the fighting was over.

HAGIM
Despite being a link on the wrist of the Reaching Arm,
Hagim is not an important world. Relatively little trade
comes this far out to trailing and most of the vessels
that head out into the fingers are jump-2 or higher ships
intended for frontier operations. The scout base offers
training for starship crews intending to operate along
the Imperial fringes, yet uptake is generally small. Most
of those intending to take their ships out over the fron-
tier know what they are doing – or think they do.


Hagim is mid-sized, with a thin atmosphere and limited
surface water. Its dim red dwarf primary is unable to
warm the world much, so the terrain is mainly arctic
desert with little animal life. Despite its unwelcoming
aspect, Hagim is home to some 900 million inhabitants,
who make their homes in mid-sized towns wherever a
sheltered valley or liquid water source is to be found.
The locals have a sustainable Tech Level of 4. Most
people scratch a bare living by farming and fishing in
the world’s small, ice-covered seas. Government is
by a rather ad-hoc system of representation, although
governmental structures are extremely loose.


Hagim is chiefly notable for two factors. First, a sur-
prisingly large number of inhabitants go offworld to
work or join the Imperial services. Although the world
has little in the way of a permanent starport, recruit-
ing ships from the Marine Corps, the Imperial Army
and some megacorporations visit certain towns from
time-to-time. The locals are uneducated but that can
be remedied. What they bring to their employers is
almost infinite resourcefulness and a willingness to
work – conditions are so tough on Hagim that some
inhabitants who join the Imperial Marine Corps actu-
ally have to undertake extra training to maintain their
pre-recruitment physical standards.


The second notable feature of Hagim is its rather
strange moon system. Despite being a small world,
Hagim has seven moons and a ring system. The ring
seems to be the remains of another moon and three
of the existing ones have been positively confirmed
as being fragments of a larger body. All seven moons
have extremely exotic orbits, a circumstance that can-
not be natural. Astrophysicists predict that two of the
outer moons will collide in about 6,000 years’ time.
This is further evidence that something has disturbed
the orbits of the various moons, since these two would
have already collided if they had held these orbits for
more than 350,000 years. Both moons are a great
deal older than that.


RECEIVING SHIPS
The Imperial services and some of the
megacorporations use the old naval tradition of
receiving ships for new recruits, but with a modern
twist. These vessels recruit promising young people
and transport them to training or education facilities,
beginning their orientation and basic instruction along
the way. A recruiting cruise can be many weeks long,
with the earliest batch of recruits in a position to assist
the crew with their newer colleagues.


Very occasionally a receiving ship will be diverted to
assist in some crisis. This can result in a vessel or
force gaining personnel who have virtually no training,
or a contingent landing in uniforms but with little idea
what they are doing. This is in no way desirable but
sometimes the nearest assets must be deployed until a
more coherent response can be made.


Corporate receiving ships are less likely to be
diverted in this manner and in some cases function
as commercial vessels. For example, a receiving
ship may provide on-the-job training for stewards and
technicians whilst transporting goods and passengers.
Vessels operated by large corporations generally offer
a solid training programme feeding into an advanced
course at a proper facility, but some of the smaller
lines have a receiving ship which transfers minimally
trained crewmembers to other vessels before recruiting
more. Standards are generally lower as a result but
this method allows a line to do away with permanent
facilities and make some money whilst its newest
members are undergoing their training.

Three of the six star systems in Osiris Deep are
Imperial members and subject to the protection of the
191 st Fleet. Two of the others are client states, with only
Mensure fully independent. Jump-2 traffic can reach
Magulus, although only a handful of vessels operate
this route. Virtually all the trade reaching Magulus and
Ssissth comes in by way of the same ships, making a
new arrival something of an event.


It is not possible to travel to trailingward from Mensure
without deep-space refuelling, even for a jump-6 ship.
It is widely believed the Imperial Navy maintains a
set of deep-space refuelling posts allowing couriers
to reach Splinter and Hollman in Abysm subsector. If
true, this creates a relatively quick communications
route between the Imperium and the nearest polities
of Gateway. This route leads to the sector capital
and naval depot, but from there the normal courier
system is used to bring news to the Domain capital at
Annapabar. This does mean the archduke is behind
the curve on events in the HPA and Plavian League
compared to his naval commanders, but that gives the
admirals a chance to prepare for likely orders if action
ever becomes necessary.


KHAANLISHA
Khaanlisha is as unimportant as a mainworld can be.
Lying on the fringe of the Lesser Rift, it is home to
around eight million people – at least, officially. The
official population occupies a group of large islands
off the coast of one of the continents, getting by
with a sustainable Tech Level 5. Most of the rest of
Khaanlisha is listed as uninhabited. In reality there is

the Deepnight Corporation. In return for a small fee
every month, the corporation has been permitted
to set up a facility to support its exploration and
scientific ships. Most of these are small; typically lab
ships or survey vessels, with a few in the 1,000-tons-
plus class. Two major assets of the corporation are
also based out of Khaanlisha. One is Deepnight
Endurance, a long-duration exploration support
vessel, whilst the other is the jump-5 capable
Deepnight Pioneer. These vessels are engaged in
exploration of the Lesser Rift and the worlds within,
and call only occasionally at their nominal base. In
the meantime, independent ships come to trade at
the port. They bring goods the corporation might
want or need, and occasionally strike it lucky when
an unusual cargo is brought out of the rift.

MENSURE
Mensure is a hostile world in a system without plane-
toid belts or gas giants, located a long way from any-
where. The world can be reached by a jump-3 vessel
by way of Magulus from the very tip of the Reaching
Finger, or by a jump-5 vessel from rimward. It cannot
be reached in a single jump from anywhere beyond
Ley. This isolation has affected the development of
society on Mensure. The world is small but dense,
and rich in heavy elements. This may have been
the reason for the initial settlement, although today
Mensure has only TL5 available, a situation that has
persisted for centuries.

The world’s nine billion inhabitants are crammed
into vast cities on the world’s few land masses.
Given that the exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by
humans, it is no surprise society is rigidly controlled
by central authority. Overall control is exercised by
the high king, who in turn is represented by citykings
and their subordinates. The positions of cityking and
high king are unusual in that they are sacrificial roles.
That is to say, a king rules for a period and is then
ritually killed to make way for his (or her) successor.
Exactly when a king is to be deposed and a new one
appointed is determined by popular support or accla-
mation amongst the common people. A popular king
might die in office but this is very rare. More com-
monly a troubled city will get through a succession of
citykings before stability returns.


Although laws are very strict, they are seen as neces-
sary by most of the population, so acclamation of a
cityking is often the result of zealous law-enforcement
on the part of the candidate. Mensure has the death
penalty for many crimes. Given the population pres-
sure, this is hardly surprising. Visitors are not exempt
from these penalties, hence the imposition of an am-
ber travel zone by the Travellers’ Aid Society.


Construction on Mensure uses a lot of natural materi-
als and processes, as does environmental protection
and atmosphere processing. The locals have learned
to use plant life to provide many of the benefits of
hard technology. This gives their cities a strangely
organic look. Despite the dense population, some
areas of Mensure are wilderness. Great forests,
rugged badlands and vast swamps make some re-
gions unsuitable for human habitation; here, strange
animals native to the world can be encountered. The
local flora and fauna are exotic enough that Imperial
scientists have made the long trip out to Mensure on
many occasions. Each trip finds yet more unknown
species, perhaps making the possibility of death by
execution worth the risk.

SWAMP MASS
A curious multipart creature native to Mensure, the
Swamp Mass has equivalents on some other worlds.
Its main component is a shapeless, amorphous blob
that can move but rarely does. If the central mass
does move it squidges slowly over the ground by
extending its forward side and contracting its rear.
More commonly it will sink into marshy ground and
allow vegetation to cover it. A typical mass is 3-4
metres in diameter but much larger individuals have
been recorded. The central mass has no brain and
few identifiable organs. Instead, their functions
are highly distributed in a manner that would be
inefficient in most creatures. However, the swamp
mass has very low energy needs. Much of these are
obtained by leaching nutrients from the surrounding
soil. Being underwater is no problem for this creature
so long as it can get food.


Food is obtained directly from the surroundings
and by detachable tentacle-like appendages which
slither into the surrounding foliage. These serve
as snares for passing creatures, curling up around
the body of a small animal or the legs of a larger
one. Once triggered – probably by pressure, but
there is little data on the subject – a tentacle will
not let go. A typical tentacle requires 2D hits from a
sharp implement to sever it, or five times this much
bashing, stabbing or similar damage. The tentacles
are designed to kill small animals and are unlikely to
be fatal to a large creature. They deliver D3 damage
immediately, then 1 point per hour by crushing. A


tentacle taken more than 20 metres from the main
mass will usually detach but sometimes one will
remain attached for a much greater distance. When
eventually dropped, it will begin growing into a new
central mass.


Swamp masses are a hazard to humans but not a
serious one – at least directly. There is always a
chance of being tripped by a tentacle or having both
feet bound by one, in which case the victim will fall
into the swamp and may drown. There will usually be
bones near a central mass, belonging to a previous
victim. When live game is taken in this manner,
small creatures are dragged to the central mass and
absorbed, whilst larger ones are moved in sections
as they decompose and break up. Alternatively, a
longer tentacle may be extruded to connect the mass
to its food source until it is exhausted.


Killing the central mass requires area damage such
as fire or plasma. Concentrated energy weapons
such as lasers are no more effective than bullets or
blades; each 5 full points of damage inflicted counts
as one. A dead mass will eventually regenerate unless
completely destroyed.

Lying on the spinward side of Ley, Highlord contains
29 star systems, of which three contain high-population
worlds. Astrographically, the subsector is characterised
by clusters separated by jump-2 gaps. This gives rise to
the usual pattern of local jump-1 shipping moving most
of the bulk goods within a cluster, with jump-2 vessels
typically plying between entry and exit points.


The Shanape Cluster is split between Highlord and
neighbouring Matarishan subsectors, with the Shanape
Link Worlds (otherwise known as the Linkworlds)
providing a jump-2 transit into the Great Ley Cluster.
Shipping moves freely between the clusters, protected
by the 238th Fleet which has its base at 900-790. The
system was chosen largely because it was more or less
unwanted, during a period in which the Imperial Navy



preferred to distance itself from the local affairs of world
governments. Since the base was established, 900-
790 has been colonised but remains economically and
politically unimportant.

The sector fleet base at El Jerarquia exists primarily
to support operations to rimward of the Imperial
border. It is home to a modest force of cruisers and
light carriers which show the flag and occasionally
intervene in local affairs in Glimmerdrift Reaches. The
base was heavily reinforced during the Solomani Rim
War and for a time housed several battle squadrons
poised to repel a Solomani incursion into Glimmerdrift
Reaches. Today the base is oversized and expensive
to maintain but formidable. It is one of the designated
fortress systems intended to halt a major K’Kree
assault. This is considered extremely unlikely to
happen in the next century or more by Imperial
experts, but the constant clamour for something to be
done about the threat from the Lords of Thunder has
resulted in several rounds of fortress-building at the
expense of naval production programmes.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has a way
station at 900-790. Unusually, it is co-located with
the naval base on the surface and in orbit around
the same rockball world. 900-790 is a major training
installation for both services, receiving large numbers
of new recruits several times a year. It also houses
a large intelligence analysis centre staffed by naval
personnel, members of the scout service and civilian
academics. The facility is dedicated to learning
as much as possible about the Lords of Thunder
and producing forecasts of their likely actions.
Information comes in by courier on a regular basis and
occasionally innocuous-looking merchant ships enter
the restricted docking area. It is an open secret that
the Imperium has many such vessels out in Gateway
and Glimmerdrift reaches at any given time.

KALUUD
Kaluud is a backwater world off the main trade routes,
home to around 70 million people. Of these, about
20 million are Chirpers. The world is welcoming, with
plenty of water and an acceptable climate, and was
originally targeted for extensive colonisation during
the late Rule of Man era. However, introduction of
Terran species resulted in a struggle throughout the
world’s ecosphere which caused a variety of climatic
disasters. Dustbowls, changing flood patterns and
similar upheavals resulted from the displacement of
native flora and much of the world’s wildlife died off.
Today, Kaluud’s ecosphere resembles that of Terra,


with a few local species and has stabilised to the
point where the world is a significant manufacturer of
agricultural produce.


These ecological disasters had a devastating effect
on the indigenous Chirper population, which fell to a
few tens of thousands and has regrown rather slowly.
The Chirpers are not very intelligent but they know that
humans caused the changes to their world and they
are resentful. They possess only Neolithic technology
but are cunning and tenacious. After a long campaign
of harassment and minor guerrilla warfare the planetary
government lost patience and forcibly relocated
the Chirpers to regions away from the main human
habitations. Carefully avoiding words like reservation, the
government laid out a set of rational and sympathetic-
sounding regulations which amount to apartheid.


For most humans on Kaluud, the problem is solved.
They are restricted to the area around the world’s cluster
of small cities and the Chirpers are kept at a distance by
security patrols and barriers. Those that have to venture
into the countryside may be in some danger and there
is a certain amount of resentment about the supposedly
fair territorial restrictions. Those who feel this way protest
the Chirpers have been given most of the planet whilst
the more numerous humans are restricted and under
siege, as some of the more rabid objectors put it. In
reality, if the world government wants more territory,
it simply chases the Chirpers off regardless of what
agreements are in place. Kaluud is thus designated an
Amber travel zone and is the subject of a great deal of
wrangling at the sector duke’s court.

NEW BRUNSWICK
Settled by Rule of Man-era Solomani colonists, New
Brunswick provides the only jump-2 link between the
Shanape, Urewr and Laiskallia clusters. Through traf-
fic is fairly light and the relative poverty of the world
has prevented any serious investment in the starport.
Most vessels passing through the system are owned
or operating under charter to Enkaasni Freighting,
LIC, which maintains a small fuelling station in orbit
around the system’s only gas giant, Tain. Only inde-
pendent ships actually use the downport at Brunswick
Prime, the world’s unimpressive capital.


New Brunswick is almost entirely covered by bare
rock deserts, with few habitable areas and larger num-
bers of impressive volcanoes. About half the popula-
tion of some 2,000 souls live in or around Brunswick
Prime, while the remainder eke out a nomadic ex-
istence wherever the conditions permit it. There is
no actual government as such; heads of individual
families make all necessary decisions, guided by an
ancient settlement code that concerns itself mainly
with survival measures.


Local craftsmen can support TL7 and extensive
use is made of solar power for domestic use. There
is little or no heavy industry and few vehicles. The
locals are hardy and self-sufficient, and have little to
trade with outsiders. The upshot of this is that New
Brunswick remains effectively isolated despite its
astrographic position.


SPEVVMI CRYSTALS
The origins of spevvmi crystals are a closely guarded
secret. Many suppose they are sourced on a remote
rogue world in the Lesser Rift, a belief that is quietly
supported by those who know where they really come
from. According to rumour, these unique crystalline
formations are found only in a certain hollow
planetoid. Part of this tale is true but the point of origin
is not in the rift and the crystals are not unique. In
fact, there are several sources of spevvmi crystals, all
inside planetoids drifting in an unknown star system.
An enterprising belter crew found them and realised
their sales potential and spread wild tales about the
origin to preserve their find.


Spevvmi crystals have an unusual composition. They
are translucent from most angles, scattering light as
well as other forms of electromagnetic radiation. This
is mainly useful as a novelty, enabling clever artists to
create ornaments that ‘sing’ when subjected to certain
radio frequencies or which create strange heat patterns
around themselves when heated. Whilst not particularly
useful, the crystals command a good price from those
who admire their beauty and items crafted from them
have found their way to ports across the Imperium.


It is not clear how these crystals came to be but they
are thought to be pseudo-natural. That is, they were
created as a natural consequence of a process that
could not occur in nature. Perhaps a planetary body
was subjected to unimaginable forces, forms of energy
or a psionic event transformed the rock of a shattered
moon. There are those who consider the spevvmi
crystal to be proof of all manner of strange theories – or
a warning that there are unknown forces at work in an
otherwise well understood universe.

The Matarishan subsector is named after the world of
Matarishan, now known as Shanape. Settled in the last
days of the Rule of Man, Matarishan was briefly home
to an interstellar civilisation which lost contact with
its members during the Long Night. The Matarishan
Federation was reconstituted in the early years of the
Third Imperium with the arrival of dissidents from Sylea

and although it has been annexed into the Imperium
under the name of Shanape the relationship remains
difficult. The Matarishan Freedom Movement continues
to advocate independence for the former Federation
worlds, although through peaceful, legal methods.
Other organisations, such as the Matarishan Liberation
Army, are more direct and forceful.




Matarishan subsector contains 29 star systems, most
of which lie in the Shanape Cluster or on the rimward
tip of the Reaching Arm. It is protected by the 261st
Fleet, which has its headquarters at Shanape and a
secondary base at Sentry. With the majority of the
sector fleet based at Depot, just over the border in the
Guadix Drift subsector, Matarishan does not host a
permanent sector fleet deployment. Nevertheless, its
cruisers are commonly sighted in the major systems
of the subsector, showing the flag and reminding
dissidents the navy is not far away.

BARAU MONAC
Lying more or less in the middle of the Shanape
Cluster, Barau Monac is a habitable world which
was never developed to any great extent. Its main
asset is its excellent starport and like many such
worlds the planetary population can be considered
as an outgrowth of the port economy. The vast
majority of income is generated by trade and
starship services at the port, with industries serving
mainly to meet local needs.

The planetary government is based at the highport,
which is unusual, and the planetary population have
a lower standard of living than those dwelling in orbit.
This them and us attitude extends to external politics
as well as society on-planet. The world government
sees itself as part of the Imperium and has more in
common with the ships coming through the port than
the disadvantaged citizens below. Social Climbing has


a very literal meaning on Barau Monac; anyone who
can afford it wants a place in the highport’s society and
jobs there are used to reward government supporters.


Support for the Matarishan Liberation Army has
been growing on-planet for many years and some
settlements are now under the control of its militias.
For the most part this has been accomplished in a
polite and low-key manner without triggering much of a
response, but as the MLA gains confidence and no firm
response is made it is only a matter of time before more
of the planet falls or open conflict begins. It appears the
planetary government prefers to ignore the problem –
or perhaps some elements of the government actually
condone what is happening. If the MLA takes over
enough of Barau Monac a secession attempt is likely,
which will trigger Imperial intervention. What form this
takes remains to be seen.

MLA ORGANISATION AND OPERATIONS
The Matarishan Liberation Army uses a flexible
organisation, as much out of necessity as a
desire for effectiveness. Its forces belong to
two general types – field and security. Security
forces are ostensibly geared towards controlling
and protecting territory, whilst field forces are
intended to destroy enemies. However, this split
is not as simple as it sounds. Security forces
might better be described as armed political
and economic actors whilst field forces have a
primarily military role.


Within a security force there will usually be
diplomatic and liaison detachments, negotiators,
lawyers and traders. Some personnel will be
equipped to a military standard but most are
intended for a peacekeeping role. One standard
technique for winning over an area is for a
security force to assist local police in removing
criminal elements. This means bypassing due
process and forcibly arresting anyone suspected
of a serious crime and placing them before an
MLA court. In theory the outcome of this trial is
advisory and the suspect will be handed over
to local authorities. In practice, proceedings are
dragged out as long as possible, such that those
who have not confessed or been proven guilty
are still being prosecuted by the time the MLA
has taken control over the local authorities. At
that point the sentence is rubber-stamped.







MLA commanders are adept at winning hearts and
minds. The arrival of a security force means an
increase in stability, a drop in crime, new business
opportunities and assistance for those with a
grievance against the local authorities. The MLA
uses a push gently but push always approach in
most areas, gradually moving into a position of
trust and support. This is most effective when the
local or Imperial authorities have failed to deal
with problems. The MLA learned long ago that
work crews repairing the roads neglected by the
planetary government are worth more than patrols
marching along those roads.


Security forces use civilian vehicles for the most
part, typically the equivalent of wheeled or grav
SUVs and light trucks. Weaponry is, similarly,
what would be associated with security rather
than military forces – sidearms backed up by
shotguns, with some personnel armed with
sniping rifles, submachineguns and the like. A
security force might also have a stash of military
hardware, such as anti-armour systems and
support weapons, but this is sufficient only to
provide stiff resistance to a raid rather than to
defend cities from a major assault.


Field forces are likewise lightly equipped but
along military lines. They are more suited
to counter-insurgency (or more commonly,
counter-counter-insurgency) work than battling
a serious military force. Some civilian vehicles
are used for transport, logistics and as light
weapons carriers, with small numbers of light
armoured vehicles and personnel carriers
available for spearhead operations. Anti-armour
and anti-aerospace weapons are available in
significant numbers but most are short-range
infantry-crewed systems. Any large anti-
aerospace or artillery system the MLA obtains is
a major asset to be carefully husbanded.


Command of both field and security forces is
exercised on a minimalist basis. Command units
are designated task, local, area and regional and
have an appropriate (if very lean) structure. A
task command consists of a leader assisted by
a communications operator and typically two to


four other personnel. This is sufficient to run most
field tasks, which involve less than 50 personnel
and their equipment, or to administrate part of a
town. A local command team is usually about ten
personnel and is considered sufficient to run a
company-sized military force or to administrate a
town. Area command is considered equivalent to
a battalion, small city or a group of towns spread
over a modest area. Regional commanders are
assigned to cities or a fairly large area, possibly
commanding miliary forces greater than a
battalion equivalent.


Above the regional level command is exercised
by the MLA’s generals. These high-status
individuals generally communicate through cut-
outs and proxies, so can be difficult to identify. As
with all levels of command no distinction is made
about areas of expertise. Some commanders
are better suited to administration and others
to military command, but all are expected to
do what is necessary. For example, a regional
commander has authority over all MLA forces
in their area of operations unless a general is
personally commanding a force, and is also
responsible for the security and political aspects
of the mission. This can lead to weaknesses but
commanders have authority to appoint assistants
and advisors as they see fit.


Command structures are built on an ad-hoc and
as-needed basis out of assets that are designated
teams, detachments, companies, forces or armies
according to their strength. Teams are typically
a handful of personnel – in any field ranging
from finance to military engineering – with their
own leader. A detachment is typically formed of
multiple teams and might be anything from 15 to
60 personnel strong. Companies typically contain
three to five detachments and some teams. Higher
formations are rarely formed but would be termed
a force if deployed in the equivalent of battalion or
brigade strength. Anything above 2,500 personnel
would be termed an army by the MLA and led by
a general. This command structure is personal
rather than official, and can produce highly
variable results. When it works it is responsive and
well-tailored to the local situation, although the
loss of a key individual can result in a collapse.




LONG ISLAND
Long Island is a water world located almost at the very
end of the Reaching Arm. It is ruled by a hereditary
pseudo-nobility made of business owners and financiers,
most of whom have interests on the surrounding worlds or
even farther afield. The world is named for its single land
mass, a snaky island over 250 kilometres long but rarely
more than 40 kilometres wide. The rest of the planet is
covered in oceans which are farmed from underwater
settlements. Most of the 10 million population live on Long
Island itself, or in cities built on the continental shelf close
to it. The only significant inland settlement is the startown
surrounding the downport.

Society is rigidly controlled by a paramilitary security
force which also serves as a conventional military.
Among its assets are deep-diving submarines carrying
orbital defence missiles. These are built offworld
and shipped in but the subs are of local design. The
maritime element of the planetary security force is
involved in a constant battle with the world’s large
aquatic predators which are attracted to the fish farms
and can cause havoc if not driven off.

Long Island receives relatively few tourists, largely as a
result of enthusiastic enforcement of its restrictive laws
but one attraction brings a steady stream of maritime
scientists and well-off tourists. This is the Great Forest,
an area of shallows populated by tall, tree-like plants.
These breach the surface, with the tallest standing
tens of metres out of the water. Free-floating sea plants
catch in the lower fronds of the trees, creating a unique
environment which supports a huge range of animal life
both above and below the surface.


CINGESSE SHEPHERD
The cingesse shepherd is named for its curious manner
of feeding. It has a central body resembling a very
large flat fish or ray, propelled through the water by
rippling the outer surfaces. There are two pronounced
shoulders at the front, from which extend long
tentacles. When the creature is moving fast these tuck
under the body and trail behind it but when it is time
to feed, they are extended wide out to the sides and
brought forward in a long curve. Most fish between the
tentacles will swim away but some can be shepherded
towards the creature’s enormous maw.


Tentacles can reach 50 metres in length on a large
specimen and can be used to grab or bash people and
objects. The maw would inflict at least 6D damage on
anyone drawn into it but that is only likely to happen to
helpless or unconscious people. Cingesse shepherds
do not grab and pull food into its mouth, they guide
panicked fish in that direction. Lurid tales of these
creatures dragging crewmembers off nearby boats
are only partially true – a shepherd will certainly knock
someone overboard it if can but a strong swimmer may
evade the maw with ease. Indeed, whilst carnivorous
and aggressively territorial, these creatures are better
considered as filter feeders than hunters.

Frontier Worlds lies on the fringe of the Third Imperium,
with a three-parsec gap separating the Imperial border
from the neighbouring Khuur League for most of its
length. Other than a small segment of the Reaching
Arm there are no significant clusters or mains. The
subsector capital at Saramid has a high population
and a TL15 industrial base, making it one of the most
economically important worlds in the region. It is a little
isolated astrographically, requiring a jump-2 vessel to
reach. Saramid is the most trailingward point where
ships belonging to Tukera Lines or Imperiallines are
regularly seen, although other megacorporations have
interests further from the Imperial heartland.


The subsector is secured by the 262nd Fleet, which has
its headquarters at Saramid. This is one of the better-
equipped subsector fleets in Ley, although most of its
assets are older destroyers and escorts. Elements of


the sector fleet also use the Saramid naval complex
but are almost exclusively employed in showing the
flag along and just outside the border. The bitter war
with the Khuur League was not so long ago that the
Imperial authorities are prepared to discount the
possibility of further hostilities. Naval officers in this
region are charged with both preventing a war – by
deterrence and diplomacy – and warning of impending
conflict in time to pre-empt it. Although not considered
likely, Frontier Worlds is one of the next war candidates
monitored by Imperial Naval Intelligence.


In addition, Frontier Worlds is considered a likely route
into Imperial space for invading K’Kree fleets. Plans to
harden The Gate – Sydymic, Outreaumer, Diamond-
Prince and Outworld subsectors – are in motion but
proceeding slowly. Annexation would be necessary
before naval bases could be built and fortress worlds

created, and this seems less likely now than a century
ago. One solution would be to fortify Frontier Worlds,
but it is less of a choke point than The Gate. There is
little money for the project in any case, and the Imperial
authorities are unwilling to finance defences that might
not be necessary for centuries – and which could be
bypassed with relative ease.


SARAMID
A high-population, high-tech world which is also
the subsector capital, Saramid is the very definition
of important and its citizens know that. Their living
standards are extremely high due to extensive TL15
industry and the profits made by the excellent starport.
The planet itself is an airless rockball but that matters
very little. Most people consider themselves citizens
of the Imperium rather than of a particular world; they
just happen to live on this one but their interests lie
everywhere. This extends to a voracious appetite for
information about far-fluing Imperial regions. The goings-
on at the court of the Duke of Tobia, on the other side of
the Imperium in the Trojan Reach, are as popular a topic
of conversation as shares in Naasirka on the Ley stock
market. One consequence of this is a tendency to try to
gain the lead over each other about current affairs and
the implications of even in obscure places.


A particular area of interest, perhaps not surprisingly,
is the expansion of Imperial interests into Gateway and
the possibility of a clash with the Lords of Thunder. The
Loyal Sector Guard has a huge following on Saramid


and nowhere more so than at the planetary university.
There, the LSG is one of the most popular societies.
It produces many prominent graduates who proudly
display their uniforms and banners. Underneath this
façade of noisy but ultimately harmless anti-K’Kree
sentiment is a harder core of agitation which includes
fundraising and recruiting for voluntary service in
various places – many of which are far away in
Gateway. Whilst officially this is disapproved of, the
authorities have never done anything to prevent it.


TAYLOR'S WORLD
Taylor's World is an example of a system state rather
than a single world. The mainworld is a small chunk of
rock with a trace of gas and no surface water, useful
primarily as a place to put a starport in orbit over. It
is home to about 90,000 people who are scattered
in small communities with virtually no governmental
structure. A loose Council for Cooperation and
Mediation based at the highport handles most disputes
and beyond that simple economics governs the system.


The settlements on Taylor's World, as well as a
significant belter population and various commercial
installations scattered around the system, are all
represented to the Council. It mostly acts as a collective
bargaining association and benefits the various
interests in the system sufficiently that most accept the
Council’s leadership. As a result, Taylor's World has a
reasonable system economy even if all the component
parts are small enough to be insignificant. The arrival of
new players in this very loose politico-economic game

can cause some upset from time-to-time but overall, the
system’s internal politics are self-regulating. Everyone
needs everyone else and cooperation generally
benefits all involved.

GAS GIANT ECONOMICS
Gas giants can be an important source of raw
materials, both directly and through exploitation of
their moons and associated planetoids. Many gas
giants have gathered a cluster of planetoids at their
leading and trailing Trojan points, 60 degrees ahead of
and behind the giant planet in its orbit. Trojan bodies
are also sometimes associated with smaller planets
but they tend to be single or small in number rather
than the clusters associated with larger giants. These
clusters can be useful to miners and prospectors, and
those wanting to set up a base where it might not be
found. The navy spends a significant amount of time
surveying Trojan clusters in case they are being used
by smugglers or similar undesirables.

The gas giant itself cannot be mined but its atmosphere
can be skimmed. Most ships doing this are seeking
fuel and one way to make money from a gas giant is
to set up a refuelling station in orbit around it. Many
ship operators will pay for the convenience of taking
on refined fuel from a station rather than skimming it


themselves. Various other chemicals can be extracted
from a gas giant’s atmosphere, notably complex
hydrocarbons. Whilst petrochemicals are of limited use
as fuels in an interstellar economy, they are used in the
creation of various plastics and polymers.


A gas giant chemical extraction facility usually consists
of an orbital gas rig and shuttles which undertake
the skimming process. A few rigs descend into the
atmosphere themselves, although this is riskier and
produces more wear in the long term. Mobile skimming
operations may use a skimmer/refinery vessel, filling
up with compressed gases then processing them on
the way back to base. All of these methods are viable
providing the atmosphere is not too turbulent and
radioactivity is within tolerable limits.


In systems with gas giants but no system government
capable of enforcing its territorial claims, gas-mining
is something of a free-for-all. The Imperium has
laws governing such activity and some other states
regulate it to some extent. In some areas gas-mining
rigs or planetoid mining facilities have become
trade hubs, with facilities for visiting ships gradually
expanding until the installation becomes a starport in
all but name. Such facilities are usually protected to a
greater or lesser degree, as raiders are always on the
lookout for an easy target.





Sydymic lies almost entirely outside the Imperial border
and is one of the subsectors making up the region loosely
known as The Gate. The majority of worlds are part of
the Khuur League, most of whose systems are within
one parsec of one another. The main exception is the old
Sydite homeworld of Sopater, now known as Khuur. This
system has a high population but is of low importance.
Khuur was heavily damaged by Imperial forces and it
proved more convenient to move the capital than to
rebuild. Today the League’s capital is on Aankemishas,
which is also the site of the polity’s only naval installation.


The Khuur League is not hostile to the Imperium as
such, although memories of bitter conflict remain. Trade
links are impeded by a three-parsec gap, forcing most

ships to go around by way of Outworld and Diamond-
Prince subsectors. Contact with the Galian Federation
to trailing in Gateway is much easier. Trade relations
with Phoniwt are also important to the League. In
recent years, Hiver trade ships out of Gashuki have
become regular visitors to the rimward end of the Khuur
League, where they are generally very welcome. Exotic
goods shipped all the way from the Hive Federation
have never really caught on in the League but the Hiver
traders are smart enough to tailor their wares to the
rather unimaginative Sydite market.






IRGAMKI
Irgamki is an Imperial client state located four parsecs
beyond the Imperial border, next to Khuur. It is a
former world of the Sydymic Empire but has gradually
moved closer to the Imperium in terms of politics and
culture. Irgamki is rather difficult to get to from Imperial
space and is more likely to receive a visit from ships
based out of Tharver than from the Frontier Worlds.


The world has rather poor natural resources but
farming of a variety of fungal organisms provides
some income. The vast majority of the produce is
processed close to the farms and shipped to Tharver
where it is used to make cheap rations for the
starship and mining industries. Despite the rather
dry conditions, Irgamki’s fungal life is quite varied.
This permits a surprisingly palatable range of dishes
to be produced without many imported ingredients.
Occasionally the datanets are flooded with revelations
about the superfood properties of Irgamki’s fungus,
leading to a rush by enterprising merchants to buy up
large quantities. There is no scientific basis to these
claims but that does not stop the datanet ads from
screaming about how ‘Irgamki Fungus provides 10
Vital Benefits (eat daily)’ for a few days before moving
on to some other nonsense.

KHUUR
Khuur, homeworld of the Sydites, is a wet world with
a thin atmosphere situated almost at the extreme
trailing edge of Ley. Home to some five billion
people, the majority of the planet is at the low end
of mid-technology and therefore of little economic
importance. It is the spiritual home of the Sydite
people and still holds a powerful mystique for them.
Indeed, diplomatic and certain favoured merchant
vessels are registered out of Khuur. There is no
proper starport on Khuur and registry of vessels is
actually handled at the capital. However, the honorary
status of being a Khuur ship grants a higher level of
prestige throughout the league than ships registered
out of other worlds, even the capital.


The population of Khuur are divided among its
small continents in loose associations of cities and
regional administrations. Some retain the trappings
of the old Sydymic Empire but most are workmanlike
bureaucratic systems led by the more imaginative
and driven members of their society. A strong
sense of community and a general lack of personal
ambition means these quasi-nations are on the whole
peaceable and productive. Each has its own landing
area for visiting ships but these are rare. A standing
deployment from the Khuur League’s naval base
discourages landings by any vessel not registered
out of Khuur or carrying an approved-visitor tag in its
transponder code.

THE IRGAMKI TAINT
Atmospheric taints can vary considerably. The
common factor is that they require a filter mask or
similar protection. This assumes a visitor to the
world, as in some cases the locals have become
accustomed and more or less immune to the taint.
Taints that are inert are the easiest to deal with.
Gaseous atmospheric contaminants, dust or similar
materials are easy to filter out and require little
more than a barrier to prevent inhalation. Those
that are toxic or radioactive require some form of
decontamination to prevent them being carried inside
a structure or vehicle.

Irgamki’s taint is biological, making it one of the most
difficult to deal with. In the case of Irgamki the taint
takes the form of fungal spores which will grow in the
respiratory tract and can be passed on to another
person once the fungal growth has developed
enough to cause symptoms. These are typical of
such an infection; shortness of breath and a general
malaise accompanied by elevated body temperature.
Infection is rarely fatal but can be debilitating if not


Disease END check Damage Interval
Irgamki Respiratory Fungal Infection Difficult (10+) END-1 (max. 1D+3) 1D Days


treated. 2D days after infection the victim begins to
feel ill and suffers slight breathing difficulties. This
translates to a loss of END -1. Every 1D days after
this, the patient must make a Difficult (10+) END
check using their reduced END. Failure indicates
the loss of END to a maximum of 1D+3, determined
when the infection is discovered. Someone whose
END is reduced to 0 will slowly suffocate but can
be supported by artificial breathing assistance until
treatment is complete.


A few patients recover naturally but most require
medical treatment to kill the infection. If treatment is
not available, the patient must live with the condition
and may pose a hazard to others as they breathe
out spores. Every 2D months, the Traveller must
make a Difficult (10+) END check. Success indicates
the condition has been eliminated by their immune
system. Failure does not make things any worse.
Treatment usually means a course of anti-fungal
drugs and some supportive therapy such as enhanced
oxygen delivery. Whether naturally or artificially
eliminated, once the infection has gone the lost END
is regained at a rate of 1 every 2D days.





Satyressia contains six star systems. One of them,
Secundus, can be said to lie out in the Delphi Rift and
Gambler’s Ruin is also very isolated. The other four
systems are accessible by a jump-2 ship from Zukhin
and Highlord subsectors. Traffic is very low, even
along the x-boat route through L’Orient and Ipsham.
The subsector has a numbered fleet, the 192nd, but it
only has a handful of vessels at its disposal.


During the Solomani Rim War, a number of commerce
raiders were active in the coreward end of Ley. They
were supported by auxiliaries but operating at the end
of a very long supply chain. The question of how these
vessels were able to maintain high-tempo operations
and make repairs after receiving combat damage
has troubled Imperial analysts ever since. The Long
Night Remembrance movement, a violently pro-Vilani/
anti-Solomani organisation, insists that either a secret
Solomani Confederation base was established in the
subsector or a segment of the local population was
covertly supporting the raiders.


No evidence has been found by the authorities but
to this day LNR continues to agitate for a purge
of Solomani sympathy in the subsector and those
surrounding it. LNR operatives have kidnapped a
number of prominent citizens of Solomani descent
and interrogated them about the matter. This
resulted in a great many arrests among Long Night
Remembrance members, which in turn produced
allegations of Solomani collaboration amongst the
sector authorities.

IPSHAM
Ipsham is a small, dense world with a thick
atmosphere tainted by mildly radioactive volcanic
dust. The world is going through a cycle of volcanism
at present, making areas downwind of the main
areas of activity hazardous to those operating
without a mask. This is not much of a problem for
the planetary population as they dwell in a single city
using sealed buildings and routine decontamination
for those venturing outside. Ipsham is a landgrab
world, settled to create a territorial claim then never
really expanded. It exists mainly to support the
orbital highport and derives most of its income from

ships passing by. This is not a great deal but there
is a jump-4 route into Outreaumer subsector from
coreward and spinward.


Ipsham’s wildlife is ferocious, especially several
species of large predatory flying reptiles. These
occasionally make a nuisance of themselves at the
downport and city, and have to be chased off or killed
by the world’s small security force. Elsewhere the flyers
are left to their own voracious devices. Until recently,
the heavily forested lowlands and volcanic mountain
ranges of Ipsham were of interest only to naturalists
studying its highly aggressive ecosystem. However,
rumours are now beginning to emerge of lost cities
in the forests of Ipsham. These are said to have the
characteristics of a human habitation but vastly predate
the settlement of the region by the First or Second
Imperium. It has been suggested that a colony of
humans was set up on Ipsham by the Ancients and
apparently survived for some time after the Ancients’
Final War.


IPSHADACTYL
Despite the best efforts of the scientific community,
Travellers have together grouped several
species of flying reptile as Ipshadactyls.
The name makes no sense except
as a reference to the ancient Terran
pterodactyl but it has entered the popular
consciousness. Most ipshadactyls are large
enough to be dangerous to a human, with
a few species capable of upsetting a grav
vehicle by landing on it. Open-topped air/
rafts are a very poor idea on Ipsham as
the local wildlife has learned to land on the
sides or rear and peck at the crew, or even
to grip the vehicle and flap their wings to
destabilise it. Personnel have been known
to be shaken out of a vehicle by this.


Ipshadactyls operate in flocks, often detaching a couple
of individuals to cause a distraction whilst the rest
position themselves for a violent, screaming swoop
upon the victim. They are quite willing to attack small


groups of humans in defence of their territory – and
occasionally just out of orneriness. They nest in high
places and will bring game to their chicks in gory
pieces, returning to the kill to strip more meat out of it.
This sometimes leads to a secondary kill, where some
hapless scavenging creature is lured into the open by
the apparent free meal awaiting.

Most of the 22 systems in Outreaumer lie on
the Serpent Main, which stretches over into
Diamond-Prince subsector. Tukera Lines has spent
considerable sums on improving starports in the
region around Ohasset and still dominates the major
shipping lines. In the past 50 years however, it has
faced increasingly strong competition from members
of the Ley Sector Commercial Alliance which
escalated almost to the point of a trade war in the
1090s. The situation has cooled off somewhat since
then but rivalry is intense. One consequence of this
is the presence of several flagship liners intended
to impress all who behold them. More suited to the
Core sector, these vessels lose money on every jump
but their operators consider them a necessary tool in
gaining control of the Serpent Main trade routes.

Outreaumer Subsector is the responsibility of the 267th
Fleet, which has its headquarters at Khiskami. The few
Imperial worlds in neighbouring Thorstone subsector
have no fleet assigned to them, so the 267th takes
responsibility for security in the region. It is assisted by
a force of destroyers and sometimes a cruiser or two
belonging to the sector fleet. These are based out of
Shangri La. Additional security is provided by corporate
vessels operated by Tukera Lines and members of the
Ley Sector Commercial Alliance. Both are hostile to
lawbreakers but many observers believe these ships
are present more as a symptom of commercial tensions
than to keep the peace.


This subsector is one of the four comprising a region
of strategic interest loosely referred to as The Gate. It
is of lesser importance than neighbouring Diamond-



Prince subsector but the systems of its trailingward side
will be a battleground if war with the K’Kree comes.
The subsector’s nobles routinely petition the archduke
for more warships and better defences but the threat
is far off and the archduke insists there will be time to
prepare if the day finally comes.

GULEM KILAR
Situated close to the rimward Imperial border, Gulem
Kilar is important only as a link on the x-boat network.
The world was settled in the 680s as a landgrab and is
still an Imperial Protectorate. It is ruled by an appointed
planetary governor answering to the subsector duke at
Ohasset. The population has remained steady since
the original colonisation, which is hardly surprising.
With very little industry and a local Tech Level of 6 there
is not much to attract immigrants to Gulem Kilar.

The system’s starport was earmarked for upgrade in or-
der to support the x-boats and couriers deployed there
and in the interim a standing deployment of x-boat
tenders was instigated. Funding never emerged, so
the tenders are still there. At any given time, there will
be one tender actively engaged in x-boat support, one
acting as a base for couriers serving the surrounding
systems and one or more tenders present as backup
or holding for deployment elsewhere. The system is
erroneously noted as a scout base in some information
sources but this is not the case. Scouts assigned to the
system are stuck aboard their ships unless they choose
to visit the rather basic Class D starport at the south
pole of the mainworld.


Gulem Kilar itself is hot and very wet. Its landscape is
characterised by swamps and rainforests for the most
part, with the population of some 600,000 clustered at
the poles and in drier upland areas. Visitors describe
Gulem Kilar as a vegetation-choked steam-bath, a de-
scription that is if anything far too kind. Other than the
polar and upland settlements, the world is still largely
unexplored and has very little industry. Occasional
prospecting missions head out into the jungles or the
deep oceans. Nothing of great value has ever been
found but there are rumours of lost cities and great
treasures in remote locations.


SHANGRI LA
Shangri La lies on the jump-4 and x-boat route into
the subsector from spinward, making it an important
link between the Domain capital and the rest of the
Imperium. This has always been the case; Shangri
La was settled expressly as a communications and
trade link. The mainworld of the system is an asteroid
belt. Although there are several iceball worlds in
the system, the belt was chosen as the site of the
port to allow use to be made of its extensive mineral
deposits during construction. Before the port was
constructed (in 902), the system was inhabited only
by nomadic groups of belters.


Shangri La Starport is an impressive A class facility
situated on a large planetoid on the edge of the belt.
The port is subsidised by the Imperial Colonial Office
(ICO), which intended to withdraw its funding once the
system was capable of supporting its port. This never
happened and the necessity of keeping the x-boat
route open requires continued support. Little money
is made from trade due to the port’s location and local
industries are not significant.


An ore processing plant at the starport ships out large
quantities of mostly low quality ore. The corporate
mining platforms generally produce better output but
the profits go to the corporations rather than the main-
world’s industries. Some income is produced by the
shipyards; however, they are small and specialised.
Shangri La mainly builds x-boat components and ves-
sels for the mining trade. Special orders, which gener-
ally means anything other than x-boats and seekers,
can take an inordinately long time to complete due to
retooling requirements.


Lacking any real industrial capability, the Shangri La
system cannot support its tech base without imported
equipment. Despite this, the inhabitants enjoy a
TL13 standard of living but the port has the air more
of a place of work than a homeworld. Ninety million

people live and work in habitats on the planetoid or
scattered throughout the belt. Many are employed
in the port or its associated starship construction
yards. Of the rest, the vast majority are involved in
the asteroid mining industry, mainly as employees
of Sternmetal Horizons, LIC, which operates several
vast mobile asteroid-gutting platforms.


Government is by feudal technocracy. The ruling
council is drawn from representatives of various
technical branches such as the starship environmen-
tal and the mining engineers. A substantial minority
of the population are descendants of the original
belters. They feel disenfranchised and there is some
friction between them and the newcomers. Indepen-
dent belter ships still work the belt, although they are
gradually being edged out.


THE IMPERIAL COLONIAL OFFICE
ICO was created at a time when colony operations
were commonplace. It was to serve as a governing
body for colonial claims and to oversee the settlement
and development of official colonies. Over time, this

role faded into near-insignificance as almost every
promising colony site has been settled. In the case
where worlds or parts of worlds are reserved for future
development, ICO is charged with overseeing them but
the decision to open up a world is made jointly with the
Scout Service and regional authorities.


The Colonial Office has become a bureau of the
backwaters, providing development funds to minor
worlds or sending assistance when one suffers a
setback. This is more about supporting the overall
economic wellbeing of the Imperium than advancing
the cause of any one world. Problems that might affect
trade, such as a damaged starport after a disaster of
some kind, are the concern of the Imperium as a whole.
Development of a world’s economy is its own business
unless it also benefits the regional economy.


For example, ICO might provide funding and assistance
to a mid-tech world if an increased Tech Level and
bigger industrial base makes it a better market for
offworld goods or a source of something other nearby
worlds might need. The Colonial Office will make only
a token effort, if it does anything at all, to assist a world
that simply wants to be more prosperous. This is an
underlying factor in the Imperial psyche – it exists to
foster free trade to the benefit of everyone but what
local governments do about the opportunities provided
is up to them. Cynics might say the ICO exists mainly
to ensure the poorer worlds remain prosperous enough
to enrich the wealthy ones.


In The Gate, ICO has been tasked with assisting
local worlds – but always to the benefit of the
Imperium. Its personnel and assets can be
encountered assisting with projects that improve the
flow of trans-border trade or expand a market. When
there is no obvious financial benefit to the Imperium,
the project is almost certainly being backed for
political reasons. This is sometimes aligned with the
long-term hardening of The Gate mission but may
also be a general relations-improvement project
of the sort ongoing on most frontiers. Sometimes
this leads to an expansion of the borders but even
if it does not, it creates a zone of friendly and
economically dependent states along the frontier.

The 30 star systems of Diamond-Prince lie mainly on
the Serpent Main or within the Annapabar Cluster.
This was previously designated the Imperial Trade
Cluster but that was a project name rather than an
astrographic designation and is used less often
today than previously. The heavy investment that
accompanied the creation of the ITC resulted in several


excellent starports being opened but the economies
of their associated worlds never expanded to match.
Nevertheless, Diamond-Prince and the Annapabar
Cluster in particular are important as the arrival and exit
point for most of the trade headed into Gateway and
Glimmerdrift Reaches.



Diamond-Prince is the most strategically important
of the four making up The Gate. The most likely
path of a K’Kree advance would be through
Outworld into Diamond-Prince then spinward-
coreward towards the Great Ley Cluster. In addition
to any strategic considerations, astrography would
incline an invasion force to move in this manner.
Given the predictability of such a move and the
prevailing opinion that it is inevitable, calls for the
fortification of Diamond-Prince are common.

At present, a system of pivot fortresses is envisioned.
Some worlds will be hardened and supplied with
heavy defences, creating safe havens for mobile
fleets to operate on interior lines against an invader.
Even if the fleet is withdrawn – or never deployed
for lack of ships – the pivot systems can be used to
harass enemy supply lines. This is not to the liking
of the Gateway Wall adherents who want a solid
line of fortress systems, several parsecs deep, right
across The Gate. Ideally, the fortresses will be in
newly-annexed systems in Outworld and Sydymic
subsectors. This is unlikely to happen.

The subsector is the responsibility of the 266th Fleet,
which has its headquarters at Zuge. Elements of
the sector fleet are based at Glen Murdoch. These
are mostly large destroyers and cruisers which
operate beyond the border. A standing deployment
of one BatRon and one CruRon is also maintained
at Annapabar but as these ships are the nearest
sector fleet assets to the seat of the archduke one or
more of them is usually detached for some important
errand, with another showing the Imperial flag in
Outworld subsector. Additional security is provided
by the archduke’s personal forces, which are
based at Annapabar.

ANNAPABAR
Annapabar orbits at the outer limit of the life zone,
resulting in a very low surface temperature. This and
the very thin atmosphere means most surface water is
in fact ice. The great majority of the planetary surface is
glacier or bare, lifeless, rock. Only in the depths of the
oceans is there much life. This is generally of a hardy,
cold-resistant and primitive nature. Unsurprisingly,
before 991 Annapabar was almost entirely uninhabited.

In 991, the new Archduke of Gateway made the
momentous – and rather sudden – decision to move
the Domain capital to Annapabar. The system also
became the subsector capital at that time. An enormous
orbital city was built to house the starport and the


Domain administration, with associated settlements
and industry planetside. The population expanded to
around 20 million and remained stable thereafter.


Moving the Domain capital to Annapabar was
one of the most controversial decisions Archduke
Erechs ever made. The declaration of the Imperial
Trade Cluster, which was simultaneous, also raised
eyebrows – mainly due to the vast sums spent
on starports orbiting rather unimportant worlds.
However, the Cluster did achieve its primary aim.
Trade into Gateway sector was greatly expanded,
with most ships going through Annapabar Highport.
This generated a great deal of revenue which largely
justified the starport-building programme.


Annapabar was set up as a fortress as well as a
capital. The orbital highport has a large naval quarter
which, whilst not officially a naval base, can serve as
one. There are also small installations in the outsystem
which can support system defence craft and destroyer-
sized naval ships. The mainworld itself has an
impressive array of ground defences, including deep-
site meson guns. Whilst hidden, some installations
such as the Planetary Aerospace Defence missile
bases scattered around the globe are quite obvious. A
visitor might get the impression the whole of The Gate
was similarly fortified, which suits the Imperium.


The cornerstone of the defences, at the time they
were installed, was a purpose-built 750,000 ton
monitor. This was no converted planetoid; it was a

true naval ship built in a dock created specifically to
accommodate it. Crewed jointly by the Archduke’s
Huscarles (personal forces) and the Navy, this vessel
is named Resolution. She is a century old now but
has been refitted twice and can be expected to serve
for many decades more. Most of the time Resolution
cruises close to the mainworld, where both friends and
potential enemies can see her.


Annapabar receives visitors and ambassadors
from across the region, notably embassies from
the Galian Federation and the Khuur League, and
a trade delegation of Hivers from Gashuki. Officials
from Phoniwt are also usually present, although
the internal politics of that powerful world are such
that individuals are constantly being recalled and
replaced. A steady stream of jump-3 trade ships
pushes out through The Gate, along with navy
cruisers and intelligence-gathering vessels. For many
visitors, Annapabar is the furthest into the Imperium
they ever will go and a lot of money is spent on
creating a good and slightly daunting impression.


GASHUKI
Gashuki is a rockball world located almost at the very
tip of the Serpent Main just outside Imperial territory.
It was never of any importance until a Hiver Trade
Mission arrived, followed by others. Although the
world’s hereditary oligarchy is still officially in control, it
is widely assumed that Gashuki is ruled by the Hivers.
Ostensibly their presence is intended to facilitate trade
and cultural relations between the Imperium and the
Hive Federation but there is much speculation about
what they are really up to.


The trade mission is genuine and makes a profit
for those involved, but it is part of a larger plan.
The Hivers are fascinated by just about everything
but particularly the psychology and motivations of
sentient species. Hivers have a deep-seated fear of
violence and this translates to a need to understand
their neighbours so the Hive Federation can be
prepared for an attack or other conflict. Many Hiver
Manipulations are based around gaining an idea of
what a given species will do in a situation.


The upsets in the Domain of Gateway a century ago
were a magnet for Hiver researchers, who were both
frightened of what might happen and fascinated to see
what will result when one human leader is deposed
in favour of another. Some Hivers actively tried to
manipulate the outcome of the struggle between the
two archducal factions, whether to obtain a favourable


outcome or see if a manipulation on such a grand scale
can be done. They have almost certainly continued to
influence events, or tried to, in Ley ever since.


However, this was a secondary aim; one that became
possible due to outside circumstances. The real reason
the Hivers came to Gashuki is twofold. First, they wish
to study the Sydites. It would seem the Sydites are
ideal targets for manipulation given their susceptibility
to influence. Perhaps they can be made into allies for
the Hive Federation or puppets for the Federation,
carrying out instructions given from a safe distance.
The Hivers’ intentions towards the Sydites are unclear
and it is likely they vary from Hiver-to-Hiver. What is
clear is that the interest is there, although naturally the
Hivers of Gashuki are not making it very obvious.


The other great concern for the Hivers is related to
the K’Kree or more specifically, the Lords of Thunder.
The Hive Federation is concerned about their possible
expansion. They have shown an interest in Crucis
Margin sector, where at least one human state has
assumed a submissive stance towards them. This
frightens the Hivers, who foresee the day when the
Lords of Thunder begin to encroach on Hiver space
and perhaps even redress the defeat inflicted upon
them by the Hivers.


The most effective way to counter a threat like the
Lords of Thunder, the Hivers know, is by influence from
afar. Ideally, the Hivers can work through third or even
fourth parties, persuading others to recognise the threat
posed by the K’Kree expansions and to bolster the
will and the defences of the threatened human states

in Gateway and Crucis Margin. Even if this merely
distracts the K’Kree for a few decades, it is worth
doing. It may be possible to create resentment among
the Lords of Thunder toward those the Hivers are
manipulating into opposing them. K’Kree who are angry
with humans are less likely to attack Hivers.

Therefore, the Hivers are in human space for several
reasons. They are of course also interested in trade
and studying humans and other species. The Hivers
also hope to create a counterbalance to the K’Kree by
fostering the mindset among humans that the K’Kree
are a dangerous threat. Whether the Imperium begins
to actively oppose the K’Kree, or simply becomes
predisposed to help the Hivers if they are attacked by the
Lords of Thunder in the future, the work is worth doing.
Naturally, the Hivers are happy to fiddle with, meddle
in and generally stick their sensory appendages into
anything else that may be going on the region.

LEPANTO
Lepanto is a mid-sized world with a thin atmosphere
and moderate expanses of water which was colonised
during the Rule of Man. Never a large colony, the
remaining population was tripled by the arrival of
Imperial colonists in 720 who integrated among the
existing population with surprisingly little friction.
Shortly before the outbreak of the Solomani Rim
War, pro-Solomani agitation spilled over into acts of
violence against non-Solomani Imperial citizens on
the planet. A soft approach failed to secure any useful
results and as the violence increased, steadily firmer
measures were taken.

Full intervention took place in 992 after the Solomani
blockade runner Liberty was intercepted by INS Urskii
Gla with a cargo hold full of weaponry intended for


Solomani sympathisers. Investigations proved that
several such cargoes had already been delivered and
Solomani advisors were planetside, training guerrillas
and terrorists to use the weapons. The intervention
was welcomed by frightened Imperial loyalists and
was a success, despite stubborn resistance from the
hopelessly outgunned rebels. Martial law was imposed
in 996 and not lifted until 1015. Insurrection gradually
died down after the end of the Solomani Rim War but
Lepanto has remained troubled ever since.


Over time, the troublemakers on Lepanto have moved
from being pro-Solomani to more generally anti-
Imperial. Among smugglers and less ethical merchants
it is an open secret that there is good money to be had
running people in and out of Lepanto. There is always
a market for arms and military equipment on a world
like this but cargoes of weaponry or small combat units
are sometimes shipped out. It is thought Lepanto is
a stronghold for the Free Peoples’ Alliance, although
attempts by intelligence agencies to obtain hard proof
rarely produce meaningful results.


Typically, the situation on Lepanto quiets down for a
few years at a time before a small group manages
to trigger a wider backlash, which in turn results
in a resurgence of violence. Restrictions on the
ownership of weapons are routinely ignored and
enforced in a patchy manner at best. Lepanto has
been an Amber Zone for over a century and is likely
to remain so, despite the efforts of various special
envoys from the archduke and mercenary forces
tasked with pacifying the world.

The 31 star systems of Outworld lie beyond the
Imperial border, although some are client states. The
Khuur League, the Galian Federation and the world
of Phoniwt all vie for market shares and political
influence throughout the subsector. There is no
assigned numbered fleet as Outworld lies beyond the
remit of subsector fleets but the Ley Sector Fleet is
active in the area.


Outworld is considered part of The Gate and efforts
are constantly made to align worlds with Imperial
interests. Success has been patchy, largely due to
an inconsistent and underfunded effort. Much of the
money spent on improving relations comes from those
involved in the Gateway Project and their first priority
is profit rather than allegiance. This is seen as a
necessary evil by the Imperial authorities – better some
progress now than massive effort in the future.


The main trade routes coming out of Imperial space
depart the Annapabar Cluster heading either directly
trailingward towards the Viyard Concourse by way
of the Ownsbee subsector or coreward-trailingward,
either through Phoniwt or bypassing it depending on
the current situation. Wise captains are always on
the alert for news from Phoniwt and willing to change
their plans accordingly.


PHONIWT
Phoniwt, with its 60-billion population, is a small, tidally-
locked world orbiting the gas giant Kaske Huul at the
very edge of the life zone. Most surface water is frozen
into spectacular glaciers near the poles. The rest of the
planet is chilly desert whose very thin atmosphere is
not sufficient for life more complex than moss. Despite
its unappealing nature, Phoniwt is a thriving metropolis.
The majority of the population live on the ‘out-facing’
side, away from the gas giant, in a single immense
underground city. The ‘facing side’ has a few mining
and industrial communities but is rather hazardous due
to occasional radiation bursts from Kaske Huul itself.


Phoniwt was settled in the last days of the Rule of Man
and was for a time an important naval support base
whose industry supplied spares and parts for naval
squadrons assigned to the region. When the Long
Night fell, the world retained its status as an important
refit centre and became something of a boom world
even as interstellar civilisation fell apart. An important
trade nexus and starship-repair centre, Phoniwt
survived the Long Night as the centre of a trade
alliance, now long broken-up, and has always been an
important port for trade into and out of Gateway. The


world was annexed by the Sydymic Empire on two
occasions but won its independence both times, the
latter just before the Imperium/Sydymic war.


Phoniwt, typically of heavily-overpopulated worlds,
has strict laws. Government is bureaucratic and slow-
moving, and is dominated by several major factions.
The Phoniwt Naval Service has considerable influence
over its own budgets, while other industrial concerns
are important. However, the real power rests, oddly
enough, with the University of Phoniwt. The University
business school provides the vast majority of personnel
to government offices and over many years has come
to directly influence them. This control is currently
challenged by the People’s Centre Party, which has
many popular figures but little coherent strategy.


The result of this political infighting is considerable
delays in getting anything done and the bringing-to-
bear of bureaucratic influence on every trivial topic as
the various factions manoeuvre for position. Politics so
pervades daily life that most citizens see themselves
as players in ‘the game’. The use of influence is an
accepted means of getting things done in normal life.
Politics of this sort, which takes place at every level
from grand policy to grocery shopping, is the most
popular recreational activity on the planet.


Phoniwt remains an important trade and industrial
centre despite its internal wrangling, and merchants
come from across the subsector to trade here.
Phoniwt maintains trade links through Far Portal to the
Galian Federation, providing the main route for trade

between the Imperium and Gateway. Many Phoniwt-
based corporations are beginning to make their
influence felt beyond the local region. Naturally, the
Imperium sees Phoniwt as a potential asset but has
yet to make any progress towards client status. This is
partly due to the popular distaste for being told what to
do by outsiders, and partly because nobody can agree
on anything for very long.

WORLDSHIP ANNAAGMAA
The Wanderer name for this vessel is unknown but
it is currently closest to the Annaagmaa system so is
generally known by that name. The worldship is a large
planetoid fitted with sublight drives, crawling at low
velocity in a generally spinward direction. Encounters
with Wanderers from this ship are possible anywhere
within a radius of fifteen parsecs. Travellers are unlikely
to encounter the worldship itself unless they happen to
jump to the right spot in deep space. It is possible they
could find the worldship by befriending an expedition of
Wanderers whose home it is.

Worldship Annaagmaa was one of the last worldships
out of the homeworld before its destruction. Over-
populated, half-finished and underpowered, it never
achieved the high sublight speeds required for a long
journey. The worldship coasted out of the home system
during the last phase of the attacks, unobserved by the
Vilani warships. Some of its drive systems failed within
the first ten years, making deceleration and turnaround
a painfully slow process, but eventually the worldship


reached a point in Gateway and went into orbit around
an uninhabited planet. Descending to the surface, the
survivors made a life for themselves as best they could
and gradually clawed their way back into space.


The arrival of human settlers on their new homeworld
was a shock to the Wanderers but there was no
genocide. The two populations, neither of them
large, ignored one another most of the time. As
the human presence grew, the Wanderers became
uncomfortable and they longed for their old home.
Tales of the destruction of the Vilani Imperium
encouraged them and they began a great project.
They would return home!


Long years had eroded memories and hard data had
been lost but the Wanderers were able to figure out
a general area. They traded almost everything they
had as a civilisation for a few jump drives and enough
spares to fix up their worldship, eventually setting out
to spinward. The worldship is entering the old home
region, and the priests aboard are sure they can sense
their home somewhere ahead.


The worldship is directed roughly at Kam, in
Diamond-Prince subsector. The ship is decelerating
slowly, and should arrive in about 550–600 years.
Kam is not the final destination, merely a waypoint.
The Wanderers plan to enter the system and set up
a stable orbit. From there they will search, finally
starting up their drives again when they are sure they
have found their way home.





Gateway is a very different place to Ley. This is
partly the result of astrography. Its star patterns
make the creation of large states difficult and have
impeded Imperial expansion into the sector. There
are few mains or major clusters. Instead, Gateway
is characterised by a scattering of small clusters
and individual systems, separated by two or three
parsec rifts. Navigation is somewhat more restricted
than in areas with many mains. The primary
astrographic feature of the sector is the Lesser Rift,
which separates the coreward end of the sector
from neighbouring Ley.


Gateway contains several major interstellar
polities and many minor or one-world states.
It sits uncomfortably between the Imperium
to spinward and the Two Thousand Worlds to
trailing. Influenced by both (and listed in Imperial
data as a collection of client states) the majority
of worlds are in fact stubbornly independent or
subject only to local alliances and trade pacts.
There is no sector capital as such. Gateway Prime
comes close, mainly because of its importance in
interstellar trade.


Neither the Ziru Sirka nor the Rule of Man reached
Gateway in strength, although enterprising colonists,
mainly of Solomani descent, spread throughout
the region in the early years of the Long Night. The
first human colonies in the region were most likely
on Tharver, Bremen and Salur, around -1700. The
first definite date in human history in the region is
-1511, the founding of a colony on Carlton. However,
it is known that by this time there was already
considerable interstellar traffic in the region.

# GATEWAY SECTOR


The human people of Gateway, as far as any
generalisation is valid, value personal freedom,
self-reliance and individualism. This is one reason
the region is so fractious. There are several
K’Kree populated worlds within the sector. Some
are entirely K’Kree, while others have a mixed
population of humans, K’Kree and sometimes
others. In some areas this has led to greater
understanding and tolerance; in most it simply
creates opportunities for conflicts of interest and
even open warfare. Several other species are
present, including some small enclaves of Vargr
and the odd Wanderer worldship.


Some states actively support piracy as a political
or economic tool, although Imperial interests are
working to curb this trend. The biggest threats to
local stability come from the Lords of Thunder to
trailing and the Hochiken People’s Assembly to
coreward. Both are known to be expansionistic and
are considered a threat by their neighbours as they
may be engaging in covert action to improve their
situation. A number of one-world states are also
attempting to secure their position or enhance it.


The Imperium has a certain amount of influence
in Gateway but this is mainly confined to the
spinward subsectors. The Galian Federation,
while friendly to the Imperium, acts as a buffer
between Imperial space and the rest of the sector.
It is likely the K’Kree have agents at work in the
region, whilst influence from the Hivers or Solomani
Confederation is minimal. Piracy and privateering
are relatively common in Gateway, with some states
having a long tradition of such practices. Interstellar
trade is therefore rather hazardous even without
the complications imposed by relations between the
states of Gateway.

Gateway Sector


The main astrographic feature of Gateway is the tip of
the Lesser Rift which dominates the spinward-coreward
corner of the sector. There are four star systems in this
subsector, only one of which receives regular interstellar
traffic. The world of Glee can be reached with relative
ease from the Hochiken People’s Assembly to trailing.
All other systems require multiple jumps and deep-space
refuelling. This can be done but it requires more effort
than the returns justify. HPA ships can occasionally be
encountered in Darksky, as can Imperial vessels, but
there is no subsector economy as such.

As with any area that lacks regular interstellar traffic,
there are rumours of strange anomalies in Darksky as
well as star systems that are not in the navigational
databases. The latter is easy to disprove by simple
observation, although it would require starship sensors
used from a position on the fringes of the Rift. Tales of
strange phenomena and general weirdness are harder
to debunk but are very unlikely to be true.

ISOLATION
Located at least five parsecs from any other star system,
Isolation lives up to its name. It is hard to see why such
a world would be selected for colonisation, given the
effort required just to survive there, but for the original
settlers a hell-world in the middle of the rift offered
security through anonymity. The original colony mission
contained dissidents from the Rule of Man, who intended
to disappear and certainly achieved their aim. Nothing
was heard from them until an Imperial exploration ship
ventured into the Lesser Rift in the mid 500s.

The colonists managed to survive on Isolation, despite
its insidious atmosphere and generally hostile nature.
They constructed several small cities connected by fast
grav transport and settled down into loose cooperation.
The one thing these groups had in common was
a desire to be as far from the Ramshackle Empire

as possible. Beyond that, they were very different;
religious idealists, losers in an internal power struggle
and other groups who felt safer undiscovered. Contact
with the Third Imperium was an awkward and nervous
business but whatever differences had existed had
long been forgotten; to the Imperials, Isolation was just
another forgotten colony.


Contact is today maintained by the occasional Scout
Service vessel or navy Rift Cruiser, with occasional small
cargoes arriving at the world’s central starport. Isolation
has little to export, other than minor unique items such
as artwork, so trade is minimal. However, there are
suspicions that the life support technology used by the
cities of Isolation is not of human origin. Not necessarily
more advanced, it is... different and makes use of some
components whose nature is a closely-guarded secret.
Attempts to gain access and examine these systems
have insofar been unsuccessful, leading to speculation
that the people of Isolation may have something to hide.

Atoon is characterised by groupings of two or three star
systems separated by two to three parsec gaps. There
are no mains or significant clusters, making commerce
and the construction of a coherent interstellar power
problematic. Despite this, about half of the subsector
is the territory of the Hochiken People’s Assembly. The
remainder is independent, although the three-system
cluster around Luray is claimed by the HPA.

The presence of a K’Kree client state immediately to
coreward is undoubtedly a worry for the HPA, although
little information is available about relations between
these states. It is probable some form of border
agreement is in place since there does not seem to
be a great deal of naval activity in the coreward end of
the subsector, and it is thought trade ships cross back
and forth on a frequent basis. The rimward end is more
active due to tensions with the Plavian League. There
have been numerous incidents which stop just short
of warfare and it is obvious to any observer that open
conflict is only a matter of time.

GRANTH
Granth is an old colony situated on what used to be
a comfortable, temperate and Earth-like world at the
extreme coreward end of the sector. In recent times
the world has become polluted and rather grim. The
nine billion people living on Granth are concentrated
into several mega-arcologies, some of which are
situated on the seabed or largely underground. There
is also a vast arcology with a population over 1 billion
on the largest moon of Granth, plus several military
cities scattered across the planet in isolated and
defensible locations. These are part fortresses and part
manufacturing centres, turning out endless shiploads of
weaponry for the HPA’s armed forces.


As the capital of the Hochiken People’s Assembly
(HPA), Granth does not have its own planetary
governmental centre. Instead, the world is governed
from the Orbital People’s Administrative Centre
(O-PAC), which houses and handles the bureaucratic






apparatus of the entire HPA. With a population of
several tens of millions, the O-PAC is a critical part of
the functioning of the Assembly, and has always been
considered a no-shoot target in the various power
struggles in the Assembly’s history. The place has been
stormed more than once by ground troops, however.


Granth’s main product, apart from bureaucracy, is war
material for the Assembly’s ever-growing armies and
fleets. Several planetside and orbital yards construct
ships, weapons and vehicles from materials brought
in by an endless stream of freighters. As the source
of most of the weaponry in use by the HPA, control
of Granth is vital to control of the HPA as a whole.
Various ambitious leaders from other parts of the HPA
have designs on it, with the result that security is tight.
All traffic, even that intended for various outsystem
installations, has to come into Granth Central
Starport and be transferred to local transports before
proceeding to its destination. Outgoing goods are
treated the same way, allowing the central government
to watch what is going where.


The system is heavily militarised, with fixed and
semi-mobile installations backing up the huge Granth
System Fleet. The jump-capable tenders of the
strategic reserve are based in the Granth System along
with a powerful fleet answering directly to the Assembly
President, ruler of the entire HPA – at least in name.
In reality, these massive forces are more to prevent
an ambitious admiral from attempting a coup than
to defend the system. It is well known the President
and his supporters are gradually losing control of the
outlying systems and the more they fortify their position


at the capital, the freer rein the frontier commanders
have. At present these commanders are jostling for
position but it seems likely that an alliance will arise
capable of challenging the President’s authority.


Life in Granth is subject to strict laws and harsh
policing, a situation much worse for offworld visitors.
Uniformed and covert operatives of the Special
Service Bureau, a secret police force, have a wide
range of powers. These extend into military matters,
creating an additional complication in naval or military
operations. It may be the strangulating internal politics
of the HPA are the single biggest impediment to its
conquest of the Plavian League.


LURAY
Lying on the fringe of HPA space, Luray is a warm,
damp world inhabited by some 9,000 souls. Technically
claimed by the HPA, Luray has not been occupied by
its forces. This is for a number of reasons, not least of
which because Luray is horribly inhospitable. The entire
human population lives in a fortified enclosure that is
all that remains of a rather grand starport and city built
by entrepreneurial corporations operating out of the
Heptad many years ago. The designation of Class B
for the starport is rather kind; the orbital highport is a
poor remnant of what it once was, prone to dangerous
system failures and the occasional outright disaster.
Ground facilities are run-down but functional, although
few ships come through the port these days.


The downport and associated city are a lawless,
violent place ruled by armed bands who follow various
charismatic leaders vying for control of the port facility
and the little trade it brings in. Refugees from the Plavian
league and the HPA, usually criminals and political
escapees respectively, swell the numbers of colonists
from time-to-time, but the gain is far outweighed by the
number of shootings and other violent deaths. Outside
the fortified port area, Luray is one gigantic, chilly swamp
roamed by a variety of dangerous creatures, some of
which will attack the port or its supporting farms on
occasion. The world may have considerable natural
resources; finding them has proved so dangerous that to
date no accurate survey has ever been made.


Neighbouring Inast was conquered by a rogue
HPA fleet about a century ago, creating a quasi-
independent world which tries to play off the HPA
and the Plavian League to its own advantage. Luray
provides neutral ground where trade and some
unofficial diplomacy can take place. This occasionally
results in a surge in trade or at least a few ships
passing through the remnant of the starport.

PLANETARY TAKEOVER

AND RESISTANCE
It is very difficult to take control over an entire planet
with a significant population but for a starfaring power
there is often no need. One method used by rogue HPA
commanders, and elsewhere by others with a few ships
to their name, is to take control of the starport and a
small surrounding area. This is achievable without
violence in many situations but even if force is required
it need not be particularly destructive. The ability to
land troops almost anywhere and take control of lightly
defended infrastructure allows an indirect approach
to the downport itself, whose defences may not be
sufficient to prevent a direct landing in any case.

However, often the invader will simply declare they
are now in charge, perhaps couched in friendly terms
as a protector or guarantor of free trade. With armed
starships in orbit, it is typical for local authorities to
play along with a polite fiction or to take a deal unless
it is unacceptable. None of this guarantees loyalty,
of course. If the armed ships are transferred away or
driven off, the locals will not fight for their erstwhile
masters. In short, taking control of a backwater world is
easy. Keeping control can be more difficult.


Outlying areas have to be pacified, coerced, won
over or ignored. Which depends greatly upon local
conditions. Often an offworld power will have control
over the port region without changing the rest of the
planet. Sometimes an insurgency or direct military
opposition will emerge. It has been known for an
offworld takeover to result in civil war, in which
resistance is met with force by those cooperating with
the invaders. This can have nasty consequences long
after the invaders have moved on.


Takeovers of this sort are usually ramshackle and finite
in existence, providing opportunities for mercenaries
and troublemakers to ply their trade for one side or
the other. The sort of world that is worth taking over
is not easily pacified by force, whilst those that are
easy to control produce few resources. Having a
home of this sort is seen as prestigious by some HPA
commanders or rogue fleet leaders, although others
might disparagingly refer to it as ‘chicken farming’. On
occasion a group of ship commanders or an admiral
ends up involved in a quagmire trying to keep control
of a world valuable only to their egos. Resources are
squandered and ships are tied down achieving nothing
but the eventual eclipse of those involved. A common
phrase for this fate is to have ‘bought a poultry farm’.
A number of the HPA commanders whose paper
strength is considerable are actually well on the way to
becoming full-time chicken farmers.




Denkard exhibits similar low stellar density to Atoon,
particularly on the trailingward side of the subsector. All
star systems are accessible by a jump-2 ship but routes
are likely to be predictable. There is little trade rimward
into the territory of the Plavian League, although in less
turbulent times the Galvestar-Prevarren run used to be
a regular conduit. About half the subsector is claimed
by the Hochiken People’s Assembly but this does not
translate to being unified or untroubled. The internal
politics of the HPA are such that worlds distant from
the capital may be almost entirely beyond its control at
least some of the time.

The subsector can be a difficult place to do business,
largely due to the politics of the HPA. Even when its
leaders are not bickering among themselves, some of
them are engaging in projects that destabilise the rest of
the subsector. It has been some years since a fleet went

rogue and conquered somewhere but individual ship
captains have been known to take their disaffection to
extremes and embark on private ventures. This means
that an HPA warship might decide to rob a passing
vessel despite being assigned to protect local shipping,
or a security contingent may start running a protection
racket if it seems profitable enough.


DARMIN
Darmin is a water world with little land above sea
level. What there is tends to be rocky and of little
use. The 6,000 inhabitants live in a single floating
city anchored in the lee of an island chain near the
equator. When necessary the city can move slowly,
enabling it to relocate to the most sheltered position
possible. Most storms can be ridden out in place but
when a particularly violent one is forecast the entire
population battens down and the city is moved to
safety. Upon occasion it has been necessary to cut the
anchor chains and allow the whole settlement to be
blown downwind. This has not occurred in a decade but
the propulsion and stabilisation systems are carefully
maintained just in case.


Darmin’s city/raft was created as a platform for
aquaculture. The seas are for the most part very
shallow or extremely deep, with little in between. The
island chain lies at the centre of a wide subsea mesa
where the water is an average 50 metres deep. Huge
seabed farms are worked by robots and submarines,
which also herd large shoals of fish. The world’s
primary export is seafood and sea-grown plants,
most of which are processed into a rather unpleasant
smelling paste to be shipped offworld. When combined
with other ingredients the paste can be made palatable,
although a taste of the sea always remains.


Darmin has the potential to be developed into a
‘breadbasket’ – albeit of a fishy sort – for the HPA.
Doing so would require an influx of workers and
equipment, accompanied by the development of more
settlements. This would be quite an undertaking,
requiring a level of coordination and cooperation
rarely seen in the HPA. Minor and piecemeal efforts
have been made, resulting in a string of half-built
installations on the less forbidding land. A few of these
are still underway, whilst others are being unofficially
cannibalised to expand the more viable projects.
At most a few hundred people are involved in this
endeavour but the exact number is not known.

TARKAAN
Tarkaan is a high-population world located two parsecs
from the official border of the Hochiken People’s
Assembly. It is dry, with a tainted atmosphere which
will make visitors ill but is harmless to those born
planetside. The availability of water determined the
initial settlement pattern and thus the entire future of
the world; cities were founded at the centre of well-
watered areas and separated from one another by
expanses of badlands or desert. Over time nearby
cities coalesced into nations along geographical lines,
and competition for resources inevitably led to friction.


HPA diplomats have attempted to win over or simply
annex segments of the world population, without
much success. The only thing the people of Tarkaan
hate more than outside overlords seems to be one
another; there are dozens of small states making
up the population of around seven billion and most
seem hostile to everyone else. This does not mean
the nations of Tarkaan will not make use of foreign
mercenaries or trade for weapons. They are quite
happy to use outside help in their internal struggles,
just not very welcoming or polite about it. Tarkaan
has become known in the mercenary marketplace as
somewhere there is always work for those willing to be
treated with contempt by their clients.


The fragmentation of Tarkaan means that despite
a good technological base and high population
the world is economically unimportant. Industrial
output and interstellar trade income are both

largely swallowed up by militarisation or expended
in financing wars. This has been the situation for
decades, with many conflicts having roots in old
hatred rather than modern issues. The population
are generally willing to put this enmity aside long
enough to gang up on a rival nation that is getting too
powerful or aligning itself with an outside power.

CONFLICT ON TARAKAN
The nations of Tarakan are not large but have
sufficient population and industry to field significant
armed forces. These are equipped with locally
produced weaponry and, unusually, set up for on-
planet conflict rather than the defence of their world
against outsiders. It is common for worlds with
significant interstellar contact to tailor their forces
to deal with an invasion or raids but the nations of
Tarakan pose more of a threat to one another than
any offworld power might. Aerospace defences exist
and could be used against offworld raiders, however
they are mostly designed to protect cities and critical
infrastructure against grav tanks and missiles.

Due to financial restrictions, most military forces
on Tarakan use ground vehicles for transport. The
superior mobility afforded by grav vehicles makes
them attractive for spearhead units or heavy assault
formations, which bear the brunt of fighting. The


usual pattern is an assault by grav-borne forces
absorbed by less mobile ground-pounders before
the defender’s grav-mobile assets counterattack.
Occasionally a decisive victory is achieved but
more commonly a little territory and some resource-
production areas change hands.


War on Tarakan is usually limited by mutual consent
but there have been occasions where deep hatreds
inspired more extreme conflict. This has included sneak
attacks with small nuclear devices smuggled into a city,
chemical warfare and the all-out obliteration of cities
using either nuclear weapons or orbital bombardment.


The radioactive crater where the city of Speztyi once
stood is now home to a very curious installation.
Some years after the strike that wiped out the city,
a starship of unknown origin landed and built a self-
contained settlement using robots. The ship then
departed, returning a few times to deliver some kind of
cargo or personnel. Surrounded by a heavy defence
zone of robotic weaponry, this settlement has defied
all attempts to investigate or make contact with its
inhabitants. It is rumoured to be populated only by
robots but most species could live comfortably and
safely in such an environment with proper radiation
shielding. The settlement has had few offworld visits in
the past five years and none of Tarakan’s nations are
willing to risk crossing the radioactive defence zone to
look more closely at what might be going on there.




Lowton has the same low stellar density as the
subsectors to spinward of it. This makes transit into the
much denser systems of Hkur! subsector to coreward a
more difficult prospect and limits trade in that direction.
Little is known about the people of that subsector outside
the Akeena Union, which conducts some trade in that
direction. A small main gives access to the subsectors
trailingward but there is little or no information in the
publicly available databases about this region.

About half of the worlds are part of the Akeena Union,
which is made up of a close alliance of humans and
Akeed. The Akeed do not eat meat and humans of
the Union collectively became vegetarians many
generations ago. This makes relations with the K’Kree
much easier and of all the states in Gateway the Akeed
Union is the closest to having friendly relations with
the Lords of Thunder. K’Kree trade ships are routinely

sighted in the territory of the Union. This in turn draws
traders and diplomats from the nearest Gateway
polities in the hope of learning more about the Lords of
Thunder or profiting from relations with them.


AKEEN
Homeworld of the Akeed, and capital of their multi-
world state, Akeen is a water world with a number of
archipelagos and island chains. The Akeed seem to
be equally at home in the water as on land and little is
known about their society. What is known is perplexing
and more usually utterly incomprehensible to human
outsiders. The Akeed seem to like it that way, although
whether they are deliberately keeping secrets or are
just so different that outsiders cannot fathom their
culture is open to debate.


Somewhat more is known about the human inhabitants
of the orbital arcology (and starport) named Sky.
Population and government codes are a best guess
and refer to Sky rather than the planetary population.
The laws of Sky defy comprehension and are probably
based upon traditional Akeed values. The population,
which is mostly human with significant numbers of
Akeed plays an important part in the economic, military
and political operations of the Union.


Various estimates exist as to the technological
capabilities of the Akeed but these are mainly based
on observations of the human population and their
artefacts. It is thought the Akeed population numbers
in the hundreds of millions and that there is an
extensive underwater culture on the planet. Visitors
are welcomed on Akeen (and at Sky) and are treated
with courteous hospitality by the locals. However,
they are restricted to Sky and the human enclaves on
the planet’s islands.


The Akeed do not eat meat and thus are not
considered vermin by the K’Kree. Relations are thus
fairly good, even with the Lords of Thunder, who
maintain a small (human-free) enclave on one of
Akeen’s larger islands. This is said to be something
of a paradise for K’Kree, with small but lush plains
and a pleasant climate. Outsiders are not welcome
other than Akeed diplomats and their vegetarian
human attendants.


BANSERADA
Banserada lies at the trailing fringe of Gateway.
It is not much better than a rockball world and
not considered a permanent home even by its
inhabitants. The entire population is employed by
The Austen Group, a business conglomerate which
also controls neighbouring Boden. The Austen
Group makes a good profit from trade passing from
the Akeena Union into Tm Shanmai and Rattler
subsectors. Details are not publicly available but it is
assumed the human state is under the control of the
Lords of Thunder or in its political orbit.


Banserada builds a few starships for local clients.
These are mostly small, as there is only one large-
ship yard and this is always busy. The large yard
constantly maintains and repairs the smaller yards,
which are mobile and have their own jump drives.
Occasionally a mobile yard from Banserada is
sighted in a system many parsecs from home. At
least two are currently in the Renkard Union, turning
out corvettes as fast as possible. This supports the
theory that the entire infrastructure of The Austen
Group is ready to bug out of Banserada at a few
weeks’ notice. Scouting vessels constantly travel
around the trailingward end of Gateway, presumably
maintaining current information on safe destinations
with good resources.

THE BANSERADA PROJECT
One of the ships built by the Austen Group in
Banserada is of a very curious design. Despite
possessing technology to rival many Imperial worlds,
the Austen Group has chosen to build a large vessel
without jump drives, using only reaction thrusters.
According to those claiming insider knowledge, this
vessel has no artificial gravity systems aboard. It is a
majestic, if curiously primitive, thing. A central spindle
is surrounded by four ‘hamster-cage’ rings set up as
contrarotating pairs. The forward pair have a larger
diameter than the aft pair and are probably used for
accommodation. Fuel modules are docked in a cluster
around the reaction drive which is located right aft.

This vessel, known only by is cryptic designation
SC-02, set out from Banserada some years ago. After
making two solar orbits and presumably conducting


trials, the vessel began accelerating for a stellar
slingshot manoeuvre. Its destination is thought to lie
in the far outsystem, although no likely target body
has been identified. What is most curious about this
ship is that it is supplied and refuelled by conventional
starships. These are easily able to match its velocity,
attaining in a few hours the same vector it has taken
six years for SC-02 to build. Specially designed
tankers and supply vessels refuel the reaction
thrusters every few weeks and it is possible the
crewmembers are also rotated.


Why anyone would go to such lengths to send a
vessel to the outsystem is completely unknown
outside the Austen Group. One hypothesis is artificial
gravity and conventional drives cannot or must
not be used at the target point. There are no good
suggestions as to why this would be and the Austen
Group is not telling.




Abysm consists almost entirely of what is termed deep
rift. There are only two star systems, although there
may be rogue planets and comets as yet undiscovered.
Abysm is considered a strategic asset by the Imperium
as it creates a barrier to incursions and therefore a
frontier that can be left lightly defended. Expeditions into
the rift are occasionally undertaken by the Scout Service
and private exploration companies. It is rumoured the
Deepnight Corporation has one or more ships operating
in this region, although to what end remains a mystery.

SPLINTER
Located five parsecs from anywhere, in the middle
of the Lesser Rift, Splinter is a water world with an
unbreathable carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere.
It has extensive but very primitive sea life, mostly of
a single-celled nature. A small scientific colony was
set up there several decades ago and has grown
into a settlement of around 2,000 people. Most are
researchers or their dependents, or employed in the
service and support sector. The colony is entirely
dependent upon support ships from the Galian
Federation which travel by way of Pasternak and a
deep-space refuelling point or tanker support.

The effort required to maintain the installation at Splinter
makes some wonder if there is something more to it than
investigating primitive ocean life. One idea, popularised
by cranks and conspiracy theorists in the 1080s, is that
Splinter is the site of a secret Galian psionics research
installation, or perhaps a secure backup of all its
records in case some unspecified disaster overtakes the
Federation. Whether or not these ideas have any basis,
Splinter’s scientific community does produce regular,
if dreary, papers on deep-ocean anaerobic life and its
possible applications in terraforming projects.

HAT PROJECTS
There is evidence of a number of what are unofficially
known as HAT (Half-Assed Terraforming) projects in
Gateway. These are usually the result of poor science or
lack of funding but occasionally terraforming techniques

## ABYSM SUBSECTOR


might be carried out maliciously. This amounts to
large-scale ecological warfare and is illegal in the
Imperium, but where there is no over-arching interstellar
government, local agreements, if any, prevail.


Most HAT projects fail quickly and have little impact on
the target world. Others can cause significant long-
term disruption but ultimately fail to alter conditions
favourably. Very occasionally a terraforming project
will take despite it having been abandoned, resulting
in a war between local conditions and the introduced
effects. This can create unusual conditions in some
parts of a world without much affecting others. The
locals might not even know something is happening,
especially low-tech communities who think their weirdly
changeable weather and climate pattern is the norm.


There are a few cases where a HAT project has been
picked up by others for continuation or an alternative
approach, or agencies are trying to reverse a project
that has not gone as planned. There are, according
to rumour, those who plan to ecosystem bomb worlds
taken over by the K’Kree. One option is to seed large
quantities of Splinter’s anaerobic life in the oceans of
a world in the hopes it will destabilise the ecosystem
and make the world uninhabitable or intolerable for
the Lords of Thunder.

Windfleet is considered to lie partly in the Lesser Rift
and partly on its fringe. There are no groupings of
more than two star systems, with the exception of
the Heptad. These seven systems are located in the
trailing-coreward corner and are part of the Plavian
League. The worlds between the League and the
Galian Federation, notably Anderson and Havary,
are important trade links whose starports would
be upgraded but for wrangles about funding and
permission from the planetary governments.

The independent worlds of Windfleet were once part of
the Galian Trade League. This has left varying attitudes
towards the successor states. Some worlds feel


abandoned because they were left outside the newly
formed breakaway states, others fought to become
independent. Neither the Galian Federation nor the
Plavian League is aggressive towards these worlds but
both have their own agenda and are willing to oppose
one another at the expense of local interests.


Until recently, the independent shipping corporation
Gateway Shipping was active in Windfleet, notably
on runs between the Plavian league and Galian
Federation. Its presence has drawn down in recent
years, although quietly. A few ships still make the
Galian-Plavian run but there are virtually no vessels
operating elsewhere in the subsector.








DOVA’S WORLD
Dova’s World is listed in the navigational databases
as a Red Zone, although that can mean something
different outside the Imperium. Red Zones are normally
implemented by the Imperial Navy for political or
military reasons and the Scout Service for scientific
or social reasons. Beyond the Imperial border, a Red
Zone usually indicates extreme danger or a local
interdiction that amounts to the same thing. In the case
of Dova’s World the former is the case. Nobody will
stop a ship from going to Dova’s World but whatever
happens is the responsibility of the operators.


Dova’s World is a small rockball with a single
city of some 90,000 or so people. Its democratic
government collapsed, leaving rival factions
fighting for control of the world. The remains of the
starport have been declared a truce zone, where
daring ship captains can make a good profit trading
medical supplies, life support spares and personal
weapons to delegates from the various factions.
Buckwhackings and robberies are commonplace
despite the truce, however, and it is not uncommon
for a trade party to be engaged in a firefight before
they are even out of sight of a visiting ship crew. The
city’s infrastructure is badly damaged and on the
point of breakdown but there is no sign of abatement
in the violence.

THE HALVERSON’S


ROCKS CONTROVERSY
Halverson’s Rocks is technically the name of the
system’s mainworld, a cluster of large planetoids in the
inner asteroid belt, but the name is generally applied
to the whole system. The star system is the territory of
its independent government, at least according to the
government itself. The corporation Gateway Metals,
successor to Galastrian Metals, would disagree.
According to repeated lawsuits filed on Gateway,
the government of Halverson’s Rocks is illegally in
possession of the company’s assets including mining
ships, industrial facilities and a star system.


According to Gateway Metals, the Galastrian
operation in the Halverson’s Rocks should have
gone to Gateway Metals as part of the reorganisation
following the breakup of Galastrian 800 years ago.
Instead, managers within the local operation co-
opted all assets and illegally declared themselves a
government. Most assets have been replaced several
times over but Gateway Metals continues to pursue
its claim to the system. The company does not really
want to be a system government but it does want
undisputed control over the three planetoid belts and
their rich mineral wealth.


In the interim, a cold war is being fought between
Gateway Metals and the government of Halverson’s
Rocks. On the whole, government ships operate mainly
within the inner belt which contains the mainworld
cluster whilst the outer belt is worked by Gateway
Metals ships. The belt is actively disputed, with ships
from both factions harassing one another as they
search for new deposits. Neither wants a shooting war
but incidents of armed harassment are common.


Whilst the locals use conventional mining techniques,
Gateway Metals has positioned several mobile bases
in the system. These are fitted with jump-1 drives and
an array of detachable modules, permitting a base to be
tailored to the needs of the local situation. Some bases
have processing facilities whilst others are geared towards
rest and recreation for mining crews. The bases deployed
to Halverson’s Rocks are armed for self-defence, carrying
a contingent of fighters for local patrol and security work.
Those operating in other systems may or may not be so
equipped, depending on the situation.


No resolution is likely, so the armed standoff between
corporation and system government is likely to
continue unless something breaks the deadlock. Covert
operations to obtain embarrassing evidence might

permit a legal solution and both
sides have shown willing to use

and incentives to bring in goods

GATEWAY
Gateway (sometimes called
Gateway Prime) is an artificial
planet, constructed in -224
by the Tharver-based firm
Galastrian Metals. A large
planetoid on the inner edge of
the Galian Belt was hollowed out
to create a worldlet that would
be a base for mining operations.
Technically, Gateway is part of
the Galian Belt but is sometimes
listed in astrographic data as a
separate entity.

By the time it became
independent in 251, Gateway
was an extremely prosperous
and populous world. The original
hollowed-out area, now known
as Coreworld, had become a park with a gigantic
reservoir known as the Equatorial Sea. New living
and working areas were built into the rock of the
asteroid and its surface, creating a patchwork of
utilitarian industrial and residential areas which give
a first impression of a typical asteroid settlement. The
interior is famed across the sector and considered
worth a visit by rich tourists from the Imperium.

Gateway is currently the capital of the Galian
Federation. Mining on the asteroid ceased long
ago. Today, most of the world’s income comes from
processing of materials mined elsewhere in the
system, from industry and shipbuilding on Gateway
and through trade coming into the starport. One of
Gateway’s key export is starships, of which almost
half are built at the huge Gateway Yards situated
at the north pole of the worldlet. Black-and-red clad
troops on retainer to the yards provide all internal
security and police functions throughout Gateway,
giving some indication of how important the yards are
to the world and its society.

Castra would ideally be the crossroads of the sector
but its astrographic realities mean navigation is difficult
and many worlds are rather isolated. There are three
groups of three star systems, two of which lie in the
territory of the Plavian League. The other is known as
the Vestra Triad and is isolated by a 2–3 parsec gap
named the Prosaira Deep.

Jump-2 ships ply predictable routes between Castra,
the Akeena union and the Swanfei Free Worlds.
The latter run can be dangerous if a Swanfei leader
decides a little deniable piracy is more profitable
than guarding the trade routes. Plavian patrol ships
are usually stationed along the trade routes as a
deterrent. They may not be sufficient to stop an
incident but as an official witness their captains can
bring considerable influence and force to bear on
a malefactor, unless the patrol ship mysteriously

disappears. This has been known to happen and is
officially blamed on well-armed pirates who clearly
have moved on to other hunting grounds.


TREVANNIC
Trevannic lies between the Plavian League and the
Swanfei Independency but a trade route using the
world would require jump-3 vessels and is thus not
viable. The world has little to offer economically so is
generally ignored by the wider universe. Ships out of
the Plavian League often make an out-and-back loop
from Anderson in Windfleet to Neopis but few make the
extra jump to Trevannic. This makes the system one
of the most isolated in Gateway despite being more or
less in the middle of the region.





Trevannic is home to around 90 million humans
who have a TL6 civilisation, descended from Rule
of Man-era colonists. They share their world with
an unknown number of Droashav, who are often
assumed to be a native species. In fact, this is
unlikely to be the case as the Droashav are the only
six-limbed species on Trevannic. The majority of
Droashav live simple lives as TL1 desert nomads,
some of whom have settled among the humans
on the fringes of their lands. Both species seem to
get along amicably enough most of the time and
Droashav tribes will happily trade for mass-produced
tools and weapons. This may have stunted their own
technological growth.


There is a large enclave of Droashav in the northern
reaches of the planet, in dry semi-arctic terrain.
These Droashav possess TL4, which may have
been learned from humans or developed by the
Droashav themselves. It is thought the Droashav
might be the remnants of a collapsed civilisation,
although little effort has been made to find ruins or
other evidence. The current working theory among
those few scientists interested in this species is that
they are descended from a species that developed
elsewhere and set up a colony on Trevannic before
collapsing back to the stone age. There may be
other Droashav elsewhere.


VARAN’S BELT
The area of sparse star systems between the Plavian
League and the Swanfei Independency is generally
known as the Prosaira Deep. The jump-3 gap makes
it difficult to reach Trevannic and the cluster of three
worlds centring on Polacci. Nevertheless, Varan’s
belt was settled by miners and their dependents
in the latter days of the Rule of Man. Throughout
the Long Night, mining outposts in the system
supplied Polacci and Vestra with raw materials,
and the three worlds of the cluster retained a single
interstellar government. The declining colony on
Polacci was evacuated around -750, other than an
ore transhipment base, but the industries of the Belt
continued to thrive.


In -100, political troubles on Vestra resulted in the
population of Varan’s Belt declaring independence.
A period of confrontation lasted until 350, at which
time the two worlds entered into a trade and mutual
support agreement that lasts to this day. Although
independent, Varan’s Belt has close ties with Vestra
and with the re-established, independent and yet
again failing, colony on Polacci.


The belt is fairly rich in iron and heavy metals and
exports considerable quantities of metals and finished
industrial items (mainly heavy industrial equipment)
to the Plavian League by way of Calliver. Society

in the belt is free and easy, although as in most
belt communities there is a code of taboo against
certain activities that endanger the community. The
differences in ideology between the belt and Vestra
are immense and are to some extent a reaction to
one another’s policies. Despite the variances, both
societies cooperate surprisingly well.

PLANETARY RAIDING

AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
Piracy of interstellar cargoes is only one option
available to those with a starship and loose morals.
A much safer if often not very lucrative option
is planetary raiding. In its most basic form, this
involves landing a ship at a suitable site, driving off
or eliminating opposition and looting the place for
everything that can be quickly removed. The least
profitable but least risky option is to engage in what is
disparagingly referred to as cattle rustling or poultry
theft – targeting small, remote mid-tech communities
where resistance is minimal.


Bolder raiders will hit a town or installation, which
might actually have something worth taking. The
most callous will take life-support and power-
generation equipment from an outsystem facility,
leaving the populace to die or taking them hostage.
Others settle for vehicles and non-vital equipment. A
variation on this practice is to take hostages rather
than harming the settlement itself, demanding a
modest ransom for their return. This has the benefit
of returning the people to work so they can generate
more wealth to be stolen later.


Some planetary raiders take this a step further,
demanding tribute rather than openly attacking. This
might be phrased quite politely or dressed up in the
trappings of an officious tax inspection or could be
a straight demand. Farming multiple communities in
this manner can produce a continuous, if modest,
income even whilst the raiders are busy elsewhere.
Of course, the ‘farms’ must be protected against
other raiders and tribute is preferable to being
slaughtered in a one-off orgy of pillaging. The
raiders might be seen as a necessary evil and their
elimination by a naval sweep the beginning of a
period of uncertainty until the next group moves in.
With the navy likely long gone, the local population
can only hope the new raiders are businesspersons
rather than wanton murderers.




The coreward end of Forcett has a handful of
worlds separated by two-parsec gaps. This allows a
tenuous link to the Akeena union from the Swanfei
Independency. Access to the Renkard Union, the
Megusard Corporate and the independent worlds
of Renkard and Rattler subsectors is considerably
easier. This is a mixed blessing now the Lords of
Thunder have reached the borders of the Renkard
Union and look set to overrun it in the near future.

The systems surrounding the Swanfei Independency
typically have a long history of self-reliance and are
not keen on the creation of a multiworld government.
The threat of K’Kree dominance has finally caused
some to consider forming a defensive alliance or
contributing to a joint force. In some cases this
means donating money or hardware to the defence
of the Renkard Union but since 1091 the Conclave
of Emoress has been ongoing. This was originally
intended to be a month-long conference to discuss
an effective deterrent or counter to the Lords of
Thunder and has become an ongoing event with
delegates from various worlds and corporate bodies

arriving, taking part for a while then withdrawing. A
small core of determined supporters have emerged
and a joint intelligence and planning operation is now
ongoing. This makes Emoress the best place outside
the Renkard Union to get a clear picture of what is
happening on the fringes of Gateway.


CARLTON
Settled around 2,500 years ago, Carlton is a warm
world with wide plains and vast forests, home to
90 million people. As the capital of the Swanfei
Independency, Carlton exerts a great deal of
influence in the local region. Its ports are free and
open, a euphemism for lacking in laws, and are a
major centre for the mercenary trade as well as
for the trans-shipment of dubious goods. Among
the mercenaries and starmercs (mercenary spacer
crews) in the port are numerous privateer ships

- semi-legitimate warships hired as escorts or
freelancing as pirates and smugglers depending
upon the economic climate.





Much of the business on Carlton was founded with
money made by pirate bands or from firms serving
their needs. However, the passage of many years
has allowed most businesses to acquire respectability
and legitimacy. Some vestiges of the pirate heritage
do remain, for example the freeport nature of the
major cities; Carlton Down and the recently-founded
but rapidly growing New Haven. System defences
are good and while customs inspections are cursory,
the authorities do not tolerate piracy. Many dubious
merchant ships and some outright pirates use the
ports of Carlton with the unspoken understanding that
local trade is off-limits.


Carlton’s support of piracy is a point of contention with
other interstellar polities and at present the Galian
Federation has a boycott in place. Its vessels will
not enter Free Worlds space, nor trade with ships
out of the Free Worlds; in practice this means trade
is conducted in neutral ports beyond the borders of
the Free Worlds. In recent years Carlton has seen an
ever-increasing number of individuals either recruiting
mercenary starship operators or representing them.
Whilst most want fighting ships, there is a solid market
for sneaky intelligence-gatherers or captains willing to
run into Lords of Thunder territory and rescue those
who want to leave.

EMORESS
Civilisation on Emoress is shaped by the nature of
the world. What little useable land there is forms
archipelagos and a couple of large islands. Each is a
distinct political as well as geographical region with
its own downport. The shared highport is impressive
for this part of Gateway but is looking run-down. It
was built by the Megusard Corporate as part of a
plan to expand trade in the region. This did not go as
intended and after a couple of decades the backers
pulled out. The nations of Emoress cannot afford to
maintain their orbital port in its original condition and
have sold some of the equipment they inherited. This
has left large parts of the port uninhabitable.


Despite this, Emoress is home to the more or less
permanent conference known as the Conclave of
Emoress. The Conclave provides a significant portion
of the port’s income either from direct funding or
the activities of ships visiting to take part. At any
given time there may be representatives from a
dozen worlds and small states, mercenary forces,
corporations, popular insurgencies and any other
group that might conceivably be worried about the
Lords of Thunder. Each has a need and a plan, but
few have much to offer in terms of resources. A
surprisingly effective joint intelligence task force is
operated by the Conclave, which pays handsomely
for accurate and timely information about K’Kree
activities as well as general information on their
society, leaders and economic situation.

INDEPENDENT NAVAL BASES
Many worlds are marked on the map as having
naval bases but outside the Imperium this can mean
different things. A facility capable of operating a
couple of wings of fighters and landing supply ships
to support them might be considered a naval base. In
some cases, bases might be an adjunct to a starport
or a small facility elsewhere in the system. They may
even be operated by someone other than the system’s
mainworld government.

The naval base at Emoress, for example, is a collection
of modules contributed or paid for by the more well-off
supporters of the Conclave. It began as a refuelling and
repair station for small vessels engaged in intelligence-
gathering runs into the territory of the Lords of Thunder


and gradually gained additional facilities and defences.
The base can support vessels up to around 1,200
displacement tons but has landing areas for large
numbers of craft in addition to multiple wings of fighters.
The base provides a training service for pilots and crews
destined for service elsewhere – a euphemism for those
intent on joining the defence of the Renkard Union.


The base has grown over time and actually generates
some revenue for the mainworld government. The
Conclave moved to the base from the mainworld’s
highport, becoming in effect a secondary, diplomatic
and military port. It is off-limits to those not taking part
in the Conclave or delivering supplies and munitions
but a permit to visit is not hard to obtain for anyone
with less than six limbs.




The spinward-coreward side of Arconna is very
sparse, with Castamaria providing a jump-2 link to
the Khuur League. Trade ships out of Tharver make
regular runs to the league, refuelling from corporate
tankers stationed at Tanis. A similar permanently-
temporary arrangement exists at Williwaw to
support jump-2 traffic headed towards Far Portal
and Phoniwt. This represents a significant volume
of trade, enriching the second capital of the Galian
Federation at Tharver.

The trailing side of the subsector is within the territory
of the Galian Federation. It looks to Tharver as its
capital rather than Gateway as a result of the three-
parsec gulf running more or less across Federation
territory. There are those who believe this half of the
Federation should go its own way and some worlds
are only token members of the Federation. If this drift
towards breakup continues it will surprise no-one; the
disintegration of the old Galian Trade Federation was
a gradual affair for the most part, and the successor
states are anything but internally unified.

FAR PORTAL
The Far Portal system centres on a red giant star
which has destroyed its inner system. Far Portal is
a moon of the innermost gas giant, enjoying a brief
warm period before the star consumes the rest of
its planets or begins its final cooling. The time frame
involved is sufficiently long that the system might as
well have always been as it is now as far as humans
are concerned. Whilst the mainworld population of
around 800,000 is vastly larger than the numbers of
people in the rest of the system, there are a few small
cities on various bodies. All are represented to the
mainworld government as part of a system-wide state.


Accounts vary as to whether Far Portal was ever part
of the Galian Trade League, at least as a full member.
When it suits the system government, they play up
the link and sometimes use it to claim territories in
neighbouring star systems. On other occasions Far
Portal denies any connection to the old League – and
any affiliation with the Galian Federation that comes
with it. This does not mean relations are bad; Far




Portal is an important trade link for the Federation and
profits considerably. Its tiny navy proudly patrols the
neighbouring systems and conducts joint exercises –
it might be better to say tags along with – the navies
of Phoniwt and the Federation.


To date Far Portal has resisted Imperial overtures
and is not receptive to funding under the Gateway
Project. Trade is entirely acceptable of course,
allowing some slow insinuation of Imperial interests.
However, attempts to hammer out a basing
agreement for the Imperial Navy have gone nowhere.
Far Portal allows navy ships to use its port for the
usual fee and makes no concessions, nor does it
recognise the Imperial Navy’s jurisdiction in any
matter. This has led to the bizarre situation of a Far
Portal corvette firing across the bow of an Imperial
cruiser and haughtily demanding it leave the vicinity.
Such incidents are merely posturing and the Imperial
Navy is more likely to produce cartoons of the matter
than to shoot back. The locals know better than to
push it too far and the Imperials do not want to look
like invaders.

THARVER
Tharver was the founder of the Galian Trade League.
Its corporations set up many of the colonies in the
region and created their industries. However, over
time control was lost. Gateway became the capital,
then the League broke up. There are many who
consider the ‘Tharver Half’ of the Galian Federation
to be almost a separate polity and who dislike
receiving instructions from Gateway. Some are also
concerned about how friendly Gateway is becoming
with the Imperium. Imperial ships and money are
welcome at Tharver but distance is maintained.
According to rumour at least this is not the case at
Gateway. It is possible that the ‘Gateway Half’ of
the Galian Federation may effectively become an
Imperial client state whilst Tharver leads a proudly
independent Federation.


Despite this wariness towards Imperial intentions,
Tharver hosts a small complement of Imperial
warships and has a number of Imperial-owned bases
in its cities. Relations are cordial but cooperation
is agreed as and when rather than assumed.
Tharver’s own naval assets patrol the worlds of the
Federation and parts of Outworld and Ownsbee
subsectors as well, protecting its large and ever-
expanding trade fleet. Some ambitious merchants




have begun pushing missions far out to trailing and
even attempting to open up trade with the Lords of
Thunder. This has led to misunderstandings which
had unfortunate consequences for those living closer
to the Lords of Thunder, with the result that Tharver-
registered ships are unwelcome in parts of Gateway.

TRASARIAN FACTORS IN THE GATE
Trasarian Factors was founded in the distant past
and has been an institution of the various Galian and
Galian-Successor states. It has large holdings in the
Galian Federation, the Viyard Concourse and the
Trindel Confederacy, which can have an effect on the
politics of all three. Trasarian in addition has interests
on many worlds. In some cases these have become
a liability as the political wind changes, forcing a
decision. The firm could sell its assets for whatever
it can get and pull out, or it could try to change the
situation to make it more viable.

Imperialisation of worlds in The Gate might impact
Trasarian’s interests there, so it is quietly creating
opposition. This is never overt and usually indirect.


However, the firm does not mind losing some money

- actually, staggering sums by the standards of most
planetary economies – in order to win in the long
term. It will not directly fund anti-Imperial insurgents,
or anything so direct, but will offer a subsidy to a
struggling starport until it is dependent, then apply
pressure to impair Imperial goods and vessels.
Trasarian is also quite happy for others to use funding
it has supplied in good faith for economic development
to support the anti-Imperial movement.


Trasarian Factors is engaged in what amounts to an
economic cold war against the Imperium. Both know it
very well but open accusations are not how the game
is played. The Imperium could crush Trasarian if it
wanted but only by transferring resources currently
in use elsewhere. So the game goes on, with both
sides sponsoring initiatives or quietly undermining
one another. Those who can negotiate this minefield
play off both sides and profit greatly but for the most
part minor players are simply tools for the two major
economic powers of The Gate.




Beckann contains 23 star systems, most of which
are part of either the Trindel Confederacy or the
Galian Federation. One system belongs to the
Viyard Concourse; all others are – at least in theory

- independent. In practice most of these worlds are
disputed and have at times been fully controlled by one
of the regional powers before being lost again.

Beckann is an avenue for commerce between the
successor states to the old Galian Trade League,
when they are not in dispute over the worlds between.
The necessity to maintain interstellar trade links
means even on the rare occasions where these
states are in open warfare against one another in
one system, agreements limit the conflict to that
location. These are not always honoured however and

commerce-raiding attacks are always a possibility.
Freelancers or pirates are sometimes paid to attack
the ships of one power and make it look like someone
else was responsible. This makes the centre of
Beckann an interesting place to do business.


CORALEE
Coralee is a disputed world claimed by both the Trindel
Confederacy and the Viyard Concourse. A fairly non-
descript planet notable mainly for dryness and lack
of atmosphere, Coralee has gained value as a status
symbol since being repeatedly claimed in negotiations
by Viyard and clung onto by Trindel. Its position in what
astrographically should be Viyard space represents
a thumbed nose on the part of Trindel and the
Confederacy is determined to keep the system as a
symbol of defiance. Possession of Coralee would not
gain Viyard any significant navigational advantages.
Ships en route from Viyard to Ariel or Gaspar Belt
would take just as long to get there via Coralee as
via Umbrin. However, it would deprive the Trindel
Confederacy of a convenient marshalling point for an
attack into Viyard space, a consideration that means
more to Viyard than Trindel.


The world itself is home to some 60 million souls,
most of whom are housed in cities situated close to
the world’s few liquid seas. These are mainly found in
deep depressions in the surface, so they are somewhat
isolated from one another. Maglev tubeways link
some cities but most travel is by grav vehicle. It has
been suggested that Coralee may have had a thicker
atmosphere and more water at some time, having lost
both in some ancient cataclysm such as an asteroid
impact. This theory remains unproven.


The system is defended by an assortment of vessels
on loan from various world governments in the
Confederacy. Sovereignty is frequently challenged by
Concourse ships out of Viyard or Umbrin and it seems
likely that if there is ever a shooting war between
Trindel and Viyard, Coralee will be the flashpoint or an
early battleground. It is remotely possible a negotiated
settlement will be reached but both sides have made
much of possessing Coralee and would lose face by
giving up their claim.


TARAVESH
A wet world with a dense atmosphere, Taravesh is one
of the main driving forces in the Trindel Confederacy’s
economy. Capable of building TL12 starships, Taravesh
has a purely military shipyard located in orbit around
one of the system’s gas giants. Raw materials are
mined in the system’s belts and on gas giant moons,
processed at an orbital facility then shipped out to the
yards aboard large in-system freighters. These are an
obvious target for sabotage or a deniable pirate raid
so are provided a security detachment. All transports
have the capability to carry a defensive module,
although most do not have one fitted. Those that do
gain a modest missile and point-defence armament
and the capability to operate a handful of fighters. This
is considered sufficient to make a raid risky which is
usually all it takes to deter potential aggressors.


Taravesh is one of the three sub-state capitals of the
Confederacy, claiming Nadia, Drovinthic and Welmertin’s
Station as its subordinates. Taravesh has also tried
to exert control over Coralee but this is disputed by
Trindel and Ashton. As a consequence, Taravesh has
threatened to withdraw its forces holding the Coralee
system, greatly weakening the Confederacy’s hold over
the new territory and has entered into negotiations with
the Viyard Concourse over a buffer-state independency
deal. This is more likely to be a gambit in the
Confederacy’s internal politics than a serious measure
but diplomats from Taravesh have begun shuttling back
and forth into Viyard space – to the great displeasure of
the rest of the Confederacy.

**C2H-SP (CATCH-BOOT)**
The creature designated C2H-SP was first observed
on a planetoid in an unknown system, quite possibly
beyond Gateway. It is thought to have been brought
to the region aboard or possibly attached to the hull of
Rule of Man-era colony ships. The designation stands
for Class Two Hazard – Suspected Psionic, which has
somehow been mangled into catch-boot by those who
have encountered these creatures.

The catch-boot is a mollusc like creature capable of
surviving in total vacuum for an indefinite period. It
feeds on any source of carbon it can obtain, extending
tendrils through its leathery outer shell to feed and
anchor itself to rock or any other hard surface. The
creature will lie almost entirely dormant for years, or
even decades, and can survive a jumpspace transit
attached to a ship’s hull. It normally obtains food by a
filter process but can bite with a serrated hard area on
one end of its shell. Hapless Travellers who get a boot
caught may be trapped long enough for their suit to be
punctured, at which point the horror begins.

The catch-boot will extend tendrils into any wound
opened in a boot or any other point of contact,
pumping neurotoxic chemicals into the target.
This produces a reaction ranging from catatonia to
euphoria, during which the victim may expire from
vacuum exposure. If not, the toxins will kill them
sooner or later, and the catch-boot’s tendrils will grow
through their body to consume the bounty of carbon-
based matter. Once sufficiently fed the creature will
reproduce asexually, creating a colony.


Catch-boots are most at home in Trace or Very Thin
atmospheres, suggesting those on vacuum worlds and
planetoids got there accidentally. Travellers coming
close to one may feel a sense of directionless unease,
which ironically makes it more likely they will step
on one of the camouflaged creatures as they look
around for threats. If one is attached to a ship in jump
space, everyone aboard is likely to experience severe
nightmares and headaches, which can trigger psychotic
episodes. It is not clear if this is a psionic effect or
another phenomenon.


Little is known about these creatures, other than
they are highly dangerous and rather disturbing.
The few scientists who have done more than dissect
one claim the catch-boot may have an infinite or
extremely long life span and they could have been
transported over a very wide area aboard ships of
the Vilani Imperium or the Ancients.

About half the star systems of Ashton are part of the
Trindel Confederacy, the Viyard Concourse or the
Megusard Corporate. The remainder are independent.
Low stellar density in the trailing-rimward corner of
the subsector limits contact between Megusard and
Viyard, with ships plying between Megusard and
Trindel typically taking a long route through Riftin
subsector. The Trindel Confederacy is thus the
most influential power in the subsector and if not
distracted by other events will eventually annex the
independents along its trailing fringe.

K’Kree ships have been sighted in Ashton with
increasing frequency over the past 20 years or so.
There have always been occasional expeditions or
trade missions but larger groups of ships have been
seen far more often since the Lords of Thunder began
approaching the borders of the Renkard Union. These
groupings usually break up at key points and send

## ASHTON SUBSECTOR


trade missions to various worlds before reforming.
There are rumours the Lords of Thunder are using
these movements to conceal the actual number
of ships they have in the area and are seeking to
obtain a forward base by economic infiltration. An
increase in insurgency and dissidence seems to have
accompanied the K’Kree traders but they deny any
knowledge of the foolish bickering of non-K’Kree.


The supercorporation Four Sectors Arms more or
less owns the world of Bonnhelm. The planet itself
is unimportant and home to just a few thousand
individuals but the system’s location on a natural jump-
2 route across the sector makes it an ideal trade nexus.
The orbital installation at Bonnhelm is officially known
as Bonnhelm High but is generally referred to by the
system name as the orbital installation is essentially the
system mainworld and the planet is irrelevant.

Four Sectors Arms has a modest in-system defence
force and a few armed traders but mostly sells to
ships passing through the system. It has clients
on many independent worlds as well as the main
regional powers and maintains generally cordial
relations with all of them. There are few restrictions
on what Four Sectors Arms will sell, nor to whom,
and it is common knowledge the corporation meddles
in planetary affairs as far afield as Crucis Margin
when there is a profit to be made. Four Sectors Arms
aims to create a sustained demand for weaponry,
which translates to many long-term conflicts rather
than a single short, victorious campaign. It has an
interest in keeping the region divided and troubled
but not sufficiently enough to cause an economic
collapse. To this end, Four Sectors will occasionally
act to end a conflict rather than prolonging it beyond
the point where it is most lucrative.

interstellar capability until the mid-400s. Its billion or
so inhabitants have been ruled by a series of dictators
since the collapse of a democratic government in

944. Control over the population was supposed
to be enhanced by a ban on personal weapon
ownership but this has backfired in places. Disarming
a population used to owning weapons proved an
extremely difficult task, with militias resisting the
effort in some areas. A combination of penalties and
inducements have brought most of the populace into
line, with some segments of society still ignoring the
edict to turn in their guns.


Dover’s excellent starport lies on the rather
roundabout jump-2 route between Trindel and Carlton
and whilst the world cannot build jump-2 ships
itself it operates a few freightliners using imported
drives. Tensions between Dover and the Swanfei
Independency are increased by sporadic raids which
the Independency completely fails to condemn or
control. At the same time emissaries from Carlton are
quick to protest when a Dover ship fires on a suspect
vessel, even in the Dover system. This is having the
effect of pushing Dover into the Trindel camp, with
a real chance it will apply for membership of the
Confederacy in the near future.





GRAVIN
Gravin is very much a backwater world which
sees little interstellar traffic. Neighbouring Dover
apparently has no interest in extending its
territory into the Gravin system and since it is not
really on the way to anywhere, Gravin remains
something of an irrelevance. This was not
always the case and there are signs of human
habitation in the distant past – probably the Ziru
Sirka era. The ruins of a small city are said to
exist, surrounded by a once cultivated hinterland.
Apparently a few thousand people once dwelled
on Gravin, they must have had spacecraft as
there are clear signs of landing areas and with
no other indications of habitation these people
cannot have been native.


The subject has not received much attention
given the remote location of the site but the
few researchers who have visited claim they
found obviously human artefacts, some bearing
inscriptions in Vilani. The current best-guess is
that Gravin was some kind of forward base to
support exploration of the region, or perhaps
a colony set up by a misjumped vessel. If so,
theirs must have been a lonely existence with no
prospect of returning home or being found. It is
possible that the wreckage of a starship found
drifting in the Finestre system is related to this
settlement. That ship was said to have been
built for humans but was equipped with a badly
deteriorated and rather primitive jump drive. The
current location of the wreck is unknown.

WRECKS AND RUINED CITIES
The patchy history of Gateway means many colony
missions were simply forgotten about, including some
secondary expansions from colonies that were at
the time doing quite well. The discovery of evidence
that a given world was once inhabited rarely causes
much excitement; the go-to explanation is colonists
landed there and established a community that faded
away over time. In a few cases, closer inspection
has produced a different explanation or led to a more
intriguing mystery.


It is possible there are Vilani Imperium-era ruins on
some worlds, or even that some Vilani populations
were established and survived long enough to be
incorporated into the Rule of Man-era colonies. The
Vilani are not known to have deliberately pushed out
this far and reaching the middle of Gateway would
be quite an undertaking with the technology of the
time. However, it is entirely possible ships could have
misjumped and been unable to return home.


Another theory is currently enjoying a resurgence
of popularity. Perhaps the Ancients seeded some
unknown human group on the worlds of Gateway
shortly before their Final War. What might have
become of these people; could their communities
have survived into the modern era in some form?
This idea forms the basis of an even wilder
suggestion which a small band of scientists and
Ancients hunters are trying to prove.


According to this group, a human population may have
rebelled against their masters in the last years before
the Ancients’ Final War, stealing ships and filling them
with equipment before heading to the furthest reaches
of Gateway. This leads naturally to the idea that there
were free humans with access to Ancients technology
in Gateway 300.000 years ago and they may have
left behind a game-changing stash of technology or
starships. The idea has few adherents but they are
fervent, leading to small ‘gold rushes’ as evidence is
found on some remote moon or corner of a backwater
world. There is no reason to suppose there is any
truth behind the theory, however.




The primary astrographic features of Riftin are the rather
grandly titled Silest Main, which forms the backbone of
the Renkard Union and the four-system Goldstar Cluster.
Jump-2 transit to trailing is relatively easy whilst wider
gaps make contact to spinward more of a problem. This
natural astrographic break is generally thought to guide
the strategy of the Lords of Thunder. It is expected they
will advance rapidly through the Renkard Union, then
more slowly into the subsector’s main stellar groupings.
This will, most experts think, be followed by a period of
consolidation and pacification. Small-scale advances
may occur but the expected sudden surge forward
should stop at Megucorp Alpha. This is not much comfort
for the people of Riftin.

## RIFTIN SUBSECTOR


The primary economic factors in the subsector are
Megusard and Renkard, although Megusard is far
more politically influential. The Renkard Union has
traditionally been anything but unified, considerably
limiting its political weight. With the developing threat
to trailing this has dwindled to almost nothing, although
trade ships continue to ply back and forth. These
days, Renkard is a major market for naval and military
hardware, with ships coming from across the sector
and the Imperium. Some weapons arrive as aid but
most have a price tag attached. It may be that even if
the Renkard Union survives it will collapse under the
weight of debt to the arms market.

ATHENE
Athene is a very wet world, with deep oceans
teeming with life. Some indigenous species are large
and quite dangerous – ocean-going megafauna
can pose a threat to a submarine and are kept
away from inhabited areas by maritime units of
the Defence Force. The main maritime training
facility of the Megusard Corporate’s Defence Force
is located on Athene and gains regular live-fire
training courtesy of the world’s aquatic life. Athene
is something of a breadbasket for the Megusard
Corporate, with excellent growing conditions on its
small land masses. Although only 10% of the planet
is above sea level this is still a lot of land and much
of it is good farming country. Vast farms employ a
large number of personnel from the coastal and
island towns and from them bulk cargo vessels ship
produce to the worlds of the Corporate.


The population of some 10 million or so live in
three large city-states and a number of smaller
settlements. Two cities are underwater while the
third, Athene Prime, is located on an equatorial
island and is both the world’s downport and capital.
Most smaller settlements are constructed on islands
or the shores of larger land masses. Rather than
a strict bureaucratic government system, Athene
has a complex administrative system based on
factionalisation and control of key industries.
Workers’ organisations in key industries each have
representatives on the planetary government and
often find themselves at odds over issues like budget,
social programs and education. This system arose


as a result of corruption among the leaders some
years ago; a period of power-brokering and internal
dissent resulted in a new power structure that works
reasonably well but is hamstrung by too many vested
interests and an excess of checks and balances that
prevents much actually getting done.


SARDIS
Sardis is the seat of government for the Megusard
Corporate and the location of most company
headquarters, the main banks and other critical
institutions. It is also the headquarters for the
Corporate Defence Force, which is based out of
Sardis’ larger artificial moon, Saina. Saina is a large
planetoid, one of just a handful of such bodies in
the system which was captured and brought into
orbit over the mainworld several centuries ago. The
naval base has been gradually extended over the
years and is now a formidable fortress equipped with
prototype meson guns buried in armoured bunkers,
with particle accelerators and missile launchers
in installations scattered over the surface. Saina
houses the Defence Force space training facility as
well as maintenance and berthing facilities for most
of the fleet.


Although its standard atmosphere is tainted badly
enough to require a mask, Sardis is a fairly pleasant
world to live on. It was settled early in the human
expansion into Gateway and has grown into a major
economic and industrial centre. Products from the

factories of Sardis are sold across the sector and
even into Crucis Margin to rimward. The mainworld
has a second artificial moonlet named Braihe. Braihe
is another deliberately captured body and the site
of Braihe Highport, the main interstellar port for the
entire Corporate. With many landing areas for large
and small ships, Braihe serves most of the traffic
through the system, with sublight craft plying a regular
service to Megusard Downport on Sardis. The moonlet
is a major site for shipbuilding, with several yards
building private and corporate vessels. At present all
the yards are busy with many orders from Renkard.
Security has been increased to avoid the possibility of
interference in the completion of contracts.

THE GATEWAY LEGION
Riftin is the most forward point where the Gateway
Legion of the Loyal Sector Guard has a significant
presence. According to reports back home, contingents
are present on several worlds but in reality some are
fully equipped and combat-ready divisions. Even those
who know the scale of the LSG presence may not be
aware of its combat capabilities.


Gateway Legion forces are mostly equipped for
defensive warfare against the Lords of Thunder. They
have large quantities of anti-armour and aerospace
defence weapons including planetary defence systems.
Armoured vehicles are light but far more advanced than
anything the local forces can field. An Imperial official
might be concerned the LSG could take on a planetary
army and win; local commanders know they would
stand little chance against such a force.


There is no indication the Gateway Legion intends
to do any more than defend the region from K’Kree
incursions. However, ambassadors from the Lords of
Thunder decry the Gateway Legion as inflammatory
and claim LSG-backed vessels routinely enter its
space on ‘missions of aggression and rapacity’. It
is widely suspected the Gateway Legion’s leaders
want a war with the K’Kree here, far from the Imperial
border, and hope it will draw in a full-scale Imperial
response. There are those who wonder what purpose
this combat-ready force will be turned to if that war
does not soon materialise.




Ownsbee is mostly independent, with a few worlds
belonging to the Galian Federation in the trailing-
coreward corner. Most trade from the Imperium moves
through the ports of this subsector, making both the
Imperium and the Federation influential in local affairs.
Imperial navy ships belonging to the Ley Sector Fleet
are not uncommon in the subsector; Galian vessels
less so but still encountered from time-to-time.

Many trade ships turn around at the independent
world of Caldwell, selling on their cargoes to local
traders or merchants from the Federation and taking
on new goods brought there from Federation worlds.
Other vessels proceed on to Tharver or even Gateway
itself and there is an increasing presence of Imperial
businesses throughout the subsector. The majority

of money spent by the Gateway Project is devoted to
these worlds, either directly or to influence decision-
making in favour of Imperial interests.


The world Amber has a repressive, unstable
government opposed by a vigorous pro-Imperial
insurgency. Although the Galian Federation does
not approve of the world government and has
generated considerable bad press by supporting it, the
Federation has chosen to assist against the rebels. It
is widely assumed these are aided by Imperial-funded
mercenaries and that a secret agreement will recognise
a revolutionary government if one emerges. This might
damage Imperial-Galian relations but both powers
appear to think the risk is worth it.






BAKER
Baker was once part of the Galian Trade League
and vigorously resisted attempts to retain it as part
of the Galian Federation. This involved violence
until the Federation concluded Baker was not worth
the effort. The world began a gradual decline at
that point, proudly isolated from the Federation and
at times openly hostile to it. This might have gone
on for longer had Imperial diplomats and traders
not persuaded the world government to change its
stance. In reality, the government of Baker knew
its position was untenable in the long run and was
entirely willing to accept Imperial investment in return
for a reconciliation with the Federation.


Today, Baker provides an alternate route into the
Galian Federation for Imperial ships wishing to avoid
Caldwell. Over-reliance on one local government is
generally considered a bad thing and the creation
of a Class A starport at Baker actually improved
the Imperials’ bargaining position when requesting
passage rights. Baker’s decline has been turned
around completely and the world seems to be
enjoying something of an economic golden age.
Some money has been put into improved system
defences which, along with good relations with the
Imperium, is exactly what the Gateway Project was
set up to achieve.

BASTERNEVIS

prospect for colonisation in the Rule of Man era and
it is entirely possible that Solomani colonists might
have landed there. If they did, they would have found
an apparently indigenous non-human species who
were at around TL5. These people were for a long
time referred to as the Remnant but more recent
scholarship has led to better understanding of their
society and they are today more commonly known as
the Capry. Basternevis was overcome by catastrophe
at some point during the Long Night, and was
unpopulated when human colonists arrived sometime
in the early 300s.


A modest TL8 society exists today on Basternevis,
with most of the 500,000 inhabitants living in a
cluster of towns in the centre of the largest continent.
Sheltered by a tall mountain range to the west,
this area has cleaner air than most of the planet.
On the other hand, a more concentrated version
of the atmospheric taint is precipitated out at the
mountains, creating a dead zone at their foot which
is visible from space. The taint is complex and mildly
toxic to most living things. Much of the planet’s flora
is developing a resistance but tends to be fragile
and sickly. Even the cleanest areas are vulnerable to
minor climatic variations.




It is quite obvious that this situation cannot have
been going on long but there are much more
interesting planets to investigate and little scientific
interest in such a backwater. There are rumours
that traces of a lost civilisation have been found –
some say human and some say alien – and that
the atmospheric taint may be the result of runaway
industrial pollution. The wilder tales speak of a ruined
city where adventurers battle one another to retrieve
valuable relics.

SOMBERVIEW
Somberview is in many ways typical of the
independent worlds of Gateway. A more or less barren
world with only a trace of atmospheric gas, it was
settled hundreds of years ago then largely forgotten
about. With a population of around 600 millions and
a mid-tech industrial base the world is a potential
market for high-tech goods. The main obstacle for this
is lack of funds to buy them. In recent years, various
members of the Gateway Project have been active on
worlds like Somberview, investing in local industry and
assisting in advancing technological capabilities. This
is not altruism but commercial pragmatism; creating
a modest export capability makes the world a viable
market – and not coincidentally the improvements in
quality of life should win friends.


Not all such efforts have been success stories but
Somberview is considered a showcase by many.
Although the world’s official Tech Level is still 7
it has a modest TL9 industrial base operated by
skilled locals trained on-site or educated at Imperial
universities. Resources are locally garnered and
products are divided between supporting further
advancement and trade for higher-tech goods.
This has created something of a dependency; until
Somberview has a sufficient industrial base it will
be reliant on its offworld investors and might suffer
a collapse or at least a slump if they pull out. This
is part of the plan; good business is beneficial for
everyone involved but those who have the resources
call the shots.


TERRAFORMING SOMBERVIEW
Several attempts have been made to terraform
Somberview in the hope of making it less inhospitable.
Most have been badly funded HAT (half-assed
terraforming) projects that achieved virtually nothing.
The latest has more promise but is using an unproven
technique. Icy planetoids from the system’s Oort cloud
are directed inwards and much later caught by craft
which place them in ‘ready’ orbits, from which they
are guided close to the mainworld. Finally the rocks
are soft-landed in sheltered areas to create small
deposits of ice. Any gases released in the process
are a bonus, as thickening the atmosphere is an
extremely long-term project.


Sites for ice deposits are carefully chosen to provide
a combination of shelter from direct sunlight and
geothermal warming, creating a crust of ice over
slushy depths. Here, simple life has been introduced.
According to rumour this is single-celled creatures
from Splinter but there are other possible candidates.
The long-term aim is to create areas of life-bearing
liquid water on Somberview. Results so far have
hardly been promising but the project’s funding
continues to increase. This may be for pragmatic
reasons – the Imperial authorities have found a place
to try a new terraforming technique without chancing
harm to Imperial citizens.

About half of Ariel is the territory of the Viyard
Concourse, with the remainder being independent,
in theory. The breakup of the Galian Trade League
had varying effects on the people of Ariel. Some
worlds barely noticed, others were fought over or
lost vital offworld goods and suffered a plunge in
sustainable technology. Although several worlds
are now mid-tech societies their people are well
aware of what can be done with the right equipment
and knowledge, and in most cases have learned
to replicate important functions using lower-tech
equipment, more personnel and greater effort.

The highest technology in the subsector is possessed
by the Faar, a race native to Alphaaric. They seem to
have no interest in the wider cosmos however and have
not come to dominate the region – either politically or

economically – as they might have done. The Galian
Federation, Trindel Confederacy and Viyard Concourse
all court the Faar as allies and trading partners, but none
have achieved much of an advantage.


The low-population world of Pathway is officially
designated an Imperial client state. Essentially this
means the Imperial authorities have negotiated a
deal to set up a small scout/naval base there. The
base supports forward deployments and contact with
the Faar, and is assumed to be a marshalling point
for information gathered by a web of agents in the
surrounding subsectors. The world’s modest port sees
considerable jump-2 traffic moving between the Galian
Federation and the Viyard Concourse, and thence to
more distant ports.






ALPHAARIC
Alphaaric is the homeworld of the Faar, a non-human
species possessing high technology but apparently
little inclination to leave their world. The system data
partially reflects the human presence in the system.
For example, the Class A port designated by the data
is Faarview, a port/city orbiting Mashan, the system’s
largest gas giant, and not the Faar’s homeworld port.
Faarview has a population of some 20,000 humans and
this population is listed in the data.


Population figures, like much else about the Faar, are
unknown. What is certain is that the Faar possess TL13
devices and can apparently construct them. They have
studied jump drives provided by humans and not only
profess to understand them but have offered theoretical
advice on improving the design – yet the Faar have no
desire to build or even board a spacecraft. The Faar
do trade with humans, mainly from the neighbouring
Galian Federation. They welcome spacefarers to
their many small Class D equivalent spaceports and
trade happily for electronics, recreational devices
and artworks. They will not sell weapons or starship
components and have no interest in buying them.


The age of the Faar civilisation is not known but it
seems likely this is their homeworld, and that they
have had some form of civilisation for at least 20,000
years. Society seems to be well balanced and the
population are apparently content, although exactly
how the Faar govern, police and administer remains
unclear. Archaeologists have occasionally found
ruins built by the Faar on worlds very distant from
Alphaaric. The connection has never been proven
and the Faar decline to comment.

INDOLENCE
Home to 90,000 people governed by a hereditary
governor-for-life, Indolence is an independent world
close to the rimward end of Ariel and on the verge of
the Crucis Margin sector. A backwater world, Indolence
is only useful as a jump-2 link across that end of the
subsector or into Crucis Margin. It is rumoured that
ships in the area sometimes experience problems
with their jump drive ranging from longer duration in
jump space to a complete inability to enter jump for
several hours or days at a time. Some ships have gone
missing, leading to wild tales about something called
deadspace. Its existence has never been proven and
most of what is known about the phenomenon comes
from the background of a particularly lurid interstellar
drama popular a century ago.


Those that make the journey to Indolence find a chilly,
overcast world with a thick, soupy atmosphere and a
dull, dark green landscape covered in thick shrubby
forests. The sole human habitation is on a large island
near the equator where the climate is more pleasant.
The population are scattered across this island in
communities of a few hundred. The vegetation of
Indolence is anything but indolent and breaks up roads
almost as quickly as they can be constructed. Thus most
transport is by air, with dirigibles being the commonest
load-carrying transport. Every community has a dirigible
field and the starport at the capital is merely a larger
than usual airship yard where starships sometimes land.
The locals are not particularly interested in offworlders

or their goods. They will trade courteously enough but if
no ship ever came into Indolence again, nobody would
care. Few would even notice.

There are rumours of ruins in the wilds of Indolence,
as with several worlds in the region. In this case,
the rumours are true. Some niche scientists and
explorers have postulated that a spacefaring
civilisation colonised Indolence around 4-5,000 years
ago, stayed for a couple of millennia then upped
and off leaving virtually nothing behind. The human
population arrived before these others left and have
ancient tales of friendly but strangely fearful aliens
who once shared their world. This information is
surprisingly hard to come by and cannot be found in
most common datanets.

THE FAAR IN GATEWAY
According to some scientists, ruins found in other
parts of Gateway are definitely of Faar origin, although
it is difficult to prove this since the Faar do not grant
access to their modern communities. All supposedly
confirmed Faar sites show signs of violence,
hurried abandonment, or both. There are no known
communities of Faar anywhere but their homeworld.
The humans who live with the Faar generally do not
discuss the matter and will shut down any discussion in
an uncharacteristically blunt manner.

Occasionally, humans do leave Faar society. This
is rare and those that do are generally unsavoury
individuals or the victims of some tragedy that leaves
them seeking new homes and meanings. These
people can sometimes be induced to talk about


the Faar reluctance to travel and their responses
are split roughly 50/50 between two apparently
contradictory tales. According to some the Faar
voyaged over vast distances, far beyond the sector,
aboard their own ships and some they found drifting
and managed to repair. They went everywhere, saw
everything and realised that exploring far-off space
was a dead end. Now the Faar explore the universe
through music, poetry and art, and best of all through
the companionship of good friends. It is here, they
maintain, that real truths are found. The rest is just
rocks, gravity wells and radio waves.


There is another version of this tale. In this, the Faar
voyaged to a distant star where they found wondrous
starships and took possession of them. They
wandered, explored and found something that terrified
them so much they ran home, hid, destroyed their
starships and huddled around tables with their friends.
They may hope whatever it was might not find them
but if it does, nothing but annihilation awaits. Better
to enjoy the company of friends in the meantime than
waste time on exploration and science that will only to
attract attention.


It is possible none of this is true. If any of it is, the Faar
may have encountered something that could wipe
out Charted Space. It is said they will not talk about it
partly out of fear that ‘it might hear’ but also to protect
everyone else. If they knew, they might go looking –
and the Faar do not want that to happen. In the end,
it might be better not to know what the Faar learned,
and they are certainly not inclined to inflict such terrible
knowledge on anyone else.




Cinder contains 20 star systems, 12 of which lie
within the Viyard Concourse. Around 12 billion people
live in the subsector. Whilst the vast majority of
these sophonts are humans, local minor species are
represented in small enclaves on some worlds. The
Galian Trade League never incorporated the worlds of
Cinder that currently lie outside the Viyard Concourse,
so there is no history – good or bad – of membership.

Cinder provides several good markets for goods from
the Viyard Concourse and Megusard Corporate; worlds
with sufficient technology to produce valuable goods
in return and/or a high enough population to create a
demand for bulk items. Competition between Megusard
and Viyard traders is high but generally amicable since
both states benefit greatly from trade with one another.

## CINDER SUBSECTOR


The FJT (five-jump-two) route from Mast to Megucorp
Beta is used for most direct trade but the majority of
goods are shipped to the neutral port at Waystation.


The Waystation system has a significant Gateway
Shipping presence, based out of a small independent
port in the same asteroid belt as the system capital.
Waystation is the trailingmost of Gateway Shipping’s
facilities and was never particularly large. It serves as
a turnaround point for Gateway’s own vessels and a
recreation facility for their crews. Training services and
some minor maintenance are also offered, used mainly
by vessels out of Waystation itself. Given the situation
a subsector to trailing it is no surprise that Gateway
Shipping is drawing down its presence in the region
and there are rumours the training facility has been
leased to a small company delivering a crash-course in
shipboard operations to the raw personnel recruited by
the Renkard Union.

PARADISE OF EL
Isolated in the Silveron Deep, inaccessible by even
jump-2 ships except by a lengthy transit along the
astrographic feature known as the Gateway Sword,
Paradise of El is a pleasant, temperate world,
although with a rather thin atmosphere. El was
settled by a group of isolation-seeking colonists as
twilight gathered and the Long Night drew in. Rightly
guessing hard times were ahead, the colonists set
out to become as self-sufficient as possible. Their
technology base was low but extremely rugged and as
a result El came through the Long Night remarkably
well. Contact with the rest of Gateway did not come
until 226, when a long-range scouting mission out of
the Galian Trade League crossed the Deep via Caster
and Shin, and recontacted the many isolated worlds of
the Morrell Scatter.


Contact remained intermittent until the 900s,
when the Viyard Concourse underwent a period of
expansion and attempted to annex various systems
in the Scatter. The operation was not a success but
in the case of El, a small military base was set up
at the Starport and Viyard officials began to issue
dictates to the government of El. The inhabitants of
El, accustomed to being left to their own business,
reacted with a vigorous but inept guerrilla campaign.
The locals could not seriously threaten the Viyard
forces at the port but Viyard was now finding its
trailing possessions to be an embarrassment rather
than an asset. An unspoken compromise was


eventually reached; a Viyard-backed government
would rule the planet from its starport fortress and the
population would ignore it. This has been the case for
the past 50 years or so, with no sign of change.


PICARD’S BELT
Situated at the rimward end of the Morrell Scatter,
Picard’s Belt is a highly unusual asteroid field. The belt
is truly vast, so much so that the star appears hazy. It
has never been properly mapped and new discoveries
are constantly being made. Apart from the awesome
belt, the system is more or less empty. Even its Oort
cloud is unusually thin, as if all matter in the system has
been concentrated into the belt. How or why this could
occur is beyond understanding. A number of Belter
communities, perhaps totalling 900,000 souls, are
scattered around the fringe of the belt. Ore is exported
mainly to the Viyard Concourse. There is no central
port; several communities have processing works and
these all have their own Class C ports. Thus the Belt
can seem to change at every visit.


Not everyone comes to Picard for ore. A number
of scientific and treasure-seeking operations are
taking place within the belt. Strange artifacts have
been found on the asteroids of the belt, including
pyramidal buildings, a 20 centimetre sphere of an
unknown alloy and a 50 kilometre asteroid cored
by some immense force, leaving behind a mirror-
like inner surface. The origin of these artifacts is
unknown but likely alien. It has been suggested that
an unknown civilisation exists deep in the belt but no
traces have ever been found.

THE MORELL SCATTER
The Morell Scatter is a semi-official term given to the
sparse star systems of Cinder and Farina subsectors.
The most prominent astrographical feature of the
region is the Gateway Sword, a straight line of
systems from Waystation to Rios which permits
jump-2 access to most other worlds in these two
subsectors. Ships from the Megusard Corporate,
the Renkard Union and the Viyard Concourse have
traditionally carried most of the trade moving around
the Scatter, although in recent years Renkard vessels
have been occupied elsewhere.

The Scatter is in many ways typical of Gateway. A two
parsec range is required to navigate it, although many
ships use two one-parsec jumps to cross between


worlds. Information and goods generally move
slowly through the region along predicable routes.
Occasionally vessels are positioned to intercept those
of a rival, denying them an accurate picture of what
is happening whilst an action is taken on one of the
other worlds in the region.


With Renkard and, to a lesser extent, Megusard
distracted by events to trailing, Viyard vessels have
been increasingly common in the Scatter. It is likely
some worlds are moving towards a more pro-Viyard
stance either out of generated goodwill or as a result
of economic pressure. Whether this will lead to
formal expansion or simply greater presence remains
to be seen.




Farina contains 23 star systems, most of which
are at least in theory independent. The strongest
economic and political influences come from the
Megusard Corporate and the Renkard Union, with the
more distant Viyard Concourse generally occupied
elsewhere. Viyard-registered trade ships are not
uncommon in the subsector but it has never been an
area of great political interest to the Concourse. That is
changing as the Lords of Thunder make their presence
known but not quickly.

There are no heavily industrialised worlds in Farina,
making it a market for goods from the Renkard Union
and the Megusard Corporate. The population of the

SILVERON
A large, wet world, Silveron is home to five million
people who dwell in a large number of settlements
across the temperate regions. Government is very
loose, with power in the hands of a small, educated
class who perform technological functions in return
for support from the community. The forests of
Silveron are home to much unique flora and fauna,
and exports include a number of plant and animal
derivatives used in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries. Exports are usually bulk shipments picked
up once or twice a year by ships from the Renkard
Union plying the Gateway Sword which extends from
Waystation to Rios.


Silveron is renowned for the variety and ferocity of
its carnivores, which pose a serious threat to the
settlements. They are kept at bay by a social caste
who proudly refer to themselves as Expendables.
Expendables are usually young people hoping to earn
the right to a full education and therefore the chance
to become a leader or technical advisor. A period of
service is required for all persons wishing to enter the
higher-education process. This has the result that the
leaders and scientists of Silveron all have a strong
pragmatic streak. Of course, many Expendables
serve for a time and go on to other careers or make
Expendability their career, training and leading the
next generation of guardians.


RIOS
Rios lies at the trailing end of the Gateway Sword, a
broken chain of worlds running from Waystation and
giving jump-2 access to Trondelm. The system is
claimed by Trondelm but has never been developed
into a significant asset. Possession serves mainly
as a status symbol and to guarantee access to the
Gateway Sword. The three million inhabitants are
governed directly from Trondelm and for the most part
work in industries that support the starport. There is a
modest population in remote areas, mainly extracting
resources or living in self-sufficient communities that
rarely interact with the offworld government.


Rios is said to have indications of habitation in the
past. According to some independent experts the
ruins seemed to be of Faar origins, although Rios is
very unlike Alphaaric. Hard information is difficult to
come by, and Trondelm discourages visitors, but it
seems at least some of these settlements suffered
massive destruction similar to that caused by orbital
bombardment. If the Faar did have distant colonies and
they were wiped out, this might explain their reluctance
to leave their homeworld. It does raise the question of
who destroyed these settlements, and why?

THE SLETEKK
The Sletekk is a vicious and sneaky carnivore
thought to be native to Silveron. This is probably
the case, although populations have been
recorded on other worlds where they have
caused havoc among people and the native
wildlife alike. The Sletekk can best be described
as a feathered leopard, favouring lightly wooded
terrain but entirely willing to plunge into deep
forests. Sletekk can climb alarmingly fast using
their claws and will leap from a high place onto
their prey as a favoured gambit. Their feather-like
covering can be puffed up to keep warm or look
intimidating and acts as excellent camouflage
due to its light-absorbing matte colouration. This
ability to regulate temperature also gives the
Sletekk a measure of concealment even from
thermal devices, although it is instinctive rather
than a reaction to the presence of sensors.

Sletekk travel in small family groups, usually of
three or four adults and two to six cubs of varying
ages. They birth live young and are extremely
protective of them, and are smart enough to know


that armed humans are a real threat. Sletekk
will stalk and kill humans just as they would a
rival predator, even if they are not hungry. A
family group usually has a range of about 30–40
kilometres depending on the availability of food.


The Camouflage trait refers to the DM applied
to attempts to spot a Sletekk or to hit one with a
weapon from more than 10 metres if there is any
concealment available. It also applies to thermal
sensors.

The prevalence of independent powers in the Trailing
Frontier has resulted in preferences for starship
equipment not seen elsewhere. Some systems
parallel those peculiar to other regions, whilst others
are not generally found elsewhere. In theory, all
systems could be built by any competent starship
component manufacturer. However, the same
problems may be solved in other ways or the need
simply may not exist in other regions.

The relative sparsity of star systems and absence
of large mains in Gateway combined with the low
availability of greater than jump-1 drives makes
navigation something of a problem. This can be
solved by carrying sufficient fuel for more than
one jump but this detracts from the ability to carry
cargo. One solution, also used elsewhere in Charted
Space, is to make part of a ship’s cargo capacity
configurable as fuel tanks.

Any cargo area can be built or reconfigured as
fuel/cargo space. This requires the addition of
accessways, hatches and heavy-duty partitions.
Once in place, swapping from fuel tankage to cargo
space requires little more than flushing out the tanks
to ensure no liquid hydrogen remains then loading
them with cargo as needed. In theory, fuel tanks could
be retrofitted to be used for cargo but this can be a
problem if the tanks are oddly shaped or access is
tricky. On most ships only a small part of the fuel tanks
might be suitable for these retrofits.

# HIGH GUARD: TRAILING FRONTIER




Cargo/fuel containers cost Cr5000 per ton of capacity
and require 0.05 tons of additional equipment, for
example a fuel/cargo container capable of carrying
100 tons takes up 105 displacement tons and costs
Cr500000. A given tank/hold must be used either
for cargo or fuel. It is not possible to mix cargo and
fuel unless specialised containers are used, which
will greatly drive up the cost. For this reason, fuel/
cargo areas are typically constructed as blocks
sufficient to fulfil a particular purpose. A ship might
have a dedicated cargo hold, enough fuel for
normal operations and one jump, plus one or more
configurable areas each containing enough fuel for
an additional jump. At the price of some capacity,
such a vessel becomes vastly more flexible yet
retains the ability to navigate between the sparse
star systems of Gateway.

MEGUSARD PROTOTYPE


MESON GUN EMPLACEMENT
The meson gun becomes available at TL12, or rather
that is the Tech Level at which a reliable and cost-
effective version first becomes viable. The Megusard
Corporate is capable of building a primitive version of
this weapon at a single facility in the Sardis system.
The installation is well protected, as it would be an
obvious target in any conflict and is occasionally the
subject of a sabotage attempt.


It is not clear how the Megusard Corporate obtained
its meson weapons technology. One suggestion is a
leak from an Imperial arms firm, perhaps accidentally-
on-purpose as a means of hardening the trailing end of
Gateway sector. Whilst Megusard cannot construct the
more advanced versions of the weapon it has created
a standardised lower-tech variant which is produced
without full understanding of the processes involved.

The Megusard meson weapon, known locally as
Heavy Anti-Starship Weapon, Advanced Technology
or HASWAT, is produced only in a version equivalent
to an Imperial 7,500-ton weapon. Due to its lower
Tech Level this weapon is 20% larger at 9,000 tons
and costs MCr1000. It is delivered as part of a
package which also includes a dedicated power plant
and some protection. The power plant is an advanced
prototype, equivalent in output to a TL12 fusion plant
but with greater mass.

PLANETARY AEROSPACE

DEFENCE (PAD) MISSILE
The generic term for any missile system designed
to attack craft in orbit from the ground is PAD, or
Planetary Aerospace Defence. PAD missiles are
much larger than conventional ship-to-ship weapons,
although their Final Attack Vehicle (FAV) component
is often a standard missile. A PAD launcher can be
considered a starship-scale component, although some
governments mount them on maritime vessels, trains
and huge ground vehicles.

Engagement of a target in low orbit will typically
fall within the Short (11–1,250 kilometre) bracket,
whilst more powerful missiles can engage targets
in high orbit or local space. This is the Medium
(1,521–10,000 kilometre) range band. Climbing out
of a gravity well requires more thrust than a ship-to-
ship engagement if the missile is to have any chance
of interception. This thrust is provided by additional
boosters and a high-burn initial drive stage. The table
below indicates time required to reach a target in low
orbit. An additional two space combat rounds are
required to reach a target at Medium range, since the
missile’s drive has already done most of the work by
the time it reaches low orbital height.


PAD MISSILES
Light PAD missiles have an additional booster
stage which allows engagement at Short range (low
orbital distance). However, these missiles have little
fuel once reaching this altitude, so cannot engage
a target beyond Short range unless it is drifting
on a predictable vector. A standard PAD missile
can engage at Medium range due to its additional
boosters, a heavy PAD missile has very large
additional boosters which reduce engagement times
and, in theory, allow interception beyond orbital
ranges. Heavy missiles also have larger warheads.


A PAD missile launcher can be quite basic, in the form
of a silo or a mobile erector-launcher. It is considered a
ship-scale component. Each launcher can hold a single
missile. Normally launchers are single-shot weapons
which are reloaded over several hours by lowering
another missile into place with a crane. Launchers with
a dedicated reloading system and stowage can have
another missile in place in 2Dx10 minutes. Four Light
PAD missiles, two standard missiles or one heavy
missile take up one ton.’

POINT-DEFENCE WEAPONS
Larger ships can make use of a point-defence battery
(see High Guard page 40) but for smaller or lower-
tech vessels this is not an option. Defences are still
desirable however and in some cases the authorities
prefer civilians to arm ships only with short-range
defensive weaponry rather than long-range missiles
and combat lasers. Any hardpoint can mount a point-
defence turret instead of a standard turret, and it is
always possible to do so, even alongside combat
weapons. This is inefficient, but some operators like
to be able to switch their mounts from launching
missiles to fend off an enemy’s salvo or fighters.


POINT-DEFENCE TURRET (TL9)
A point-defence turret can only mount point-defence
weapons and can mount only a single example. In
some cases this may be a dual weapon but it makes
a single attack with all features. That is, a dual point
defence laser is considered a single weapon with
two tubes. A weapon on a point-defence mount gains
DM+2 to attack rolls but has a very limited maximum
range. For most point-defence weapons this is Short,
although a heavy point-defence laser can attack
targets at Medium range. At this distance, the DM

for a point-defence mount does not apply but normal
damage is done. Point-defence turrets must be used
by a Gunner.


POINT-DEFENCE LASER (TL9)
A small, light weapon designed to intercept missiles
and deter fighters, the point-defence laser has a
maximum range of Short. A single point-defence laser
can be mounted in a point-defence turret or replace




standard weapons in a normal turret. In the latter case
either the point-defence weapons or standard weapons
can fire in a given round as the targeting parameters
are quite different.

**DUAL POINT-DEFENCE LASER (TL10)**
A more advanced version of the point-defence laser
firing rapid pulses from alternating barrels a dual
point-defence laser gains DM+1 to hit targets at Close
or Adjacent range. This is added to any DMs for point-
defence turret mounts.

**GATLING POINT-DEFENCE LASER (TL12)**
A multibarrel light laser with dedicated power storage
and cooling systems, a gatling point-defence laser
gains DM+2 to hit targets at Close or Adjacent range.
This stacks with any bonus for being mounted in a
point-defence turret.

**HEAVY POINT-DEFENCE LASER (TL11)**
Falling somewhere between a point-defence weapon
and a conventional laser, the heavy point-defence
laser is more powerful than others of its type but this
comes at a price of a lower fire rate, which reduces
the chance to hit. A heavy point-defence laser can
attack at Medium range but does not gain any DM
for being on a point-defence mount. Attacks at Short
range do gain the DM.

PLANETOLOGY LAB (TL9)
A planetology lab is a specialist facility geared to
mineral analysis and mathematical modelling of likely
planetoid composition. Some equipment is fairly
heavy-duty, intended for smashing and grinding up
rock samples but there are also powerful specialised
computers running sophisticated software. Using a
planetology lab grants DM+1 on checks involving
prospecting or analysis of samples which may be
useful to miners, explorers or scientists. The DM can
only be applied to a single task, requiring 2D hours
of work by a suitably skilled Traveller. Every four tons
of lab space allows one person to work, allowing

DMs to be generated for multiple tasks. For example,
prospectors on the surface of a planetoid can benefit
from the work of their colleague in the lab or by
moving in and out of their vessel to make an analysis
then returning to work. A second Traveller working at
a different task could generate a DM, which can be
‘held’ until the Traveller is able to get into the field and
apply it. Planetology lab space costs MCr2 per ton.


VEHICLE BAY (TL8)
Whilst standard docking space can be used for
vehicles, it tends to be tailored to use by spacecraft
rather than for delivery of craft to a planetary surface.
A simple bay and ramp will suffice for most ground
vehicles, although some examples use an elevator
system to allow a craft to be deposited or picked up
without landing the ship. Delivery or pickup without
a landing requires a Difficult (10+) Pilot check, with
modifiers for wind or other adverse conditions.
Failure indicates a sudden drop which causes 1D
damage to the vehicle per point of negative Effect.
The vehicle then ends up on the ground, which may


require another attempt at pickup. This assumes
a ground vehicle or watercraft; grav vehicles can
simply fly into the bay.


A vehicle bay takes up 10% more tonnage than the
vehicle it is intended to carry, which includes delivery
and recovery systems. Cost is MCr0.1 per ton.


VEHICLE MAINTENANCE BAY (TL8)
Vessels that carry vehicles may require a
maintenance and repair area for them. This can be
improvised from any clear area such as a cargo
bay but for heavy vehicles or significant work this
is not satisfactory. A vehicle maintenance bay
requires 25% more tonnage than the largest vehicle
it accommodates and can be used as a garage
although it does not have surface-delivery facilities.
A bay of this sort provides DM+2 on checks to repair,
modify or maintain ground and grav vehicles. Some
vessels might have a watercraft maintenance bay
instead, which costs the same but is incompatible
with ground vehicles. Cost is MCr0.2 per ton.




# SPACECRAFT


Imperial-standard vessels can be encountered across
the Trailing Frontier. They are built under license or
simply copied on many worlds and are often bought
from Imperial suppliers. Lower-tech versions are also
sometimes encountered, either as the result of a local
refit or an attempt to build a particular design without
access to the right components. In addition, a great
many local designs are produced. Some are unique to a
particular power or even a single world, but most can be
encountered over a wide area, even in Imperial space.


Vessels of the various planetary and state navies of
Gateway tend to be small by Imperial standards. A
10,000 ton vessel is a rarity and would be considered
immense, whereas in the Imperium such a ship would
be used as an escort or patrol vessel. Imperial warships
in the 30,000 tons+ classes attract awe and admiration

- or sometimes wary resentment – wherever they
go. This does not translate to Gateway being easy to
conquer and annex, however. The volume of space and
the astrographical difficulties make a war of conquest
impossible even if it were desirable.


### IMPERIAL SHIPS

Imperial designs are quite varied as a result of influences going back hundreds and even thousands of years.
Some designs are popular simply because they are common and therefore easy to obtain spares for or to buy at
an acceptable price. These mass-produced vessels may be less than ideal for a given set of circumstances but
overall, in an area the size of Imperial space, they represent the industry standard.

Officially designated HS-10, the name Halklar
Savasci translates from an old Terran language
as people’s fighter. Designed for and widely used
by the Loyal Sector Guard, this craft is intended
to be cheaply built in large numbers and operated
from the most basic of facilities. TL10 components
are used to allow the fighter to be built and
maintained almost anywhere. The one luxury this
craft possesses, if it can be called that, is a set
of aerofins and a streamlined hull design. HS-10
fighters are designed to operate from a grassy
field if necessary, climbing rapidly to orbit with the
assistance of a reaction drive system.

Performance is rather modest when operating on
conventional m-drive but this is sufficient for patrol
operations and planned intercepts of merchant
traffic. This is the HS-10’s primary role, escorting
customs boats or ‘eyeballing’ suspect vessels. The
fixed pulse laser is a reasonably effective weapon,
and with a total of 8G thrust the HS-10 can bring its


weapon to bear quickly against most foes. This is
just as well, since the lightly built hull cannot take
much punishment. Any hit that breaches the armour
is likely to take out the fighter.


Overall, the HS-10 provides a decent level of
capability for a small cost. There is nothing much
to go wrong with it, making the ‘people’s fighter’,
a popular choice among small merchant lines and
mercenary units with limited budgets. It is widely
assumed that large numbers of HS-10s have
been transferred to the Renkard Union, a notion
supported by the popular vid drama Lightning
Squadron, which follows a band of plucky LSG
pilots and their unfeasibly attractive support
crew as they battle the Lords of Thunder in a
supposedly-hypothetical invasion scenario. It is not
clear whether Lightning Squadron was intended as
a serious drama or a propaganda piece but whilst
it is condemned as inflammatory in some circles it
remains highly popular into its 19th season.


HALKLAR SAVASCI- CLASS FIGHTER



**CLASS:Karmun**

A custom design built in small numbers in Ley and
under license elsewhere, the Karmun was never
intended to be viable in short-range local trade. Its
jump-3 capability grants an advantage in the high-
speed cargo and passenger market as well as the
capability to cross a two-parsec gap and reach
markets unavailable to other vessels. Although
promoted as a rift trader, the majority of Karmuns in
Ley are employed on fast runs between worlds 2–3
parsecs apart, outpacing the more tonnage-efficient
jump-1 vessels which typically ply the mains.

A fair number of vessels are active in the trans-
border region, crossing in and out of Imperial
space to reach worlds in Gateway. Karmuns are
sufficiently common on these routes that they are
not automatically identified as Imperial vessels. This
is useful to the navy, which is thought to use the
class for intelligence gathering and general auxiliary
tasks beyond the Imperial frontier.

The Karmun-class uses a hull form not dissimilar
to the Type R subsidised merchant, although it is
wider and longer. As with the Type R, the lowest
level is mainly given over to a two-deck-high cargo
hold. Aft of this on the lowest deck is a smaller one-
deck cargo hold generally used for smaller items.
Right aft is the small passenger section, which
contains only four cabins and a 12-ton common
area. On some vessels this is repurposed or used
for additional crew accommodation. Passengers
access the vessel through the aft bulkhead and
are separated from the rest of the ship by the crew
area on the deck above.


The forward part of the mid deck is taken up by
the upper level of the cargo hold. Aft of this is
the crew accommodation and common area plus
associated facilities. As built, Karmuns have an
armoury, workshop and medical bay. Some users
repurpose these areas. The upper deck contains
the engineering section and powerplant, with the
bridge forward of it.


The Karmun-class, as built, is lightly armoured and
armed with two fighting turrets and two defence
turrets. Five other turret mountings are fitted and
can easily be set up with whatever weapons are
desired. Power is a tight if all systems have uprated
armaments but it is rare to be shooting whilst the
jump drive is charging. Most operators use the turret
mountings as additional storage space.


Overall, the Karmun-class is a rugged and
dependable vessel capable of fast courier and
light trade work or operating in a sparse stellar
region. Nominal crew is twelve but it is common
for some jobs to double up. Gunners are rarely
needed so may spend most of their time working as
technicians, drive hands or stewards, whilst most
operators prefer to have a backup pilot among the
crew even if they have a different day job. A typical
setup for frontier operations is three bridge crew –
the captain, astrogator and pilot – plus a technical
and engineering division with six personnel. Some
will be starship engineers, others electronics or
mechanical technicians. Another three multi-skilled
personnel will fill the gunner, steward, medic and
general maintenance roles. Double-occupancy is
required in crew berths unless the crew take over
passenger accommodation.

### GALIAN FEDERATION SHIPS

The Galian Federation inherited its shipbuilding traditions from the old Galian Trade League, of which it is the
largest remnant. The Federation can afford to build larger ships than most other powers and benefits more from
economies of scale. Its vessels are sold more widely in Gateway than those developed in any other power,
including the Imperium. Whilst the Federation cannot compete with the Imperials in terms of volume of production,
the position of the Federation gives a significant local advantage.


ABYSM DEEP SPACE

OPERATIONS

VESSEL

The Abysm-class is named after the subsector it was
developed for use in. Built at TL11, the best available
in the Galian Federation, the Abysm-class is capable
of jump-2 operations and has a modified drive to
allow better manoeuvring in deep space. Normal
manoeuvre drives are grossly inefficient this far from
a gravity well, making operations risky. In deep space,
this drive can deliver 35% of its normal thrust, which is
sufficient for most requirements and certainly enough
to safely dock with a fuel cache or tanker.

Two small craft of up to 60 tons can be carried and
the Abysm-class DSOV is capable of skimming
its own fuel or buddy-refuelling a similar vessel.
Sufficient fuel is carried for a single two-parsec jump
plus two months of general operations. If necessary,
fuel for a total of four parsecs more of jump range
can be carried in four cargo/fuel modules. If a full fuel
load is carried there is little room for anything else,
and accommodation is similarly cramped. A nominal
crew of 12 is accommodated in eight cabins plus a
small recreation and eating area. Twelve low berths
are onboard to allow personnel or backup crews to
be carried.

The DSOV is not an exploration ship, although
it can be used as one. Its normal roles are as
a support vessel for other deep-space craft or
a transport for long-range cargoes. A DSOV
can make the trip out to Splinter using its own
resources, but cannot carry much whilst doing


so. More commonly, two or three support ships
accompany an Abysm acting as a transport, one
tanker performing buddy-refuelling then turning
back after the first jump. This is a lot of effort
to keep in touch with one outpost but between
missions the ships can be assigned to other tasks.
Indeed, a considerable number of DSOVs are in
service, many of them sold beyond the Federation.


With sufficient fuel for two 2-parsec jumps, the
vessel can still carry freight or goods. This is
not a great deal for a ship of its size but in the
sparser areas of Gateway getting goods to market
is a challenge. For this reason many Abysm-
class vessels have been repurposed as jump-2
freighters or naval auxiliaries. With some of the
configurable cargo/fuel areas converted to hangars
and pilot accommodation the class can serve as
an auxiliary carrier, although it remains rather
fragile compared to a real warship.


Standard crew is 11 or 12 personnel, with
command and administrative tasks doubled up
with astrogation and medical or some similar
arrangement. In addition two craft pilots are often
carried. The usual procedure in such a situation is
for the commanding officer and one other member
of the crew to have their own cabin, with everyone
else doubling up. Given the cramped nature of
the accommodation this is very tiring for the crew,
making personnel turnover high for most vessels.

COLLMEN-CLASS

PROSPECTING

SHUTTLE

The Collmen is named for a legendary figure from
the early years of the Galastrian Metals company,
a prospector who made strike after strike and rose
from the rank of apprentice to become one of the
corporation’s directors. She never revealed her
secret, if she had one, but her name has become
associated with inordinate luck and an uncanny
ability to spot good prospects. Although relatively
humble, the Collmen is a well-respected workhorse
optimised for lengthy operations within a belt or on
the surface of planetoids.

Layout is unconventional and distinctly unattractive.
A crew working space is located aft, containing the
power and drive systems along with an open-plan
command and control facility equivalent to a dual
cockpit. From here all functions can be carried out,
with a crewmember operating drones or mining
lasers whilst another monitors the reactor and makes
positional adjustments. The control component of the
drone systems and laser drills are also located here,
creating a small multipurpose bridge. There is also a
single cabin, allowing crewmembers to rest on long
deployments. Hot bunking is common where multiple
crewmembers are carried, with two at a time using
the cabin’s bunks on a rotating basis.


Forward of the command space is the operations
bay, containing the drone launch and maintenance
systems as well as a small planetological laboratory.
Most of this area is configured as a vehicle bay
and on some craft is actually used for up to 12 tons
of vehicles or robots. On others, the ramps and
wide doors are merely a convenient way of getting
samples in and out. The Collmen is a prospecting
craft rather than a dedicated miner – there is
stowage only for a few samples, although in many
cases the vehicle bay fills up with crates as a mission
continues. Some operators use ore transports built
on the same hull, with a near-identical command
area but only cargo space forward. One Collmen can
produce ore for a rotation of transports to take back
to a parent vessel.


The Collmen-class is also popular with scientists,
explorers and surveyors. In this role the mining
drones are usually removed and replaced with
additional accommodation space or working areas.
The vehicle bay is highly useful to those wishing to
use the craft as a base for ground exploration but
can always be treated as additional cargo space or
a general working area.

Built on the same hull as the Collmen-class, the
Jiydyce is a dedicated mining craft intended for much
shorter missions. It has the same internal layout,
more or less, with an open-plan control area for the
ship located in what would be the drive room but
the rest-cabin is replaced by a control suite for the
vessel’s mining drones and laser drills. This allows
up to four personnel to operate drones and drills,
enabling mining operations to take place without
anyone having to suit up and go outside.

The forward compartment is given over entirely to
cargo space, other than the launch mechanisms
and maintenance equipment for drones. It is
common for this area to be open to space during
operations, allowing drones to fly in and out without
delay. Ore is then dumped into storage bins by a
dedicated crane. This could handle cargo if the
attachments were available but in its usual setup is
optimised for scooping up loose ore without much
regard to careful handling.

TORCON CORE

MODULE

The Torcon-class is one of several designs used
by Gateway Metals and a few private operators.
It is a compromise between the efficiency of
a purpose-built surface facility and the cost-
effectiveness of a redeployable asset. Overall
design is based on a ‘one and three’ system, with
a jump-capable core segment surrounded by three
additional modules at 120-degree intervals. The
drives aboard the core segment are configured for
operations with three modules attached and fuel
requirements are based upon a full load.

The core module is designed to make one or two
one-parsec jumps with three specialist modules
attached, then operate in the target system for
some weeks. If necessary the specialist modules
can be detached to operate under their own power.
This permits the core to return to base using
far less fuel, perhaps making repeated runs to
deliver more specialist modules or cargo modules
instead. If the concept has a major flaw, it is that
the Torcon-class cannot easily self-refuel, requiring
another ship acting as a tanker or a module
containing fuel-skimming shuttles.

The core module is utilitarian, serving almost
exclusively as a ‘jump tug’ for its modules. Typical
craft complement is three 60-ton boats of one class
or another but the hangar is capable of taking a single
craft of up to 180 tons’ displacement. The docking
clamps are set up for standard 2,000-ton modules but
could in theory accommodate other craft. This might
require recalibration of drives and systems, especially
if the load was not properly balanced.


The Torcon core module is lightly armed with a mix
of missiles and pulse lasers, plus a significant point-
defence armament. The heavy point defence lasers
are capable of engaging a craft out to Medium range
but are most effective at Short range. They are more
powerful than a beam laser and more consistent, if
slightly less potent on average, than pulse lasers.


The primary uses of the Torcon core module are as
the centre of a mobile mining base or as the tractor
for a group of 2,000-ton craft. Additional module
types are available. Pure cargo or fuel-tank versions
are used to create a bulk transport or freighter, or
to extend the range of the vessel. A hangar module
may be carried, usually filled with prospecting
shuttles, instead of one of the mining-bases. Some
private users have had their own custom modules
produced. There is at least one liner operating in
Gateway and several cargo ships are known to
be in use. Meanwhile the Galian Federation has
some vessels in service. These are used almost
exclusively to relocate 2,000-ton system defence
monitors as and when the strategic requirements
change and to deliver supplies and replacement
crews to them whilst on-station.


Nominal crew is around 40 personnel plus craft
pilots. Most crew are engineering technicians, with
other functions fulfilled by the gunnery team. It is
rare for the vessels of Gateway Metals to need
weapons, other than in the Halverson’s Rocks
system where tensions with the local government
always run high.

TORCON MINING

MODULE

The mining module is not intended to directly
undertake mining operations. Instead it sends out a
flotilla of prospecting and mining craft and supports
their operations. The module does have a manoeuvre
drive but is capable only of minor positional shifts.
This is acceptable since most mining modules remain
attached to the core segment. Those intended for
longer-duration missions are carefully placed before
the parent vessel departs.

The heart of the vessel is its ore refinery, fed by the
small craft carried aboard the hangars and docking
space. Hangars provide space for maintenance
and repairs, which are often necessary on vessels
operating in an environment cluttered with waste
from the processing operation. A mix of craft may be
carried, including prospecting and mining shuttles
plus utility craft or fuel-skimming shuttles.

Nominal crew is about 74 personnel, including small
craft crews and refinery workers. A light point-defence
armament is mounted, with a couple of dedicated
gunners to look after it. Other crewmembers are
usually trained to use the weapons in an emergency.
When docked to a core segment the mining module’s
point defence weapons are tied into the overall
defence network of the ship.


Mining modules are the commonest component
used by the Torcon-class, along with cargo modules.
It is common for a Torcon to operate with two mining
and one cargo module, or two cargo and one mining.
Occasionally one is encountered carrying a hangar
module for squadrons of fighters, notably in the
disputed Halverson’s Rocks system. Ore can be
offloaded to jump-capable craft for the transit home
or the entire Torcon can make the trip when full.
More commonly, there will be one or more Torcons
in a system, usually with two mining and one cargo
modules, and another serving as a support ship with
three cargo modules. These can be swapped for a
full one, creating a constant flow of ore homewards.


It is not known whether the vessel thought to be
named Craijioa Enterprise is owned by Gateway
Metals or not. This ship appears to be equipped with
a mining module and a custom-built manufacturing
module, with a third carrying small craft, weaponry
and living space. Craijioa Enterprise has appeared
in various systems, offering TL11 goods for sale at
high but just about acceptable prices. It is usually
preceded by one or more small trade-scout vessels
whose crews drum up anticipation before the main
vessel arrives. Craijioa Enterprise then disappears
for a while, presumably mining materials for
additional manufacturing projects.

REVONIS GALIAN

CRUISER

The Revonis-class has been in service for decades,
undergoing steady alteration and upgrades as
operational lessons are learned. It is a large and
powerful vessel by the standards of Gateway,
although probably outmatched by a much smaller
Imperial destroyer. The primary limitation of
Galian vessels is in terms of strategic mobility;
the Federation is only capable of building jump-1
vessels but most of its systems are separated by
two-parsec rifts. Forays outside Galian space are
painfully slow and committing a major force in the
wrong place could be disastrous. Not only would the
fleet take weeks or months to reach its new target
but even the couriers sent to bring its new orders
would take an inordinately long time to arrive. The
only solution to the distance problem is to carry
enough fuel for two 1-parsec jumps, whilst the
time issue cannot be solved with locally available
technology. It is possible that a few ships have been
fitted with Imperial drives obtained through the trade
missions but no confirmation is available.

The Revonis-class is built using mostly TL9
components but with TL10 manoeuvre drives and
electronics systems. Primary armament is a pair of
large missile bays located in sponsons projecting
each side of the cylindrical main hull near the fore
end. A similar pair of projections located further
aft carry the ship’s small-craft complement. The
result is a rather blocky, business-like but inelegant
hull form. Craft are recovered at the rear of the
twin hangar pods and launched from the outer
side. Launch operations are much slower than
recovery but the need to get craft back aboard
before a quick jump was a primary concern of the
designers. Each sponson can carry 400-tons of
craft, usually a mix of shuttles and fighters.


Nominal crew is 60 officers and enlisted personnel
plus craft crew. There are large cabins for the
captain and one other person, which may be the
executive officer, an important guest or a mission
commander. A group of cabins and a common area
designated ‘officers’ country’ provides a measure
of comfort for the ship’s senior personnel and
most of the crew will have a cabin of their own
as well as access to a significant common area.
This is considered important in a ship expected
to undertake long-duration missions. If additional
personnel such as marines are carried, barracks
accommodation and an extensive armoury are
available. More commonly, most of the armoury
space is used as secure stowage.


Secondary and defensive armament consists of
40 triple pulse laser turrets grouped into batteries
of eight and 40 sandcaster/beam laser turrets
grouped in pairs. Each has an associated munitions
stowage area, with additional missiles and
sandcaster canisters carried as cargo. Hold space is
considerable for a military ship, at least on paper, but
not all of this space is easily accessible. A number of
small holds are scattered through the ship. As built
they serve as ready areas containing spares and
consumables for nearby systems but on most these
areas are used for additional accommodation or to
house systems added during a refit.


Craft complement varies depending upon mission.
At least some shuttles are always carried but some
of the craft tonnage might be used for fighters,
gunships or specialist craft. A communications
variant of the cruiser is known to exist, which
supports small courier vessels operating between
critical worlds. These ships have additional hangar
space in what used to be the main cargo area. Other
variants may also exist.

### CORPORATE VESSELS
#### MEGUSARD



The corporate mindset of Megusard is evident in their shipbuilding. Vessels are constructed with a view to cost-
effectiveness, either individually or as a fleet, rather than for high-end capability. This has always been sufficient in
an environment where piracy and the odd raid are likely threats. The situation changed when the Lords of Thunder
established a border close to Gateway but still the Megusard Corporate thinks in terms of economic sanctions backed by
lightly armed vessels rather than repelling a fanatical enemy bent on destroying all G’naak.

The Megusard Corporate operates several classes of Gunship-Equipped Merchant vessel, or GEM ships. These,
naturally, have names associated with precious stones and minerals. The idea behind a GEM ship is to create a
transport and utility vessel capable of self-defence but which can be swapped to other roles by simply assigning
a different complement of small craft. The GEM vessels are built around the standard Megusard 40-ton small
craft hull. Various craft are built in this pattern but those most commonly encountered are the Holande-Type cargo
lighter and the S-40 gunship.


The Holande-Type exists for the sole purpose of
moving cargo from a groundside or space installation
to a GEM ship and back again. It is configured as
a blunt cylinder with cargo doors in the belly and a
flight-and-drives pod on the dorsal surface. When
landed in a gravity well – artificial or planetside – the
craft is supported by retractable legs which mate
with a parent vessel’s grapples. This creates the


impression that lighters hang upside-down from the
belly of their GEM ship. A Holande-Type will usually
act as the cargo hold of its parent vessel, however, if
necessary a second set of dorsal cargo doors open
to allow items to be through-loaded into an internal
hold. This is more commonly done when supplying
a ship than to carry cargo, as loading and unloading
are time-consuming when carried out in this manner.

Built on the same hull configuration as the
Holande-Type and other 40-ton small craft, the
S-40 is a multipurpose combat craft. The design
is inefficient in some ways, being required to
fit into the standard GEM recess but it allows a
single hull to be used for multiple variants. Other
versions mount a fixed laser and a turreted one,
mixing defensive capability with pilot-aimed
precision. This version has no weapons equipped
for maximum versatility, as this is how they leave
most shipyards

The crew of two share a cockpit, with a small rest
area which serves as access to the drives. As built,
the S-40 has significant cargo or configurable space,


allowing the craft to be used as a personnel transport,
shuttle or utility craft. S-40s in customs enforcement
roles usually have an extended personnel area for a
boarding party, whilst other variants include a search-
and-rescue platform and pilot trainer. Squadrons of
S-40s have recently been transferred to the Renkard
Union, more because they are available than for their
supposed combat capability. However, a mix of laser
and plasma-armed craft led by a command variant
is thought to be a good counter to K’Kree remote-
controlled fighters. If the laser boats can protect the
plasma strike units long enough they may be able to
inflict crippling hits on the controlling K’Kree ship and
eliminate the entire swarm.

SAPPHIRE

GUNSHIP-EQUIPPED

MERCHANT

The Sapphire-class has a nominal displacement of
2,800 tons, of which 960 tons is composed of 40-
ton gunships or other small craft. The main hull is
a simple flattened cylinder, to which the small craft
clamp in recessed bays. The vessel has an internal
cargo bay but when operating as a merchant vessel
can carry up to 828 tons of cargo aboard its Holande-
Type cargo lighters. If a longer jump range is required,
40-ton fuel pods can replace any or all of the small
craft for a maximum capacity of 960 tons above the
internal tankage. More commonly some extra fuel is
carried, perhaps enough for a second jump, along
with a complement of gunships or cargo lighters.

The hull is ruggedised, with light armour sufficient to
mitigate a minor weapon attack. Standard armament
is light, with six beam laser turrets and six missile
barbettes although up to six more turrets can be
mounted if necessary. GEM ships are not warships,
although they can carry out some basic patrol tasks
and rely upon their complement of gunships to deal
with any significant threat. There is no absolute
standard complement but typically six laser and two
plasma gunships make up a squadron, with a GEM
ship engaged in commerce typically carrying one
squadron. This brings total cargo capacity down
to around 750 tons but greatly increases security.
A GEM ship on patrol or security duty will normally
carry two squadrons plus eight utility craft.


A GEM ship typically requires a crew of 26–30 plus
craft crews. This can mean up to 24 pilots, plus 24
gunners or technicians. In practice, a GEM ship
might only carry crews for half its craft, or even less,
if engaged in commercial operations. The Holande-
Type lighters can be remotely piloted from the
parent vessel. For this purpose a secondary craft
operations bridge is carried. The Sapphire class
also has a conference suite which is used for crew
briefings and commercial meetings as well as acting
as a wardroom for officers.


Crew accommodation consists of two High cabins
and 16 Standard cabins plus a common area. This
is sufficient for a crew of 26 to have the senior
officers berthed in luxury, eight senior crew in single-
occupancy and 16 crew in double-occupancy. A
secondary accommodation area contains another 32
Standard and two High cabins. This area is used by
craft pilots and crew plus their officers and possibly
passengers if any are carried.


Most of the time the craft pilots and crew will assist
with general tasks as additional stewards, medics and
maintenance personnel. If no passengers are carried,
it is possible for all crew to have their own cabin.

MEGUSARD MESON

EMPLACEMENT

The standard emplacement below is designed
to be installed on the surface of a planetoid or
moon rather than buried deep within it. Deep-
site emplacements are much more resilient but
require considerable effort to construct. The
Megusard Corporate has solved this problem
by constructing composite structures partially
built from starship components and partly
tunnelled into the surface.

The centrepiece of the installation is a 9,000-
ton meson cannon which can attack targets
in any direction. It is powered by a prototype
reactor which also supplies the installation’s
defensive armament. This is a mix of torpedo
launchers and laser weapons intended mainly
to keep missiles and small craft – which the
meson gun struggles to target – at bay.

It is possible to build an installation of this
kind on any planetoid of greater than around
23,000 displacement tons, of which there
are plenty in most star systems. Even in the


Sardis system it is possible to find numerous
suitable bodies, although many have had to be
relocated using temporary drive systems. The
design below is not a mobile planetoid-hull
vessel but a fortress built into a larger body.
Multiple forts could be built on the same body
at need, perhaps accompanied by small craft
bases and missile emplacements.


Accommodation is quite generous, although the
security personnel assigned to an installation
live in cramped barracks. This is offset by
good recreation and training facilities. Senior
officers in particular have almost palatial
accommodation – at least by navy standards.
Command of a meson gun installation is
comfortable and prestigious, if something
of a dead-end conferred on older officers or
those with less drive. Installations tend to be
commanded in a cautious manner by highly
experienced officers who have few options in a
fight but to win or be destroyed.

The Renkard Union has never had a particularly coherent starship building strategy. A great variety of short-run
classes and one-off designs are produced locally, with a basic level of interoperability. It is generally possible to
move from one Renkard vessel to another without requiring retraining but there will always be slight differences in
layout and systems. This is a minor inconvenience in the commercial shipping world and a potentially deadly flaw
now the Union needs a properly organised navy.

### RENKARD UNION VESSELS


The Piramion-class is an example – some might
say a symptom – of Renkard defensive thinking.
It is a simple vessel designed to be produced in
great numbers by almost any yard. Basic hull form
is a lightly-armoured broad wedge with the bridge
nestling between two elongated prongs. This gives
the craft a sleek and deadly look not matched by
its capabilities. The Piramion-class is designed for
cost-effectiveness rather than combat efficiency,
enabling the Renkard Union to crash-build large
numbers of ships in a short time. In theory these
permit their crews to gain experience whilst
providing a measure of defensive capability and will
be replaced by more capable ships in the longer
term. In reality it is likely these are the ships that
will fight and lose the war for the Renkard Union.

As built, the Piramion-class is unarmed, with
dedicated space for weapons and associated
ammunition stowage. The standard loadout for
a combat-configured piramion is two torpedo
barbettes at the front of the prongs and four
triple missile turrets in mountings on the dorsal
surface of the wedge. These are intended to
take out K’Kree warships whilst staying clear of
the fighter swarm and teaches crew to use more
manoeuvrable craft.

One mooted doctrine has piramions operating
in threes, with one boat mounting all torpedoes,
one armed with missiles for standoff support and
another with an all-laser armament to fend off


the fighters. This specialisation requires a level
of cooperation far beyond the capabilities of the
Renkard Union. Whilst it looks clever on paper,
this strategy is almost certain to come unstuck in
action. Wiser leaders are pushing for the adoption
of an armament comprising four laser turrets and
two barbettes, either missile or torpedo, whilst
pragmatists are keen on an all-missile armament
since there are already huge stockpiles in place and
more arriving every day.


The Piramion-class can power an armament of
up to four triple laser turrets and two missile or
torpedo mounts. As built the vessel has no jump
capability but there is a mounting for a jump-1
drive if available. This permits some vessels to be
converted to a more mobile role. Similarly, space
may be allocated for additional hull armour if funds
allow. This space is useless for anything else.


Multiple variants of the Piramion-class exist.
The most expensive have the extra armour and
carry a jump drive with enough fuel for four
consecutive jumps. Armament on these vessels
is typically four laser turrets and two missile
barbettes, with additional accommodation built
into the remaining cargo space. Some, jump-
capable and otherwise, are armed with whatever
could be obtained at the time, whereas others
have been diverted to non-military roles as
auxiliaries, transports and civilian traders. The
situation surrounding procurement of these
vessels is, as usual, chaotic and rather panicky.

A number of designs are built across the region or in non-aligned yards, then sold to whoever wants them. In some
cases the original designer is disputed, with several companies claiming ownership or building variants that are just
different enough to merit a different class name.

The Meccach-class is considered by many to
be a boat rather than a starship, despite it being
capable of interstellar travel under its own power.
It is intended to serve as a personal transport and
courier rather than a commercial ship and is not
viable in that role other than when transporting very
high-value goods. What the Meccach-class does
well is ensure communications are maintained
across a three-parsec gap. Transits are not quick,
given the vessel’s jump-1 capability but with
onboard fuel for one jump and optional capacity
for two more there are few places these vessels
cannot go... eventually.

The lightly armoured hull provides a measure of
protection and sublight performance is reasonable
for a non-military craft. This, and a light laser
armament as standard, makes the Meccach a
popular choice for those operating in hazardous
areas. Typical users are governments and

##### UTILITY VESSEL CLASS:Meccach


corporations needing a small, secure courier or
merchant lines which prefer to send trade scouts
on ahead of their big freighters. In recent years,
numbers of these vessels have begun operating
out of Emoress. Most are simply couriers but a few,
possibly heavily modified, regularly penetrate into
K’Kree space and bring back information as well as
the occasional defector.


Nominal crew is three; a pilot/astrogator, an
engineer and someone capable of operating the
weapons when not filling in all the other little jobs
that need doing. For longer missions a larger crew
of four to six is usually carried, leaving a couple
of cabins for passengers or specialist personnel.
Common space is fairly generous for such a small
ship and the cargo hold or vehicle bay can be
repurposed at need. Cargo capacity is officially
rated at 12 tons but by using the vehicle bay and
configurable areas just over 50 tons can be carried.

BECKHANN

SUPERFREIGHTER

Named for a subsector in Gateway, the Beckann
is one of the largest haulage vessels in the region.
Ships of this type carry bulk goods between the
major starports of the sector, often undertaking
cruises lasting many months. The majority run
on regular routes but enterprising operators may
engage in large-scale speculative trade.

The Beckann is primarily a goods hauler, with
over 24,000 tons of cargo space. It has a small
mineral processing and manufacturing facility
which is sometimes used to produce custom-
ordered goods but more commonly churns out
standard items likely to be desired at the next
port. The manufacturing facility can also create
spares for emergency repairs.

The crew live in a sort of ‘cabin village’ segregated
from the passenger-accessible parts of the ship.
In addition to those required for the running of the
vessel, craft crews and technicians for the factory
are usually carried. Large-scale accommodation of
this sort is more space-efficient than the staterooms
used by passengers, which are only viable on such

##### SUPERFREIGHTER CLASS:Beckann


a large vessel. Although not a passenger vessel,
the Beckann class has a decent number of standard
cabins and low berths available.


Defences are light but adequate to deter most
pirates and some Beckanns carry gunships or
fighters to back up their own guns. In-system
performance is modest but adequate to trundle in
from the jump emergence point and establish orbit.
Unless it is possible to dock, cargo transfers are
carried out by shuttles. Typically, the hangars are
used to load craft which cycle through the process,
returning for transport to the next system.


Beckann-class vessels can be encountered across
the sector, although they are rarely more than a
couple of weeks from a major port. The arrival of
one in the backwaters would be an indication that
either something very unusual is going on, or a
captain has decided to take a risk on a speculative
trade cruise. This rarely produces the sort of results
necessary to justify tying up such a big vessel but
occasionally a staggering profit is made, inspiring
others to take a risk in the same manner.

A variety of Orbital Defence Platforms (OPDs) are
in use in Gateway, notably in Megusard Corporate
and Renkard Union space. They are manufactured
to a variety of designs by independent contractors,
with significant numbers produced in Megusard
yards and delivered to the end client as modules
for assembly in orbit. A basic drive is provided for
station-keeping and it is customary for orbital forts
to shift their orbits in a complex or random pattern
to prevent ballistic strikes from eliminating a world’s
defensive capabilities.

The standard OPD is built as five cylindrical
modules joined by a nexus connector. The main
body of the station is an elongated cylinder
containing the living quarters, with three rings of
three docking clamps around the outside. This
allows the station to be used as a fighter base or to
carry shuttles for customs inspections and the like.

##### 400-TON ORBITAL DEFENCE PLATFORM CLASS:—


Each clamp can in theory support a craft of up to
100 tons but the available space is such that a craft
of 31–60 tons takes up two clamps and a craft of
61–100 tons covers three. An ODP might have six
10-ton fighters and three 20-ton shuttles attached,
a 65-ton gunship and six fighters, or some other
combination of craft.


The operations and command module is accessed
through the nexus connector. This contains the
bridge and power-generation chamber, protected
by an armoured bulkhead in addition to the station’s
robust hull, plus a station-keeping drive and
defensive laser turret. The nexus connector also
gives access to three cylindrical weapons modules,
located at 120 degrees around the diameter of the
station. These are built around a missile barbette
and a magazine for additional munitions, and
protected by bulkheads.

The Predator-class is a blatantly anti-K’Kree vessel,
from armament to name. It is intended to deal
with the swarms of robotic fighters used by K’Kree
warships using its dogfight missiles and pulse laser
turret. Although effective in this, the Predator is
not capable of delivering much damage to a large
vessel once the swarm is cleared and was designed
to operate in concert with other craft mounting anti-
ship weapons. Among these is a variant carrying
a pair of anti-ship torpedoes on external mounts
instead of the dogfight missiles.

##### GUNSHIP CLASS:Predator


The Predator is tough and, for its Tech Level,
quite manoeuvrable. It has sufficient space to be
converted to other roles, serving as a customs patrol
platform or well-protected interface shuttle. Indeed,
its most successful engagements have been
extracting personnel from a world being overrun
by the K’Kree rather than directly challenging their
fleets. The Predator is built under license on multiple
worlds, using COTS (commercial off-the-shelf)
components as much as possible. This makes it
easy to maintain and source spares for.

##### COVERT OPERATIONS PLATFORM CLASS:Teccmir

The Teccmir-class was designed as a
reconnaissance platform and as such has some
unusual features. One is the oversized bridge, which
has sufficient space for additional crewmembers.
These are normally engaged in real-time analysis
of data when the vessel is in a dangerous are,
and longer-term in-depth intelligence work for the
remainder of the time. Communications interception
capability is limited but against targets of a similar
Tech Level, the Teccmir-class can conduct effective
signals intelligence work.

Electronic warfare is only a small part of this vessel’s
work. It is designed to covertly land personnel and
equipment on-planet and retrieve them once the
mission is complete. The spacious briefing suite
and some of the cargo area can be converted to


additional accommodation if necessary. This is the
case with vessels supporting the secret wars against
the Lords of Thunder on various worlds.


If detected, the Teccmir is capable of defending
against small-craft but it is not a warship. Nor is it
commercially viable; almost a third of its tonnage is
taken up with fuel tanks. This permits a secondary
role as a courier or personnel transport, or even
as the command vessel for a small-ship task force.
Depending on the intended role the briefing rooms,
vehicle bay and drone launchers can be removed
and replaced with other systems. It is known a
few Teccmir are used as prisoner transports for
extremely sensitive offenders, whilst others operate
on covert prisoner-snatch missions to obtain
personnel for interrogation.

The Trailing Frontier offers a wide range of adventuring
possibilities. Ley is mostly Imperial space, so
adventures there might be driven by internal politics
and economic factors. Over the border are many
small powers, some of which are at odds with one
another, and areas that have been little explored by
Imperial citizens. There is no reason to assume the
data held in Imperial libraries is entirely correct and it
is certainly not complete. There is room for almost any
sort of adventure in this setting and a campaign might
incorporate several of the elements mentioned below.

ALIENS AND ANCIENTS
There are several major and minor alien races in the
Trailing Frontier. Indeed, some humans of the region
are more alien than the non-humans. An encounter with
a very alien species can be a frustrating or rewarding
experience; it is certainly the stuff of high adventure.
As with human cultures, alien society should possess
internal consistency but this need not be immediately
obvious to Travellers. Aliens are every bit as varied and
complex in their motivations as humans and should be
presented accordingly.

The Traveller universe has its share of vanished alien
and human societies. Some are quite ancient, and
have left behind only mysterious ruins and artefacts,
whilst others have obviously disappeared quite recently

- at least, in historical terms. However, the greatest
of all alien mysteries is presented by the Ancients,
who it is thought are the beings who genetically
engineered humans and Vargr, and transplanted them
across Charted Space for reasons unknown. The
Ancients have now vanished but some remnants of
their civilisation survive. It is thought they destroyed
themselves in a huge civil war long ago; what is left are
minor outposts too unimportant to be targeted.

Ancient artifacts are enormously valuable (those
that work, anyway) and often dangerous. Ancients
researchers and artifact hunters scour Charted Space
for remnants of their lost technology. Those that possess
working Ancient devices are reluctant to allow anyone to
see them. It is unlikely the Ancients will play much part in
a campaign in the Trailing Frontier but they are normally
blamed for every strange anomaly, ruin or mystery
discovered. Sometimes these assumptions are correct,

# ADVENTURES IN THE TRAILING FRONTIER




and it is possible Travellers will occasionally encounter
remnants of these powerful beings, or be propelled into
an adventure by the rumour of an Ancients site.


There are indications the Ancients were active in
the Trailing Frontier but not extensively so. They are
known to have seeded the Luriani and Sydites on their
respective homeworlds but no major Ancients sites have
ever been discovered in the region. There are always
those who are adamant they exist and Ancients hunters
can be found almost anywhere. There are also those
who seek to profit from a false rumour of an Ancients
find, either selling fake artefacts or making money from
the rubes who come rushing to seek their fortune.


There is some evidence the Ancients seeded worlds
with humans and other creatures, who either survived
long enough to be incorporated into the new colonies
set up by the Ramshackle Empire or vanished long
before the First Imperium arose. At least one world has
structures which seem to date from the Ancients period
and there are populations of creatures and people not
native to their ‘home’ worlds. It is possible the Ancients
planted these and they may have altered some star
systems by deflecting moons or destroying planets.
Searching for traces of the Ancients in Gateway
could be the focus of an entire campaign, made more
complex by the existence of rival local powers.

INTERSTELLAR TRADE


AND COMMERCE
A campaign focusing on interstellar trade and commerce
could take several forms. The typical free trader campaign
is always an option but with an extra dimension provided
by the existence of numerous powers. Free Traders could
be engaged by the navy to gather intelligence or by a
major shipping corporation to act as trade scouts. Indeed,
a corporate trade-scout mission would be a good way
to get the Travellers moving from world-to-world in the
Trailing Frontier even if their adventures are not always
connected with commerce.


It might also be interesting to run a high-level
commercial campaign. The Travellers might be corporate
executives with a set budget or assigned assets, tasked
with opening up trade opportunities in a new area. In


addition to managing their resources and finding ways
to make money they would inevitably be drawn into local
politics. Such a campaign might be connected with the
Gateway Sector Project, or with a covert plan to harden
local systems by aligning them with the Imperium and
providing the funds to create effective defences.

Such a campaign would see the Travellers operating in
an area where they normally do not. Rather than looking
for low-bulk, high-value, one-off cargo runs they would
be operating on a smaller margin but using larger ships
carrying vastly more. Bulky items such as ore and grain
are normally moved in enormous bulk freighters, usually
operated by a world government or a large merchant
line. Such vessels are often chartered or contracted to
a route for long periods of time. Service aboard such a
vessel tends to be routine and rather dull for the most
part but the pay is good and the risks low. This might not
interest the Travellers very much but the situation might
be different if they were the ship’s operators.

SMUGGLING, PIRACY AND

COMMERCIAL WARFARE
Smuggling is likely to occur anywhere there is trade.
The temptation to under-declare cargoes or slip a
few small packages through customs concealed in
a special mini-hold is considerable. Customs parties
do board vessels and search for contraband but the
thoroughness of such searches varies considerably.
This kind of minor smuggling is a fairly trivial
problem for most interstellar states. More serious
is the practice of shipping illegal goods into a world
disguised as something legal there. Quite large
cargoes can be brought in by this method, although
it is generally easier for customs personnel to spot
something is amiss.

In many cases, smugglers of this sort will purchase
goods on one world, where they are quite legal, along
with a cover cargo they can make a small profit on
at the destination, and openly fly into port with their
ostensibly legal cargo. If they can deceive customs into
inspecting only the cover cargo, they can then deliver
the illicit goods. An alternative on this strategy is to use
an unsuspecting merchant crew to do the smuggling, by
contracting them to deliver legal cargo but concealing
something illicit in the containers. This is one reason
smart crews check out their own cargoes and take care
from whom they accept contracts. Of course, a ship with
financial problems may have to take whatever is going.

The most blatant form of smuggling is undertaken by
bold crews who try to evade detection and slip onto a
world away from the starport, never allowing customs


personnel anywhere near the cargo. Such vessels
can arrive with a hold blatantly filled with illicit goodies,
although most have some form of deception or
concealment plan in case they are caught by a customs
ship. There is a fine line between this sort of smuggling
and blockade running, where a vessel attempts to
penetrate an interdiction squadron to deliver goods or
personnel to a world surface.


A campaign revolving around commercial activity could
cross the line into smuggling and a naval campaign
might see the Travellers trying to stop it. There is also
the possibility the Travellers might end up smuggling
weapons into worlds threatened by the Lords of
Thunder, or trying to get people out of a system
about to be overrun. They might also find themselves
harassing K’Kree shipping as a form of commercial
warfare or dealing with K’Kree-sponsored pirates, as
well as more typical plunder-for-profit vessels.


Piracy is more common in independent systems
such as most of Gateway than in a large state like
the Imperium. This is for several reasons but mainly
because a major state can afford more resources to
protect commerce and hunt pirates. It is necessary for
pirates to have a base of some kind and a large state
will normally act to correct any world acting as a pirate
haven, or to sweep a system suspected of having a
base on its outsystem planets.


There are exceptions, of course. Pirate organisations
may exert considerable influence and even more or
less control a world’s government. In some cases,
corporations or even states have been founded on pirate
money – and to the Vargr, corsair is an honourable
profession with long traditions. As a rule, however, piracy
is uncommon in the Imperium and the more powerful
states of Gateway, except near the borders. In non-
aligned space, it is somewhat more common.


There are several kinds of pirate. The first is the
‘ethically challenged merchant’, or ECM. Out on
the frontiers, merchant ships are often armed for
self-protection. Such vessels are able to undertake
aggressive action as well as defensive. The ECM-
type pirate is a merchant vessel that supplements its
income by opportunistic piracy. Such craft will attack
only when the odds are heavily in their favour. The
typical ECM pirate starts out honest but slips into
smuggling as profits from trade drop. As things get
worse, a golden opportunity drops in their lap, and
the crew crosses the line in a single act of piracy.
Successful or not, this is the watershed; having
become predators, most crews continue their piratical
career intermittently until caught or killed.

Adventures in the trailing Frontier





The career pirate is rather rarer and such careers
are often cut short by the navy. Career pirates may
operate merchant ships, and indeed engage in normal
commerce or smuggling, but they are always on the
lookout for a mark. Smart pirates – the ones that
last more than a few weeks – choose their targets
carefully and often use deception to get into a position
of overwhelming superiority. Contrary to the popular
image, most career pirates are non-descript captains of
well but not excessively armed merchant ships.


Career pirates make use of a number of factors to
ensure their success. They often bribe or influence port
workers and officials to feed them information, as well
as taking note of where the navy patrols and where
merchant ships are most vulnerable. Some strike and
move on; others have places to hide or fade back
into the merchant traffic and bluff their way past the
antipiracy patrols. All smart pirates ensure their attacks
are dispersed in time and space, and are willing to abort
an attack at any point and slip away if the odds are poor.


There are a few swashbuckling buccaneers operating in
the region. Most have a very short career since they are
so blatant that they lose the anonymity of more cautious
pirates. Those who are successful usually operate
heavily modified vessels, or even semi-military ships,
giving them a fighting chance against a patrol vessel or
at least enough acceleration to run away and enter jump.


Many such buccaneers deliberately cultivate a
reputation to help their activities. The usual stereotype
is the harsh but fair pirate captain who will strip a ship
bare if it surrenders but leave passengers and crew
who do not resist unharmed. Such captains will go
to great lengths to keep their reputation intact and
normally blast ships to pieces if they fight, creating a
choice between safe but financially harmful surrender
and certain death. So long as the reputation remains
intact, such a technique can work.


Larger pirate organisations do exist. Sometimes several
ships band together to create a base or to go after more
valuable prey. Such organisations often use varied
methods – some of them legal – to remain viable,
engaging in commerce, smuggling, cargo theft directly
from starports and extortion as well as traditional piracy.
Many pirate outfits work both sides of the line and will
demand protection money not to attack or even hire out
as escorts-for-hire if this seems more profitable than
attacking commerce, or if it serves some other end.


Pirates normally steal cargo rather than the carrying
ship. There are numerous reasons for this. A ship
that has resisted and been disabled may not be in a


jump-worthy condition and only be fit to be stripped for
spares. Bringing in such a ship requires a prize crew
or placing some troops aboard to coerce the crew into
taking it to the pirates’ safe port. The crew normally
have nothing to lose, since they are likely to be killed to
prevent them from revealing the location of the pirate
base, so coercion is not always successful.


However, pirates do sometimes hijack ships or capture
them to break for spares or sell on the black market.
Pirate groups will seek the best profit they can get,
wherever it comes from. Some pirate groups also engage
in planetary raiding, normally against outposts and worlds
unable to adequately defend themselves. Such ships
carry a contingent of ground troops and support vehicles.
They strike hard, grab what they can and depart swiftly.


Similar to piracy is commerce raiding, or commercial
warfare. This is conducted by warships or armed
private vessels and while cargoes may be taken,
the goal is to harass or destroy enemy shipping and
inflict economic damage. Privateering is illegal in
the Imperium but commerce raiding by legitimate
warships is considered a part of war-fighting and
accepted as such. Commerce raiders tend to be
light military ships, well enough armed to destroy
merchants and their small escorts but fast enough to
escape powerful navy ships.


To counter the threat of piracy and commerce raiding,
many merchant ships are armed and in dangerous
areas frontier trader type ships are popular. These are
hardened merchants that sacrifice some of their cargo
space for extra weapons and sensors, or military fire
control systems. Such craft also make decent raiders.


Other measures include random and regular naval
patrols, inspections of suspicious vessels, sweeps of
areas likely to be used as a base and occasionally
Q-ships; heavily armed vessels disguised as innocent and
vulnerable trade ships. These measures are deterrents for
the most part and only rarely make contact with a pirate
ship. By making piracy difficult or excessively hazardous,
these measures cause the pirates to move on. However,
coverage is expensive, so the level of patrols and other
operations is often reduced after the number of pirate
attacks diminishes. In time, the pirates come back.

Actually eradicating piracy is a matter for careful
intelligence work. Agents find the pirate bases, their
supporters and safe ports, their hardware suppliers
and the people who buy the pirates’ stolen wares.
Then the enforcement arm (which could be special
police, army or navy ground troops) strikes fast and
hard. Arrests are made where possible, or in some
cases the navy will simply blast an outsystem base
Adventures in the trailing Frontier


to slag. Facing the death penalty, many pirates resist
vigorously, so anti-piracy strikes can approach the
conditions of an all-out battle.

CONFLICT AND

INTERSTELLAR WARFARE
Within Imperial territory, conflict is limited by laws.
Transgressors risk being corrected by force and cannot
possibly hope to defeat the Imperial armed forces. Most
conflicts are kept within civilised limits and are typically
characterised by precision operations or low-intensity
skirmishing. Beyond the Imperial border the situation
is rather different. Low-intensity warfare is always
possible, especially where funding and resources are
limited. At the other end of the scale, Travellers could
be drawn into a major war between two of the region’s
powers or against the Lords of Thunder. The amount of
restraint shown in such cases depends on many factors
and escalation is always a possibility.

All-out war between worlds is fortunately very rare.
Such wars are mainly naval affairs, since whoever
gains uncontested control of orbital space can bombard
the defender into oblivion at leisure. Most states are
unwilling to do so, however, for several reasons. Not
only is massive orbital bombardment with nuclear
weapons or deadfall ordnance – generally referred
to as ‘rocks’ whatever its actual nature – devastating
to the ecology of the target world, often slaughtering
the entire population and rendering the planet useless
into the bargain, but this kind of apocalyptic attack is
repugnant to most civilised states.

Additionally, there is the fact that a state or world which
engages in this kind of warfare – or uses biological
weaponry to cause mass casualties – is likely to alarm
its neighbours, who may band together and make sure
it never happens to them. An apocalyptic state may find
itself on the receiving end of a massed attack designed to
do unto them before they can do unto others. As a result,
wars tend to be subject to a certain amount of restraint,
negotiation and brinkmanship. These limited wars always
run the risk of escalation but civilian targets are normally
considered off-limits except where they are used to
shelter military assets – and sometimes even then.

Most wars take the form of skirmishes in space or ground
actions to seize outposts and economic targets, with both
sides trying to inflict economic damage and bring the
opposition to the negotiating table on favourable terms.
Massed fleet actions are rare, because losing one can
lose the war, and the sheer cost of rebuilding even a
victorious fleet can ruin a planetary economy.


Covert actions, raids and similar small-scale military
operations are common, sometimes coupled with
support for dissident elements in the enemy’s society.
Sudden attacks by ground forces to seize important
targets are occasionally attempted. These are usually
followed by a demand for negotiations, which normally
results in a peace treaty, some concessions etc.
Invasion to occupy and annex a world is only possible
where one side has a massive military superiority.


Most interstellar wars are characterised by an attitude
of ‘grab what you can and sue for peace’ and are
fought for limited goals under restrictive rules of
engagement. The occasional war that spills out beyond
this restriction is remembered as a horrific business for
generations to come. Normally rival states have more
to gain from a favourable treaty and some economic or
territorial concessions than obliteration of a neighbour,
even if it means a rematch 10 years down the line.


Wars of survival and extermination, such as the one that
some analysts believe will eventually occur between
the K’Kree and the Imperium, are not subject to any
rules or restrictions. Such a war may have caused the
destruction of the Ancients and their civilisation. Nobody
wants to risk such a fate, unless they are sure they can
win or are backed into a corner from which there is no
escape. Most combatants are careful to ensure their
enemies never become so desperate and wars remain a
mix of economic, diplomatic and military action seeking
advantage rather than apocalypse.


Travellers might become involved in conflict as
participants – perhaps mercenaries or the crew of a
long-range naval expedition – or be caught up in wider
events. An interesting take on the naval campaign
might be to have the Travellers fighting against Imperial
expansion into Gateway. The Imperial Navy has
enormous resources but is at the end of a long supply
line, making a successful campaign by a resourceful
but overmatched enemy a possibility.


Tensions between the states of Gateway Domain offer
many opportunities for mercenary work but of course
the nightmare scenario is defending a world against an
invasion by the Lords of Thunder. If this were part of an
all-out steamroller attempt the Travellers would stand
no chance but it is common for one or another of the
K’Kree leaders to act alone with limited resources. A
successful defence or escape after a hard fight leading
to a narrow defeat is possible. It may even be that the
Travellers could bring down one of the great leaders
of the Lords of Thunder. One who feels threatened by
rivals might launch a military campaign to demonstrate
strength, only to fail and be eliminated. Such an event
would place the Travellers on the stage of history even
if they never directly encountered their enemy.

Adventures in the trailing Frontier





THE PSIONICS INSTITUTES
The term psionics institutes is a general catch-all for
the various groups and individuals that teach the use
of mind powers. Some are real institutes, organised
as a university or even a corporate training school.
Others are hidden, meeting like a witches’ coven
to practice and share knowledge, and some are
individual adepts and masters who take on the odd
student from time-to-time.


The institutes have no agenda or common cause.
Most are discreet – especially in the Imperium, where
psionics are banned – and like to maintain anonymity.
A few are in communication or aware of one another
but for the most part each is an independent entity.
Their only common trait is a desire to be left alone to
pursue their interests. This individualism means the
institutes are not a coherent force but does not mean
they do not influence events in the region. Some
psions actively use their powers to influence politics
while others serve as advisors, often disguising
the nature of their power by acting as intelligence
coordinators or political advisors.


It is not uncommon for psions to wander, seeking
new secrets or basic training. Some such wanderers
may get involved in local events – for good or bad
reasons – because they have the power to influence
matters or because their talent reveals something
others might not see. Such a wandering apprentice
or adept psion can do great good or harm (usually a
bit of both) by their actions.


Occasionally a psion will decide to go on a crusade to
right some wrong or change the world for the better,
to champion justice or to make a fortune from a life
of psionic crime. Such individuals draw attention –
normally of an unfavourable sort – to the institutes, and
are frowned upon at best. Sometimes it is necessary for
an institute to take measures to dispose of a crusading
psion, even one who is doing good, to avoid backlash
from the local populace.


The world of psionics is not merely a wondrous vista of
glorious mental learning; it is a shadowy environment
of conflict, politics, rivalry and occasional violence. The
Travellers might find themselves drawn into such a
conflict, which may have no clear villains and no heroes
at all. Psionics might play a part in almost any Traveller
game set in the Trailing Frontier, particularly one that
touches on the Ancients in some way.

IMPERIAL ENTANGLEMENTS


IN GATEWAY
The Gateway Project is the most widely known of the
Imperial endeavours in Gateway and certainly the
largest. It is an umbrella for multiple smaller projects,
loosely coordinated through the Domain capital at
Annapabar. Those with the funding and equipment for
the task they have in mind can apply for membership
of the project, which carries relatively minor benefits.
An officially sanctioned project will be given preference
in any dispute with a private venture and the Project
facilitates mutual assistance and cooperation. For
those without the wherewithal to carry out their plans,
the Project has funding for worthy endeavours and can
help source personnel and equipment.


Membership of the Gateway Project is not mandatory
to obtain a license to operate across the border,
but it does help. The archduke likes to keep an
eye on what is going on and to be able to direct
endeavours towards the goals of the Imperium as
a whole. Joining the Project means buying into this
mindset and the archduke rewards those who align
themselves in this manner. However, there are many
smaller and private ventures operating without the
oversight of the Project. Imperial ships and personnel
can still rely on the protection of the Navy and the
diplomatic service if they get into trouble whilst
undertaking legitimate business.

Whilst this activity is legal and above-board, there are
plenty of Imperial citizens operating below the radar or
pursuing their own agendas. Cross-border smuggling
is common, usually carried out on a small scale by
otherwise legitimate vessels. Blockade runners –
Adventures in the trailing Frontier


dedicated smuggling vessels which operate covertly
rather than making a pretence of being legal – also
cross in and out of Imperial space. These are the
likely means for larger cargoes. Since the Imperium
has a generally higher Tech Level than the worlds
outside its borders, high-tech cargoes are lucrative,
especially restricted goods.

A number of the ports in The Gate are smuggler-
friendly. This does attract Imperial displeasure and the
occasional raid but it is not possible to suppress the
problem entirely. There are also rumoured to be secret
freeports located in certain systems, supporting a more
organised smuggling trade. The otherwise legitimate
corporations involved in cross-border trade may also be
illegally moving high-tech goods.

In addition to the corporate and illicit trade, there are
other Imperial ventures in Gateway Domain. Some
of the nobles who lost their holdings in the reshuffle
following the installation of the new archduke have
quietly begin moving assets and personnel beyond the
border. Even quite a minor Imperial noble house could
be a player in the politics of Gateway, especially if they
possessed high-tech weaponry or starships. A number
of these pocket empires have been identified. Most
seem harmless in the grand scheme of things but it is
possible that some might dream of returning to Ley to
overthrow its current leaders. Such a venture is unlikely
to succeed but that does not rule out an attempt.

FORMER ARCHDUKE STEPHEN AND

THE LOYAL SECTOR GUARD
Deposing an archduke is not done lightly – except
in Ley, or so the saying goes. The Erechs dynasty
had three generations on the archducal throne at
Annapabar; long enough to make their mark on the
sector. They are primarily remembered for instigating
a time of turbulence, although this was probably better
for the ordinary folk than the stagnant cronyism of
Nells and his followers. Archduke Stephen lost his
primary title but was given the barony of Zuge as an
appanage. His other titles were redistributed along
with that of the archduke, removing him from direct
positions of power around the domain capital.

No high noble would be pleased at a huge demotion of
this sort but the requirement is to accept the situation
gracefully. Usually the bitter pill is sugared a little
by appointment to a new set of duties which carry
additional prestige. This was the case with former
Archduke Stephen, whose appointment as baron of
Zuge placed him on the Imperial border. The post
came with great wealth in the form of shares in various


Imperial businesses. These were diversified, so Baron
Stephen did not gain influence over these companies
but he was granted an income far greater than a typical
baron. This of course came with conditions. The baron
of Zuge is a ‘Defender of The Gate’, charged with
maintaining personal forces sufficient to contribute to
the stability and protection of this sensitive region.


In the three decades since his deposition as archduke,
Baron Stephen has fulfilled the role of Defender of
The Gate diligently and well. Of course he resents his
demotion and plans to elevate himself or his family,
and there are several possible routes he might take.
One is loyal service in his new role, perhaps coupled
with some polite criticism of the new order. The baron
has no choice but to fulfil this role – he would be
further demoted and disgraced if he did not – but he
has made a point of doing the job better than anyone
could have expected.


Baron Stephen’s personal forces – known as huscarles

- are scarcely smaller than when he held the office
of archduke. They include escort-class warships and
support vessels repurposed from the merchant line
Stephen still owns. It is not uncommon to see these
vessels in Outworld subsector or to find detachments
of the baron’s huscarles protecting friendly installations
in the region. They are often encountered in company
with Loyal Sector Guard personnel and many officers
are members of both organisations.


The LSG presence on Zuge is typical of the organisation;
a fairly large number of members who do nothing much
besides drink expensive wine and look dashing in their
uniforms. However, a higher than average percentage
of the LSG’s Zuge chapter go active by joining the
Gateway Legion or in detachments sent into Gateway.
Ironically perhaps, given that the original Loyal Sector
Guard supported the deposed Nells against the new
Archduke Erechs, Baron Stephen is a prominent and
influential member of the organisation.


There are concerns Baron Stephen may be building
a powerbase within Imperial territory through his
LSG affiliations and creating a force of combat-
experienced soldiers with the Gateway Legion. To
what purpose remains unknown; it is entirely possible
he is loyally pushing the Imperial agenda in Gateway.
However, it is known that cargoes of manufacturing
equipment and life-support systems have been
shipped across the border. Baron Stephen may
have decided to set up a base somewhere beyond
the reach of the current archduke, who cannot take
away what he cannot find. Whether this is a fallback
position in case a future gambit fails or serves some
other purpose remains to be seen.

Adventures in the trailing Frontier




MYSTERIES OF


THE TRAILING FRONTIER
There are many mysteries, great and small, in the
Trailing Frontier. These might be the focus of a
campaign or something the Travellers stumble on in the
middle of doing something else. A hard-bitten force of
mercenaries skirmishing with scouts from the Lords of
Thunder might find themselves dealing with something
entirely different and may not realise it at first.


One of the largest mysteries of the Trailing Frontier
is the Wandering People. They are widely thought to
have entered the region a few hundred years ago but
are in fact a native species. There is a persistent but
incorrect myth that they invented the jump drive and
at one time knew the secret of advanced drives well
ahead of their time. Might the Wanderers be a Major
Race? Might their lost knowledge unlock the secrets of
jump-7 or higher? The answer to both questions is no,
but investigating the Wanderers will lead to revelations
about the Vilani Imperium.


Many of the facts known about the Wandering
People are incorrect. The commonly available
databases typically mention only their worldships
and a few physical characteristics. Those with more
information claim they invented a superior jump
drive, which frightened the Vilani imperium so much
that the Wanderers’ homeworld was destroyed.
The latter part of this statement is true but the
Wanderers did not invent the jump drive and are not
a Major Race. Nevertheless, the occasional datanet
article thunders out new revelations about the
Wandering People and trots out the old myth that
they had jump-2 and higher before the Vilani. This is
not what happened. Nor is the commonly held belief
that they crossed the Lesser Rift correct. Some may
have done so but most of the Wanderers’ worldships
went in other directions.


The Wanderers emerged as a sentient species on
the world of Lirguu in what is now Diamond-Prince
subsector in the distant past. For millennia they
developed their culture and technology, until eventually
they ventured into space. The original exploration ships
were sublight vessels much like the current worldships,
although on a much less grand scale.


Sometime before -5400, the Vilani were experimenting
with a wholly new concept – a jump drive that could
propel a ship more than the one parsec thought to be
its limit. Early experimentation was risky to say the
least, and testbed ships sometimes misjumped. One


hurled itself all the way to the rimward-trailing corner
of Ley where the wreck was found by the curious
Wanderers. They were able to reverse-engineer the
drive, although in an inferior form, and ultimately
launched their first jump-capable vessels.


Sublight exploration was quickly displaced by
jump technology, although the Wanderers used
the technique of jumping to a sublight base ship
sent out decades earlier and using it as a mobile
base from which to explore the local region. By this
means the Wanderers spread out across several
systems, where they created a stable and peaceful
civilisation. They also contacted other species,
including the Luriani, and traded knowledge,
including that of the jump drive, to them. When the
Vilani realised the Luriani had jump technology,
they were alarmed that another species could have
developed it. It was not until later they discovered it
was their own drives, albeit modified by Wanderer
influences, and by then the Vilani Imperium had
visited catastrophe on the Wanderers.


Around –5400, contact with the Vilani shattered the
Wanderers’ peaceful existence. The Ziru Sirka had
recently developed a reliable jump-2 drive which gave
them huge advantages over those whose strategic
mobility was limited to one parsec a week. All the same,
the possession of jump by the Luriani was a shock.
When a Wanderer drive was examined, shock turned
to terror. The Vilani realised – incorrectly – that the
Wanderers had cracked one of the major technological
barriers of the jump drive and could in theory build two-
or even three-parsec capable ships.


This was bad enough but the internal politics of the
Vilani Imperium also played a part. Ambitious officials
overstated the threat and asked for funding to counter
it. By the time the report reached the shadow emperor,
the Wanderers had functional jump-5 vessels. This
made them capable of striking deep into the Vilani
Imperium and strategically outmanoeuvring the
empire’s battle fleets, which could not be permitted.
The Vilani demanded the secret of high-jump drives
from the bemused Wanderers and when they did not
deliver them – because they could not – the shadow
emperor ordered the secret be taken by force.

The ambitious officials who had inflated the threat
never got their increased budget. Instead a fleet of the
most powerful jump-2 ships the Ziru Sirka could muster
was diverted from a campaign elsewhere and sent into
what is now Ley. This weakened the campaign against
a species known as the Kaski, in Empty Quarter
sector, and contributed to Vilani difficulties there. War
with the Wanderers might have been averted but the
Adventures in the trailing Frontier


Vilani commanders were nervous. A minor incident
escalated and within days an entire Wanderer colony
had been turned to slag with nuclear warheads. There
was no turning back now. The high-jump threat of the
Wanderers, imaginary as it turned out to be, had to be
eliminated at any cost.

The Wanderers were a peaceful people but they
possessed some weapons and were determined to
fight what they saw as murdering aliens. The Luriani,
or perhaps Wanderer traders operating among them,
provided intelligence which allowed the Wanderers
to ambush a detachment of the Vilani fleet, although
their own warships were improvised and only
marginally effective. Further engagements wore
down the Vilani expeditionary force until its survivors
were forced to retreat.

The destruction of their fleet terrified the leaders of
the Ziru Sirka. Although knowledge of the defeat was
strictly controlled and later expunged from the history
books, it was decided that these powerful, advanced
and warlike aliens could not be permitted to threaten
the Grand Empire of Stars. A much greater fleet was
assembled and began the methodical reduction of the
Wanderers. The Vilani were determined to do it right
and built forward bases in what had been unexplored
territory. One-by-one the Wanderer worlds were
bombarded into rubble.

The Wanderers put up fanatical resistance and
rapidly became quite proficient at space combat.
Having seen the fate of their first colony they saw
no point in surrendering to the murderous Vilani, so
each outpost was defended to the last. It was to no
avail; the forces ranged against the Wanderers kept
increasing as the Vilani, amazed at the tenacity of
their foes and dismayed they could not be induced to
surrender like sane people, fed more and more ships
into the maelstrom.

It became obvious to the Wanderers they were about to
be exterminated, so a desperate plan was formulated.
Sublight colony ships were hastily built and sent out,
taking as much of the surviving Wanderer population
with them as possible. These were joined by the few
jump-capable vessels that could be spared. No records
remain of the direction taken by these ships but it is
likely they went to trailing or rimward, directly away
from the Vilani threat.

Some Wanderer vessels were lost en route. It may
be that some reached distant safety only to fade and
die in alien surroundings, while others may fly ever
onward, loaded with dead colonists aboard failed
low berths. Some found sanctuary, where they built


up their population, reconstructed their technological
base and created new worldships. As the Long Night
settled in, the Wanderers hid from a Ziru Sirka that
had fallen long ago.


Sanctuary was not home. Many of the escape ships
lost records and the Wanderers were unsure of the
location of their ancient home. They had a vague idea
where it might be found and eventually, some of the
Wandering People set out to return to their old domain.
They found the Grand Empire of Stars gone, replaced
by a Third Imperium that seemed saner and more
friendly. No-one remembered them. Even their friends,
the Luriani, had no idea this was a recontact and not a
first meeting. They did speak of a year of woe, in which
Vilani agents did something in Luriani space and of
curious gaps in their knowledge.


The Wandering People had returned to their home
space as strangers. Most of those they encountered
were friendly enough but they had been almost wiped
out by humans for no reason they could understand.
The Wanderers are not willing to risk annihilation a
second time. They keep their mission secret, gathering
information thorough trade and commerce. Their
worldships crawl across the region, sending out jump-
capable scouts and traders. No-one knows their secret
agenda, nor even that they have one. Their goal is to
find and reclaim their ancestral home, and it is essential
they do. Without their home, the Wanderers face
spiritual and perhaps actual extinction.


The Wandering People do not reveal much about their
religious or spiritual beliefs to outsiders. Human experts
are aware the Wanderers consider all sentient life to
possess a spirit or soul, and that upon death this spirit
is ‘led home’ by an empowered religious object. What
they do not know is that Wanderers believe if their
souls are not led home, they linger, suffering, and bring
bad luck upon those still living.


The empowered religious object in this case is
a piece of rock, ceremonially inscribed, from the
homeworld of the Wanderers. This is the object that
should reside in the sacred pouch carried by their
priests. However, almost all Wanderer communities
have lost their homestone (as it is known), and are
thus surrounded by the unquiet spirits of thousands
of years, which remain, tormented, among their
living descendants.


There are two factions within Wanderer religion.
One group refers to itself as the seeking people;
using a word that translates roughly as ‘those who
remain true to the wandering generation’. They
have no homestones and are served by a caste of

Adventures in the trailing Frontier





impoverished priests, whose sacred pouches are
empty but for an inscribing device used to make a
piece of homeworld rock holy.


The other communities do have homestones but
these are not from the original homeworld. They
are either from a colony in Ley or one of the worlds
the Wanderers fled to in ages past. Their priests
wear their full regalia and carry a properly inscribed
homestone but they are referred to by the seeking
people as ‘they who became lost’. The seeking people
believe the false homestones lead the souls of the
dead to a hell or similar bad place. A member of the
seeking people would be terrified at being anywhere
near such a false priest, since upon death they would
be taken to the wrong place.


Both groups need to find the homeworld, to obtain true
homestones or reconsecrate the ones they have so the
dead can go to the right place, and more importantly so
both halves of the Wanderer religion can be reconciled.
Those who became lost do not recognise the difference
between the two factions, and refer to both as ‘The
Wandering People’ or sometimes ‘The Displaced
People’. Wanderers do not discuss their religion or the
importance of their spiritual home with anyone.


The Wanderers known as ‘crazies’ or ‘rogues’ are
considered holy seekers by mainstream Wanderer
society. Their numbers are increasing as the
centuries go by, a sure sign there is something
badly wrong with the souls of the Wandering People.
Crazies are respected but not entirely trusted, as
holy madmen are still madmen when it comes down
to it. They have many goals but, like all Wanderers,
they long for the day when the souls of the dead can
be led home into the stones of their homeworld to
join the ancestors. On that day, all the crazies will
become sane. They will have redeemed their species
and can take their reward; being able to re-join
Wanderer society as normal people and enjoy the
community of their species.


The Wanderers’ search for their homeworld is
ongoing in the background of other events in the
region. They may commission Travellers to help them
search or investigate somewhere, although they are
unlikely to explain what they are looking for or why.
Alternatively, the Travellers may encounter the same
bands of Wanderers or individual crazies in various
places and realise they are looking for something.
The Wanderers will affect the situation in the Trailing
Frontier another way, too. Those who carried
out the atrocities of the Year of Woe served the


Sharurshid megacorporation, as did the officials who
misrepresented the situation in Ley and inadvertently
triggered a genocidal war. Sharurshid would prefer
this secret remained buried.


Keeping the skeletons in the closet is the task of an
organisation known as Zulii Aana Korameshh, or
ZAK. Their name translates in Galanglic as Keepers
of Dark (or deep, or difficult, depending on the
inflection) Secrets. ZAK is a secret branch of the
Sharurshid megacorporation’s security service. Its
existence is unknown to more than 99% of the firm’s
employees and senior officials. Its personnel all have
cover jobs as managers, workers and contractors,
and most do not know what secrets they keep. They
simply stand ready for the day when they are ordered
to intimidate or kill someone. They never ask why
and many believe all they are doing is preserving
the security of the megacorp. Some are actually
recruited under the pretence that they are deep-
cover Imperial agents and believe they are acting on
orders from the highest Imperial authorities.


ZAK does not keep records of the secrets it guards,
although some personnel have gleaned some facts
and senior coordinators have access to the truth in
order to direct their operations more effectively. No
regional ZAK office knows about matters protected
by other regional branches. The biggest secret
guarded is the near-extermination of the species now
known as the Wanderers and since these beings
have returned to Imperial Space, ZAK has been
highly active in monitoring them and ensuring others
do not stumble upon the secret.


The Ley Sector office of ZAK maintains a close watch
on scientists, journalists and the occasional Ancients
hunter poking around the region in search of artefacts
or lost history. The Wanderers’ worlds were pretty much
scrubbed by the Sharurshid fleet but artifacts do turn up
from time-to-time which might prove they were resident
in the region long ago. One response to such activity
is to deflect, offering funding to search a world known
to be a dead-end, or to buy up artefacts and quietly
make them disappear. If this fails, coercion, intimidation
and murder may become necessary and ZAK has
access to deniable assets in the form of mercenaries,
corsair ships and assassins as well as its own covert-
operations personnel. The keepers will always try to
use soft options before resorting to radical action that
might cause further investigation.


Since the rimward end of Ley is a potential time bomb
for Sharurshid, ZAK maintains a presence on many
worlds. In some systems these are paid informants

Adventures in the trailing Frontier


who do not know who they report to or perhaps a lone
agent, but the organisation can bring in major assets in
an impressively short time, and given the importance of
the secret they guard, they are willing to take extreme
and even desperate measures if necessary.

The Travellers might fall foul of ZAK even if they know
nothing about the Wanderers and their quest. Indeed,
it may be that by triggering a ZAK intervention and
wondering why there are suddenly secret agents trying
to kill them, the Travellers are drawn into unravelling
a mystery 6,000 years old, and inflicting enormous
damage on the Sharurshid megacorporation’s
reputation into the bargain.

THE RORYNIAR
According to ancient tradition and wild rumour, Luriani
were not the first sophonts to dwell on Daramm. The
name given to these earlier inhabitants is Roryniar,
a word of unknown origin. Some claim the Roryniar
evolved on Daramm, which is unlikely given it is
a water world, whilst others claim that Vesaravyn

- the planet next to Daramm’s primary – was the
Roryniar homeworld. Vesaravyn does have a complex
ecosystem and would be a better prospect for
development of a technological society, but there is little
evidence it was inhabited.

According to the Roryniar Lobby, this species
developed super-advanced technology even before the
Ancients, building outposts across their home system
and elsewhere in the sector, before becoming extinct.
Hundreds of thousands of years have hidden their
works. Adherents of the Roryniar concept point to the
large number of sites they say exist as evidence that
the Roryniar really did exist. However, it has proven
extremely hard to find these sites even when their
location is revealed in public databases. It is likely the
Roryniar are a wild tale or perhaps a conspiracy theory
linking what are in reality unrelated sites belonging to
much more humble societies.

THE LORDS OF THUNDER
The Lords of Thunder are not a mystery. Their
intentions are quite clear and openly declared. They
plan to take control over the whole of Charted Space
and kill every single G’naak they encounter. The details
are less clear, however. It is almost certain that the
Lords of Thunder will attack the Renkard Union within
the year. This is a highly significant act as it brings them
into open conflict with at least some of the states of
Gateway, and establishes a foothold in the sector.


The Renkard Union stands no chance against a
concerted assault. Its only hope for survival is the
disunity of the K’Kree, coupled with timely and
meaningful reinforcements from nearby states. It is
likely the Megusard Corporate will assist, although
perhaps not directly. The Corporate is already hiring
mercenary forces, enabling it to deny responsibility in
the event Renkard is overrun quickly. If that happens,
Megusard and other local states may try to stall with
appeasement and denial of their part in the defence of
Renkard. On the other hand, if Renkard puts up a good
enough fight other states may decide a line can be
drawn and send additional forces.


The Lords of Thunder will not pursue a clear and
coherent strategy against the Renkard Union. Even
the start of the operation will be muddled as some
leaders try to show their worth by attacking sooner
than everyone else. In addition to being distributed
in time, attacks will be scattered across the whole
Union. They are likely to be launched recklessly and
against the more habitable worlds where the K’Kree
can fight in their preferred style. It is possible a skilled
commander on the Renkard side might be able to shift
reserves to meet the rain of blows one at a time and
actually hold some of the targeted worlds. This has
the potential to inspire others to assist and is essential
to the survival of the Union, or at least part of it.
However, unity of command is unlikely, so the defence
may come down to isolated attacks and defensive
actions, with some worlds immediately overwhelmed
and others untouched.


The imminent war at the trailing edge of Gateway
is of great importance to those taking the long view
and everyone close to the threatened area. There
is a steady movement spinward of those with the
resources to relocate and there are rumours the
Imperials are quietly assisting. Populations and rich
individuals resettled by Imperial ships are required to
swear allegiance to a new state wherever they arrive
and in many cases these new states are keen to
become Imperial clients. It may be the line against the
Lords of Thunder is drawn in the Renkard Union, if not
then it will likely be in these client states. When the
K’Kree advance reaches this point, the Imperium will
have to fight or abandon its people. It is not at all clear
what the decision will be, nor when it will become
necessary. What is certain is that sooner or later the
fleets of the Imperium and the Lords of Thunder will
clash, probably somewhere in Gateway and definitely
within the Trailing Frontier.
