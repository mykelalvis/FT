# THE TRAVELLERS' AID SOCIETY

The Travellers' Aid Society (TAS) maintains a chain of hostels, which vary considerably in quality from excellent hotels to drafty shacks, and provides information to its members about local conditions.  While TAS was created with the needs (and money) of well-off businesspersons and minor nobles in mind, it has gradually come to cater to a more ordinary voyager. Anyone can rent a room in most TAS facilities but the Member's Lounge and special facilities (which generally include accurate and up to date local information on what is really going on) are reserved for members.

Membership can be awarded for service or, as cynics claim, for being someone TAS would like to have as a member. It can also be bought for a straight MCr1, although some candidates are blackballed after paying, for various reasons.

TAS publishes JTAS – the Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society. This is a well-respected news and current events journal, with features on interesting people and places across Charted Space. The 'open' version can be bought by anyone and helps fund reporters and the society itself. Members have access to a slightly more comprehensive version with the JTAS archives, which are very extensive and contain information on a wide range of subjects.

TAS is not a secret society, nor is it a 'universal siblinghood of Travellers'. There is no guarantee that an influential person staying in a TAS hostel will talk to a down-at-heel adventurer just because they are both TAS members. However, it provides a place where interesting, and perhaps useful, people can be met if a Traveller makes the right approach. Sometimes job offers and information come through the TAS network and are not seen by outsiders.

Overall, TAS is very useful to Travellers. Whether it is worth spending a million Credits on is another question entirely.

Ironically, while many Travellers are members of and make use of The Travellers' Aid Society (TAS), it was set up to assist the more mundane traveller (no capital T). TAS maintains a chain of hostels which vary considerably in quality from excellent hotels to draughty shacks, and provides information to its members about local conditions.

While TAS was created with the needs (and money) of well–off businesspersons and minor nobles in mind, it has gradually come to cater to a more ordinary class of person. Anyone can rent a room in most TAS facilities, but the Member's Lounge and the special facilities (which generally include accurate and up to date local information on what's really going on) are reserved for members.

Membership can be awarded for service or, as cynics claim, for being someone TAS would like to have as a member. It can also be bought for a straight one million Credits, though some candidates are 'blackballed' after paying for various reasons.

TAS is in no way a secret society, nor is it a 'universal siblinghood of Travellers'. There is no guarantee that an influential person staying in a TAS hostel will want to talk to a down–at–heel adventurer just because they are both TAS members. However, it at least provides a place where interesting and perhaps useful people can be met if the Traveller makes the right approach. Sometimes job offers and information come through the TAS network and are not seen by outsiders.

Overall, TAS is very useful to Travellers. Whether it is worth spending a million credits on is another question entirely.
