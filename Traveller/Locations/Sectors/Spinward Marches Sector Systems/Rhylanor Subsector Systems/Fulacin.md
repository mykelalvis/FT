**Fulacin** is a low-population world with a population of less than 10,000 sophonts in size.

- This world has yet to take off economically or otherwise and the population remains low for reasons largely unknown.
- It is a member of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] in the [[Rhylanor Subsector]] of [[Spinward Marches]] Sector in the [[Domain of Deneb]].
- This is a temperate world, with a climate of pleasant, average temperatures, considered to be an _ideal_ or _near-ideal_ environment by many different sophont species.
- This is a "high technology" world with technology achievements at, near, or over technology standards for [[Charted Space]].
- Fulacin is a member of the [[Spinward Main]].

### System Data

The worlds of the system have been surveyed. They consist of:

- The mainworld.
- x10 secondary rocky worlds.
- x1 planetoid belt.

### Mainworld Data

Fulacin is a large, mostly unexplored world, and its plains and deserts abound in wildlife. While multiple orbital surveys have been carried out over the years and relatively detailed charts exist, few locations on the world have actually been visited.

#### Mainworld Size (S)

**Fulacin** is a Meso World between 8,800km and 10,400km in diameter. The world has a standard gravity between 0.6G and 0.8G. The horizon will appear about 4.4km away.

#### Mainworld Atmosphere (A)

**Fulacin** has a pressure of 0.71 to 1.49 atmospheres. While a Standard Atmosphere does not require survival gear this atmosphere also contains an unusual taint such as such as disease, a hazardous gas mix, pollutants, or sulfur compounds which requires the use of a Filter Mask. Some taints may require more protective equipment. TL–3 or more advanced survival gear is required to settle this world.

- It experiences low to moderate temperatures.

Fulacin's most noted feature is its standard density tainted atmosphere. Widespread taint in the form of heavy metal dust and oxides means that the atmosphere is unbreathable without a filter mask. The dust causes a wide variety of respiratory illnesses, and can cause carcinoma within years of exposure. This metal dust has also made Fulacin an ideal location for use of [[MagnetoDynamics]]'s several patents dealing with recovery of metal from atmospheric and oceanic suspension.

#### Mainworld Hydrosphere (H

**Fulacin** has 35-45% of its surface covered by liquid water. There will be a number of small seas or one larger body of water. Wilderness refueling is possible.

[[World_Map_Fulacin_Basic.jpg|Fulacin Map]]

#### Native Lifeforms

Abundant native life occupying every available ecological niche. Its metabolic functions drive the process of atmospheric renewal.

#### Fauna & Flora

The world is well known for several of its native species:

- Fulacinian Groat: Fulacin is notable as the native world of the Groat, an herbivore prized for its shaggy hair and meat.
  - Groats are found on a number of other worlds across the region.
- Fulacinian Snowcat: a carnivore and potentially agressive creature.
- Fulacinian Trapper: an octopodal carnivore/trapper, known for its aggressive behavior.

![[Fulacinian_Snowcat_Twilight's_Peak_Richard_Hentz.jpg|100]]

![[Fulacinian_Trapper_Twilight's_Peak_Richard_Hentz.jpg|100]]

During its time developing the colony, [[MagnetoDynamics]] has shown little to no interest in investigating the ecological effects of its activities other than to issue the notorious statement:

> "_the groats don’t taste any different_".

## History & Background (Dossier)

![[Comp-Prog-Dav.jpg]]

Fulacin has been under the control of [[MagnetoDynamics]] through an Imperial charter for development.

### World Starport (St)

**Fulacin** has a **Class A Starport**, an excellent quality installation which includes all the expected amenities including refined fuel for starships, brokerage services for passengers and cargo, and a variety of ship provisions. There is a shipyard capable of doing annual maintenance, overhauls and other kinds of repair, and construction of both starships and non-starships. Most ports of this classification have both a Highport and a Downport.

Though otherwise unimportant, Fulacin's excellent A–class starport was constructed to facilitate access to Rhylanor "Rhylanor (world)") (Spinward Marches 2716), the subsector capital. The starport features ship construction and repair facilities, a Travellers' Aid Society hostel, and overhaul equipment.

- The region around the downport, now designated Fulacin Down, is surrounded by large towers which draw in atmospheric gases and process them to extract useful chemicals. Similar plants line the shores of nearby seas.

### World Population (P)

**Fulacin** has population of 800 sophonts (hundreds).

- This is a Low Population World and the population would be too low to sustain itself without moderate outside assistance. This may represent a large transient population such as the crew of a fleet of starships, the dwindling remnants of a dying colony, a construction team building a new colony, or an outpost that could evolve into a colony.
- Defining some of the downport inhabitants as residents of Fulacin created a planetary population who could be granted Imperial Member status, thereby making Fulacin Imperial territory.

#### Linguistic Topography

The following languages are most commonly heard:

- Anglic, one of the two official languages of the Imperium.
- Vilani "Vilani (language)"), one of the two official languages of the Imperium.

### World Technology Level (T)

**Fulacin** possesses a Technology Level of TL–13 or _TL-D_ in Hexadecimal Notation.

- Common _Communication_ technologies for this TL include: Holovideo recorders.
- Common _Power Generation_ technologies for this TL include: Miniature super-batteries, prototype collectors, advanced fusion plants.
- Common _Transportation_ technologies for this TL include:
  - _Land, Water & Air:_ Personal G-Tubes and advanced gravcraft.
  - _Space:_ Advanced interplanetary spacecraft (System Craft).
  - _FTL:_ Jump Drive-4.

[MagnetoDynamics.jpg](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/File:MagnetoDynamics.jpg)

### World Government (G)

**Fulacin** is governed by a _Corporate Polity_ with a single corporation with a typical corporate structure as a government. A company town, or world. The typical corporate run world usually has a single purpose. Examples include mining, agriculture, or other kinds of resource extraction. But rather than a simple base of operations, there are facilities for housing workers and their families including hospitals, schools, and other infrastructure. How, or if, the children of the workers are incorporated into the workforce varies with companies. The corporation running the world may be a subsidiary of a larger interstellar corporation.

- Fulcain Down has grown into a "Corp Town" where every business is licensed by _MagnetoDynamics_ and most services were provided directly by the company.

### World Law (L)

**Fulacin** has no law in practice. It is an Anarchy. On many worlds, this by itself justifies an Amber Zone advisory. There are few laws, covering only important areas. There may be few or no law enforcement officers, the expectation is citizens will bring law breakers to the attention of the Judicial system. Legal proceedings will be fast, with few people involved. For interactions outside of the framework of the laws, cultural norms dominate.

### Imperial Landed Nobility

**Fulacin**, as a member world of the Third Imperium has a member of the Imperial Nobility overseeing the world.

- It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.

### Trade Data

- Importance:1 (ordinary)

### World Economy

- Resources:5 (scarce)
- Labor:1 (tens)
- Infrastructure:1 (extremely limited)
- Efficiency: -3 (poor)

### World Culture

- Heterogenity:1 (monolithic)
- Acceptance:3 (xenophobic)
- Strangeness:1 (very typical)
- Symbols:8 (somewhat abstract)

#### World Timeline

Major events that have affected this world and the wider region that it lies within:

- The Year 0: the Third [[Imperium]] is founded.
- 300-420: the Imperial First Survey charts the system.
- 589-604: [[First Frontier War]].
- 604-622: the [[Civil War]].
- 615-620: [[Second Frontier War]].
- 624: the Express Boat Network is established.
- 979-986: [[Third Frontier War]].
- 995-1065: the Imperial Second Survey charts the system.
- 1065: the Second Survey is published. Information about the system becomes widely available.
- 1082-1084: [[Fourth Frontier War]], also known as the _False War_.
- 1107-1110: Fifth Frontier War.

### Later Historical Eras

In [[IY1118]], as part of the increased trust and cooperation between the [[Zhodani Consulate]] and the rump [[Imperium]], the Zhodani revealed that they had established a secret base on Fulacin. It was opened up and converted into a state-of-the-art interactive museum that shows the history of the Frontier Wars from the Zhodani viewpoint. It is required visiting for any student of Frontier War history, and draws tourists from all over the Marches.

The museum contains a flame sculpture memorial to the Imperial and Zhodani undercover agents who died during the Frontier War period, which officially ended when Emperor Strephon ratified the Treaty of Quar") on 000-1110.

# From [[Twilight's Peak]]

Welcome to Fulacin! Cataloged as Fulacin/Rhylanor 0203-A674120-D on the
starmaps, this world is typical of many of the backwater worlds in the Imperium.
Its 9600 kilometer diameter makes it of moderate size, while seas covering 40% of
its surface make water available, if not overly plentiful.

Fulacin's most important feature, its combination blessing and curse, is its
standard density tainted atmosphere. Widespread taint in the form of heavy metal
dust and oxides means that the atmosphere, otherwise quite ordinary, is unbreath-
able without a filter mask. The dust is a sufficient irritant that it triggers allergies
with great frequency, causes a wide variety of respiratory illnesses, and can cause
carcinoma within years of exposure. Great pains are necessary to keep food clean
and uncontaminated; filter masks can be removed only for very short periods,
such as when eating and drinking. At the same time, the presence of this metal dust
has made the world a promising location for development by MagnetoDynamics,
Inc, which holds a resource exploitation grant from the Emperor for Fulacin. The
world is an ideal location for use of the corporation's several patents dealing with
recovery of metal from atmospheric and oceanic suspension.

MagnetoDynamics is responsible for the population of Fulacin; local inhabitants
are all employees of the corporation, dependents, or local contractors. Local
government is entirely in the hands of the corporation, which enforces reasonable
regulations for the protection of its exploitation grant and of the locals.

The MagnetoDynamics patents are high technology items, and the overall tech
level for the corporation and its settlement at the starport is D, higher than average
within the Imperium.

FULACIN STARPORT
Perhaps most puzzling, and most interesting, about Fulacin is its class A star-
port, complete with ship construction and repair facilities, a Travellers' Aid Society
hostel, and overhaul equipment, all so far from the established trade lanes. The
answer, unsurprisingly, is money. Poor economic conditions almost forced the
company to bankruptcy following the Fourth Frontier War (1082 to 1084) and at
the first signs of recovery, the company diversified its operations by building the
starport, which opened in 1099. While ultimately the starport will support mineral
export traffic, it has an interim purpose of supporting (through landing fees and
other income) the company's on-going survey of the world as ultimate exploitation
is carefully planned.
The starport is a profitable operation for two reasons:
First, Fulacin has no gas giant, and all refuelling must be performed on the
planet. Since the company has an exploitation grant for the world, refuelling from
the oceans is an infringement. The starport has a monopoly on fuel sales.
Second, Fulacin is on the Spinward Main. Jump-1 ships regularly call at Fulacin
on their way to other worlds throughout the Marches. The total cash flow is not
excessive, but it does help to support the company's other operations.

overlying other terrain
types. Ice does not affect
speed directly, but does call for a DM
of +6 on the event tables. For example,
ice plus mountain makes all rolls on the
mountain table results of 7 to 12.

Notes: Rolls are with one die. Roll
on the event tables once per terrain hex.
Speeds: Time per hex assumes an
ATV with a cruising speed in plain
terrain of 100kph. Each hex is about
850 km across. An air/raft would spend
about 8 hours per hex (except moun-
tain: about 16 hours/hex).

TERRAIN EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERS
Once the group begins its travels on Fulacin, they must necessarily pass through
several hexes of the world as they search for the octagon. A variety of events may
be called for by the events tables; the following descriptions apply to those events.
Most of these events are written in terms of their effect on ATVs. Those using
aircraft or air/rafts will generally be unaffected unless explicitly stated.

1. Animal Encounter. Occurs in all types of terrain. Movement catches the eye

of one of your group. The group has encountered one or more animals. Refer to
the animal encounter tables and roll for the specific type of animal present.
2. Blizzard. Occurs in plain and mountain terrain. A winter storm is brewing.
Severe winds and precipitation begin, making visibility near zero and movement im-
possible. The storm continues for 1D days, with only occasional reductions in
force. ATVs must stop and may not continue until the storm abates. Air/rafts
roll 8+ to avoid the storm, turning back into the previous hex; otherwise, they
are grounded and must spend the time on the surface. After a blizzard, treat the
hex as deep snow for at least a week.
3. Chasm. Occurs in mountain terrain. A deep chasm splits the mountains.
Throw 10+ once per hour to find a suitable path for an ATV down in to it allowing
continued progress; otherwise, the party must turn back to the previous hex.
Air/rafts may disregard this requirement.
4. Concealed Gully. Occurs in plain terrain. Snow has drifted smooth in front of
the group and conceals a deep gully. Throw 2D for the effects of the impact (if in
surface vehicle). DM: - ATV skill, DM -2 if moving slower than standard speed for
this terrain. Less than 6 has no effect other than a severe jolt. Results of 7, 8, or
9 indicate that the vehicle has sustained minor damage and will require 30 minutes
repair work (to be performed within the hour). A result of 10 or more requires
that the vehicle stop immediately and will take eight hours to repair.
5. Deep Snow. Occurs in plain, ice-covered ocean, and mountain terrain. Very
deep snow covers the ground in all directions. Ground vehicle speed must be
reduced to half; time in the hex is doubled.
6. Fog. Occurs in ocean and ice-covered ocean terrain. Fog obscures vision in all
directions. Throw two dice: on 7-, the fog disappears within an hour; on 8 to 10,
the fog disappears within six hours; on 11+, the fog remains for the entire day.
Forward ground progress is virtually impossible in fog; air travel requires a reduc-
tion in speed to half.
7. Forest. Occurs in plain and mountain terrain. A dark green forest appears
before the vehicle. Throw two dice: on 6 or less, the forest is a tangled morass
of trees and vegetation and is impassible; it must be detoured around at an addi-
tional ten hour cost. On 7 or more, the forest is reasonably clear, and can be
driven through. Throw for animal encounter while in the forest.
8. Ice Bergs. Occurs in ocean terrain. Ice bergs are sighted. The group should stay
clear of ice bergs. Moving near one may cause it to shift, toppling over onto a
vehicle, or perhaps lifting the vehicle out of the water. Such a berg will shift natur-
ally every 1D days.
9. Impassible. Occurs in mountain terrain. The way ahead is completely blocked
and cannot be negotiated by a surface vehicle. The group must backtrack to the
previous hex and try another path.
10. Marsh. Occurs in wetland terrain. This area is water-soaked and low, with

much vegetation and many trees growing in it. Marsh impedes surface travel,
reducing it to 36 hours/hex.

11. Oasis. Occurs in desert terrain. A patch of green is ahead of the group on the

horizon. The oasis is a source of water and shade for the group. Throw two dice: on
10+, the oasis is dying, with very little water; on 9 exactly, it is brackish, with
contaminated or poison water; on 8 or less, it has plentiful water.
12. Quicksand. Occurs in wetlands terrain. The vehicle has become mired in
mud. This mud is actually quicksand to a depth of nearly three meters. Persons
leaving an ATV to work on freeing it will be trapped and sucked down unless
fastened to the vehicle with ropes. Throw dexterity to avoid being trapped other-
wise; DM + survival skill.
13. Rockslide. Occurs in mountain terrain. The path ahead is blocked by an
accumulation of rocks at about a 40 degree angle. Pushing past this blockage will
require excellent driving ability and a good vehicle, (throw 10+ to succeed; DM +
ATV skill) or the vehicle will be disabled for 1D days while it is repaired. Or, the
way can be cleared by hand (some mechanical and vehicular help) with a delay of
1D times 8 hours.
14. Rough Valleys and Canyons. Occurs in desert terrain. Precipitous river
canyons cut the desert here. Moving through this area on the surface will require at
least triple normal time.
15. Sand Sea. Occurs in desert terrain. This portion of the desert is loose, shif-
ting sand. Ground vehicle progress is reduced to 18 hours per hex.
16. Sand Storm. Occurs in desert terrain. A storm has begun, and is whipping
small bits of sand to high speeds. This storm will last for 1D time 8 hours and make
forward progress by surface or air impossible. In addition, individuals must protect
themselves from the sting of the sand and the danger to their eyes.
17. Sargasso. Occurs in ocean terrain. Dense vegetation covers the surface of the
ocean. A vehicle afloat in the ocean will become entangled in this seaweed: throw
six dice for the degree of entanglement. One person can remove one point of
entanglement per hour in clear weather (maximum of three persons topside on an
ATV or it will capsize). Throw 10+ per hour for rough weather which will force a
halt to untangling, last two hours, and add 1D points of entanglement.
18. Shallows. Occurs in ocean terrain. This part of the sea is very shallow, never
more than a meter deep, and quite flat. An ATV can proceed using its wheels or
tracks to make good time: half normal transit times.
19. Storm. Occurs in plain, wetland, ice-covered ocean, and mountain terrain.
A severe rainstorm has begun. The storm will last for 1D time eight hours, during
which time no forward progress is possible. In the following three days, plain,
wetland, and mountain terrain will be muddy, with speeds of surface vehicles
reduced to half.
20. Sea Storm. Occurs in ocean terrain. A strong storm (lasting 1D times eight
hours), accompanied by high winds and rain, makes any air/raft or aircraft turn
back to the previous hex. Any surface vessel or vehicle is tossed by wind and wave.
No forward progress is made in the period of the storm. Each person must throw
endurance or less to save against seasickness which will disable the individual for the
remainder of the storm plus six hours.
21. Thin Ice. Occurs in ice-covered ocean terrain. The ice ahead is too thin to
support a vehicle. The group must detour, adding five hours to time in the hex.

## Animal Encounters

Fulacin is a large, unexplored world, and its plains and deserts abound in wild-
life. These animals come in all sizes and types, and may be found in all parts of the
world.

### ENCOUNTERS

When directed by the events table, roll on the animal encounter table for the
correct type of terrain in order to determine the type of animals involved. Assume
that the adventurers do not have surprise if they are in their vehicle; if on foot, roll
for surprise normally.

Reactions: The final column of the tables contains codes for animal reactions.
An is the throw on which the animal will attack (thus A4 means it will attack on
4+). Fn is the throw on which the animal will flee. Sn is the animal speed. Throw
An and Fn in the order shown on the table.

Several Tables Provided: One animal encounter table is provided for each of the
primary terrain types— ice cap, desert, plain, wetland, mountain, and ocean. Use
the appropriate terrain table.

#### THE ANIMALS

All animals on Fulacin are native to the world (or were transported here long
enough ago to adapt to its tainted atmosphere). As a result, all are contaminated by
its heavy metal concentrations and are inedible. Hunting, except for protection or
trophies, is probably not called for.

The following animals on the encounter tables are of special interest.

![[TwlP-048.jpg|100]]
[[TwlP-048.jpg|Snowcat]]

Snowcat: The name snowcat is common throughout human space; it seems that
any vaguely feline pouncer which shows any
affinity to snow and cold is called a snowcat,
much as arctic hunters are called polar bears.
Averaging 100 kilograms each, snowcats con-
gregate in prides or packs of three (rarely
more) and hunt together for their food. They
are typical pouncers in that they lie in ambush
and attack with a burst of speed; striking from
concealment, and waiting until at close or
medium range, the strongest of the group
pounces first, with each of the remaining two snowcats in the pride striking at
about one minute intervals.
The snowcat is well-camouflaged; its dark coat with vertical light stripes serves to
conceal it in tall grass, rocky outcroppings, and even in shadows on snowfields
(allows DM +2 on surprise rolls).
Snowcats are most commonly found in the mountain and ice cap regions of
Fulacin, where they make their lairs and hunt the shaggy groats of the hills. Less
frequently, they are also found in other regions, especially the plains and deserts
where they are in pursuit of migrating groat herds.

![[TwlP-050.jpg|100]]
[[TwlP-050.jpg|Groat]]

Groat: This grazer is a native of the mountain regions of Fulacin and lives
most of its life in large herds grazing on upper moun-
tain fields. Relatively innocuous as individuals, the
groat in a herd is a dangerous encounter, as the
animals find strength in numbers and will attack
almost any perceived danger.
The shaggy groat hair is the most obvious resource
the animals can provide. At first, it appears ordinary
hair, but once cleaned and groomed, it has a softness
and silkiness which rivals the finest synthetic. In
addition, the high concentration of heavy metals in
the strands provides a two-fold advantage. First, the
hair is proof against most insects and mildew; the
fibers are poisonous to most off-world pests. Second, a simple chemical treatment
can bring out an iridescent shimmering quality which is quite attractive.
Groats as individuals are quite capable of defending themselves. Their three-toed
feet give them splendid footing on the rocky outcroppings of the mountains; in
desert (especially sandy desert) these hooves are a disadvantage, and reduce their
speed by half. They fight defensively with their teeth and hooves (hooves-1).
Finally, they have a secret weapon. Concealed under the tail is a small gland which
can expel a noxious fluid to a distance of nearly three meters. Somewhat like tear
gas, it makes an enemy or attacker concentrate on getting away rather than contin-
uing the attack. Strangely, the fluid seems to work on anything except snowcats. A
human who is sprayed with this fluid will be unwelcome company to any com-
panions for at least a day, and will be required to take great efforts to remove the
smell (baths, keep in a vacc suit for hours, physical separation).
The groats are also subject to a migration instinct. At irregular times, herds of
groats make a long migration from their mountain meadows to some specific oasis
in the desert for mating and for the old ones to die. After combat between the
older males to determine the new leaders within the herd, the groats then return the
way they came to spend the rest of the year in the mountains.

CLIMATE
The weather on Fulacin depends on latitude and terrain. It is unremarkable and
requires little attention from the referee. Obviously, it is cold in polar areas and hot
in deserts. In addition, the following factors should be considered.
Mountains: Mountains are routinely swept by storms (throw 8+ for a storm)
which will stop all air travel and reduce surface travel to one quarter. Throw 8+ for
a snowstorm lasting 1 D days; otherwise it is rain lasting 1D hours.
Deserts: The equatorial regions of Fulacin are desert, hot and dry. Air travel over
them is usually routine, but throw 11+ for a turbulent updraft which will then
ground the craft (throw 8+ to avoid; DM of operator skill). Repairs will take 3 to
18 hours of hard work. Surface vehicles are subject to overheating and to damage
from dust and sand.
Oceans: Oceans present a hazard from weather because storms at sea can bring
down even the best of aircraft. Throw 10+ daily for a storm which may crash the
craft (on 8+; DM of operator skill). Surface craft caught in a storm are subject to
random directional movement (being blown off course) from the storm.

Animal Encounter Tables: The six tables on these two pages provide animal
encounters for all of the terrain shown on the Fulacin map. Throws are modified
based on the latitude regions (polar, mid-latitudes, and equatorial) and terrain type.
