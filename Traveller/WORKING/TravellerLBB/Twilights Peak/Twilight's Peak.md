# Introduction

This booklet is a comprehensive adventure for Traveller entitled Twilight's Peak.
Set in the Spinward Marches, it deals with a search for the remains of a military
expedition lost on a mission over a century ago.

It is assumed that this adventure will be administered by
a referee who has read through this booklet, and who is
familiar with both it and the rules for Traveller. The Twi-
light's Peak situation requires several of the Traveller
materials: the basic Traveller booklets (Books 1, 2, and 3) and Mercenary (Book4)
for its advanced weaponry. If players wish to generate Droyne characters as ex-
plained in the last section of this booklet. High Guard (Book 6) and Citizens of the
Imperium (Supplement 4) will be needed to explain some of the skills. A variety of
other Traveller materials are desirable, but not required; if you have them, they can
be used to enhance specific parts of the adventure. Spinward Marches (Supplement 3) provides starmaps of the area in which this adventure takes place; they supplement the starmap given in this adventure. 7007 Characters (Supplement 1) provides
pregenerated non-player characters for encounters. Snapshot (Game 2) or Azhanti
High Lightning (Game 3) provide game rules for precise resolution of personal
combat on a square grid; if the ultimate combat sequences in this adventure are to
be fought out in detail, either of these two games may prove useful.

(\w)(.*)\n(\w)(\s*)

As usual, paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and square-grid graph paper will prove
necessary during the course of the adventure.

To The Referee: This adventure is set in the Spinward Marches, the same back-
ground used for previous Traveller adventures and double adventures, and a consis-
tent setting for most of the published Traveller materials. In addition, this adven-
ture contains a set of pre-generated characters for use by the players. As such,
this entire adventure is self-contained and can be played without an on-going
Traveller campaign being in the hands of the referee. There are two additional
considerations which should be addressed.

First, this adventure can be altered or modified for use by any referee in his
or her own on-going Traveller campaign. Changes in the starmaps and to some of
the backgrounds may be necessary, but any good referee should have no trouble
taking care of these details. Further, characters from such a campaign can easily
be used in this adventure in place of the pre-generated ones.

Second, this adventure is itself an extension of two previously published
Traveller adventures— Research Station Gamma (Adventure 2), and Shadows (part
of Double Adventure 1). If the players to be involved in this situation have not
played either of these items, the referee may consider playing several sessions with
them before beginning Twilight's Peak. Alternatively, the characters may begin with
the Twilight's Peak situation and encounter Research Station Gamma and Shadows
along the way.

Be sure to read this adventure through completely and to be familiar with
its contents before beginning the situation. You won't understand what's going on
until you read the sections on the Octagon Society, the epic, and the referee's notes.


Requires Basic Traveller and Mercenary.

## CHARACTERS

This adventure is intended for a band of adventurers numbering at least two and
no more than eight. A group of pre-generated characters is supplied below.

A skill level of 0 has been assigned to show some familiarity with a skill sufficient for use but without conferring real expertise. Thus, vacc-0 allows a person to use a vacc suit but not to perform dangerous stunts in it.

## EQUIPMENT

Characters should review their equipment, and may purchase more. However,
it is essential that one of the characters be the merchant captain (character number 1), because he provides the Empress Nicholle, a 200-ton type A2 far trader
which serves as transport for the adventurers. Its ship's locker contains the
equipment shown in the table. No addi-
tional equipment is available at the
moment, although some may become
available in the course of the adventure.

## The Empress Nicholle

The starship
owned by the merchant captain is a
type A2 far trader, 200 tons, now fifty
years old and finally without a mort-
gage. It has six staterooms (one for the
captain, and one each for the three passengers; double occupancy for the rest of the
crew) and four low berths; cargo capacity is 61 tons. The ship is streamlined, and
can refuel by skimming gas giants or drawing water from planetary oceans. Arma-
ment consists of one triple turret fitted with a heterogeneous mix— one missile
rack, one beam laser, and one sandcaster. The ship carries an air/raft in a fitted hull
compartment. It is fuelled, provisioned, and ready to go.


### SHIP'S LOCKER
eight vacc suits, each with oxygen
tanks for eight hours and
medium range commo gear.
four shotguns, each with ten loaded
magazines (100 rounds).
two automatic pistols, each with
ten loaded magazines (150 rds).
four cutlasses, each with a
belt scabbard.
one long range communicator.


# Crew Briefing

The place is Regina Starport, on Regina, in Regina subsector. The far trader
Empress Nicholle has just returned from a trading charter through the coreward
parts of the subsector, and is now unloading its cargo of trade goods to the local
broker. This is a time for the crew to hold a ship's meeting and decide just where
the vessel should go next in its trading travels.

The Spinward Main: Meandering throughout the Spinward Marches is an in-
formal trade route called the Spinward Main. This Main is a line (actually several
lines, with branches) of worlds each only jump-1 from the next. The result is that
long, often profitable trading journeys are possible even for lowly jump-1 ships.
From Regina, the Main extends coreward, into the subsector. It also extends
spinward, beyond the Imperial borders, ultimately to Querion subsector and
the Zhodani Consulate. Both of these options seem less than optimal— the first
because the ship has just returned from the interior of the subsector, and the
second because of growing hostilities between the Imperium and the Zhodani. The
best course would seem to be a trading mission back towards the Rhylanor sub-
sector.

## PROFITS TO BE MADE!

The Empress Nicholle is paid off, but it still costs quite a lot to run. That was
the reason why the ship took a charter into the Regina subsector— to make some
money. Its coffers now hold 040,000 to buy goods for resale. With that money,
and a little luck, the ship should be able to buy low and sell high, and maybe come
out with a profit for everyone concerned.

The free trader has a cargo hold for 61 tons of goods, and has no room for
any more passengers (except in low passage). This relatively small cargo capacity is
dictated by the fact that the ship is capable of jump-2, and thus has larger drives
and more fuel tankage than the ordinary type A free trader.

Unfortunately, the Empress Nicholle has a problem. It is old, and its drives are
not working properly. Rated at jump-2, they have
not been able to make better than jump-1 for over
a year. This is one reason why a trading mission on
the Spinward Main looks so attractive: the route is
jump-1 all the way. Repairing the drive to make
jump-2 is going to require a complete replacement
of most of the insides of the jump mechanism, at a
class A starport at a cost of about Cr3,500,000.
Overhead: The costs of running even a paid-off
starship are (literally) astronomical. They include
fuel, life support, salaries, maintenance, and
berthing costs. On this mission, the ship will be able to cut some costs, but will have
to plan on paying others. Assuming salaries are cut to about Cr1000 (see shares,
below) and the ship gets fuel from skimming gas giants, the cost for each jump (and
a one week stay on the world looking for trade goods) will be about Cr15,400,
which figure represents a minimum cost for two weeks travel.

Computation of the Cr15,400 figure assumes Cr12,400 per trip for life support,
and includes food, fresh rations, minor repairs at starports, tuning of various
equipment, and other sundries. The cost may vary, but averages out to Cr12,
per trip; if it isn't paid on one trip, it would have to be paid on the next (in addi-
tion to current costs) to make up for depletion of the ship's equipment and stores.
Cr2,000 is to be saved every two weeks in anticipation of overhaul costs at the end
of the year. Although a prudent captain will not touch this money, it does accu-
mulate, and can be used in an emergency for speculation in trade goods, or for
emergency costs. Berthing fees average O100 per starport. Salaries are pegged at
O900 for the entire crew. A complete discussion of overhead costs is presented in
Traveller, Book 2.

Shares: Once overhead costs are paid and the initial money put into buying
trade goods is recovered, the remainder is profit to be distributed to the captain and
and owner, and to some of the crew. In this case, there are 100 shares. Sixty go
to the owner. The remaining forty may be divided up in any equitable manner,
so long as all agree.

The proceeds of the shares must be distributed periodically by paying each
shareholder his or her due. After determining an appropriate amount to remain in
the fund, the remainder is distributed to each individual in accordance with the
shares held. The shareholders may decide to establish a time when the fund is split
up, or may vote to do so.

In return for shares, all of the crew must agree to smaller salaries. The overhead
computations assume that each will accept Cr100 per two weeks as salary, plus
any income that shares provide. It is assumed that the three passengers will be
offered jobs on the ship, and that the captain draws the extra Cr100 as captain.

## TRAVELLING

The ship is capable of jump-1 (one parsec; one hex on the starmap) and requires
refuelling with 60 tons of fuel between each jump (remember, the jump drive is
supposedly capable of jump-2, but doesn't work right; it has a high fuel con-
sumption too). Jump takes one week, during which time the ship has no contact
with any other ship or world. At the end of the week, the ship emerges in the new
system, and must move to the world and starport within the system.

Refuelling can take place at the gas giant (if the system has one), or in an ocean
on the world (if the world has a hydrographic percentage of at least 1, and a law
level of less than 8). Otherwise, the refuelling must take place at a starport, and fuel
will cost Cr100 per ton (unrefined).

Travel from the jump point to the world takes about a day. A starship encounter
(Traveller, Book 2, page 36) should be rolled at this time. The remaining time of
five days in system are used for routine maintenance, selling trade goods, buying
new goods, finding cargos and passengers, and general touring.

Crew members in port will also encounter rumors and gossip which may lead
them to cheap trade goods or to possible adventures.

Situations may also lead the characters to leave their ship locked at a starport for
some period of time and to travel abroad on a world in search of adventure and
riches. A ship left in such a situation costs Cr100 per week for storage and guard
fees, but has no other costs.


# The Spinward Main

# Rumors

The rumor is ultimately the source of all information for adventurers. Once they
have been pushed by a rumor, they may look longer and harder in that direction
and thus be moved closer to their goal. But without the initial impetus of the rumor
the adventurers will find they have little reason for adventuring.

Rumors have three basic purposes: to direct the characters toward profitable
endeavor, to misdirect the characters away from profitable endeavor, and to assist
them after they have established a goal for themselves. For example, a specific
clue may be utterly incomprehensible to the adventurers when they first find it.

Later, they may come upon a situation where the clue's information fits perfectly,
and finally the rumor's true nature comes to light.
Rumors in this adventure are of two distinct types: mandatory rumors and
world rumors.

## MANDATORY RUMORS

Mandatory rumors are essential to the adventure. As such, they must be pro-
vided to the adventurers without regard to chance or mischance. There are two
mandatory rumors— Twilight's Peak and the Octagon Book. Twilight's Peak should
be the first or second rumor received by the adventurers, regardless of other events.

The ideal setting for the Twilight's Peak rumor is in a starman's bar on Regina
the night before the ship leaves on its trading mission.

The Octagon Book should be provided later in the adventure; ideally much later,
after the ship has visited most of the worlds on the Spinward Main. Because of the
importance of these two rumors, their receipt should be a matter of some impor-
tance, and the situation should be handled to make the rumor seem casual, but
potentially of great interest.

Twilight's Peak. In a starport tavern, the group can hear an argument in the
far corner of the room. The noise of the inn is loud enough to make hearing diffi-
cult, but the argument continues. One man (a scout) insists that there really was a
Twilight's Peak, and the epic was true; the other (a navy starman) has taken the
opposite view, and says that it was all the rantings of a drug-crazed scout. After
several minutes, the two spontaneously decide that while logic may not convince
the other, perhaps fists might. The tavern's bouncer ejects the two, and the room
is not quite as loud as it was. Referee: Ideal methods of following this information
up include library data (for a broad overview of the subject), following and talking
to the scout, and finding a copy of this epic (it isn't in the ship's library data;
it would probably be found only in a library at a class A starport).

The Octagon Book. While casually touring the area on the edge of the starport,
(perhaps looking for a bar), one of the group sees a bookshop. If any decide to
go in, they will find shelf after shelf of old, hard-bound books in various states
of decay. After browsing for some time, one of the group finds a water-stained
and worn volume marked with an octagon on the binding. Price: Cr30.

The book is a detailed history of the Octagon Society, produced some centuries
after the demise of the society. It covers, in great detail, the various octagonal
shaped buildings which the society erected for the comfort and safety of distressed
space-farers throughout the Regina, Lanth, and Rhylanor subsectors. Referee: The
Octagon Book is full of interesting information, of which a digest is presented in
the Octagon Book section.


## WORLD RUMORS
As each new world along (or near) the Spinward Main is encountered, the group
of adventurers should be seeking new information and rumors. The following
rumors and events are to be encountered by the travellers as they move to each new
world. The referee should take pains to inflict or impose these rumors on the
players in the correct setting— carefully building a situation before revealing the
information to them.

Algine/Regina (0803-X766977-4). This world is interdicted. A naval task force
(perhaps a Kinunir class battlecruiser and several Gazelle class close escorts) will not
allow landing on Algine and are uncommunicative as to the reason for the inter-
diction. They will allow refuelling by skimming the local gas giant.

Celepina/Rhylanor (0610-B434456-8). Soon after landing, a local starport
employee comments on the Shivva class patrol frigate in orbit above. Its gun
muzzles are sealed and the ship is on a diplomatic mission carrying a Zhodani
representative to Rhylanor. The locals here still hold memories of the False War and
wish the ship on its way real soon.

Dhian/Aramis (0706-C9A769D-4). Oberlindes Lines has just opened a new
shipping and passenger facility on Dhian. Now Tukera Lines is scrambling to open a
rival shipping office.

Dinom/Lanth (0201-D100535-A). There is a revolution taking place at the
moment, with each of the three cities on Dinom isolated from the others.
Dinomn/Lanth (0202-B674632-3). A visit to the scout base here produces the
information that Djinni is interdicted, but that a rudimentary starport is being
established. The scout base has a shipment (20 tons; crates of radio responders) for
the starport-under-construction ready to go at standard rates (Cr1000 per ton per
jump). Deliver to Aleem Vren.

Djinni/Lanth (0403-E459000-0). This world is interdicted; an automatic beacon
says so when the ship arrives insystem. Aleem Vren is on a large island on the
equator managing a team of construction robots. He insists that the group leave
immediately (unless they have brought cargo from Dinomn). If approached correct-
ly, he indicates an octagon structure out on one of the islands near here. But
it is only a rough foundation, long since broken and crumbled by the storms.

Echiste/Lanth (0306-C53A313-A). A large scout xboat facility is under con-
struction with an expected completion date of sometime in the coming year. It
is intended that xboat links be established from Risek to Echiste to Yori to Regina,
cutting three weeks off the long-range communication time to the core and opening
up this part of the Spinward Main to commercial and business operations.

Fulacin/Rhylanor (0408-A674210-D). An official of MagnetoDynamics, Inc (the
owning corporation of the world) is extremely helpful, answering questions and
giving helpful hints about finding octagon buildings— on other worlds. He knows of
none here. When pressed, he will give (reluctantly) a restricted license to look on
Fulacin; with a provision that there be no prospecting.


Gileden/Rhylanor (0308 C483103-5). There is no one here. That is, the starport
is poorly manned and ill-attended, and no one seems to know anything of any
interest. The starport bar even serves an overly expensive bad whiskey.

Hefry/Regina (0501-C200423-7). Hefry holds the scout district administrative
headquarters for Regina. A scout (active or retired) can look through old records
for clues— and find that the recovery of the Blatant Lie at Treece/Lanth cleared the
books on the Gyro Cadiz task force. The assumption is that the crash was in the
Rhylanor subsector— probably Gileden, Fulacin, or Kinorb. More remotely possible
sites are Tureded and Valhalla. Incidentally, berthing fees for Hefry are Cr 1000
rather than Cr 100.

Henoz/Rhylanor (0710-A245543-B). There is an octagon set back in the moun-
tains and used as a hunting lodge sometimes. The octagon building is identical to
the one on page 29 with the following exceptions: it is in good condition, sited in a
small valley, and it has no secret inner or subterranean passages. Locals know
something about it, and can comment that it was one of the last built by the
Octagon Society before they dissolved.

Inthe/Regina (0605-B575776-9). The naval base has records of the discovery of
the Blatant Lie at Treece in 1084. These records should be available to anyone (a
naval character, active or retired, will get them faster, however). A drive analysis of
the small scout indicated that it had misjumped; it could have come from any world ;
within four parsecs of Treece.

Jae Tellona/Rhylanor (0410-A560565-8). Arriving in system, a naval system
defense boat hails the ship and boards for a complete inspection of cargo and crew.
This severe records check will turn up any irregularities on 9+; if it does, then a
naval pilot is put aboard and the ship is sent to Jae Tellona. Irregularities call for a
Cr100,000 fine and confiscation of cargo.

Jenghe/Regina (0301-C799663-9). The major starman's bar on Jenghe, just
outside the gate of the starport, is the Planetfall Liberty, on the ground floor of a
large octagonal-shaped building. This octagon covers the whole block and also
houses offices and apartments.

The bartender at the Planetfall Liberty will discuss the building and its history
as long as the group continues to buy drinks. This octagon was once a distressed
spacefarer's shelter, built and operated by the Octagon Society. They built big
ones like these on the major worlds (there used to be one on Regina; there still
are ones on Feri and Wochiers) and smaller frontier shelters on the other worlds of
this end of the Marches. They once had plans to build shelters all through the
Imperium, but the society fell on hard times and dissolved about three hundred
years ago).

Keanou/Lanth (0506-C790348-7). This desert world is a source of dust-spice, a
powerful seasoning with mild euphoric properties. Rarely, however, is this spice
available in quantity. Just today, a local broker has posted four kilograms of the
spice for sale at Cr5,000 per kilo and is taking bids over that amount. An Asian
trading mission will bid against the group (to a maximum of 2D times Cr1,000).
Dust-spice can be sold at Rhylanor, Regina, Roup, Zivije, or Rethe for Cr10,
per kilogram (plus 2D times Cr1,000).

If the group is successful in bidding, the Asian trading mission will then attempt
to buy it outright for what was paid for it plus Cr5,000.
Kinorb/Rhylanor (0507-C449433-9). A local merchant has for sale a small set of
disk-like coins of unknown origin. He says they are good-luck charms produced
by the Asian and that they come from clear across the Imperium. Each of the six he
offers has a different figure engraved on it, including an aslan leader, a flame,
a human, a cloud, an ice crystal, and a sine wave. They appear to be old, and
fashioned of aluminum with a gold-colored wash. The merchant wants Cr600 each,
or Cr3,000 for the set of six.

KKirka/Lanth (0305-CAA5345-8). This world is a mining community con-
cerned with extracting rare earths from the mountain ranges. One miner does
remember staying the winter in an octagon shelter some years ago. He can give
directions to it (for a small price).

Macene/Rhylanor (0508-B000453-E). Oberlindes Lines has taken on the mono-
poly held by Tukera Lines, and is now shipping locally produced ore to Risek at
10% less. Local feeling is that its about time that someone paid attention to the
needs of the miners here at Macene.

Paya/Aramis (0805-A655241-9). An octagon shelter used to be situated on
a small hill just north of the starport. It was torn down some years ago when this
starport was built. Indeed, Paya had no starport until 980, when Tukera Lines
guaranteed runs through Paya and some Regina investors put up the money for
the construction.

Pirema/Lanth (0206-D691142-5). The starport at Pirema is fully automated
(which isn't saying much, because the starport does little more than run a con-
tinuous beacon and furnish radio directions to the local sea for refuelling) and there
are no people in sight. Looking for more than a week will finally turn up a local
miner who evasively reveals that he has seen an octagon off in the mountains. He
will sell the location for Cr500.

Porozlo/Rhylanor (0310-A867A74-A). Talking about the Twilight's Peak and its
history will result in the name of a person who might know something. He turns
out to be a local naval historian who has researched the matter of the Gyro Cadiz
task force in some depth. He believes that the mutineers were actually Zhodani
agents. At least, he believes Zhodani agents supplied the forged identifications and
papers which got the group into the task force. Further, he believes that, after the
task force called at Porozlo, it proceeded to Fulacin and that the ships crashed
there. He has long pages of proof of his theory, but no one has ever found the ships.

Rech/Lanth (0304-D9957AA-6). Rech is an agricultural world known for its
smoked meats and fine leathers. There simultaneously with the adventurers is a
Vargr trading mission buying meat for shipment back to the Vargr Extents. They
seem very stand-offish, only speaking to someone with streetwise or liaison.
If they do engage in conversation, one of them will mention an octagon shelter
back in their home territory (40 parsecs to coreward), built by the Octagon Society
for distressed spacefarers.

Regina/Regina (0401-A788899-A). Initially, the Twilight's Peak anecdote should
be imposed as a mandatory rumor. On a second arrival at Regina, the group finds a
talkative person who seems knowledgeable about the Octagon Society. He isn't
really, but he does know that they still have a branch on Wochiers and it is still
operational.

Rethe/Regina (0804-E230AA8-8). It is Festival on Rethe and the local law level
has been reduced to zero for the next six days. The world is temporarily classified
as amber until the end of the festivities.



Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0210 A434934-F). The local starport authority has com-
plete records, including a flight plan filed by the Gyro Cadiz task force— some-
thing not in the records elsewhere. The group planned its flight to be Rhylanor

- Porozlo - Deep Space - Fulacin - Deep Space - Kinorb - Deep Space - Echiste -
    KKirka (without refuelling) - Rech - Djinni - Deep Space - Regina.
       Risek/Rhylanor (0608-A325579-A). The Octagon Society built its shelter in the
    Risek system in orbit— in the form of an octahedral space station orbiting Risek.
The station is still in existence, although now under the management of the Risek
Space Authority. Checking out the station will provide pictures of three octagon
shelters along with precise location data for Fulacin, Gileden, and Kinorb.

Roup/Regina (0701-C77A9A9-6). No rumor.

Treece/Lanth (0505-D232866-8). Treece is a system without a gas giant. Land-
ing on the world will turn up little information concerning the discovery of the
Blatant Lie. However, the local broker has 15 tons of very good local liquor, at
Cr6,000 per ton. It should bring at least Cr12,000 per ton at Inthe or Dhian.

  Tureded/Lanth (0207-C465540-9). There are four starports at Tureded, situated
equidistant along the equator. Each has full facilities for a class C starport; one of
the starports also has an octagon shelter now serving as a bar for spacers. This
octagon is identical to the one on page 29, but converted to a tavern.

Valhalla/Rhylanor (0709-E365432-5). No rumor.

Vreibefger/Lanth (0108-E481542-2). In 874 the Imperium purchased the assets
of the Octagon Society on Vreibefger and converted the grounds of the local shelter
to an Imperial Research Station which is currently engaged in stock breeding
experiments as part of a long range project to improve several of the meat pro-
ducing animals of the Imperium. The octagon remains as a small part of the grounds
today and is used for storage.

Wochiers/Regina (0802-EAC28CC-9). At the Octagon Society's height, it was
headquartered on Regina. When the society collapsed, the headquarters and most
branches were dissolved. Wochiers, however, has a continuing need for just the
service that the society provides; the planetary atmosphere makes local surface
travel difficult and dangerous. As a result, the Octagon Society still exists and is
functional on Wochiers. All records of the society have been transferred to Wochiers
from the dissolved branches, and it is now concerned entirely with local affairs.
There is a museum and archives which can make a great deal of information avail-
able, at a research fee of Cr100 per day. Throw 9+ per day for success; success will
make all of the data on the Octagon Book available.

Wypoc/Lanth (0303-E9C4547-C). Wypoc has an insidious atmosphere; the local
inhabitants live in domed cities and rarely venture outside. Recently, however, the
military (Imperial Marines) has been testing protective suits which will enable
personnel to operate in the insidious atmosphere for long periods. There is a large
Marine contingent on the world and the local economy is doing quite well.
There is some mention that the Marines have been here longer than one would
think necessary to just test vacc suits; and none of the suits are being made available
to locals.

Yori/Regina (0503-C360757-D). The local Imperial Research Station is engaged
in long-range communications work.

Yurst/Regina (0704-E7B4643-5). No rumor.

Zivije/Rhylanor (0609-C6B199C-B). No rumor.


# World Data: Fulacin


See [[Fulacin]]


# Twilight's Peak

The ultimate goal of adventurers on Fulacin is the wreck of the Gyro Cadiz and
the Octagon tower, supposedly the present site of the cargo from the wrecked
ships.

Searching: The referee should select a specific mountain hex on the Fulacin map
and note it as the site of the octagon tower. Another site about three hexes away
should be noted as the crash site of the Carlisle. These locations should be kept
secret from the adventurers.

Before beginning a meticulous search, the adventurers may ask for an orbital
survey from the starport or from MagnetoDynamics, or they may conduct one of
their own. Such a survey will produce indications of metal enough that several will
be promising leads. The referee should specify those locations as likely ones on the
map (they should number between 3 and 10 and all must be in mountain hexes; the
true locations should be included).

Trip times in various hexes are given on the event tables; such times cover a
simple transit through the hex, not a detailed search. In order to search a hex,
the group must spend time in periods equal to the transit time through the hex.
For each such period of time, one roll for success in the search is permitted: throw
12+ for success. DMs are allowed. For each period in the hex searching, DM +1. If
searching by air, DM +1. If storm or blizzard, -6. Of course, the object of the search
must be present for the search to be a success.

Adventurers must remember to stop for food, rest, sleep, and recreation from
time to time. Penalize those who do not with extreme negative DMs as well as
chances for mishap or accident.

In addition, for each period spent in a hex in search, throw for an event. If the
event is chasm, allow a DM on search of +2. In any event, if the search is successful,
impose an event of chasm, and then proceed to the search for a way to the bottom
of the chasm. It should produce the road, described next.

## THE ROAD

Winding up the side of the mountain valley is a small, one-lane road cutting
into the side of the sheer rock wall. In places, it nearly tunnels into the rock, and in
others it spans small crevasses with single arch bridges. All of the road is masonry,
finely cut stone set neatly into place.

Weathering has taken its toll in the course of the years, and the road has lengths
of broken or buckled paving. Local vegetation has grown through the masonry
seams in spots. In places, nearly the entire width has been carried away by rock
slides and ice-weathering. The road is usable by an ATV to about half-way down
the mountainside; thereafter, progress must be on foot.

The Other Direction: If the group cares to investigate, it may follow the road
off in the other direction. That way, it follows the top of the chasm wall until it
joins a promontory jutting out into valley. The road then becomes a broad avenue
which, on extension, directs the eye to an octagonal building in a crag in the center
of the chasm below— the Octagon! A light is visible in the window.



Not very obviously, the rock face immediately below this observation level is
of some interest. Close examination will show that this rock is polished smooth,
and artificially; this fact is not obvious, and the rock face is cloaked in shadow
most of the time, due to its location and the surrounding mountain walls.

## THE OCTAGON

Sited on the top of a granite crag nestled in a valley, the octagon is an intriguing
structure, if only because it is incongruous in the otherwise natural setting. A light
shines brightly in the single window visible from afar. Watching for any period of
time (especially at night) will reveal shadows moving about within. Once at the
bottom of the chasm (via the road), climbing the crag is a relatively easy task,
taking about an hour on foot or several minutes by air/raft. An ATV will be unable
to make the journey, but it probably couldn't make the trip to the bottom of the
chasm anyway.

Approaching the building, the top of the peak can be seen to be covered with
a light blue-green moss, similar to ground cover previously discovered. The building
is set on a stone terrace which provides a flat base. In the approach, the rock of
the crag blends easily into the terrace.

Just before reaching the terrace itself, five cairns of rock can be seen all in
a row. These are graves, and should be recognizable as such. If not, or if they are
dug up anyway, each holds a single skeleton.

Approaching the terrace, the octagon looms large before the group, and can be
seen to be constructed from native rock, with strong ribs or columns of stone
forming the corners of the eight-sided building. The window with the light is on
the second story, and cannot be entered from ground level. Looking closer at the
building itself, a band of light-colored stone rings the structure at about head
height; carved on this band of stone is a continuous string of runes or characters
which are completely unintelligible. However, if any character has in his possession
a coyn (from Shadows, from Research Station Gamma, or even the counterfeit ones
purchased from the merchant on Kinorb), a connection may be made (perhaps
now, perhaps later) and one or more runes will match the engraving on the coyn.

The terrace leads around the building, presenting a path about two meters wide.
There is no railing or curbing on the terrace, and most people are at least a little
cautious in the presence of such a situation. Looking over the building from these
locations, it can be seen that the south side of the octagon also has a window.
There is no danger unless the terrace is slick with ice or rain (throw dexterity plus 3
to fall; DM for safety rope or other precaution). If someone does fall, the drop
from the lip of the terrace is enough to cause severe injury (2D hits).

Beyond the narrow path, the terrace again presents a large area and reveals a
single entrance to the structure. Up a small flight of three steps, a broad double
door in the center of one face of the building is closed by stout wooden doors.
Knocking gives no response; pushing on either gives some resistance, as if locked or
barred within. The doors can be forced with relative ease: any energy weapon will
burn through them, as will any explosive. Applying a combined strength of 10+ will
force the doors open; if that strength is 13 or greater, the door being pushed will
come off its hinges and clatter to the floor. An explosion will destroy the doors;
any other method of entry will show what was holding them closed: a single
skeleton slumped behind them both.

Ground Level: Once within the octagon, the building can be seen to be of at
least two stories, of which this is the ground floor. Flooring is of wood strongly
built. Above, a ceiling of timbers stands at about three meters; the center is cut out
to show a balcony above. A pale light illuminates the upper level from a source not
readily apparent. Enough light filters down through the opening to make vision
easy.

1. Entrance. Aside from the doors and the skeleton, the doorway area has one
other item of note: crude iron (rusty) brackets and a massive wooden beam.The
beam is obviously intended to bar the doorway. If it had been in place, those
doors would not have opened for anything short of an energy weapon or a heavy
explosion.
2. Fireplace. The masonry of the walls extends beyond their normal thickness
at this location to create a large fireplace with a masonry floor and vents to a
chimney.<br/>
The floor of the fireplace still has wood ash and partially-burnt logs in place,
although water drippage from the chimney vent has reduced some of the ash to
a black stain on the floor.<br/>
Cut into the masonry are toesteps leading up, while solidly fixed to the stone is a
single iron bar for a hand grip. This ladder leads upward to the second floor of the
octagon. Referee: Actually, the iron bar is not that solidly in place, and will slowly
come loose. Count the total strength points that climb the ladder, and when the
total reaches 40, the bar suddenly gives way. The person on the ladder must throw
dexterity or less to avoid a nasty fall. If unsuccessful, inflict 2D hits on the person.
Very close examination (perhaps an hour of detailed scrutiny) of the fireplace
will reveal a loose stone which can be removed to reveal a narrow shaft leading
down. It is very black and forbidding below, and the shaft mouth is covered with
webs.
3. Bedding. Scattered around this area are several sleeping bags, all in reasonably
good condition (sheltered from sunlight and weather, they have not deteriorated),
although there appear to be some small bugs crawling around in them. Additional
equipment includes a small campstove, several metal bottles of water, and some
heavy climbing rope marked with red dirt.<br/>
Markings on the equipment include the name Gyro Cadiz and IISS Blatant
Lie. Some (but not all) of the equipment is old style standard scout service issue.
4. Equipment and Crates. This area contains perhaps twenty crates (with ship-
ping numbers and addresses indicating the Regina system) containing a wide variety
of contents. Looking at just the surface boxes, contents listings indicate radiation
treatment drugs and radiation diagnostic equipment. <br/>
Looking through this group of
boxes completely will take at least two hours. Such a search will show that four
additional items are also present in crates: one crate of combat drug (1440 doses),
one crate of truth drug (1440 doses), two crates of medical literature, primarily
brochures detailing the hazards and benefits of radiation treatment drugs, and
one crate of binary glue— fourteen pairs of half-liter bottles which, when the two
parts are combined, make a strong (500 kilogram) bond. In addition, one crate
has been opened, and does not contain radiation therapy drugs; instead, it has been
used to carry a large quantity of greasy mechanical components. Someone with
engineering expertise will see that they are parts to a power plant for a starship—
the fusion regulator.


Upper Level: The second floor, pierced in its center by the open area, is con-
structed of timber beams and wood planking. The level has a very high (perhaps 7
to 10 meter) ceiling, and stone walls as on the ground level. Hanging from the
rafters are long ropes supporting wooden platforms at just about waist level: their
purpose is not immediately obvious.

5. Entry Passage. The footholds leading up come out in this location, next to
the fireplace. Close examination of the fireplace shows that the chimney vent
for this fireplace is not connected to any other vent (like the vent from the fire-
place below). The fireplace, it may be noted, is much smaller than the one on the
ground level. The masonry contains several small holes (about ten centimeters
across) scattered throughout its face. These holes, if examined, have an air flow
and may be ventilation holes.
6. Window. This window is the one visible from a distance. It is about one
meter wide, and two meters high, with the sill very close to the floor. There is a
large lantern placed on the floor near it. If the area is dark, the lantern is on and
produces a strong glow; if the area is not dark, the lantern is not on.
This lantern, marked with Imperial Navy identifications and stock numbers, is a
fusion emergency light, stands about 40cm high, and weighs about six kilograms. A
photoelectric cell activates the lamp when darkness falls unless overridden by a
switch. This type of lantern is normally functional for a maximum of three years,
much longer than this one has apparently operated. Close examination will reveal a
small (6 by 4 by 10 cm) box attached which is feeding power to the lamp.<br/>
The lantern is placed so that at least one suspended platform is between it
and the window. Slight movement of the platform will cast moving shadows
through the window and may give the appearance of someone being on this level.
7. Window. This window, facing south, is nearly identical to the one facing west.
The major difference is the presence of some iron bar stubs on the lower sill. Their
purpose cannot be ascertained with certainty; they may be the remnants of barred
grillework, or they may have supported some sort of rope or chain.
8. Open Area. This area is relatively unfeatured, and is free even of the suspend-
ed platforms.


Top Level: The roof is a very strong wooden structure, with a double thickness
and waterproofing. A single trap door is present, accessible from rungs cut into the
masonry along the chimney inside.

9. Chimney. The masonry chimney is close set to the top of the roof, and
contains three smoke vents. The trap door is placed close to the chimney.

10. Patch. The wood of the roof has either deteriorated or been broken through
at some time in the far past, and the area has been patched with sheet metal from a
ship's streamlined skin. In places the workmanship is rather crude, but the patch is
serviceable, and there was no evidence of leakage below.

11. Ring Link. Attached to the masonry of the roof edge is a single large ring
(30cm in diameter) in a universal joint to allow movement. There is no rope at-
tached, but there probably used to be. The positioning of the ring link is directly
over the window on the south edge.

12. Notch. A deep notch has been cut into the masonry lip of the building,
deep enough to allow a gunner to lie on the roof and aim to the terrace and front
doors below without being seen. This notch is not original to the building. Close
examination will give an insight into the construction techniques used in the
structure. No mortar is used; instead, the stones are close set, with an interlocking
ridge and groove being carved laboriously in each one. If this technique is used
throughout, the entire building should be very strong, and must have taken a large
amount of labor to construct.

Lower Level: This level is entered through the shaft near the fireplace. It is
entirely dark. The floor is wood, similar to that of the ground level. Ceiling height is
approximately three meters, so there is a lot of headroom.

13. Shaft and Fireplace. This location gives evidence that it was used for cooking
(or at least eating— there are bones scattered about).

14. Sand. The floor here is covered with gritty sand. Little is here, but there
is enough to reveal an air current blowing through the wall on this edge. The sand
also slowly disappears through the flooring— a clue that there is another floor
below.

15. Trap Door. Once there is some light, it is quite obvious that there is a trap
door in this area. It can be seen set into the floor. It leads down, but there are no
stairs or ladder.

16. Seeping Water. A small fissure in the foundation is seeping water into this
area. The water, if checked, smells and tastes slightly sulfurous.
Lowest Level: This level is entered through the trap door at location 15. The
floor is solid masonry similar to that of the walls and terrace. This area is dark, and
no details are visible without assistance.<br/>
The ceiling is one meter in height, which requires that humans crouch while
standing within.<br/>
Set in the center of the floor is a large, eight-pointed star. This star is formed
of pearly white stone set flush with the masonry of the floor. Each spike from
the star points to the center of one of the eight walls of the octagon; one spike
(the one pointing north) is noticeably larger than the others.

17. Spike. The north-pointing spike extends to nearly touch the wall on this
side. It can be recognized as the supports on this level for the fireplaces above.

18. Chair. A single wooden chair featuring excellent craftsmanship is placed on a
small raised area of stone at the spike facing west. The chair is massive and well-
constructed.

19. Shelves. This entire wall is covered from floor to ceiling with small shelves
with a wide variety of items. Searching through them shows most to be small jars
filled with liquids and powders, all of which appear to be unidentifiable. One jar,
however, is clearly labeled as radiation therapy drug, and appears to be from the
shipment in the crates on ground level. Checking will confirm from label and
lot number that it is.

20. Chair. A single massive stone bench is placed on a small raised area of stone
at the spike facing east. The bench is adorned with inscriptions similar to those on
the outside of the octagon.<br/>
Cut into the seat of the bench are several circular indentations, each engraved
with a symbol (such as flame, crystal, droyne, and cloud). If anyone has a coyn
and thinks to try, the small disk will be found to fit the indentation perfectly.
Doing so does not cause anything to happen, but it does bring the subject of the
coyns to mind for the adventurers.<br/>
Hidden beneath the bench is a small compartment with a stone lid; it contains
three coyns, all three of them engraved with a droyne.



## THE CATACOMBS

The eight-pointed star in the center of the lowest level conceals a stairway lead-
ing down still further. The concealment is excellent; a counter-weighted stone
hinged to swing down at a touch, but only after one of the symbols on the large
star is depressed. Anyone randomly walking on this level within the star may
accidentally push the right piece (apparently the people who built this never
thought someone would be walking around within their star figure). Throw 9+ for
each ten minutes on the lowest level for someone to hit the right piece. The stairway leads down to chamber 1 in the catacombs.

The entire nature of the rock within the catacombs is different from that of the
octagon. The octagon is built of close-fitted, fine masonry; the rooms and corridors
of the catacombs are of rough cut rock with occasional timbers to shore up ceilings
and places with crumbled rock on the floor, as if from partially collapsed roofs.
Each of the chambers is a stairway leading down to a landing. That landing
may have a corridor leading off from it and does have a stairway leading still
further down into the crag of the octagon.

1. Chamber 1. The stairs lead to this landing and a corridor branches to the
east. As the first of the many rooms, it should be noted as dark and damp.

A. This large square room is empty.

2. Chamber 2. The stairs leading down pause at this landing and then continue.
It appears that a corridor once lead west from the landing, but it is now blocked
with masonry. This is not actually the case: the wall needed shoring and masonry
was used. There is no corridor.

3. Chamber 3. The landing for chamber 3 leads to the east, to two rooms.

B. This room, located on a branch of the larger corridor, has a floor covered
with thick dust, probably from a loose ceiling. Looking closely, an individual with
good light can see small footprints (as if from scavengers or reducers) criss-crossing
the dust.

C. This room has a lowered floor and raised ceiling, making it larger in volume
than other rooms of the same area. The first step, however, is tricky; throw dex-
terity plus 3 or less to trip entering the room. Throw strength plus endurance or less
for 1D injury from the fall. In any case, instruct the first to enter the room that he
or she almost tripped.<br/>
Room C is directly below A, and its ceiling comes within three meters of the
floor of A. Looking through the room closely (throw 9+ per ten minutes until
successful) will reveal footholds in the wall leading to a concealed hatch leading to
room A. This hatch is not detectable from room A.

4. Chamber 4. The stairway leading down to this chamber is exceptionally
long and seems to continue endlessly. Finally, it arrives at a landing. With the
height of the stairs, this landing is quite long, and is bordered on the north by the
stairs up and on the south by the depression into which the further stairs lead.

5. Chamber 5. This chamber is more ordinary, and similar to the previous
ones. A corridor leads to the east. Several meters down the corridor, it turns from
rough cut rock to natural cave or water-worn rock and widens perceptibly. The
corridor wall has some narrow fissures in loose stone; brushing against them hard
will knock some loose, revealing wider fissures behind. These fissures connect with
those within room D, allowing the grillwork of bars to be bypassed in about 5
minutes of crawling and climbing.


D. A series of vertical metal rods, closely set at about 5 centimeter intervals,
bat the way. They are easily cut with a metal saw or an energy weapon. The room
itself is large and an apparently natural cave; its wall is marked with some natural
fissures which apparently lead deeper into the rock. Following them will require
leaving behind any packs and equipment except for perhaps a pistol or knife.
Following the fissures will take at least an hour of crawling and exploring.
Roll 8+ for the group to become lost (unless marking their trail. After the hour of
exploring, roll one die; if not lost, add 2 to the die roll. On a result of 1 or 2, the
group exits in the fissures at H. On a result of 3, 4, or 5, the group exits at point 1
on the alien base map. On a result of 6, 7, or 8, the group returns to the fissures at
D.

6. Chamber 6. The stairs leading down to this landing pause and then continue.
Coming down the stairs, there are small rocks and gravel on the individual steps
which make the footing perilous: throw dexterity plus 3 to fall and take 1D hits.

E. This portion of the landing is cluttered with rocks and debris. Looking
around, it is apparent that the ceiling is loose at this point.

7. Chamber 7. The stairs leading down to this landing are blocked by a large dry
web with strands the thickness and strength of heavy string. Further, although the
web looks dry, each strand is coated with a strong adhesive; strength 9+ is required
to pull the strand off what it is attached to on the first try; otherwise two tries are
required.

F. Wrapped in webbing at this point on the landing are several small dead
animals.

8. Chamber 8. The stairs lead down into the middle of a large room. There
are no railings to the stairs, and there is a severe drop to the right and left of the
stairs.

G. This room has a low ceiling at its edges, but it rises to a high vaulted
arch toward the center. In the center of the floor is a raised wall (about a half-meter
in height) surrounding a deep hole. Call this feature a well— it is filled with water to
a point about ten meters down.<br/>
The northeast corner of the room is cluttered with scattered rubble, mostly
rocks and stones. Near this rubble is a collapsed section of wall with fissures leading
into the rock.<br/>
Just about opposite the stairway is a doorway blocked by masonry. An attempt
to dismantle this masonry will show that the blockage continues for several meters
at least. Tearing down the masonry will take about 36 hours of work and the rubble
from the job will fill nearly half of room G.

H. These fissures, similar to those at D, lead deeper into the rock. Following
the main path will lead directly to the masonry blockage. Deeper exploration will
require about an hour. Roll 8+ for the group to become lost (unless marking their
trail). After an hour of exploring, roll one die. if not lost, add 2 to the die roll. On
a result of 1 or 2, the group exits the fissures at D. On a result of 3, 4, or 5, the
group exits the fissures at point 1 on the alien base map. On a result of 6, 7, or 8,
the group returns to the fissures at H.

I. Beyond the masonry blockage is a small group of corridors with floors covered
with rubble. These corridors are obviously long unused and in poor repair. Passing a
section of rubble requires some clearing (perhaps ten minutes) and crawling over
large stones. At I, a stairway leads down.

9. Chamber 9. Down the well from chamber 8 is a large room. The room appears
ordinary with a low ceiling.

J. The floor is covered with about 25 centimeters of water, making the
entire room a very shallow pool. The well, positioned in the center, is considerably
deeper and probably leads to an underground stream.
On the east wall is a solid door of heavy wood, barred from within. It can
be easily opened from this room.

K. This long corridor is barred at its west end by a large, solid wood door.
The door is barred from the other side, and must be broken in from this side.

L. The corridor from K and the stairway from I both lead to a large room
with a high ceiling. One end of the room is dominated by a gleaming metal door,
hinged at the bottom and looking very much like a large bank vault door. A de-
pression in the floor of about the same size and shape as the vault door obviously
accepts the door when it swings open. A small panel to the right of the door has
several solid state lights which blink at random intervals; there is no hint of buttons
to push or controls for the door itself. Although the group may try any number of
methods to open the door, it will not open (well, maybe a tactical nuke would open
it, but that would destroy the entire area; rock tunnelling would get around the
door, but that requires mining equipment and would take several days of set-up and
boring).<br/>
In a niche under the stairway leading from I to L is a 100 kg trapper, the one
which made the web in chamber 7. The trapper is completely concealed, and will
not be visible until it springs out in an attack. There is no clue that the trapper is
hidden under the stair, and there are no webs visible in this room.

The Trapper: The hidden animal is a warm-blooded analogue of a spider, com-
plete with eight legs and a segmented body. It
is, however, a vertebrate, and is very similar to
most mammals of similar size and weight. It
will attack perhaps ten or fifteen minutes after
the group arrives in the room, generally after
they have seen the vault door and looked it
over. The trapper will fight fiercely until killed;
if rendered unconscious, it will regain con-
sciousness within five minutes and then con-
tinue to fight until killed. Looking into its small
lair will show the reason for this ferocity: it was protecting its kitten.
Before the kitten is killed by the adventurers, note that it is cute and cuddly,
and that there is no indication of poison in use by the mother.
The statistics for the trapper and the kitten are given below.


```
Animal Type Weight Hits Armor Wounds & Weapons
Trapper 100kg 12/ 8 jack 8 teeth A0 F0 S2
Trapper Kitten 12kg 8 / 2 jack 4 teeth A0 F0 S2
```

The Vault Door: The door will not open to the normal efforts of the group; it
does respond to the psionic aura associated with acute fear, opening for a period of
about three minutes before closing again. The attack by the trapper should provide
the acute fear required; after the attack, the group should see the open door.




## THE ALIEN BASE

The alien base is a small complex of corridors, rooms, and equipment lying on
the other side of the vault door. It may be entered in two different ways. The vault
door itself is the most obvious way, provided it can be opened. The second entry
method is through the fissures which originate at D and H on the catacombs map.
In either case, entry places the individuals beyond the vault door, but across the
river cavern from the base itself.
Entry Point 1. Entering through the fissures to point 1 will reveal a large cavern
to the group. Below, the sound of running water from an underground river can be
heard. Throw two dice: on 9 or less, the cavern is illuminated by a brilliant white
(red if exactly 9) light coming from a bridge spanning the cavern. Rock climbing is
required to move out of the fissures at this entry point to the end of the bridge
on this side of the cavern. Throw dexterity or less to avoid falling to the river
below; throw three times before arriving at the bridge footing. If rock climbing to
the other side of the cavern (across the cavern ceiling) throw eight times.
Falling to the river below inflicts 1D hits and the individual is swept away by
the current and out of sight. Throw endurance or less to survive (survival expertise
is allowed as a DM); if the person does survive, he or she emerges to the surface
several kilometers away from the octagon.
The rocks of the cavern are sharp; throw 10+ for a connecting rope to fray or
break in the process of a fall.
L. The Vault Door. The bridge footing on the near side of the cavern is entered
directly from the vault door. Normally, the door is closed, and it opens only as
indicated on page 32; acute fear is required. The bridge itself is present and glowing
white on 8 or less; it is glowing red on exactly 9. Visible across the cavern is another
bridge footing: a room with gleaming silver walls.
M. The Bridge. The bridge itself appears to be insubstantial, at times transparent,
although the strength of its glow makes it hard to determine this unless it is closely
examined. It seems to be a form of energy, rather than of matter. As an adventurer
steps on it, his foot will sink into the bridge surface about two centimeters giving
a feel like soft rubber over hard rubber. The bridge is, however, safe to walk on.
The bridge turns itself on and off at irregular intervals; when doing so it first
glows red for about two minutes. It then abruptly clicks off, plunging the cavern
into total darkness, and its load into the river. At any specific time, throw two dice
for the condition of the bridge: on a result of 8-, it is on, on exactly 9, it is glowing
red, and on a result of 10+, it is off. From this point, continue the cycle as noted
above.

The Base: The corridors and rooms of the base are constructed with shiny,
silver-colored walls; apparently at random, some portions of the walls are splotched
with gold or metallic green. Corridors are of a vaulted cross-section, with
the side walls angling in toward the ceiling; in rooms, the walls angle out, giving the
ceiling greater area than the floor. There are no stairs present anywhere. Instead,
shallow ramps occur where floors change levels. Wall joints are slightly rounded,
making the metal of the walls less likely to injure or cut with a casual bump.
Lighting of rooms and corridors comes from a single tube of brilliant white light
(similar to the glow of the bridge) which comes on when individuals enter a room.
These tubes are centered in the ceiling of each corridor, and are plentifully arrayed
throughout the various rooms. The strength of the light is hard on human eyes, and
tinted visors or sunglasses can help vision in these locations.<br/>
Doors in various locations marked on the map are of the automatic sliding type.
When an individual approaches a door, it opens by sliding into a slot in the wall; it
does this automatically, closing again after the individual has passed through. An
automatic door will not close on an object which remains in its path; even a small
book or package is sufficient to keep the door fully open.

N. Bridge Landing. This is the base side of the bridge. The room is a balcony
overlooking the cavern below, but is otherwise featureless. Two doors lead from
the room.

O. Circular Room. This large circular chamber is spanned by a cantilever bridge
overlooking the floor below. Situated on the floor are six ovoidal structures con-
structed of a milky-white translucent plastic; dark shapes are visible within.<br/>
This room is a barracks holding thirty-six Droyne warriors in suspended anima-
tion. When triggered or alerted, the ovoids dissolve (in about 45 seconds) releasing
the warriors for combat. When no longer needed, the warriors are returned to
storage with newly constructed ovoids.<br/>
Tampering with the ovoids will release the warriors; firing weapons within the
chamber will also trigger their release.

P. Rectangular Room. This room is bare and devoid of any features save an array
of dish-shaped surfaces on the far wall. Waving a hand in front of one causes a
circular section of floor (diameter: about 3 meters) to rise to a height of one die
times 25 centimeters.<br/>
Although there is no apparent reason for this phenomenon, the room is actually
a meeting room; the circular sections are seating for individuals. Seating height is
related to caste within the group.<br/>
The sliding doors at the far ends of the room are arranged to interact with each
other; one door will not open until the other is closed. Blocking one open will
prevent the other from opening.

Q. Rectangular Room. This large open room has no doors; instead, it is entered
through a large portal off a corridor. Its ceiling is very high (perhaps thirty meters)
and the area is studded with several columns capped with circular platforms. No
platform is less than ten meters off the floor.<br/>
This is a flying room. Training and exercise in flying takes place here. The
nearness of some columns forms an obstacle course for flyers, and the platforms
above serve as resting places.

R. Irregular Room. This large room connects to corridors, doors, and rooms
in an irregular manner. The floor of the area is clean and clear of any equipment
or furniture. In the center, however (about where the R is on the map), a single
five-fingered glove can be seen. It is marked with the Imperial Scout Service insignia
(apparently lost by a member of the shipwrecked task force some centuries ago).

S. Chairs. Overlooking the globe of Fulacin are four chairs, each with a control
panel or box with several dished depressions. Behind the chairs is a large panel of
controls and meters similar to those found in other areas of the base.

T. Power Room. This small room contains a vertical shaft leading down at least
two hundred meters. At the bottom, a strong white glow pulses regularly. Leading
up the shaft, over the lip, and into a wall connection are two heavy conduits (about
300mm in diameter). Some wall controls are present near the door. If tampered
with, throw two dice: on 5-, the power source is turned off (and the entire base
goes dark), on 6-8, a spiral bridge (like the one in the cavern) turns on and leads
down to the bottom of the shaft, on 9+, no effect (unless the power plant is off, in
which case, it is turned on. The spiral bridge will not come on if the power plant is
off.<br/>
The power plant at the bottom of the shaft is entirely self-contained and little
(if any) clue to its operation can be gotten by examining it.

U. Environment Center. This room contains a complex of air circulation and
purification machinery. There is a slight underpressure in this room, and air from
other locations is forced here; it is then pumped through the the ventilation shaft at
Y to other rooms.

V. Rectangular Room. This room is honey-combed with many small compart-
ments, each large enough to hold a single person. Their interiors appear empty, and
feeling their surface will show that they are resilient. A further sensation also
becomes apparent; within each compartment, gravity is zero.
This room contains sleeping accomodations for residents of the base, especially
those of the lower castes. Compartments vary in size, and are assigned based on
individual size.<br/>
A ventilation grating similar to that in X is present.

W. Rectangular Room. This room contains several large compartments similar
in nature to those in V. Interiors of the compartments are in zero-G, and are
covered with a resilient material.<br/>
This is the sleeping compartment for those of higher caste; they merit larger
and more luxurious quarters.

X. Cavern Room. This large room has walls of metallic green. Dominating the
floor is a circular dais (about a half-meter above floor level) with many cushions
and pillows scattered about on it. One entire wall appears to be missing, and it
opens out onto the cavern. Moving closer, one can see that there is a wall there,
but it is transparent (exceptionally so), forming a large picture window. On the
other wall is a grillework of vertical bars preventing entry into a hallway. These bars
(if tried) may be bent with hand pressure, and will slowly return to their original
shape when released. They can be bent enough to allow entry into the hallway.

Y. Ventilation Tunnel and Access Shaft. This walls of this entire corridor are
covered with dish-shaped plaques and glowing registers or meters, all of extremely
sophisticated design. They are obviously controls for various parts of this in-
stallation. Playing with them will produce no effect; occasionally, they will pro-
duce random effects (such as lights brightening or dimming, changes in background
noises, or other minor events).

Z. Hemispherical Dome. A half-sphere is set on the floor at this point. Closer
examination shows that it is a full sphere set into the floor. Obviously, this is
a representation of Fulacin itself, complete with continents and seas, cloud cover
and weather, and all of the other details necessary to show a world as it looks from
space.

The world is up to date: weather features look recent, and they are changing as
the group looks on. Even the darkness of night and the brightness of day are
visible, but without any corresponding light source or shadow within the room.


Many facilities within the base appear to be missing, such as sanitary facilities,
computer links, and repair shops or maintenance arrangements. All are normally
concealed within the walls and floors of the structure and are called upon when
needed. The gold sections on the wall indicate the locations of food dispensers and
sanitary facilities.

Bathrooms: Every room has a sanitary disposal facility. Looking closely at the
walls will show apparently random patches of gold. Patches in the rough shape of a
four-lobed clover mark sanitary facilities (no two patches are exactly the same, but
all have the same rough shape). Touching such a patch three times in rapid succes-
sion will cause a section of floor to glow dull orange; this section disposes of
anything placed on it with a slow, pulsed rhythm. Stepping on such a patch will
slowly disintegrate the bottom of a shoe or boot, and will ultimately begin destroying the sole of a foot.

The orange patch is turned off with three rapid touches on the gold patch.
This mechanism is a phased teleportation device; it teleports any matter on
the patch (to a height of one millimeter) away with each pulse. Additional matter
then settles down into position for the next teleport.

Food: Gold patches in roughly circular shape mark food dispensers and appear
only in rooms R, V, W, and X. Touching a circular gold patch three times in rapid
succession causes a wall section to open, revealing a holographic display of three
types of food— generally a meat dish, a vegetable dish, and a beverage. Reaching
into the display and grasping one of the choices causes a heavy vibration within the
hologram and the choice materializes in the hand.

This facility involves teleportation of the selected dish into the location shown
by the hologram. If it is not grasped, it will fall to the floor; if the individual is not
careful or is inattentive, a portion of the dish will coincide with the hand and
force safety interlocks to function- the dish will not appear, and the hand will
receive a sharp sting. The sting is painful but causes no real injury.

Computer: Computer links are not immediately obvious because they worked
directly with the base personnel. Each individual was tracked at all times by a psi-
onic link to the computer that provided information and calculations on the spot.

The Fulacin Globe: The large globe representation of Fulacin at Z is a detailed
model of the world. It can be touched, and is solid. Pushing against it reveals that
it is massive and responds to pushes only slowly. While it cannot be moved from
its depression, it can be rotated and turned with some effort.

Turning the globe will soon swing it around to show the site of Twilight's Peak,
which is marked on the surface with a single spark of white light. Looking further
will reveal two additional sparks placed randomly about the surface of the world
and a spark near each of the poles. Visible in miniature (the scale of the globe is
about 1:600,000; one meter equals 600 kilometers on the real surface) is the
Magneto Dynamics starport. Very close inspection will also show minute detail.

While a discrimination effect is obviously in operation and nothing smaller than 60
meters in length (scale size: one-tenth millimeter) is reproduced, even items that
small are easily missed unless assisted by lenses or magnifiers.

Sitting in one of the chairs (at S) facing the globe will activate more information
from the globe display. Orbital traces will appear showing any satellites or ships in
orbit around the world to an altitude of about 100,000 kilometers. These traces
will trail the satellite for approximately a meter (like a comet tail) in green glow;
they also project ahead of the object for about a meter in a much lighter green,
showing a predicted trajectory for the object. There are six satellites— three ships
and three small chunks of rock.

Sitting in one of the two central chairs will cause an even greater display of
information. Ships and other moving objects not actually on the surface will be
projected at 100 times their normal size (a 60 meter ship just at the limits of
resolution is projected as 10 millimeters long; just large enough to allow details to
be seen).

The controls near the seats at S can be played with; doing so involves placing a
finger opposite a dished depression. One stops the entire display, freezing it in
place until countermanded. When countermanded, it immediately jumps to a
representation of the current situation. Another control rotates the globe in the
vertical plane; a companion rotates it in the horizontal plane. Together, the two
controls make the entire surface of the globe visible with only a touch. Finally,
a single control creates a floating holographic projection of a shiny sphere. The
sphere originates at one of the white sparks near the poles and drifts slowly out of
that location. Wiggling a finger within the depression control causes it to maneuver,
and it can be steered with ease to any point within one meter of the surface of the
globe. When the finger in the control is removed, the sphere disappears from the
presentation. Reinserting the finger creates a new shiny sphere from one of the
polar sparks.

If a small shiny globe is moved to cover a ship or satellite nothing happens—
unless the finger is removed from the depression. Then the globe disappears, taking
with it the satellite or ship. No trace remains and there is no indication that there is
any debris or hulk left.

The control console behind the seats at S is more elaborate, but the individual
dished controls appear to have no real effect on any aspect of the display. After
some interaction with the controls, a single metal plate will rise from the floor near
the console and float at a height of about 50 centimeters. It has four handles
around its circular rim, and it appears to be a self-powered grav platform. About a
minute after it appears, an identical companion platform will also appear. No
others are forthcoming.

These grav platforms are more than they appear. They can be controlled by
pulling or pushing and will carry up to 600 kilograms without effort (they resist
gravity; inertia still provides resistance to movement). In addition, each has a small
resilient spot on the underside near one of the handles. Pressing that spot (which
can occur accidentally) converts the plate to a teleportation disk. Anything on the
plate is transferred to the other plate, and anything on that plate is transferred to
this plate. Range appears to be about one kilometer, provided there is no height
differential of greater than ten meters.

Operating the controls for the console at S may also open several small doors
close to the floor, revealing a cabinet containing a variety of small items, most of
which are unrecognizable. The one object which does show some potential is
a small box finished in grey metal, with two gold colored contacts on its upper
surface. It looks like a battery, and it is; the two contacts will provide almost
unlimited current.

The device is an anti-matter battery, and operates by a controlled flow of
anti-matter against an ordinary matter core. Flow is metered in response to de-
mand, and very high levels of current are available. Anti-matter batteries have a
potential problem; if all the anti-matter is released at once, a large quantity of
energy is released. Instead, this type of battery is constructed to bleed energy
slowly if broken or cracked. As a result, the battery will flash brightly for up to
twenty minutes with very bright light and intense heat. Anyone closer than six
meters is subject to burns inflicting 1D hits per combat round; DM to the hit die
roll of +2 per square (1.5 meters) closer.

Anti-matter batteries are quite resistant to damage, but are not armored or
impervious. Achieving 12+ hits on a battery casing will fracture it and the energy
release will begin.
Batteries measure 6cm by 4cm by 10cm, and weigh about two kilograms.

The Coyns: Concealed under one of the cushions on the raised platform at X
is a small bag containing 36 gold disks, each marked with a different symbol. These
coyns are more fully described in the section covering the Droyne and their cere-
mony for establishment of caste.


# Library Data


Library data is information obtainable from any ship's computer (or starport
library) in response to the correct keywords. Only the specific information re-
quested should be given to the players; care should be taken not to reveal additional
data or to allow indiscriminate browsing through the library records.

Air/Raft: Also known as a flier, the air/raft relies on solid state anti-grav mod-
ules for lift and propulsion. Four independent, individually replaceable modules
insure a maximum of safety, in that each provides one-quarter of the vehicle's total
lift. A standard air/raft masses about four tons, and can carry a payload of about
four tons, including pilot and 3 passengers. Cruising speed is usually 100kph, with
unlimited range and endurance. The normal air/raft is open-topped and subject to
the effects of weather and climate.

The major drawbacks to the air/raft are its low load capacity, its relatively slow
speed, and its susceptibility to weather (both the negative effects of bad weather on
passengers and the slowing effects of high winds and buffeting).
Most air/rafts are capable of reaching orbit (occupants should wear vacc suits)
but the trip will take several (6 to 12) hours). Most air/rafts can also be overloaded
with passengers (a maximum of eight can fit with minimal comfort) so long as
tonnage maximum is not exceeded.

All Terrain Vehicle: The All Terrain Vehicle is designed to provide high quality
transportation on any number of worlds. It can traverse all but the most forbidding
terrain and is fully amphibious. The pressurized interior allows up to eight passen-
gers to live in relative comfort for long periods of time.

The standard ATV masses 10 tons and allows a payload of 6 tons (including
passengers and driver). It can cruise on roads at 100kph; obviously, speeds will be
reduced in less than ideal circumstances: an ATV would be lucky to make 50kph
over broken ground and 20kph in mountain terrain.

The major drawbacks for the ATV are its refuelling requirement (with water or
hydrogen, generally every 24 hours or so), its slowness in some terrain, and its bulk.

Amber Zone: Travellers' Aid Society classification for a nation, world, or system
which presents a need for caution in dealings and activity. Less severe than a Red
Zone, which indicates interdiction, war, or quarantine.

Ancients: A race of non-human beings who inhabited the general region of the
Spinward Marches approximately -300,000. Archeological evidence recovered from
excavations of the few known Ancient cities indicates that the race died out during
a 2000 year period of intense warfare which left only ruined cities and shattered
planets.

The Ancients were responsible for several major features within the general
Imperial region. They created the multi-world rosette at Tireen (in the Vargr
Extents), and their warfare resulted in a large proportion of asteroid belts throughout this spiral arm.

The Ancients were responsible for the wide dissemination of humaniti within its
current domain when (for reasons currently unclear) they transplanted genetic
stock from Terra to at least forty worlds across a span of 360 parsecs.
The Ancients were also responsible for the creation of the Vargr through genetic
manipulation of carnivore/chaser stock.


Artifact: Any manufactured object.
The term artifact is commonly used to refer to any object, item, or group of
related items produced by the Ancients.

Aslan: Intelligent major race evolved from carnivore/pouncers on the world
Kuzu, situated 135 parsecs rimward from Capital. Physi-
cally, the typical adult Aslan masses 100 kilograms, stands
upright to a height of 2 meters, and is similar in needs and
preferences to humaniti. They have good night vision, a
heightened sense of smell, and retractable claws (vestiges of
earlier days) which can still prove useful in brawls. Socially,

Aslan group themselves in voluntary families (containing
two to twelve adults and a varying number of children) for
most purposes, including commerce and recreation.
Major contacts with the Aslan in the Spinward Marches
are the result of trading missions which gather rare or
valuable goods for shipment to the Aslan Hierate.

The Aslan have been Imperial allies (although rather passive) in the wars against
the Solomani.

Bloodwell: Merchant trader in the 1000 ton class belonging to the Oberlindes
Lines and generally assigned to the Regina/Regina to Pandrin/Uthe run. Lost with
all hands and passengers to Imperial naval action 347-1105 when mistakenly
identified as hostile.

Capital (Capital/Core 0508-A586A98-F): Central world of the Imperium and
seat of government since its founding. Situated in the center of the Imperium,
Capital's astrographical location has proven of prime importance, as it controls the
only gap in the Rifts for thousands of parsecs. Besides being a communications hub.
Capital is a cultural and educational center.

Coyns: Of the rare artifacts recovered from Ancient sites, the most common are
coyns; small disks of metal engraved with various symbols. Their specific purpose
is unknown. It may be that the objects served as money, jewelry, psionic focuses,
or for some other unknown purpose.

Original coyns have been found in various precious metals such as gold, silver,
platinum, iridium, and even uranium. Sets range in size from six to thirty-eight
pieces, and are considered desirable to museums throughout the Imperium. Each
coyn has a scrap value of Cr400 (if gold); to a museum, the value is closer to
Cr4000.

Copies of sets of coyns are made of aluminum, lead, or zinc, and are more frequently encountered from unscrupulous merchants or traders. Such fake coyns
have a value of about Cr20 each.



Dating Systems: Three major dating systems are in use when referring to his-
torical events— Terran, Vilani, and Imperial.

Terran dates center on a year about midway through the period of Vilani ascen-
dance. After that date, years ascend, and are suffixed AD; before that date, years
descend, and are suffixed BC. There is no year zero.

Vilani dates (using a 496 day year) count
from the year of the Establishment of the
First (or Vilani) Imperium. Those before are
suffixed PI (pre-lmperium); those after are
suffixed VI (Vilani Imperium).

Imperial dates count from the year of the
founding of the Third Imperium, specifying
the year zero as a holiday year. Dates before
that are negative, dates after that are posi-
tive, with the sign usually suppressed.
Imperial dating also uses a Julian system for
counting days. Each day in the year is
consecutively numbered beginning with 001.
Thus, in the year 1105, the first day of the
year is 001-1105.

Zhodani dating is in olympiads (obviously a translation). Each olympiad is of
three Zhodani years; each Zhodani year is 273 days. The first olympiad corresponds
to 2209 BC. The dating system itself has been in more or less continuous use since
then, with minor lapses due to war or temporary decline of ruling parties.

Droyne: Major race concentrated in the spinward regions of the Imperium.
See separate section.

Dust-Spice: Rare euphoric spice used for seasoning food, especially fruit. Har-
vested from the bark of desert scrub-plants, this seasoning is popular with humans
as a mild recreational spice with effects slighter than, but similar to, alcohol.

Certain non-human races (notably Aslan and Vargr) find dust-spice a much more
powerful euphoric, and it is in constant demand by those peoples.

Express Boats: The primary means of interstellar communication within the
Imperium is the express boat— a small, fast, information carrying ship. Outlying
worlds of the Imperium stand nearly four years from the capital, and express boat
links have been established to insure the rapid transmission of messages (govern-
mental, commercial, and private) with a maximum of efficiency.

Selected locations along major trade routes are established as express stations:
orbital facilities which service and refuel xboats on their communications runs.

As an xboat arrives in a system, it beams its recorded messages to the express
station, which then retransmits them to an xboat standing by for a jump outsystem.
Time between jumps is almost always less than four hours, and can be under seven
minutes. The speed of communication is thus nearly the speed of jump (xboats are
equipped with jump-4 drives, four parsecs per week). In practice, this speed is
somewhat reduced as trade routes do not follow straight lines, and not all jumps are
made at jump-4. Average speed approximates jump-2.6 per week.


False War (1082 to 1084): See Fourth Frontier War.


Far Trader. Variant designation of an independent merchant starship. While such
ships are traditionally called free traders, vessels with jump-2 capability (twice the
normal rating) are called far traders.


Fourth Frontier War (1082 to 1084): The fourth of the frontier wars in the
Spinward Marches was over almost before it began. Initial Zhodani and Vargr
attacks against the Jewell and Regina subsectors were stalled at the borders. The
armistice was actually signed before instructions had been received from Capital.


Gas Giant: A large planet with an extensive atmosphere of hydrogen and hydro-
gen compounds. Starships fuel themselves by diving into this atmosphere and
skimming hydrogen. The only other methods available for refuelling are 1) dipping
water from oceans, 2) melting it from icecaps, and 3) buying it at a base or starport.


Groatle: Cloth made from the hair of groats, noted especially for its shimmering
iridescence after chemical treatment. This cloth (and the raw material for such
cloth) is in great demand in the Imperial Core.


Humaniti (old spelling: Humanity): One of the Major Races. All of humaniti
originated from genetic stock on Sol/Terra, transplanted for reasons unknown by
the Ancients throughout this spiral arm of the galaxy. Parallel development resulted
in the predominance of essentially identical human races in the worlds of this arm.
Of all human races, three have gained major status: Vilani, Solomani, and Zhodani.


Kirur (Kirur/Thirty 0505-B863A03-F): Homeworld and capital of the Two
Thousand Worlds— the empire of the Centaurs. The planet's oceans are extremely
shallow and the world exhibits almost no volcanic activity, very unusual for a world
of its size. Kirur has one large continent, which was conquered in pre-historic
times by the current ruling clan; Kirur is one of the most politically stable planets
known.


Kuzu (Kuzu/Kilane 0406-A876986-E): Home world of the Aslan race and
capital of the Aslan Hierate.

Lair (Lair/Grnrouf 0802-A8859B9-F): "Homeworld" and capital of the Vargr
Extents. Unusually enough for the capital of a star-spanning empire, several sections
of the planet still boasted independence from central control until only a few years
ago.

Magneto-Dynamics, Inc: Established in 1040 with an Imperial charter and a
mineral exploitation grant for Fulacin (Fulacin/Rhylanor 0203-A674120-D). The
corporation holds several patents for the recovery of precious and heavy metals
from atmospheric and oceanic suspension, and originally obtained its position on
Fulacin for the use of these properties.

Following the severe economic downturn associated with the False War (1082 to
1084), the company encountered a cash slowdown, and suspended operations for a
period. In 1089, an influx of capital allowed the company to resume operations. In
partial support of this new era, the company also established a large starport facility
(currently typed as class A, minus) with construction and overhaul facilities to
10,000 tons. Completed in 1099.

The starport facility, envisioned as ultimately supporting mineral export traffic,
has served an interim purpose of supporting (through landing fees and other in-
come) the on-going survey of the world for ultimate exploitation.
MagnetoDynamics' exploitation grant expires in 1199, with a renewability clause
for an additional 100 years upon demonstration of efficient and profitable opera-
tions.

Stock ownership in the company is divided approximately as follows: spinward
nobility— 8%, Imperial Family— 2%, large corporations— 34%, investment trusts—
46%, public (individuals)- 8%.

Major Race: An arbitrary distinction based on technological achievement by a
specific intelligent race. Any race which achieves interstellar travel (jump drive)
through its own efforts is classified as major; one which does not is classified as
minor. To date, generally accepted major races include Humaniti (Zhodani, Solo-
mani, and Vilani, but not other examples), Aslan, the Hive, Centaurs, Vargr, An-
cients, and Droyne.

Minor Race: An intelligent race which has not achieved jump drive through its
own efforts. For most races, this is the appropriate classification, but many feel
that they are deliberately held down by the major races through this arbitrary but
all-pervasive classification system.

Oberlindes Lines: Established in 1084 with an Imperial charter specifying trade
and commerce within the Spinward Marches and supporting distant trade with
states bordering the Imperium. Oberlindes is one of the major shipping lines within
the Regina subsector, with feeder routes to all major starports; Oberlindes expansion into neighboring subsectors has improved star service but alienated many of
the older and more conservative lines.

The Oberlindes name is an old one in the trade and commerce business in the
Marches. Roxanne Oberlindes established the first line to bear the name in 487 and
built a family business which thrived between each of the several wars which have
wracked the Marches in the past half-millenium. The first major increase in Ober-
lindes' size came in 1049, with the acquisition of Emissary, a surplus cruiser de-
clared excess by the Imperial Navy. This ship, armaments intact, served as the
flagship for Oberlindes' excursions into the Vargr Extents on trade expeditions; the
venture proved highly successful. A base for Oberlindes was established just beyond
the Imperial border (some irregularities in the ship transfer made it impractical to
bring the ship into the Imperium) and served as a clearing house for trade good
shipments between Regina and the Vargr worlds.

In the years following the False War, Oberlindes Lines obtained an Imperial
charter and began operations with a large fleet composed almost entirely of navy
surplus ships— now numbering in the hundreds. The organization concentrates on
the smaller feeder routes, but has recently expanded into main line service, in direct
competition with Tukera Lines and other more established major shipping lines.

Sergei hault-Oberlindes, patriarch and controller of the line, was awarded a
baronial patent, complete with estates on Feri (Feri/Regina 0405-B384879-B), by
direction of the Emperor in 1101 for his contribution to the economic recovery in
the Marches following the Fourth Frontier War.
Oberlindes Lines is a family company with stock ownership divided approxi-
mately as follows: Oberlindes family— 78%, investment trusts— 10%, corporate
employees— 8%, Imperial family— 2%, and public (individuals)— 2%.

Octagon Society: Established in 342, the Octagon Society was the first major
distressed spacefarer assistance operation to appear in the Spinward Marches. The
group thrived on public contributions and some tax revenues for 150 years; it
collapsed in the late 400's when scandals emerged over quality of shelter con-
struction and the disposition of certain funds.

Society shelters were generally of an octagonal shape. Large hostels were estab-
lished on major worlds, while smaller weather shelters were placed on frontier or
unsettled worlds. The characteristic octagon shaped buildings are still visible on
various worlds, although none are still in use as shelters for distressed space-farers.
The Octagon Society was dissolved in 499 and its assets were sold at auction.

Porozlo, Battle of (980): The Zhodani thrust (in the Third Frontier War)
through Vilis and Lanth subsectors toward Rhylanor met a not unexpected prob-
lem— Rhylanor has no gas giant, although it does have a strong naval base to defend
it. Neighboring Porozlo (Porozlo/Rhylanor 0305-867A74-A) not only had a gas
giant for quick refuelling, but also possessed a naval base of potentially great use to
invading naval forces.

The battle began with the appearance of a single large Zhodani task force off
Porozlo's primary; it proceeded directly to the larger of two gas giants in the
system. The local naval base reacted immediately, even admirably, considering that
there was no warning of Zhodani approaches this far from the front lines. However,
as the first Zhodani task force refuelled, portions of it engaged the local defenses,
preoccupying them as a second task force appeared and drove straight for Porozlo.

The threat of action against the planetary defenses and facilities prompted the
world organization to declare Porozlo an open world. Naval forces either surren-
dered or jumped to safety at Rhylanor.

The fall of Porozlo provided the Zhodani with a supporting base for their
seige of Rhylanor. Ships could easily refuel at the gas giant, jump-1 to Rhylanor for
raids, attacks, or blockade patrols, and still have enough fuel for jump-1 back to
Porozlo, where a class A starport and the captured naval base stood ready to repair
any damage immediately.

The naval defenses of Porozlo have been increased considerably since 986.

Red Zone. Travellers' Aid Society classification for a nation, world, or system
which is quarantined, interdicted, or at war. Red indicates entry into that location
is prohibited or strongly advised against. More severe than an Amber Zone, which
merely advises caution.

Second Frontier War (615 to 620): Fought between the Outworld Coalition
(Zhodani, Vargr, and Sword Worlds) and the Imperium during the period of the
Barracks Emperors. Arbellatra (587 to 666) was named Grand-Admiral of the
Marches and led the combined local and Imperial forces to defeat the Coalition, and
then proceeded to reestablish the central Imperial authority. She was named
regent in 622 as a result, and Empress in 629.

Six Races: Traditional term for the intelligent races which dominate this region
of the galaxy. It appears independently in Aslan, Vargr, and Centaur literature.
There is some disagreement as to the meaning of the term and the identity
of the races involved. Most commentators agree that all of the six races must
be major races; the candidates are Aslan, Centaurs, Droyne, Hive, Solomani, Vargr,
Vilani, and Zhodani. Various racially based hypotheses have emerged, but none
has gained ascendency.

Solomani Hypothesis: A generally accepted theory that all Humaniti originated
on Terra, and that all other native human races arise from stock transported there
by the Ancients. The theory explains the large number of independent human races
within the Imperium without requiring a farfetched concept of "parallel evolution".

Solomani Rim War (990 to 1002): The culmination of centuries of disagreement
between the Imperium and the Solomani Sphere. Following rifts at court, the
Imperium established the Solomani Autonomous Region (or Solomani Sphere) in
704, and then ignored the region, allowing it to develop independently while the
central government paid closer attention to the Spinward Marches and the Gate-
way. By 900, reports that the Solomani rule of many client-worlds within the
sphere was over-bearing and heavy-handed forced Empress Margaret to reassess the
situation, and she (by proclamation in 940) dissolved the Solomani Sphere and
reintegrated it into the Imperium. The Solomani resisted, ultimately to be crushed
in the Solomani Rim War.

In 1002, Sol was recaptured by a massive invasion, and the capital of the Solo-
mani was lost to them. At that point, the war for the Imperium effectively ended.


Solomani sentiments differ, and there is still a strong anti-Imperial faction along the
Imperium's rimward border.


Spinward Main: Within the Spinward Marches, a grouping of worlds, planets, and
systems each within jump-1 of another. Together, this grouping (called the Spin-
ward Main) forms a corridor of jump points which allow simple jump-1 ships to
travel to 15 of the 16 March subsectors and to 223 of the 440 worlds.


Third Frontier War (979 to 986): The long period of uneasy peace between the
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate erupted into war in 979 with simultaneous
blows in the Querion and Jewell subsectors. Imperial reaction was deficient, and the
hostilities continued for nearly six years with little to show for it. The armistice
finally signed in 986 give each side little, and brought about the abdication of
Emperor Styryx in 989.


Travel Zone. As a service to spacefarers, the Travellers' Aid Society determines
and publishes travel zones which indicate the degree of danger presented by a world
to travellers. All worlds within the Imperium are coded green unless otherwise
noted. Other codes are amber (caution) and red (prohibited).

Tukera Lines: The Imperium-spanning Tukera Lines actually predates the
formation of the Imperium. The original corporation held a charter from the
Sylean Federation; with the establishment of the Imperium in the holiday year
zero, all such charters were automatically recognized by the Imperium.
Tukera Lines concentrates on the main communications links within the Im-
perium, and operates a vast fleet of jump-3 and jump-4 liners and transports which
follow the established xboat routes. In some subsectors (especially the older, more
established regions of the Imperium) Tukera has a virtual monopoly on long dis-
tance shipping and travel.

Stock ownership in Tukera Lines is divided approximately as follows: Tukera
family— 6%, Imperial family— 32%, large corporations— 6%, public (individuals)—
31%, investment trusts- 25%.

Twilight's Peak: Legendary or apocryphal story of lost starfarers on an unknown
world who discovered fantastic structures and devices while surviving a terrifying
winter. Phrased as an epic poem of execreble quality, the story is most notable only
in that it is based in fact— a task force was lost in the time period specified, and it
has not been recovered or accounted for.

Two Thousand Worlds:. The Centaur Empire, situated (at its closest point) eighty
parsecs tracing the Imperium. Its capital is Kirur, the Centaur homeworld.

Vargr: Intelligent race derived from Ancient genetic manipulations of common
carnivore/chaser stock. Vargr have long suffered from an inability to organize
themselves (to any degree or for any length of time) beyond the star system level,
and their empires rise and fall with unsurprising regularity. In addition, Vargr suffer
from a racial inferiority complex based on the knowledge that they are not pro-
ducts of evolution; instead, they were manipulated into intelligence by someone else— the Ancients.

The Vargr are scattered across most of the
coreward edge of the Imperium in many
splinter empires collectively called the Extents.
These states war with each other as much as
with non-Vargr, and there is a constant strife as
each tries to establish a position superior to the
others. Some Vargr have been more-or-less
allied with the Zhodani for several centuries,
and have participated in the Frontier Wars.
Others have maintained a strict neutrality, or
even allied with the Imperium.


Xboat: See Express Boat.

Zhodane (Zhodane/Gaval 0309-A6547C8-F): Capital of the Zhodani Consulate
and traditional homeworld for the Zhodani people. Unlike the capitals of other
empires, Zhodane is largely divided into the estates of the members of the ruling
Zhodani Council, making the world's population unusually low.

Zhodani: One of many human races and one of three known major human
races. Zhodani inhabit the Zhodani Consulate, a large (and growing) interstellar
empire to spinward of the Imperium; clashes and conflicts between them and the
Imperium have recurred for the last six hundred years, with each engagement
becoming more intense.

A major source of conflict with the Zhodani is their acceptance and practice of
psionics— all Zhodani of noble birth (social class A or higher) receive psionic
training as a matter of course.



# The Octagon Book

In 872 a history of the Octagon Society was published by Lent Publishers of
Wochiers. The following is a precis of what that book contained.

In 326, early on in the colonization of the Spinward Marches, many (if not
most) of the worlds in the sector stood at low tech levels, and travel between the
few high technology (and well-settled) worlds was a dangerous undertaking.

One traveller, Foren Caliphren Doon,
an employee of Halloran Surveys and
engaged in a preliminary reconnaissance
of several worlds for the company, met
with trouble. The free trader on which he
took passage developed engine trouble in
the Frisini system (it became Beck's
World/Regina later, during the Civil War);
he was marooned for nearly ten years.
With rescue, Doon was a changed man,
obsessed with a new-found purpose: to
stop such a fate from happening to
anyone else. His tool was almost a
church, but with a purpose very clear at
the practical level. The group's continuing activities centered on fund-raising and on
building shelters for spacefarers on all possible worlds.

The Octagon Society, headquartered at Regina, and with major branches at Feri,
Wochiers, and Alell, actively solicited funds for the construction of shelters out the
Marches. Video programs of progressively higher quality struck a responsive chord
in the audiences on high-population worlds, and cash flow synergized with a
competent organization to make the various octagon projects viable. Regina sub-
sector was furnished with shelters on all worlds in the course of forty years (338 to
378). Most notable is the current Travellers' Aid Society hostel on Regina— a large,
now only vaguely octagonal building obscured by additions and renovations. Less
populated frontier worlds received stone, concrete, or metal octagonal shaped
buildings which served as shelters for marooned or distressed travellers, and were
furnished with radios, survival equipment, and food.

In 410, the group expanded its efforts to adjacent subsectors and even sent
construction teams into Vargr territory. The entire movement fell apart in the late
400s when scandal surfaced. Embezzlement had diverted much of the funds
pouring into the society's coffers, and substandard shelters were being produced.
Shelter Locations: As an appendix to the book, a complete list of all octagon
shelters constructed or planned is included. Locations on worlds are not given, but
it does indicate that there was at least one octagon constructed on each world in
the Regina, Lanth, Rhylanor and Aramis subsectors.

No shelter was produced, however, in the Macene Belt, on Dinom, or on Roup.
The shelters on Regina, Dinomn, Jenghe, Rhylanor, Jae Tellona, Celepina, Risek,
and Inthe were staffed and operated as hotels and actually turned a profit.
An illustration of the octagon of Fulacin is shown on page 50.


# The Epic

The Third Frontier War (979 to 986) began in much the same manner as the
previous two wars had, with Zhodani attacks in the coreward regions of the Spin-
ward Marches. The initial Zhodani attacks against the Imperium concentrated on
Boughene, Pixie, and Efate in an attempt to cut off the Jewell subsector. These
opening moves were essential duplicates of Zhodani actions in previous wars; only
after the hostilities had continued for several months did the enemy introduce a
new strategy to parallel the action in Regina. A subordinate drive, supported only
by a narrow string of makeshift bases, pushed through both Vilis and Lanth sub-
sectors straight at Rhylanor. Major forces then took Porozlo and began a siege of
Rhylanor, hoping to reduce the world and establish a major stronghold before
the Imperium could respond.

During the siege, imperial forces from Regina were diverted to reinforce Rhy-
lanor, even though they were sorely needed elsewhere. Rhylanor was ultimately the
scene of several battles, and only the insertion of fleet assets from the neighboring
Sabine subsector finally turned the tide of the war.
By 981, the war was back on a more even footing, with actions concentrating in
the Regina and Vilis subsectors. Nevertheless, enemy raids were frequent through-
out the area for several years.

In 984, a routine request for radiation treatment pharmaceuticals for Regina was
routed through Rhylanor to the navy base at Vanejen, which routinely filled the
order. Dredging up a 400-ton type R subsidized merchant named the Gyro Cadiz,
the navy fitted the ship with a 40-ton interior fuel tank in the cargo hold, filled
the remainder of the ship with cargo modules loaded with drugs and other medical
equipment, and sent it on its way. As escort, three mobilized type S scout/couriers
were sent along. Because the Gyro Cadiz was capable of only jump-1, it was forced
to make several jumps to deep space, and then jump again to a world destination;
its auxiliary fuel tank provided this capability.

Being streamlined, the ship and its scout escorts were capable of refuelling on
worlds with oceans as well as at gas giants. This ocean refuelling capability was
perhaps a safer method, if only because enemy ships were less likely to be in a
system without a gas giant.

In any case, Gyro Cadiz left Vanejen on 101-984. Twenty-four weeks later, the
ship was routinely posted as overdue, and earned the official designation of missing
after thirty-two weeks, on 326-984. Further word was not forthcoming.
The answer came a hundred years later, in the aftermath of a fringe skirmish of
the False War (1082 to 1084). Naval patrol ships reconning the Treece system
(Lanth subsector) found, and destroyed, a Shivva class patrol frigate (Zhodani,
obviously) in the process of refuelling. Afterwards, while checking out the rest of
the system, the navy found a single scout/courier in a cometary orbit.
It proved to be one of the scouts from the Gyro Cadiz task force, its crew dead,
its power cells long since drained. Its entire memory banks were contaminated and
unreadable, with the only clue to the fate of the task force contained in the diary
of a crewmember.

The second officer of the ship, a scout named Wen Livern, fancied himself an
epic poet, and transcribed the entire history of the task force, from its formation
on Vanejen in 984, in the form of a long, amateurish epic.

The work runs 9000 lines, about 100,000 words. Such statistics, however, do
not describe it. Arranged in seven chapters, the lines are further divided into groups
of three to ten (typically four) lines each, expressed in thought rhyme, also known
as parallelism. The effect is amateurish, the style didactic. There is little meter, and
no word or tone rhyme. The poem is terrible reading, and few ever have.
A few samples from the epic will serve to illustrate the style, construction, and
quality.


We fought to save the Imperium, / and struggled to vanquish the mutineers.


The lines are synonomous parallelism, also known as thought rhyme. The second
line is a thought rhyme of the first, repeating in synonyms the thought of the first.
To the uninformed, the lines may simply sound redundant.


The choking dust was our bane, /but our lone ship fed our lungs.


These lines are antithetic parallelism, where the second thought is in contrast to
the first.


The wolves and bears clawed at the roof, / and drove us deeper into the cata-
combs of mystery.


This third form is climactic parallelism, where the the second line amplifies and
expands the thought of the first.

## ADMINISTERING THE EPIC

Assuming that the concerned adventurers wish to examine the manuscript of the
epic, they may do so, and can be informed of some of the basic details of the poem.

However, all attempts to read and study the poem should meet with failure, prob-
ably through sheer boredom. After starting any portion of the epic, the individual
will stop within fifteen minutes and express a desire to do almost anything other
than read this epic.

Two readily obvious answers to the problem can help through this process.

First, a scholar can be hired to give his ideas or thoughts on the matter. Cost
may be high, and the person's silence is not assured. Assume at least Cr10,000 for
the basic analysis of the manuscript. In addition, the person will want to publish
the findings (in the local computer net) immediately.

Second, the manuscript can be fed into the computer (optical scan makes it
non-boring), and it can be synopsized for easier reading. For impact, assume that
the first run of the program is set for maximum reduction: the print-out result is
two words— "We died."

Fiddling with the program parameters (specifying synopsization percentage,
word count, reading level, and other factors) should eventually produce the epic
synopsis presented on the next few pages. The text should be made available to
the characters for perusal at their leisure.



## THE TEXT OF THE EPIC

The following is a computer-synopsized text of the epic of Twilight's Peak.


> [!NOTE]
> The task force left Vanejen with a cargo of pharmaceuticals for Regina.
> It consisted of four ships: three scouts and a transport.
> The transport Gyro Cadiz was a remade subsidized merchant, fitted with long range tanks.
> One scout, the Blatant Lie, was a mobilized half-pay courier with a crew of three.
> Another, the Carlisle, was a sleek new ship with a freshly trained crew.
> The last, Black Gold, was a ringer; a courier with a crew of malice and mold.
> The route we took was circuitous, intended to avoid Zhodani patrols.
> A few times, the group even jumped to deep space and then again to a world beyond.
> I fell sick at Rhylanor, and laid in bunk through weeks of suffering.
> When I recovered, we were stepping out of jump space to refuel at a world below.
> It was safer to refuel from an ocean; fewer Zhodani would be there, if they were anywhere.
> And there we still met disaster. An ion storm from the star flared as we came in.
> The Gyro Cadiz was forced to land, and it landed badly.
> The other ships scattered across many kilometers, with only the traitors near.
> Carlisle crashed, and Blatant Lie went to its aid. In that time, the blackguards made their move.
> When Blatant Lie reappeared with Carlisle's crew aboard, Gyro was under fire from Black Gold.
> The battle ensued, for hours.
> Ultimately, the battle was too intense, and Blatant Lie landed behind a hill, damaged.
> Black Gold had further crippled Gyro Cadiz, and was killing her,
> However, the hero crew had a plan.
> While Gyro drew the traitors' fire (already doing so admirably),
> the crew of Carlisle dragged four missiles to the hilltop,
> and the crew of Blatant Lie maneuvered around the crags.
> In coordinated action, they blasted the traitors and saved their comrades.
> One traitor survived, and recounted their story.
> They were impostors, with a hijacked scout and false identities.
> They had sabotaged the transport, and were in it for the black-market money.
> He died as he spoke, painfully and slowly.
> Surveying the results, the crews found that nothing would now fly,
> Not Gyro, not Blatant Lie, not Black Gold.
> Certainly not Carlisle, lying 600 kilometers distant.
> They were marooned.
> 
> A ray of hope emerged.
> Salvage of parts form some ships could make at least one work.
> Parts from Black Gold, from Gyro Cadiz, even from Carlisle could make Blatant Lie fly again.
> They mounted an expedition to Carlisle, overland, covering 600 kilometers.
> They first installed a crew in Gyro Cadiz to guard it; the rest trekked overland, 600 kilometers.
> One died along the way.
> Another died on the way back.
> But they carried some parts back. Not enough.
> The Gyro crew computer-predicted a long, bad, winter season.
> Not enough time to make another trip. They had to hole up.
> Together they had glimpsed a structure momentarily along the way.
> On a high peak, viewed in twilight, it promised shelter.
> Trekking to it, they found a tall octagon built of fine-hewn stones.
> High on a crag in a valley.
> Moving the fusion heater and crates of rations to it, they settled in for winter.
> Snow and ice hemmed them in.
> Water was easy to get, melted from snow.
> Wolves growled at the doors, and even at the windows from atop the snow drifts.
> But they survived. They even killed wolves and ate them for food.
> Almost, they went crazy. Tempers flared.
> > 
> And the wolves beat at the doors and windows.
> Once, snow on the roof threatened to collapse it.
> But they shovelled it away to save their lives, and patched the holes.
> Late in the winter, the wolves attacked again,
> And the group retreated, leaving the second floor to wolves streaming in through the windows.
> They blocked the shaft of the fireplace, and held them off for a while.
> They moved the fusion heater to hold them back, and discovered the passage leading down.
> Two floors stood below; large octagonal rooms with buttresses at the eight corners.
> They hid there at night, trusting to stone to protect them from wolves.
> On the lowest floor, they found mystic writing, to a base number eight.
> And a central altar with human bones.
> Magically, a passage down appeared, with stairs leading to the bowels of the world.
> They followed the stairs down.
> Down countless flights of stairs, past rooms of mystery, finally to a well of running water.
> Past that well to a long corridor, to another level, to a huge vault door.
> As they stood, a quake shook the chamber; as they cowered, the door swung open.
> To reveal a magic bridge of light across a vast underground river cavern.
> Beyond stood a warren of rooms of silver and gold, each different, each with fantastic artifacts.
> Leaning against the wall, a hidden switch was apparently tripped,
> And suddenly, the floor glowed orange.
> One person lost a finger-tip when he touched it.
> Another hidden switch was tripped— and holographic visions of food appeared as mirages to
> Tantalize the famished crews.
> One gave in to temptation, and clawed his way into the vision.
> Whereupon it materialized, as real meat, real fruit, and real drink.
> Other rooms held null-G sleeping berths, areas with mystic columns for no apparent purpose,
> Or fabulous crystal eggs larger than six people.
> In the farthest back room, a huge globe of the world stood and revolved in real-time.
> It responded to their touch, and (by looking close) they could see where they had landed.
> The stayed in the rooms, warm and away from the wolves and cold of the surface, for days.
> But nowhere was there anything to carry away, nor to help in their plight.
> They turned back, only to find the magic bridge of light gone and the vault door closed.
> They rigged ropes and slings and swung four of their six across before the bridge clicked on.
> To allow the remaining two to just walk across the chasm.
> As they did, the bridge turned red, and turned off again just as the last stepped off it.
> As they sighed relief, the vault door swung open, and they left hurriedly.
> Many times they came back, but never again did the door open.
> 
> In spring, they mounted another expedition to the crashed Carlisle, and salvaged parts.
> They fixed Blatant Lie enough to jump, and three were chosen to make the voyage.
> It jumped and stuttered through the system and finally made a single hop.
> And came out in the wrong place.
> A battle raged in the system, and as the ships fought,
> The Blatant Lie hid, hoping its side would win.
> One torpedo from the fighting never hit a target, and streamed on alone, until it caught
> Blatant Lie in its sensors and moved closer, exploding to blank the scout's screens.
> And disable its drives.
> Without drives, the ship could not maneuver, and no one heard its calls for help.
> The belligerents left, first one side retreating, then the other pursuing.
> Left alone, the scout and its heroic crew settled into the vacuous night and died.

# Referee's Notes

This adventure is written to play like a novel or a story. It begins innocently
enough, and slowly builds to several different climaxes. Each should be carefully
handled, and each requires some active involvement on the part of the referee.
The Search. Starting at Regina, the group of adventurers is involved in merchant
trading (with 03,500,000 needed to fix their ship) and also casually looking for
more information on Twilight's Peak— a potential source of the money they need.

This period of search is the time to implant much of the information that will
be useful in the later portions of the adventure, such things as the history of the
Spinward Marches and the continuing Zhodani threat to the Imperium, the com-
petition between Tukera and Oberlindes (actually a red herring for this adventure),
the Shivva class Zhodani patrol frigate, and the fact that the Zhodani invaded this
part of the Marches and were thrown back in the last war.

All of this information, interspersed between the facts of the Octagon Society,
should make the search an interesting one, and set the stage for the next step.
The Octagon. Once the group has settled upon Fulacin as the site of Twilight's
Peak, the group must move there, and they must deal with the company that runs
the starport and controls the planet. These dealings are crucial, because they make
what follows realistic. First, note that one sea on Fulacin is named the Shivva Sea.

Next, make sure that the group realizes that the local authorities do not want
anyone poking around on Fulacin, but that they reluctantly grant licenses so as
not not make a fuss. Finally, some areas (especially near the starport) should be
off limits to travellers, with armed guards and big fences, enough to make people
suspicious, but not enough to attract the Imperial authorities.

The Zhodani Base

The starport has enough clues to indicate (at least in hind-
sight) that it is a secret Zhodani base, established some years ago after the last war.
At that time, the Zhodani realized that they needed an advanced base to support
the reduction of Rhylanor— their attempt to use Porozlo will not work again.

They bought into MagnetoDynamics through some dummy companies, and have
placed their own personnel in key positions. They have also placed Zhodani troops
at the starport as security guards; it would be easy enough to conceal their identi-
ties by calling them mercenaries.

Some time after the group leaves to search for Twilight's Peak, the local officials
will have second thoughts and send troops after them, to silence them permanently.
Twilight's Peak. Meanwhile, the group will have found the Octagon shelter
and begun exploration. The Octagon itself has many of the elements of a haunted
house and should be treated like one, milking it for cheap thrills and scare tactics.

When everyone is down on the lower levels, a platoon of 40 Zhodani troops
should appear, arriving in grav vehicles. They consist of 35 men with gauss rifles and
cloth armor, 4 men in battledress with PGMP-13s, and one officer with a laser car-
bine. The officer is psionically trained to medium strength in telepathy and clair-
voyance. The arrival of these troops should drive the adventurers down deeper into
the catacombs, the troops right on their heels in a running gunbattle.

The Alien Base

Once at the vault door (if the atmosphere of fear is not enough
already), the trapper can attack, creating enough fear to open the vault door.
The alien base is thekry — it is a planetary defense installation. Its weaponry is
enough to destroy any Zhodani ships (the three ships visible in orbit can be recog-
nised by anyone familiar with the class as Shivva patrol frigates), the Zhodani
installations at the starport (including three more frigates, not visible from the
ground but revealed through the power of the globe), and even the troops who are
above ground. In addition, the local Droyne in the base can (if handled correctly)
assist in driving off the troops outside.

If things work out successfully, the group will have destroyed a major Zho-
dani base intended to support the siege of Rhylanor in the upcoming Fifth Frontier
War. Their exploits may not be believable to the authorities, but there are several
rewards that are possible for the group.

First, there is the cargo of drugs (if it is not destroyed in the fighting). Truth
drug sells for Cr5000 per dose and Combat Drug for CR750. Assuming sale of the
goods at 50% (for quick sale of all of them) that is still a tidy profit. The radiation
therapy drugs are all out of date and worthless.

Second, such artifacts of high technology as can be grabbed from the Ancient
base could be of great value: the anti-matter battery alone is priceless. Against this
is balanced the fact that most objects will be incomprehensible to humans.

The Ancients

One last point should be made clear. The evidence is in after the
discovery of Droyne in an Ancient base. The Droyne are the Ancients. The Droyne
in the base are true Ancients, and date from that era 300,000 years ago. Somehow,
this base escaped destruction in their wide-ranging war. The Droyne that are to be
encountered within and outside the Imperium are degenerate descendents of the
Ancients, although that fact is not widely known.

The warriors, if revived, will be able to read the intent, if not the thoughts, of
the adventurers and the pursuing Zhodani, and will base their reactions on their
assessment of the situation, their motive being to protect the base from damage.

Each warrior is armed with a disintegrator pistol (using the same principal as the
nuclear damper in Mercenary). The pistol's targetting mechanism is complex and
telepathic: to fire, the warrior looks at the target and imagines it gone. Control is
sufficiently precise to vanish one man from a crowd or destroy a party's weapons
while leaving everything else intact. The only limitation is that the warrior must
see his target while firing; the pistol never misses and there is no defense. If a
human comes into possession of one of these pistols, he will be unable to fire it
(or figure out how it is fired) unless he is a trained telepath of at least level 10.

The Droyne warriors know very little of the technology of the base, being able
to work only their pistols and those installations described in detail in this book,
such as the food and waste disposal systems.

After the immediate task of defending the base is over, the Droyne warriors will
quickly discover that there are no members of the leader caste available to issue
commands to them. Bereft of purpose, they will initiate a self-destruct sequence,
with a few hours delay to enable the adventurers to get clear, which will destroy the
base, its polar companions, and the warriors.

More Adventures

Fulacin has more potential for adventure for any group. There
are groat herds to harvest, the other alien bases at the poles to investigate (maybe
not for long, though), and even a long trek overland if the battle at Twilight's Peak
destroys the group's air/raft.
