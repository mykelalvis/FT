# DETAILS

Ruby is one of two planets in the system and is the nearest to the sun. The second planet is a gas giant.

Ruby 0205 B400445–B S I NI G Ruby is a small desert world without an atmosphere. The colony has a population of around 40,000, all of whom live in a single city consisting of four pressure domes built on top of a network of underground tunnels.

Ruby was originally settled in 339 as a mining colony but once richer deposits were found on Jewell, the world was abandoned as the colonists were enticed to join the expanding industry on Jewell. The next 300 years saw forces of [[Zhodani]] occupy the planet during the first two Frontier Wars but there were never any permanent settlements.

The settlement was re-established in 634 by a small group of colonists lead by Papaieie Sawaiu. With a small amount of funding from the Jewell government, the colony reopened the [[lanthanum]] mines and traded their mineral ore for food with neighboring systems. Falls in metal prices caused problems for the expanding colony but the Imperium’s decision to establish a scout base nearby brought jobs and money to the planets failing economy.

This event marked the beginning of a new era on Ruby. The new scout facilities and B class starport helped establish trade routes and Ruby began to prosper. Several new domes were built to accommodate the growing population and expansion eventually halted at its current capacity.

# ATTITUDES

For the most part, the people of Ruby are friendly and welcoming. However, due to Ruby’s position as a ‘front line’ world it has endured the brunt of the Frontier Wars and the people here have evolved a strong distrust of the [[Zhodani]] and, to a lesser degree, the Vargr.

Unlike many people who have lived through wars and survived occupations, the people of Ruby are pacifists. They are also very democratic and the concept of privilege and status is distasteful to them. Everyone has equal rights, so there is no class structure or discrimination. This social structure is the legacy of Papaieie Sawaiu and his colonists.

# LAWS

All Imperial citizens are permitted to land on Ruby; other travellers must register with the port authorities. Use of psionics is banned unless authorized by the government. Non-medicinal drugs, weapons and software programs are all illegal.

There is also a strict anti-violence law on Ruby that is largely enforced by offworlders and mercenaries who do not share the local ethics. The laws are clearly explained to all new arrivals and any violation is met with swift deportation to Jewell and often results in confiscation of weapons.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Sawaiu

[[Trip-340.jpg|"Map"]]

Sawaiu is the only settlement on Ruby, consisting of the ‘upper city’ and the ‘underside’.

The upper city is comprised of four themed pressure domes. Sawaiu Dome has a tropical climate, Isgiidu is a snowy wilderness, Summondamus is a desert region and Taenu Diran consists of grasslands and meadows.

The starport is located near Sawaiu Dome and a transport tunnel provides easy access to and from the starport. The domes are interconnected with transport tunnels and each one also provides access to the underside, a vast underground tunnel network where the residential and commercial districts are situated.
