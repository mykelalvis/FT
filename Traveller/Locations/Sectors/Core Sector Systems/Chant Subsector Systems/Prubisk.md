**Prubisk** is a nonindustrial fluid world.

*   A fluid world has an oceanic geography consisting of heavily contaminated water or a substance such as ammonia, methane, hydrocarbons, or other exotic liquid.
*   It requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. Having to import most manufactured and high tech goods drives the price up for these items at this world.
*   It is a member of the Third Imperium in the [[Chant Subsector]] of [[Core Sector]] in the [[Domain of Sylea.]]
*   This world has an Imperial [[Naval Base]], capable of handling warships.
