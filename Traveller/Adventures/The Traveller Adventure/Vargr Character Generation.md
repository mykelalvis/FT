# Vargr Character Generation

Along the coreward border of the [[Imperium]] lies the territory collectively called the Vargr Extents. Covering an area of about nine sectors. the Extents are dominated by an intelligent race called Vargr. Physically, Vargr are not very impressive. A typical Vargr is about 1.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 60 kilograms. They are upright bipedal carnivores. rear limbs digitigrade, with hands very similar in size and appearance to those of a human, although there are significant internal differences. They have approximately the same physical parameters as humans and are able to use the same equipment without modification or additional instruction. On the average. Vargr reactions are slightly faster than those of the typical human. but individuals vary widely. Vargr are physically weaker than humans and the construction of their legs puts them at a mechanical disadvantage in combat; they have difficulty in punching or kicking. The Vargr senses of smell and sight are superior to those of humans.

### Origins

Vargr were for years a puzzle to Imperial sophontologists. Vargr biochemistry and genetic makeup are almost identical with a number of terrestrial animals, but differ radically from most of the flora and fauna indigenous to Lair, the purported Vargr homeworld. Researchers during the early years of the Third Imperium concluded them to be the result of genetic manipulation of transplanted [[Terra|Terran]] animals of the family Canidae and almost certainly the genus Canis. The obvious conclusion. which is supported by archeological evidence, is that the long-dead race known as the Ancients was responsible.

## VARGR SOCIETY

Vargr society is characterized by endemic and rapid social the upper levels of Vargr society'. and actions are based on broad coalitional concerns with a constant splitting and re146

change. The key elements which shape Vargr society are a very strong centrifugal (outward or disruptive) force resulting from an emphasis on consensus and informal lines of authority, and an equally strong centripetal (inward or unitingl force resulting from ingrained family-clan-tribenation loyalty. Centralized authority is extremely limited at

joining of dissident factions. Traditionally, this has made it very difficult for more centralized and organized societies such as the [[Imperium]] to deal on a meaningful basis with what passes for Vargr states.

### Government

There is no central Vargr government; indeed. there is no governmental type that can be said to be "typically Vargr". Every conceivable form of governmental organization can be found somewhere in the Vargr Extents. The two states described in Library Date (the Thoengling Empire and the Commonality of Kedzudhl are reasonably typical. The only cohesive force in the Extents is a fierce racial pride which causes a slight tendency towards racial cooperation. The higher the level of the Vargr government, the more unstable it becomes because of the difficulty of obtaining consent of all Vargr involved.

### Charisma

Vargr are gregarious, but their group behavior

is characterized by a constant struggle for dominance within the group. The ability to exert personal authority over others derives from an individual's prestige and force of personality. The Vargr have various words to describe this important personal characteristic, but humans call it charisma. Individuals with high charisma are likely to become leaders in groups, even if they do not otherwise have the talent or skill to lead properly. The result is often a charismatic leader who is not truly suited to lead, and a constant splintering of groups as rivals exert their influence over parts of the group and draw them away from the larger whole.

## VARGR PERSONALITIES

Vargr characters vary widely just as do humans. Almost

any behavior is permissible. and a great degree of inconsistency is almost required. Vargr have little respect for formal authority. This respect decreases as the authority becomes more remote. Vargr generally have more respect for more informal authority figures lvvith high charisma) and
are more likely to obey superiors with whom they are closely acquainted than strangers.

Vargr have an intensive racial pride, and are easily insulted. They are prone to enter into fights without regard for possible consequences.

Vargr social organization is difficult to characterize in human terms. Even amongst the most stable Vargr governments, a highly charismatic leader can attract followers for almost anything. The neighbors of the Vargr are constantly the subject of impromptu raids and scattered piracy by bands of Vargr ltotally without government sanction, of course) who have been talked into raid. battle. or war by a charismatic leader.

## VARGR CHARACTERS

All Vargr characters begin the game the same way: untrained. inexperienced. and about 18 years of age. Each character is generated with a series of die rolls. He or she then embarks on an abstract career in order to gain skills and experience. Eventually, the character leaves the service, receives rnustering out benefits, and is ready to begin adventuring.

Initial Vargr Character Generation: Vargr characters are described by six characteristics. Five of the six are the same as for humans: strength, dexterity, endurance, intelligence, and education. Vargr do not have social standing; instead they have a parallel attribute; charisma.

Vargr strength and endurance are slightly less than those of humans; for these two characteristics roll 2D1. Vargr have a slightly higher dexterity; for dexterity, roll 2D-i1. For intelligence and education, roll 2D. Finally, roil 1D for charisma. Record the results on paper.

Values for the six generated characteristics may range initially from 1 to 13. As a result of various modifications. characteristic values may range from 1 to 15. For player characters the values of characteristics may not exceed 15: they do not go below 1 except for the results of calamitous injury or aging.

The Universal Personality Profile:
Vargr characters use the same universal personality profile (the UPPl as humans. Characteristics are listed as a string of six digits in the order originally rolled: strength, dexterity, endurance. intelligence. education, and charisma (in place of social standing).

### Naming

Once generated, the character should be named. The individual player may determine an appropriate name.

### Titles

Vargr characters do not have titles in the same sense as noble titles for humans. There is no consistent system for the assignment of such titles. However, any Vargr character with charisma of A or greater has enough dominance within a group of Vargr to allow the selection of an appropriate title, and the ability to make that title stick. Acceptance of such a title depends entirely on the charisma of the Vargr character.

CHARACTERISTICS



Strength20 - 1 l is both a general evaluation of the character's physical ability and a specific measure of force which may be applied.

Dexterity (2!) + 1) measures physical coordination.

Endurance (2D- 1l measures personal determination and stamina.

intelligence l2Dl corresponds to IE1.

Education l2D) indicates the highest level of schooling attained by the individual.

Charisma l1Dl indicates relative dominance within a group of Vargr.

## ACQUIRING SKILLS AND EXPERTISE

Any newly-generated Vargr character may choose one of these six services lhlavy, Corsairs, Army, Emissaries, Merchants, and Loner), and attempt to enlist.

Only one initial enlistment attempt is permitted per character. If rejected for enlistment, he must submit to the draft. Draft is not allowed after age 18. Any character who is discharged may attempt to enlist in a service not previously served in.

### The Draft

A character who is drafted enters a randomly chosen service. Note that it is possible for a character to be drafted into the very service which had just previously rejected an enlistment. Draftees are not eligible for commissions during their first term of service; they do become eligible during the second and subsequent terms of service if they reenlist.

### Tenns of Service

Each term of service represents a period of four years.

### Survival

During each term, a character must successfully threw his service's survival throw; failure results in death.

#### Optional Rule

If the referee or player chooses, prior to character generation, a failure of the survival roll can be converted to injury. The character is not dead; instead he or she is injured, and leaves the service lafter recovery) having served only two years of the four year term. The short term is not counted for mustering out benefits.

### Commissions

Each service (except emissaries and lonersl has a commission number; in order to be commissioned as an officer. the character must throw the stated number or greater; DMs may apply to the throw. If the commission is achieved, the character receives rank 1 in the service. A character may attempt to acquire a commission once per term of service until successful, but a draftee may not attempt to acquire a commission in the first term of service.

### Success

Each term, a character may attempt success: that is, to succeed in some endeavor within the service. Success can provide increase in rank and charisma, but failure can result in demotion. discharge. and loss of charisma. To attempt success, roll 2D on the success table. Each service has a success number and DMs affecting that success throw. On a high throw, the character advances in rank and charisma. On a low throw. the character suffers demotion, discharge, or loss of charisma. A character is eligible for one success per term of service.

In the emissaries and the loners, the non-rank aspects of success lcharisrna gain or loss, gain of skills. and discharge) still apply.

### Skills and Training

During each term of service. a character has the opportunity to acquire personal skills and expertise. Allowances are made for the acquisition of new skills based on service. duty. commission. and success.

Skills are acquired by rolling on the acquired skills table once for each skill allowed, using one die. There are four

tables, each containing different generai types of skills. One of the tables is chosen before the die is rolled, and the single die roll determines the specific skill acquired.

Of the four acquired skill tables, the first three may always be used by a character. The fourth is available only to characters who have charisma of at least 6. Characters receive two skills for completing the first term of service: they receive one skill upon completion of each subsequent term of service. Each character receives one skill upon being commissioned. Each character receives one skill each time success is achieved: success is defined as a throw of 8+ on the success table.

Some skills are automatically acquired by a character (without using eligibility) by virtue of rank or service. These automatic skills are listed on the rank and service skills tabie.

### Reenlistment

Each character must roll for reenlistment at the end of each term of service. if the roll is successful. the individual may reenlist. If the result is 12 exactly, the character must reenlist. However, if the character has been discharged by failing the success throw, the reenlistment throw is ignored.

### Retirement

A character may serve up to seven terms of service voluntarily, and may leave after any term (provided mandatory reenlistment - a reenlistment throw of 12 exactly - does not occur). A person may retire any time after the end of the fifth term. Retirement grants the individual an annual retirement pay lin addition to any mustering out benefits): rates of retirement pay are shown in the retirement pay table. Retirement is mandatory for an individual
who has completed a seventh term of service. However, persons who throw mandatory reenlistment must instead serve that additional term of service.

## MUSTERING OUT

When a character leaves the service (for any reasonl. he or she is eligible for mustering out benefits. The two mustering out tables indicate the nature of these benefits: one provides travel, education, and material benefits, while the other provides cash severance pay. Each table is matrixed by service and a single die roll. When mustering out of the service, a character is allowed to consult these tables based on total terms of service and on final rank.

One benefit roll is allowed for each full term served lif. under the optional survival rule, a character serves only half a term, that term is not counted toward muster-out). Additionally. a character who has received rank 1 or 2 receives one extra roll. A character who has received rank 3 or 4 receives two extra rolis. A character who has received rank 5 or 6 receives three extra rolls and, in addition, may apply a DM of +1 to die rolls on the skills and benefits table. Any character who has acquired gambling skill may add + 1 to the die roll on the cash table: any character who is retiring may also add11; any loner who has prospecting skill may add +1.

A character is free to choose between the benefits table and the cash table, but no one may consult the cash table more than three times during the mustering out process.

### Discharge

An individual who is discharged because of failure of the success throw is eligible for a lowered level of mustering out benefits. Reduce the total number of rolls by one. An individual is eiigible for muster-out benefits each time he or she is discharged.

## AGING

When a character reaches 34 years of age (the end of the fourth term of service) aging begins to take its toll. The aging table must be consulted then, and thereafter at four year intervals. This table shows each of the characteristics affected, and the throws necessary to avoid the effects of aging. If a specific throw is failed, then the reduction indicated is applied to the characteristic.

### Aging Crisis

If, as a result of aging. a characteristic is reduced to zero, the character is considered to have had an aging crisis and become quite ill. A basic saving throw of 8+ applies to avoid death (subject to a DM for the expertise of any attending medical skill). if the character survives, recovery is made immediately (under siow drug, which speeds up the body chemistry). The character ages (one die equals the number of months in added age under slow drug) immediately, but also returns to piay without delay. The characteristic which was reduced to zero automatically becomes 1. This process occurs each time (and for each characteristicl a characteristic is reduced to zero. In the event that slow drug is not available, the individual is incapacitated for the number of months indicated if the basic throw of 3+ is successful.

### Disability

Characters may quit adventuring when they reach age 66, if any one physical characteristic (strength, dexterity, or endurance) permanently equals 1, or if the sum of all 'three physical characteristics equals 10 or less. When a character quits adventuring, he or she leaves the game, taking along ail money and possessions. The player is then free to generate a new character. Quitting due to disability is available to allow players to maintain reasonably competent characters.

## CAREER TYPES

The six career types generated here are general careers which exist in Vargr society. The services shown are intended for Vargr; humans may not undertake them.

### Navy

Members of the interstellar space navy which patrols the space between the stars. The navy has responsibility for the protection of society from lawless elements in the interstellar trade channels and from foreign powers.

### corsairs

Members of an armed fighting force which includes integral space transport and ground troops. Corsair bands operate as pirates and mercenaries. They may find temporary employment with a government, but usually do not possess a permanent home.

### Army

Members of the planetary armed fighting iorces. Soidiers deal with planetary surface actions, battles, and campaigns. They may also serve as mercenaries for hire.

### Emissaries

Individual bargainers or arbitrators employed by Vargr governments and other powers. The fragmentation of Vargr society has resulted in strong need for interrnedieries who can assist in resoiving disputes.

### Merchants

Members of the commercial enterprises. Merchants may crew the ships of the large trading corporations, or they may work for the independent free traders which carry chance cargos and passengers between worlds.

### Loners

Individual Vargr who operate alone. Two typical career paths are included in this category: prospector and criminal.

## SKILLS

The skills presented for human character generation in The Traveller Book are also appropriate to Vargr. There are three additional skills: infighting, liaison. and prospecting.

### inﬁghting

The individual is skilled in the aspects of closein combat peculiar to Vargr. It is similar to the human brawling skill.

infighting allows the use of teeth at close range or claws at short range, with a DM oi ~+- 2 to hit. In addition, a Vargr receives a DM of +1 if his charisma is higher than his opponent's; Vargr always have a higher charisma than nonVargr.

infighting skill also allows surrender by an individual losing the fight if both individuals have infighting skill. The surrender is given by simply quitting the fight and going limp: the winner automatically accepts the surrender. if the winner is of lower charisma than the loser, the two exchange charisma values (but a rise in charisma may not exceed 3 pointsl.

### Liaison

The individual is trained in the art of dealing with others; this skill is usable in relations with members of military units, citizens in a community, and with alien or foreign cultures.

The individual is trained to subordinate his or her own views and prejudices where they may conflict with those being held by the individual being dealt with. As a result, greater cooperation may be achieved, and substantial progress in mutual projects made. Liaison is primarily used as a positive DM on the reaction table.

### Referee

Liaison is similar to both streetwise and admin skills. Streetwise tends to deal with unsavory aspects of society, while admin deals with the formal bureaucratic structure. Liaison is a formal training that spans both, but also extends to contact with alien cultures. Liaison may be used as the equivalent of the next lower level of either streetwise or admin where necessary; thus, liaison-2 is the equivalent of streetwise-1.

### Prospecting

The individual is experienced in searching out mineral deposits on world surfaces and in deep space.

This skill allows an individual greater likelihood of discovering mineral deposits. In any situation calling for such a search, this skill allows a favorable DM for success. This skill alone is not sufficient for the discovery of vast mineral wealth, but it does provide greater probability of an individual discovering what is there.

### Default Skills

Often, some characters will have no skills appropriate to a given situation. A journey across a vacuum plain may be called for, and no one has vacc suit skill. In such cases. the referee may indicate that all individuals not otherwise skilled have vacc suit-0. A level of 0 for a skill indicates that the individual can undertake ordinary activities, but is not experienced enough to try dangerous activities or fancy actions. Level-0 indicates an orientation to the skill by an experienced person; it should not be taken as a stepping stone to level-1 . Skills appropriate for level-0 are: air/raft, ATV, forward observer, steward, vacc suit, and weapons.

### Maximum Skills

As a general rule of thumb, a character may have no more skills (or total levels of skills) than the sum of his or her intelligence and education. For example, a character with UPP 77894-A would be restricted to a total of 13 combined skills and levels of skills. This restriction does not apply to level-O skills.
Vargr Character Generation

## MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS

in addition to the skills acquired while actually in service, the following skills and substantial rewards can be acquired through the mustering out procedures.

### Retirement Pay

Any character' who leaves a service at the end of the fifth or later term in service luniess discharged for failure of 'a successthrowl is considered to have retired, and receives retirement pay as indicated on the retirement pay table. However, each year when the payment is clue. that payment and all future payments are lost on 10+ ldue to a change in the paying organization).

### Money

The cash table indicates specific amounts of money which become available.

### Passages

The skills and benefits table includes passages. or tickets. for travel. They include high passage. middle passage, and low passage.

### Material Objects

The mustering out procedure can provide weapons or starships.

### Weapons

The benefits table can provide blade or gun, and the character may select an appropriate weapon. If. while mustering out, the same benefit is received again. the character has the option of taking another example of the same weapon, selecting a different weapon, or taking the benefit as +1 in skill in the weapon previously received.

### Starships

Three types of starship can become available as mustering out benefits: a corsair's raiding ship, a free trader, and a prospecting seeker. These ships are described below. All three types are assumed to be fully paid for; the character is responsible for all operating expenses. After a character has received a starship as a benefit'. subsequent' such rolls are ignored.

#### Vargr Corsair (type VP)

Using a 400-ton hull, the Vargr corsair is an interstellar raiding vessel used by bands of Vargr brigands. it mounts jump drive-D, maneuver drive-K. and power plant-K, giving a performance of jump-2, and 5G acceleration. Fuel tankage for 130 tons supports the power plant and one jump-2. Adjacent to the bridge is a l'v1odell2 computer. There are 12 staterooms and five emergency low berths. The ship has four hardpoints and four tons allocated to fire control. installed on the hardpoints are four triple turrets: two carry triple beam lasers and two carry triple missile racks. There are three ship's vehicles: two Gcarriers, and one modular cutter. The modular cutter has two open modules, and space in the hold is provided for the spare. Cargo capacity is 20 tons.
The Vargr corsair requires a crew of ten: pilot, navigator, 3 engineers, medic, and 4 gunners. The ship can easily carry a crew of 24, which would include raiders or boarding party members. Ship's vehicles are operated by available skilled personnel. The ship does not normally carry passengers.

## FORMATS

Vargr characters may be referred to in the same way as human characters. By default, characters are assumed to be human unless otherwise identified. Therefore, Vargr characters should carry the identification Vargr somewhere in the description, preferably before the character's service.

Because Vargr may change services. it is possible for a character to have more than one service; specifying any services previous to the final one is not necessary. If a player does elect to note previous services. they may be indicated after the number of terms served. The example of Gvoudzon shows this format.
