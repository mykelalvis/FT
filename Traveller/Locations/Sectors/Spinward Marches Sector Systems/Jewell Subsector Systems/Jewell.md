Jewell is the primary planet in the Jewell Cluster and is both heavily industrialised and militarised. Full details can be found on page 51 (Keystone).

The Jewell system has two gas giants and two planetoid belts. Jewell occupies the third orbit in the system. There are four additional planets, all of which are uninhabited.

Jewell 0306 A777999 C 2 I Hi Ht In G Jewell is the core planet in the Jewell Cluster and is a far cry from the world that its name suggests. Discoloured clouds fill the skies and the drab buildings are covered in grime. The pollution created by the vast industries is now worse than the natural taint in the atmosphere. Short-term exposure is not fatal but long-term exposure can lead to respiratory diseases and various types of cancer. Masks are provided free of charge to any visitors who need them.

The first colonists arrived on Jewell in 318 and established a few small, independent, settlements. Years later, discoveries of [[lanthanum]] deposits lead to rapid industrialization and technological improvements. With rising tensions against the Zhodani, military bases were built to defend against any possible attack.

Jewell was on the front line during the First Frontier War and the Imperial Navy forces failed to repel the [[Zhodani]] attack in 592, resulting in their occupation of the planet. A campaign was launched to retake the world and in 603 Jewell was once again under Imperial control.

Improved defences successfully fought off several attacks during the Second Frontier War but additional forces and facilities were added to ensure that it would hold against further attacks. The Imperium’s foresight paid off and Jewell became a staging point for Imperial forces during the Third and Fourth Frontier Wars.

# ATTITUDES

Fashion is not something that exists for the six billion inhabitants of Jewell as most people wear drab but practical clothing. Combined with the filter masks they wear, the locals can seem to be unwelcoming and even intimidating to offworlders. However, once the masks are removed the people of Jewell are actually very friendly to offworlders, except with [[Zhodani]] and in some cases, Vargr.

# LAWS

All Imperial travellers must register their business and cargo before landing at the starport, anyone else is denied access to Jewell. The authorities on Jewell have banned all weapons, drugs, psionics, and information..

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Facet

The capital is a vast sprawling city, home to 12 million people and some of the largest industrial complexes on the planet. Some sections of the city, mainly the commercial districts, are domed to protect against the polluted and tainted atmosphere. The majority of buildings lie outside these zones and are sealed against the noxious air.

## Imperial Dome

This small dome is located in the centre of Facet and protects the government buildings and facilities. It also contains one of the few parks on the entire planet.

## JEWELL

Jewell is indeed a thing of great value; a more or less Terra-Prime world marred only by a slight atmospheric taint caused by volcanic outgassing. With very similar gravity and weather conditions to Earth, the world was highly suitable for colonization. The first settlement was established around 320 and conducted in an ad-hoc manner without Imperial oversight.

It was the discovery of lanthanum deposits, some time later, that caused a much more focussed colonization program to be launched, leading to industrialization and a rapid advance in technological sophistication.
Jewell was used as a forward base for further expansion into the Cronor subsector.

As tensions with the Zhodani Consulate grew, a squadron of naval vessels was deployed to the Jewell system and a base was set up to support them. This was a small installation, which was donated to the Scout Service when the Navy built a much larger base around 480.

A larger scout base was deployed a few years later and the original naval facility abandoned for a long time. Scout vessels from this base worked the communications route back into Regina via Efate and conducted both exploration and intelligence-gathering operations along the frontier. The Navy meanwhile engaged in cold war operations along the border, shadowing Zhodani ships and trying to intimidate the Consulate.

When conflict inevitably occurred, Jewell was on the front line. The system squadron and Imperial Navy forces put up a valiant fight but could not prevent the capture of the world by the Consulate in 592. Some sources claim that Grand Admiral Olav Hault-Plankwell personally led the campaign to retake the world in 603, although others disagree. Contrary to popular docu-drama cliché, he certainly did not take part in the ground fighting to retake the downport.

Jewell was strongly garrisoned after the war and has remained so ever since. During the Second Frontier War, the world came under siege for several months in 617 but held out successfully. Afterward, the scale of the world’s defences was increased yet again, with the original naval base re-opened and several other facilities constructed throughout the system. Although attacked in the Third and Fourth Frontier Wars, Jewell was able to not only repel the assault fleets but act as a base for operations into the Zhodani rear, gaining the world the somewhat fanciful media nickname of Jewell: Shining Bastion of the Marches, or the rather more mundane Imperial Breakwater. The latter refers to Jewell blunting Zhodani advances into the Marches.

Today, Jewell is something of an armed camp. Small naval bases throughout the system support squadrons of monitors and system defence boats to deny intruders access to the system’s gas giants for refuelling, while the immediate defence of Jewell itself is entrusted to one of the largest non-jump capable fleets outside Core sector. In addition, the naval base is home to the heavier elements of the 212th Fleet as well as battle and cruiser squadrons from the Sector Fleet.

Jewell is both militarised and heavily industrialised. There are numerous military bases and many high-tech industrial complexes on-planet. Pollution from the latter is now much worse than the original atmospheric taint. Breathing without a filter mask is possible, if unpleasant, and very short-term exposure is not a serious problem. However, respiratory diseases and a range of cancers can result from even a few hours’ exposure.

Clouds of brown smog are a common sight and a layer of grime quickly develops on all external surfaces. For this reason, the exterior of most structures is simply functional and tends to be both drab and filthy. Buildings on Jewell are built for efficiency without regard to aesthetics, at least on the outside.

The towns and cities of Jewell are like the people to some extent – outwardly unwelcoming but concealing something very different. When able to shed their masks and coveralls, the people of Jewell are friendly and hospitable, although not to Zhodani, and Vargr are also viewed with suspicion in some quarters. That aside, the typical Jewellite (the term Jeweller is both incorrect and liable to provoke a series of centuries-old puns that nobody finds funny but have become something of a social ritual) is demonstrative, loud and fond of strong drink, especially if there are others to share it with.  Those returning to Jewell after an absence often run a gauntlet of hugs and warm handshakes from people they only met once, accompanied by a barrage of booze.

The six billion or so inhabitants are ruled by a bureaucratic government based on the highly structured system implemented during the rapid-colonization phase of Jewell’s history. Laws are strict and robustly enforced but this causes little resentment. Jewell has been on the front lines in several major wars and its population has a rather unique outlook as a result.

The majority of citizens are members of one or another of the world’s reserve military, medical or civil defence organizations. These vary from highly efficient organizations to social clubs but all share the same outlook, the feeling that with their traditional enemies just three parsecs away, vigilance is indeed the price of peace.

Jewell is easier to get to from the Consulate than the Imperium. Jump-3 vessels can make the crossing into the Regina subsector but ships with shorter legs need to either arrange deep-space refuelling or else make a long transit around neutral space via Plaven and Emerald.  As a result, the worlds around Jewell have their own microculture, which also has local variations. It is coloured by Zhodani influences on some worlds, whereas others are vigorously opposed to anything even remotely associated with the ‘Joes’ as the Zhodani are sometimes known.
