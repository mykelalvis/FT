Ganmeids are a roughly human-sized water-breathing species that survive by filtering nutrients from the turbulent waters near the surface of [[Indshiim Ganme]]'s oceans and consuming the carcasses of dead animals found in the shallows near the coasts and on sea mounts. They communicate by emitting high-pitched sounds when at a distance but typically resort to hand signals and other forms of non-verbal communication when within a few metres of each other.
