### SCOUNDREL

By far the largest set of laws are mala prohibita , acts which are
not inherently wrong but are nonetheless unlawful. Operating
a starship is not a wrongful act but operating one without the
training and licensing required by law is illegal. In Traveller
terms the higher the planet's law level, the greater the number
of mala prohibita.

Even criminals recognize mala in se ; this book is about thieves,
smugglers and pirates, not monsters without any regard for
human life or decency. It may be necessary to kill a man, even
right to kill a man in certain circumstances but that does not
mean that the criminal kills blindly or without cause.

Criminals
While the full range of criminal activity is slightly larger than
the full range of human law, there are a few specifi c crimes
that are of special importance to Traveller games. These are
piracy, smuggling, hijacking, breaking & entering, criminal
organizations and fencing stolen goods. Three of these
are key to spacefaring games; the other three are regularly
encountered in Traveller adventures.

In addition, this book covers criminal activity and law enforcement
at different Technology Levels and presents a selection of
specialized illegal tools and vessels which those on the wrong
side of the law might use or encounter.

See The Galaxy On 30 Imperial Credits
A Day
Only a small percentage of humans ever leave the world where
they were born. Most of those who do travel make only a handful
of journeys – a business trip to visit corporate headquarters,
a once–in–a–lifetime holiday, a tour of duty with the military.
Few are regular spacefarers and even fewer are Travellers ,
making their own destiny and setting their own course amid the
stars. Most Travellers have their own ship or can afford to book
passage but for those who feel the call of deep space but have
no money, the only option is to take whatever jobs or berths will
get them offworld.

Few of these jobs are desirable. Belt mining is a cold and lonely
task; scavenging salvage is even worse, picking through the
wreckage of lost ships for usable spare parts. Others drift from
world to world, hitching or working passage on board ships.
Drifters are a curious subculture in the spaceport, a tribe without

# IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

This book covers two related _Traveller_ career paths – the Rogue
and the Drifter. The Rogue is a criminal who has rejected lawful
society and instead willingly embraced an illegal and dangerous
existence. By contrast the Drifter has failed to fi nd lawful
employment and has other choices; he does what he must to
survive. Often, this means committing crimes. Not all wanderers
are criminals but they are more likely to be familiar with the
underside of society than the average starfarer.

The galaxy is vast and strange. What is legally acceptable on
one world is punishable by death on another. Societies deal
with harmful or taboo elements in different ways. The Imperium
tries to maintain trade links but other than guarding against
piracy and enforcing the few High Laws, it has little infl uence
over law and criminality on its member worlds. The power of
the Imperium stops at the edge of the atmosphere, except for
the starport and there are plenty of gaps where an ambitious
smuggler or pirate can thrive.

Types of Crime
There are three types of law in Imperial theories of justice.

First and foremost, there are the Imperial High Laws which all
members must agree to uphold. These laws are sacred not
because of any inherent validity but because adherence to
those laws has kept the Imperium together for more than 1,
years. Meddling with the High Laws is almost unthinkable, lest
any change causes a chain of events that tears humaniti's
fragile peace to shreds.

Next, there are laws called _mala in se_ – laws punishing acts
that all humans believe are inherently evil and wrong. Virtually
every human society, even those radically transformed by
technological or environmental pressures, recognizes certain
acts as fundamentally incompatible with society. Murder, rape
and theft are always outlawed, although exact defi nitions of
what constitutes murder or rape or theft vary from society to
society. A world where the minds of every citizen are scanned
into computers and downloaded into cloned bodies may have
a very different defi nition of murder to a more primitive planet
but the act of wilfully and unjustly extinguishing another human
consciousness is seen as a crime in both cultures. _Mala in se_
exist on all worlds, regardless of law level. Even on a chaotic
world where might makes right, killing without provocation or
reason is seen as wrong.

connections or home; the scum of the spaceways. Madmen,
grifters, penniless travellers and would–be adventurers wander
from world to world by whatever means they can.

The Drifter section of this book covers rules for scavenging,
hitchhiking and other adventures, as well as notes on the drifter
lifestyle. It also covers the unique Barbarian career.

Required & Useful Materials
A copy of the Traveller Core Rulebook is needed to use this supplement. In addition, the Beltstrike adventure book has
considerably more detail on asteroid mining, while the Agent sourcebook will be of great use in criminal games.

Inspirational reading:

- Brian Aldiss' _Non–Stop_ is a classic depiction of barbarians in space.
- Many 'cyberpunk' novels include heists. _Neuromancer_ , for example, has the Straylight Run as its climax, which can be
    lifted almost word–for–word for _Traveller._
- Harry Harrison's _Stainless Steel Rat_ series, especially the early books.

Inspirational viewing:

- _Firefl y_ is great viewing for any _Traveller_ Referee but it is especially appropriate for campaigns where the characters aim
    to misbehave. Heists like the train job or the hospital raid are perfect _Scoundrel_ scenarios.
- Han Solo was a smuggler and rogue before he changed career.

Barbarians
There are a few 'lost worlds' in the Imperium. These worlds
suffered a catastrophic loss of technical knowledge, dropping
them back to a very low Technology Level. Other worlds were
seeded by the ancients and have never developed advanced
technology. Sometimes, a barbarian from such a lost world
fi nds his way offworld, usually by joining the crew of a passing
tramp merchant that stopped to take on food or water.

# SSCOUNDRELCOUNDREL C CAREERSAREERS

This chapter presents several new careers suitable for
scoundrels. Several careers (Scavenger, Hitcher, Vagabond)
can be entered without making a qualifi cation roll, like the Drifter
career in the main _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

The Belter career is detailed in the _Beltstrike_ adventure
supplement.

## INTRUDER

Intruders are specialized high–tech thieves, trained to defeat
security systems and steal especially valuable items. Most are
professionals, hired to complete a specifi c task and work as
part of a small team or on their own. A few are lone operators,
fencing what they steal.

**Enlistment** : Int 7+

- –1 DM for every previous career.

**Assignments:** Choose one of the following:

- **Hacker:** You wormed your way into computer systems and
    stole the most valuable prize of all – information.
- **Burglar:** You were the shape in the shadows, the ghost
    that fl its through the corridors without being seen.
- **Faceman:** You smiled and were just so charming that
    everyone assumed you belonged there even as you waltzed
    in and stole what you needed.

currency. At higher technology levels, he may also require the
Computers or Engineer (electronic) skills to cope with more
advanced security systems. Forgery requires the use of a
Forgery kit.

The Effect of the Forgery check determines how likely the forgery
is to pass inspection when examined. Add the examiner's
Intelligence characteristic DM to the roll.

Security
This skill covers all manner of security systems, from mechanical
locks and bolts to electronic surveillance and cameras to
computer hacking and data theft. Security is best used in
concert with other skills. For example, to use Security to pick a
lock, the character must have the Mechanic skill, while to use
Security to break an encryption code on a computer, he must
have the Computers skill. If the character lacks the requisite
skill, he may still make the attempt but suffers a –3DM to his roll.
The character needs only rank 0 in the other skill to avoid this
DM when using Security.

###### CCRIMINALRIMINAL O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

# CCRIMINALRIMINAL O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

Organised crime, smuggler rings, underground cults – some
criminal groups are run like interstellar corporations or
government agencies. These organizations have staggering
resources and equally staggering goals.

## ORGANISATION STRUCTURE

Criminal organizations usually use a cell structure, where each
member knows only a few others. This ensures that if the cell
is breached by law enforcement agents, the damage to the
organization is contained. This cell structure can be an offi cial
policy (' _We will tell you what you need to know; do not question
the space mafi a!_ ') or a loose de facto arrangement of different
gangs and sub–factions (' _Yeah, our gang boss knows Lou's
gang and they're really close to the big boss'_ ).

Membership
Organizations draw a distinction between those who merely
work for them and actual members. Only members enjoy the
protection of the organization and can draw on its resources.
Membership of an organization can be gained as a result of a
career event or benefi t (see page 12) or through roleplaying.

To become a member of the organization, the character must
swear allegiance to that organization and agree to obey its
requirements and restrictions. In exchange, he gets whatever
benefi ts membership offers and can draw on the organization's
resources.

Rank
Every organization has a ladder of ranks. New members begin
at Rank 0. Ranks are given as a reward for success and hard
work. The higher a character's Rank, the more resources he
can draw on but the more the organization expects of him.

Ranks are arranged in a pyramid; there may be thousands of
Rank 0 members but only a few Rank 4s and a single Rank 6.
An ambitious criminal may need to wait until a senior member
dies or retires before a place becomes available.

**Promotion:** A criminal has a chance of being promoted after
an especially successful mission on behalf of the organization
or after several months or years of diligent service. Promotion
is resolved by making a Trust check. The diffi culty of this check
depends on the character's current rank. If the check succeeds,
the character rises one rank. If the check fails, the character is
not promoted and may lose one Trust if it seems he pushed
too hard.

Current Rank Trust Diffi culty
0 Easy (+4)
1 Routine (+2)
2 Average (+0)
3 Diffi cult (–2)
4 Hard (–4)
5 Formidable (–6)
6 Impossible (–8)

Trust
While Rank measures a character's standing in the organization,
Trust measures how the organization's leadership think of him.
A character with a low Rank but high Trust is probably a young
member of the organization with a bright future ahead of him;
high Rank but low Trust is a senior member who is suspected of
losing his touch or of betraying the organization.

Trust is much, much more fl uid than Rank. Trust can be gained
and lost almost at the Referee's whim. In general, a character's
Trust should stay within 1–2 points of their current Rank but
this is a guideline, not a hard rule. Note that Trust can be a
negative value.

Trust Checks: Trust functions just like a skill; to make a Trust
check, roll 2d6 and add the character's current Trust. Other DMs
such as characteristic DMs may be added if appropriate; Social
Standing holds sway in a criminal organization that wishes to
appear respectable.

If a Trust Check is failed, the Referee should consider reducing
the character's Trust by 1, refl ecting his increasingly shaky
standing in the organization.

###### CRIMINAL ORGANISATIONS

Restrictions & Requirements
Restrictions are taboos for organization members, things
they cannot do. Common restrictions on criminal organization
members include revealing secrets of the organization to
outsiders or using the organization's resources for their own
private ends but can also include social restrictions, such as not
harming people from a particular ethnic group or demanding
that members avoid a particular religious faith.

Requirements are things members _must_ do. The most common
requirement is that the criminal pass on a cut of all ill–gotten
gains to the organization but other requirements may include
wearing a particular uniform or other marking or behaving in a
certain fashion.

Benefits & Resources
Benefi ts are passive boons granted by the organization – the
character's membership in the organization helps him in some
fashion. One common benefi t is protection; people know not
to cross the character, as doing so will draw the wrath of the
criminal organization. Other common benefi ts include credit
laundering facilities or easy access to illegal supplies.

By contract, resources must be actively sought out by the
character. Resources include help from other members, access
to weapons or investment, access to secret information and
so on. To access a resource, the character must make a Trust
check. Resources are divided by Rank; a character who has a
lower Rank than a resource needs may still try to request that
resource but suffers a negative DM equal to _twice_ the difference
in Ranks).

_For example, Sergei the mobster has Rank 1 and Trust 2. He
wants the organization to provide him with a Combat Implant,
which is a Rank 4 resource. He will have to roll Trust with a total
DM of –4 (+2 for his Trust score, –6 for three missing ranks) to
convince his superiors that he really needs subdermal armor
for free. If he fails the roll, then he will lose one Trust._

#### THE VRITERBEI

_'No, like_ this!' _Masaal remembered his great–grandfather
clasping his hand when he was a young child, the old man's
coarse fi ngers pressing the back of his hand in one spot,
then another. 'Practise it! This is part of your heritage!' Great–
grandfather's blind eyes glittered with tears. 'Remember it.
Remember always what you are.'_

_He had nearly forgotten. Thirty years had gone by since great–
grandfather died but his fi ngers still remembered the secret
handshake. It took all of Masaal's presence of mind not to gasp
when the offworlder greeted him at the spaceport and gave the
same handshake. His fi ngers shaking, he gave the response
just as Great–Grandfather taught him._

_'I have a proposition for you' said the stranger._

The Vriterbei are a criminal syndicate active across the
Spinward Marches. They are similar to the Mafi a/Cosa Nostra
organised crime gangs of Terra.

History
While the Vriterbei claim an ancient pedigree dating back to
the First Imperium, the fi rst verifi able record of their activity is
during the last days of the Ramshackle Second Imperium. As
the Rule of Man collapsed and worlds became isolated from one
another, new organizations and structures rose up to replace the
crumbling edifi ces of government and commerce. The Vriterbei
crime families thrived on failing worlds; they had the resources
to maintain order and commerce in places abandoned by the
legitimate authorities. At their height, from roughly –300 to 300,
the Vriterbei had considerable infl uence on dozens of worlds
across the Spinward Marches.

A concerted campaign against organised crime smashed the
Vriterbei network, driving them back underground. Where
once they ruled whole planets and controlled every aspect
of interstellar commerce across whole subsectors, they were
reduced in a matter of decades to a handful of bitter old men,
lurking in dark rooms and muttering about the good old days
when they were gangster kings. The Vriterbei survived as local
crime syndicates on dozens of worlds; they might own a slum
neighborhood or a few front businesses but their power was
only a tiny fraction of past glories.

In the last century, a series of charismatic and ambitious
Vriterbei bosses have revitalised the old organization. Once

###### CCCRIMINALRIMINALRIMINAL O O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

again, strange offworlders have visited old Vriterbei haunts
and given recognition symbols not seen in generations. The
disparate cells of the old Vriterbei network are slowly being
shaken back into life and criminals who never looked beyond
the boundaries of their neighborhood are now considering
crime on an interstellar scale.

The strength of the Vriterbei is their cultural continuity. Analysts
theorize that the Vriterbei combine the criminal ethos and familial
loyalty of the _Cosa Nostra_ with Vilani rigidity and tradition.

Activities
Anything and everything; prostitution, loan sharking, gambling,
protection money, bribery, weapons smuggling and so on. The
Vriterbei provide whatever a planet needs. They sell arms to
warlords or slaves to bored nobles but they will also smuggle
in food for starving peasants or invest in legitimate companies.
The Vriterbei want stability above all else.

Reach
The Vriterbei once had reach across the whole of the Spinward
Marches; today, they are mostly concentrated in District 268
and the surrounding subsectors.

Restrictions

- Do not speak of the Vritberei to outsiders.
- Give one–quarter of your earnings to the Vritberei elders.
- Never recruit a new member without the permission of
    your elders.
- Anarchy is not our goal; do not rock the status quo.
- Always be available to serve when called on.

Requirements

- Respect the Vritberei
- Teach your children and those you recruit the Vritberei
    ways.
- Be respectful to the poor, to women and children.

Benefits

- Vritberei members have a +2DM to all Social Standing–
    related rolls in Vritberei neighborhoods.
- Anyone killing a Vritberei member without permission will
    be destroyed by the Vritberei.

Ranks
**Rank 0 – Soldier:** You are expected to follow orders. You may
request basic fi rearms or other equipment totalling Cr. 1,000 in
any year.
**Rank 1 – Respected:** You are a respected thug. You may
launder credits through the Vritberei's front businesses. You
may request weapons worth up to Cr. 5,000 or a vehicle for
your own use. You may be given control of a small Vritberei
owned front business.

Rank 2 – Trueman: You may request a Vritberei–secured house
and have most of your living expenses paid for. The Vritberei
will also supply you with specialized training and equipment
worth up to Cr. 10,000 if needed. You may be given control of a
prestigious business.
Rank 3 – Leader: You are given a Vritberei bodyguard and a
luxury home or country villa. You may obtain needed equipment
worth up to Cr. 50,000 easily and request loans of up to Cr.
500,000. You may be given control of a very prestigious
business or a private starship.
Rank 4 – Elder: You are expected to visit Vritberei meetings
offworld once every few years. You may request up to 1MCr in
money from the organization. You may request that enemies be
eliminated.
Rank 5 – Great Elder: Your word is law within the
organization.
Rank 6 – Archon: The elder of all the elders.

#### INE GIVAR

Nobody saw it coming.

Not true. Everyone saw it coming. It is just that there was nothing
anyone could have done. The freighter cut a blazing path across
the sky as it plunged through the atmosphere, heading straight
for the baron's palace. Anti–aircraft fi re blasted it to pieces but
the pieces kept coming – kinetic–kill weapons, even improvised
ones like a hijacked freighter – are hard to stop.

In the last second before impact, someone aboard the doomed
freighter transmitted a compressed radio squeal, declaring
that the Ine Givar movement claimed responsibility for the
'extermination of the parasitic oppressors'.

History
The history of the Ine Givar is a murky and contradictory one.
Several false histories have been deliberately circulated in the
past, both by the Ine Givar themselves and by the Imperium.
Conspiracy theories cluster around the organization – some say
they do not exist and that 'Ine Givar' is just a convenient label the
media use for any terrorist group. Others claim they are funded
by the Zhodani to destabilize the Imperium or that the Imperium
deliberately created an enemy to keep the commoners in line or
that the Ine Givar is just a front for some other purpose.

The commonly accepted history of the Ine Givar traces them
to Rhylanor subsector in the late 900s, suggesting they
were founded by a disillusioned young noble who believed
the Imperium was too lax in tolerating corrupt or oppressive
governments and who grew to blame the entrenched politico–
economic system as being more concerned with propagating
itself than actually improving quality of life for Imperial citizens.
The 'modern' Ine Givar may have assimilated several other
terrorist organizations.

###### CCRIMINALRIMINAL O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

Activities
The ultimate goal of the Ine Givar is to overthrow the existing
structure of the Imperium and replace it with something more
democratic; they especially want the Imperium to intercede on
troubled worlds where disasters or corruption are endemic.
Different Ine Givar cells have different ways of advancing
this ultimate goal, ranging from protests or demonstrations to
raise awareness of the Imperium's failings, to kidnapping and
extortion to major terrorist attacks targeting the nobility, symbols
of Imperial power or lynchpins of the interstellar trade networks.

Reach
Multiple sectors. The Ine Givar is not especially powerful or
wealthy but its ideals have been transmitted across hundreds
of worlds.

Restrictions

- Do not betray the Ine Givar. Even this restriction is a
    loose one; an Ine Givar cell on one world might just shun
    a member who leaked information to the authorities but
    on another planet, the same betrayal would merit a very
    painful death.

Requirements

- Support the Ine Givar movement as best you can.

Benefits

- Ine Givar members can expect help and shelter from other
    members.

Ranks
**Rank 0 – Junior Member:** Low–level members of the Ine Givar
cannot draw on any of the resources of the organization.
**Rank 1 – Member:** Members can obtain information and funding
from the Ine Givar. The organization has an extensive database
of secret information about the Imperium and the nobility. They
also have connections who can provide weapons.
**Rank 2 – Senior Member:** A senior member can obtain a scout
ship or other small transport on loan from the organization or
request Mid Passage on board a friendly ship. Senior members
may also use the Ine Givar's connections among student
organizations, opposition political parties and other fringe
movements.
**Rank 3 – Cell Leader:** Cell leaders are responsible for
operations across a whole planet. They may request up to
Cr.100,000 in funding or supplies, as well as call in members
with some specialized skills or training (assassins, explosive
experts, psions and so on).
**Rank 4 – Co–Ordinator:** Co–ordinators are responsible for
major worlds and clusters. They have access to up to 1MCr in
credit, as well as military–grade weapons and equipment.
**Rank 5/6:** The nature of the higher ranks in the Ine Givar
depends on the truth behind the organization. This could be
anything from Zhodani psionic training to Imperial intelligence
handlers to democracy–crazed bomb throwers.

#### THE SYNDICATE

She smiled and her eyes fl ickered red for an instant, betraying
the cybernetic implants within them. 'I understand you have a
problem.'

I nodded.

'We can remove this problem. We have dealt with similar
problems before.'

'My problem is a big one.'

'We have very big guns.'

History
The Syndicate was formed by a group of retired adventurers
and ex–criminals. They had access to a half–dozen free trader
vessels and several lifetimes of contacts and criminal suppliers.
They had seen more of the Imperium than any planetary crime
lord and knew what was available out there. They realised that
there was an opening for a specialized organization of problem
solvers, smugglers, assassins and weapons dealers, a one–
stop–shop for high tech criminal supplies and they provided it.

That was more than 70 years ago; the original Syndicate
members are mostly still alive, preserved by anagathics but
other investors and crime lords have joined them on the board
of the organization. The Syndicate still offers criminal services
for hire but has branched out into incorporating local crime
organizations into an interstellar network.

Activities
The Syndicate is the criminal equivalent of a business–to–
business service. They commit relatively few crimes themselves
but instead supply weapons, offworld travel, smuggling and

###### CCCRIMINALRIMINALRIMINAL O O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

so forth. The Syndicate has been referred to as a 'shadow
Imperium', as its infl uence usually stops at the starport. They
rarely bother dealing with planetside crimes.

The Syndicate's headquarters is rumored to be on board a
converted luxury liner that moves along a pre–determined route
on the edge of known space.

Reach
Sector–wide. The Syndicate has hundreds of free traders and
smugger ships.

Restrictions

- Do not betray the Syndicate to the authorities, on penalty of
    spacing.
- Members are not permitted to own more than Cr. 100,000
    worth of property on any one planet.

Requirements

- Syndicate members are obliged to give 10% of all earnings
    to the Syndicate.

Benefits

- Syndicate members will regularly be assigned jobs from
    clients. Most of these jobs involve smuggling or other
    specialized criminal tasks such as heists or kidnappings.
- Syndicate members may obtain up to 10 ship shares for
    free; any ship obtained with these shares is property of the
    Syndicate.

Ranks
**Rank 0 – Crewman:** Syndicate crew are given a job on board
ship and may request equipment like personal fi rearms, vacc
suits and other tools.
**Rank 1 – Trusted Crewman:** Trusted crew may use Syndicate
resources to obtain supplies from across the sector. They gain
one free Mid Passage per three months.
**Rank 2 – Offi cer:** Training and cybernetic upgrades such as
Skill Augments. One free Mid Passage per month.
**Rank 3 – Commander:** Syndicate commanders are responsible
for liaising with planet–side criminals. To this end, commanders
are permitted to request virtually any armor and weapons short
of battle dress and WMDs.
**Rank 4 – Captain:** One free High Passage per month and a
Syndicate–owned ship if the captain does not already possess
a ship.
**Rank 5 – Admiral:** Command of half–a–dozen ships.
**Rank 6 – Board Member:** Access to all Syndicate resources.

#### CULT OF THE TRAVELLER

_'God is out there' said the madman. 'God is walking amongst
us. God is looking for His faithful.'_

Blood fl ows strangely in zero–gravity. Red globes danced and
fl owed along the blade of his knife as he pushed himself down
the corridor towards the next low berth.

History
The Cult of the Traveller is an underground cult, one that has
been heavily suppressed by virtually every government. The cult
stems from the teachings of a prophet (or madman) who called
himself the Watcher. He was a barbarian from a primitive lost
world who was taken to the stars by an IISS Scouting mission
in the mid–500s. The trauma of being lifted from an Iron Age
society to the Imperium shattered the barbarian's mind and he
decided that he had been taken into the realm of God.

How this delusion became a remarkably resilient religion is a
mystery; it is suggested the initial prophet was a latent telepath
who somehow created a psychic imprint that still resonates
or his book of teachings has some unique resonance for the
mentally ill. Others suggest an addictive combat drug called
Tricerin or 'trick' is responsible; it was widely abused in the 500s
and is still used to this day and can produce a psychotic state in
which addicts are extremely suggestible.

The Cult's tenets are confused and there are many different
sects but they all share certain beliefs:

- God created the universe but has now incarnated in human
    form. Some say He has incarnated to fi nd the faithful or
    to experience the human condition. The most common
    manifestation of the Cult's beliefs, though, is that God is
    trapped in human form and can only be released through
    death.
- Ritual murder is a form of communication or signalling to
    God or can point the way to God.
- God may not know Himself. If you see God, you must prove
    to Him that He is God and free him from His fl eshy prison.
- There are devils and demons who have also taken human
    form and may pretend to be God. They must be slain.

Activities
Proselytising and murder. The Cult has a number of high–
functioning sociopaths (produced through the use of the Tricerin
combat drug) and funds its activities through assassination and
mercenary work.

Reach
Limited. Cells of the Cult exist on many different worlds but there
is little or no communication between them. A lone madman
limps off a free trader and disappears into a megacity; a year
later, he has spread his twisted philosophy to another dozen
lunatics and the bodies start piling up.

Restrictions

- Do not pollute your body with impure deeds or thoughts.
- Do not listen to the blandishments of demons and sinners.

###### CCRIMINALRIMINAL O ORGANISATIONSRGANISATIONS

Requirements

- Find God. When you fi nd Him, cut Him out of His mortal
    body and restore his divinity.

Benefits

- Easy access to supplies of Tricerin (see sidebar).

Ranks
There are no ranks within the Cult and no resources it can draw
on.

#### DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF RAB-

#### WHAR IN EXILE

'We _are the rightful government of Rabwhar._ We _will re–establish
the rule of law. And_ you _have committed treason against the
state. The sentence is_ death _.'_

History
Rabwhar is a minor TL7 agricultural world in the Lunion
subsector of the Spinward Marches. A decade ago, Rabwhar's
billion–strong population fl irted briefl y with democracy. The
existing hereditary monarch was the sort who puts the 'non–
charismatic' in 'non–charismatic leader', the harvests were
failing due to a blight imported from offworld and the plan to
convert the planet's class–D port into a class–B had been
delayed by another 20 years.

A coup seized the capital city and surrounding territory and held
it for nearly three weeks before the king abdicated in favor
of his considerably more popular niece. Public opinion turned
against the revolutionaries, the army closed in on the capital

and the leaders of the coup fl ed offworld. Rabwhar forgot about
the Seventeen Day Democracy.

but the Seventeen Day Democracy did not forget about
Rabwhar. The Democratic Government–in–Exile still exists and
still claims to be the legitimate government. To survive, they
have gone underground (and taken the contents of the Rabwhar
Royal Bank with them).

Activities
The Democratic Government in Exile of Rabwhar (DGER)
has mutated into a band of pirates and raiders. They spent
the money taken from Rabwhar on outfi tting ships and hiring
mercenaries; their original plan was to return to Rabwhar in
force and demand that the new Queen resign and reinstate
them. DGER has a pirate base in the Shirene system and
preys on shipping throughout Lunion, with special emphasis on
attacking vessels heading for Rabwhar.

DGER is an uneasy compromise between pirates and civil
servants; within a few years, it is almost certain that the pirates
will win out and abandon any pretension to legitimacy on
Rabwhar or anywhere else.

Reach
Lunion Subsector

Restrictions

- Only citizens of Rabwhar may advance past Rank 3 in the
    organization.

Requirements

- Swear loyalty to the Democratic Government of Rabwhar in
    Exile.
- Pass on 10% of all cargoes taken to DGER.

Benefits

- DGER's hidden asteroid port in Shirene may be used as a
    shelter.
- As soon as DGER is reinstated, then those loyal to the true
    government will be rewarded with land grants.

Ranks
Rank 0 – Crewman: No resources.
Rank 1 – Pirate: Pirates may request the use of Combat Armor
stolen from the Rabwhar Royal Guard, as well as training.
Rank 2 – Commander: Commanders in the DGER navy may
request free maintenance of their vessels.
Rank 3 – Undersecretary: Access to the DGER treasury for
up to Cr. 100,000.
Rank 4 – Secretary: Letters of Marque, issued by DGER.
These are unlikely to stand up in court unless the government
reclaims Rabwhar.
Rank 5 – Minister
Rank 6 – Prime Minister

Tricerin Combat Drug (TL9)
A drug of Darrian origin, Tricerin production was offi cially
banned in 772. The formula for the drug was already
circulating in the criminal underworld, though and it is
comparatively cheap and easy to produce. A character
who takes a dose of Tricerin gains the following benefi ts:

- +2 to Initiative.
- Reduce all damaged suffered by two points.
- +1DM to all attacks.
- +1DM to Recon and Investigate rolls due to added
    focus.

A dose of Tricerin lasts for 1d3 hours. After this time, the
character suffers a –2DM to all actions until he rests.
Repeated use of tricerin causes hallucinations and
psychosis (after the third and subsequent doses roll END
4+, with a cumulative –1DM for every additional dose
beyond the third one). Tricerin costs 250Cr on the black
market.

###### PPIRACYIRACY

# PPIRACYIRACY

Holodramas and spacer's tales are full of pirates. Romantic
villains of the spaceways, pirates can be dastardly rogues or
wrongfully exiled nobles, swooping out of the void to steal cargos
of precious metals or to rob the jewellery from rich passengers
on a luxury liner. Those who do not travel regularly may assume
that pirates are lurking behind every asteroid and that it is a
miracle that any ship makes it to its destination.

The truth is a little more prosaic. Pirates are considerably rarer
than most people believe and also considerably less successful.
The average pirate vessel might make a dozen or more attacks
in a year, only capturing a prize if it was exceedingly lucky. Few
pirates fl y the infamous specialized corsairs – most pirates are
fl ying merchantmen and free traders with a few pop–up turrets.

Pirate Origins
Few deliberately choose the life of a pirate. Travellers might
be attracted by the romance of piracy or believe it offers vast
wealth for minimal effort. Some pirates are born – there are
pirate bases that are hundreds of years old and children born
there may know nothing else except a life of crime. Some
planets have a long tradition of piracy – a young man might
serve on a pirate vessel for a few years, then return home and
settle down with his ill–gotten wealth. Such worlds are also
likely to harbour fugitive pirate ships and benefi t from the trade
in stolen goods. Vargr raiders are especially likely to come from
long lines of pirates.

Other pirates are forced into a life of crime. A free trader crew,
down on their luck and unable to pay the crippling mortgage
on their ship go rogue and turn to piracy. Mutineers rebelling
against a cruel captain cannot return to civilization and so have
no choice but to support themselves by preying on other ships.
A crew unable to get legal jobs due to past criminal deeds might
sign on with a pirate crew, reasoning that dishonest work is
better than honest starvation.

Still other pirates are actually privateers in one form or another.
Piracy is often used as a covert method of interstellar warfare.
A duke might secretly fund a few pirate corsairs and send them
off into his neighbor's domain to pillage and disrupt shipping.
Even if the pirates only steal a few cargo ships, the neighboring
dukedom suddenly looks like a far less safe and inviting place
for a Megacorporation to invest in. Other interstellar empires
may also engage in piracy. Aslan _ihatei_ second–sons regularly
travel into the Imperium to test themselves against human
vessels and Vargr raiders are a common threat in the Spinward
Marches. Pirates with an external source of support can afford
much more powerful military–grade warships or specialized
pirate vessels like the infamous corsair design.

Piracy and Jump Travel
The nature of interstellar travel poses a problem to a would–be
pirate. It is impossible to capture a ship in jump space and any
ship capable of jump travel will use it to escape from the pirate
attacker. A pirate vessel can lurk inside the hundred–diameter
'jump shadow' of a planet, hoping to ambush and disable targets
before they reach a safe jump distance but this hundred–
diameter zone will be heavily patrolled by system defence boats
in any civilised system.

The pirates can lurk a little further out and hope to catch an
arriving ship that just jumped in with depleted fuel tanks but
such ships will always head straight to the mainworld. The
longer it takes for the pirates to bring down their prey, the closer
they get to the steel noose of SDBs.

Of course, any ship lurking around the hundred–diameter limit
is inherently suspicious. Any honest ship would either jump
away, head down to the starport or out to another world in
the system. Just fl oating 'dead' in space – loitering – quickly
draws the attention of the authorities. Pirates can risk lurking
for a while by claiming an engine malfunction or by moving very
slowly towards an orbital station or other legitimate destination
but eventually they will be noticed and challenged.

A more reliable option is to hunt down non–jump–capable
vessels en route to outer planets in the system. These cargo
ships cannot escape by jumping and because they have more
cargo space, can be a richer prize than a starship. Unfortunately,
in most systems , the planets other than the mainworld are
mining colonies, prisons and scientifi c research stations, none
of which guarantee rich prizes for the pirate.

Flamewar Warning
The viability of piracy under the Traveller rules is a long–
running and often bitter argument. Ask any old Traveller
player about the piracy debates (or about near–C rocks or
exactly what a feudal technocracy is) and watch his face
contort in pain. This book assumes that piracy is viable
but uncommon, that ships are rarely captured and that
most pirates are barely able to survive on their ill–gotten
gains. This means that pirates are common enough to be
a threat to Player Characters but not so common that they
would be constantly hunted by the navy.

Piracy may work differently in your Traveller universe;

###### PPIRACYIRACY

#### TYPES OF PIRATE

There are several common pirate strategies but they all share
a few elements in common. The aim of any pirate is to locate
an unarmed or lightly armed target, disable it so it cannot jump
away or escape to safety, extract the most valuable items – not
necessarily cargo – and then vanish without being intercepted
by the authorities.

Jumpcusser
The lowest and most common form of pirate is the so–called
'jumpcusser'. These are opportunistic predators and are seen
as little more than vermin by 'real' pirates. The term 'jumpcusser'
is derived from the most common ending of a pirate attack –
the target jumps away, leaving the would–be attacker cursing
in the target's wake. A jumpcusser is an armed free trader or
other small starship – even a classic scout ship could serve as
a jumpcusser.

Often, jumpcussers are tramp freighters, traders and adventurers
who engage in piracy on the side when they see a target. A
fat, unarmed merchant misjumps and arrives well outside the
hundred–diameter limit, leaving it without an escape route or
cover from system defence boats. The jumpcusser, whose
crew were engaged in some perfectly legal mission, take the
opportunity to attack and loot some extra cargo.

Without specialized boarding and cargo handling equipment,
jumpcussers are unable to take full advantage of a defeated
target. The jumpcusser might dock and send a few looters
through the airlock or even just demand that the merchant
pack all its small valuables into a one–ton cargo containers and
launch it out into space to be scooped up.

Corsair
This is the common conception of the pirate – an armed vessel
that intercepts merchant ships and steals their cargo. The
difference between a jumpcusser and a corsair is in fi repower
and preparation. A jumpcusser is a part–time opportunistic pirate,
while the corsair deliberately seeks out worlds where it is likely to
fi nd prey. Some fl y the infamous 600–ton corsair–class but most
are in small but heavily armed and converted, free traders.

Corsairs are more likely to have the equipment necessary to
make piracy profi table, such as boarding pods, cargo robots
and vicious marines with cutlasses and armored vacc suits.

Coast Watcher
Coast watchers are pirates with contacts on the ground. These
contacts are usually starport staff but can also be brokers, dock
workers or even vagrants with a view of the landing fi eld and
a tight–beam radio. These spies are employed to watch the
coming and going of ships and ideally obtain their schedules
and fl ight plans. The pirate jumps into the system and signals
its presence to the spies. The spies inform the corsair of likely
targets.

With a good spy network on multiple planets, the coast watcher
has a much greater chance of locating suitable prey. These
spies also warn about the presence of naval patrols and other
dangers. The risk to these spies is minimal, so the cost to the
pirates is equally low.

Belt Runner
Belt runners prey on spaceships travelling through real space
to outlying worlds in a system. Traditionally, the asteroid belt
is a haunt for pirates. The advantages of this approach is that
the belt runner's targets are unable to jump away and that the
volume of space to be patrolled is much greater, making it less
likely that the pirate encounters patrols.

The downside is the lack of good prizes. Belt runners tend to
end up with hundreds of tons of unrefi ned ore.

Prize Hunter
Only a handful of pirates have the resources and contacts to
capture and sell a ship. A ship is the ultimate prize for a pirate,
worth many millions of credits. The 600–ton corsair that can
envelop a smaller vessel is an ideal prize hunter but there are
other ways to steal a vessel. The pirates can board another
ship and take it, although to do so they must either kill the crew,
dump them into space in a rescue ball or other escape pod or
force the crew to help them steal the ship. Carrying enough
personnel to replace the crew of a smaller vessel may strain
the life support systems of the larger vessel and most starships
have internal security systems including passwords, biometric
scanners or other checks to ensure that the ship is being piloted

###### PPPIRACYIRACYIRACY

by the registered crew. These systems can be bypassed but
every minute spent hacking through security brings the naval
patrols another minute closer.

Even if the pirate manages to capture a ship and bypass security
(or subvert the crew), there are still several problems. If the
captured ship is not ready to jump, the pirates need to transfer
fuel from their own ship or skim a gas giant, both of which are
problematic. Selling a ship is also very hard – only a handful of
fences can _afford_ to buy a ship for resale and most will just strip
the captured vessel for parts and give the prize hunter only a
tiny fraction of the actual value of the ship.

Despite all this, prize hunting can be astonishingly profi table.
Even a tenth of the price of a common scout is still 2.7MCr.

Raider
Raiders are pirates who attack ground–based or other
stationary targets such as space stations. Raiding can be a
very rewarding form of piracy and the target cannot escape
the attack. Raiding can even be profi table on low–technology
worlds – dropping out of the sky, lasering open the drawbridge
of a castle and demanding the local iron age king send out his
treasure, his wine cellar and his comely daughters is a hobby
for some raiders.

The downside of raiding is that it attracts much more attention
than regular piracy. Attempting to raid a civilised, highly
populated world is tantamount to declaring war on that planet.

Most pirates need only worry about system defence boats,
q–ships and naval patrols but raiders can fi nd themselves in a
pitched battle with a planet's military.

#### PIRATE TARGETS

Pirates seek out different worlds depending on their intended
tactics. Planets well off the beaten track do not see enough traffi c
for a pirate to bother, so pirates will cluster near trade routes.
Pirates stay away from naval bases. Worlds with an asteroid
belt or gas giant attract pirates; worlds with a large space fl eet
drive them away. Hundreds of other factors play a part, the most
important of which are the needs of the Referee.

When a pirate attempts to locate prey, roll on the Prey Encounter
Table on page 44 to determine the most likely target. A result of
'no prey' does not mean that there are no other ships in the
system, it implies that there are no other ships that the pirate has
a chance of successfully tackling. The amount of traffi c in the
system determines when to roll on the Prey Encounter Table.

Roll d66, applying DMs as follows:
Backwater System: –1DM to fi rst die only
Dangerous World: –1DM to second die only
High–Traffi c System: +1DM to fi rst die only
Secure World: +1 DM to second die only
[[Capital]] or other key System: +2DM to fi rst die only
Naval Base: +2 DM to second die only

A backwater system is one with a Class X or E starport and
at least one of the following traits: Barren, Low Population, Low
Technology.

A high–traffi c system is one with a Class A or B starport and
with at least one of the following traits: High Technology, High
Population, Industrial, Agricultural, Rich.

A capital or other key system is a subsector capital or is a
world on a trade route with a Class A or B starport and at least
one of the following traits: High Technology, High Population,
Industrial, Agricultural, Rich.

A dangerous world has an Amber or Red Travel code or a Law
Level of 3 or less or is otherwise unable to patrol its space.

A secure world has a Law Level of 7 or more and has the
technology to protect travellers or has a naval base present
within six parsecs.

A naval base in the system offers the best possible protection
for travellers.

**Traveller:** A vessel other than a cargo ship, such as a scout vessel, small military ship, fast courier or even another pirate.
Travellers are poor targets for pirates, as they are unlikely to carry valuable cargoes. They can be looted for parts.

**Small Freighter:** A far trader, free trader or other 100–300 ton trade vessel. Such vessels are ideal prey for most pirates, as they
can quickly be looted and are unlikely to have signifi cant defences.

###### PPIRACYIRACY

**Medium Freighter:** A trader of 400–1,000 tons. Still a good
target for pirates, although sorting through the cavernous cargo
bay for the choicest items may take more time than the pirate
can afford.

**Heavy Freighter:** This is a freighter of 1,000 tons or more.
Heavy freighters of this kind often travel with escort vessels or
carry their own fi ghters or defensive weapons and may be more
than the average pirate can handle.

**Rich Freighter:** Roll 1d6 to determine the sort of freighter
encountered. 1–3: Small Freighter, 4–5: Medium Freighter, 6:
Heavy Freighter. This freighter is more likely to be carrying an
especially valuable cargo; when rolling for a random cargo, roll
twice and take the most valuable result.

**Liner:** This is a passenger vessel, colony ship, troop transport
or tourist vessel. Such ships may have many valuable items
carried by the passengers but the pirates will be outnumbered
if they try to storm it.

**Unusual Vessel:** A noble's yacht, science vessel, X–boat,
mercenary transport, survey ship or other rare type of ship.
The vessel may be utterly useless to the pirate or a rich prize,
depending on what is on board.

**System Defence Boat:** Roll 1d6. On a 1–5, this is a classic
SDB of some sort – a heavily armed, fast–moving spaceship
without a jump drive. On a 6, it is a q–ship, a small freighter that
has been refi tted with concealed weapons as a honey trap for
pirates.

**Naval Patrol:** The pirate has run into a heavily armed navy ship,
ranging from a small escort ship or pirate hunter to a full–size
warship.

Encounter Distance & Timing
The 'encounter window' for a pirate attack is a slim one. It takes
a ship only a few hours to lift off from a spaceport and pass
through the hundred–diameter jump point or to travel from
where it entered the system to the safety of the atmosphere.
Within that window, the pirate has to come within range of the
target, disable it or force its surrender, match velocity, dock, loot
the cargo and then escape.

The initial encounter distance is set by the Referee; as a rule of
thumb, roll 3d6 and multiply it by the diameter of the mainworld
(or 1,000km for Size 0 worlds). An arriving ship will arrive
somewhere outside the hundred–diameter jump limit, so the
values in the Jump Limit Transit Table are the minimum travel
times for an arriving ship.

Outsystem Encounters
The Prey Encounter table assumes that the pirates are
operating in the space around the system's main world. Belt
runners and other pirates prefer to operate further out on
the fringes of the system. Roll 2d6 on the Outsystem Prey
Table for these pirates, applying DMs as follows:

Backwater: –1DM Dangerous World: –1DM
High–traffi c outsystem: +1DM Secure World: +1DM

7 No encounter

Use the descriptions for the ships from the Prey Encounter
Table, with the following two encounters unique to the
Outsystem Prey Table:

Poor Freighter: Roll 1d6 to determine the sort of freighter
encountered. 1–3: Small Freighter, 4–5: Medium Freighter,
6: Heavy Freighter. This freighter is carrying an especially
poor cargo; when rolling for a random cargo, roll twice times
and take the least valuable result.

Belter: A Serpent–class or other mining ship.

Roll 1d6 or choose the prey's direction of travel. On a 1–3, it
is heading towards the planet or HighPort to land; on a 4–5,
it is heading to the jump diameter limit. On a 6, it is stationary
or heading towards some other destination, such as a moon,
another planet or another vessel.

The Jump Limit Transit Table on page 46 describes how long it
takes a vessel to reach either the surface or hundred–diameter
jump limit, depending on its thrust and the size of the planet.
Note that it is much quicker to leave a planet and travel at full
thrust to the jump limit than it is to fl y to the surface, as the vessel
must do a turnover at the half–way point (or use atmospheric
braking; either way, it must reach zero velocity at the surface or
there will be an unfortunate interaction with the ground, termed
a 'crash').

#### PIRATE ATTACKS

Once the pirate has located a suitable target, the following steps
must be taken:

- Intercept the target
- Attack the target
- Prevent the target's escape
- (Optionally) Board the target
- Loot the target
- Escape!

Intercept the target
The pirate faces a diffi cult task – they must not only get within
range of the target but must also match velocity with it so
boarding can be attempted. Use the Travel Times tables above
and on page 145 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ to determine
intercept times. The target may attempt to avoid the pirate but
any evasive maneuvers will increase the amount of time it
takes to reach the target's destination.

Opposed Piloting checks may be required when the range
drops to Short or less, as the target jinks and dodges to avoid
the approaching pirate vessel.

In general, if the pirate has a higher Thrust value than the target
and is within 100,000 kilometers of the target, then escape is
very diffi cult indeed.

As soon as the pirate opens fi re, a clock starts ticking. The
pirate has a limited amount of time to breach the target and
loot before the authorities arrive (see Pirate Hunters on page
48). The Referee should track how long the attack takes, to
determine how long the pirates have to loot their prize.

Locating a target: Sensors+Intelligence, 1–6 minutes, Average
(+0)
Estimating the likely value of a prize: Broker+Intelligence, 1–6
seconds, Diffi cult (–2)
Plotting an intercept course: Pilot+Education, 10–60 seconds,
Average (+0)

Attack the target
Pirates do not want to destroy their target, they want to cripple
it. Missile and torpedo attacks may be used to 'soften up' a
target but as soon as the target's Hull is breached, the pirate
runs the risk of destroying the cargo he seeks. Most pirates will

###### PPPIRACYIRACYIRACY

Crybabies & Decoys
One tactic to delay the inevitable arrival of a pirate hunter
is to use a decoy transmission. The simplest method is
to use a crybaby, a small but powerful transmitter that is
launched from the pirate long before the attack begins. The
crybaby is sent off on a tangential course. When the pirate
is ready to begin its attack, a signal is sent to the crybaby.
The crybaby then transmits a Signal GK or mayday call,
pretending to be a ship in peril. Ideally, the authorities go
after the crybaby, leaving the pirate free to attack.

Of course, if the authorities bother to scan the crybaby,
they will see that it does not have the energy emissions or
mass of a genuine ship. Pirates can hide crybabies behind
a convenient moonlet or in the wrecked hulk of a smaller
ship but crybabies are of little use against competent pirate
hunters.

Decoys are more expensive but also more effective. A
decoy is another starship or spaceship that pretends to be
in distress. While the authorities are occupied, the pirates
act. Ideally, the decoy is a scoutship or other starship that
can jump out when its task is complete. Of course, only the
richest pirates have multiple starships.

If the decoy is not jump–capable, then it can be manned
or unmanned. An unmanned decoy is controlled remotely
from the pirate ship; communications are relayed from the
pirate to the approaching SDB. This can result in suspicious
communications delays. Unmanned decoys can be
computer–controlled but these programs may not be able
to answer all the questions asked by the authorities.

A manned, non–jumping decoy is a better decoy but it does
have one big drawback – the crew will be picked up by the
authorities and had better have a good story to tell when they
ask ' isn't it a little suspicious that your engines shut down at
just the right time to distract us from those pirates?'

challenge the target as soon as the fi rst shot is fi red, demanding
that the prey surrender, heave to and prepare to be boarded.

The ideal results for a pirate are hits to the Maneuver Drive
(reducing the target's Thrust and making interception much
easier) or Fuel (dumping a portion of the target's fuel into space
and possibly preventing it from jumping away).

In general, a merchant captain will surrender as soon as escape
becomes unlikely , not impossible. One hit to the merchant's fuel
tank might not stop the merchant fl eeing but it proves that the
pirate can damage the merchant and will likely cripple it with
another few hits. Merchants know that it is better to lose one's
cargo to the pirate and claim the insurance (if any) than to lose
one's ship and possibly one's life to an incoming pirate missile.

Attacking engines: Gunner+Dexterity, 1–6 minutes, Diffi cult
(–2)
Docking with a crippled target: Pilot+Dexterity, 1–6 minutes,
Diffi cult (–2)

Board the target
To board the target, the pirate vessel must either dock with it or
send boarding troops across using thruster packs, grav belts,
grapple lines, small craft, breaching tubes or other transport
methods (psionic teleportation is ideal for piracy). Once the
boarders have reached the target, they need to force open
an airlock. Most pirates warn the target before breaching the
hull, demanding that the victims open up or lose atmospheric
containment. All but the bravest of targets will just let the pirates
in at this point.

If the victim intends to fi ght back, then the situation becomes
more complicated. If the defenders are not wearing vacc suits or
armor offering protection against vacuum, then just breaching
the airlock removes the problem but no–one is stupid enough
to resist boarders without fi rst putting on vacc suits (or hatches/

Called Shots (Optional Rule)
Ships at a range of Short or less may attempt to make called
shots with direct–fi re weapons. The attacker nominates the
location he wishes to attack and then rolls with a –2DM to
his attack. If the attack hits, the Referee rolls on the location
table as normal but then moves one rows up or down on
the table towards the desired location.

For example, a pirate corsair targets the fuel tanks on a
fl eeing merchant. He rolls and hits; the Referee rolls 2d6 on
the location table and gets a 4, M–Drive. However, thanks
to the called shot, he moves one row towards the Fuel
location. The new result is a 5 and the corsair hits the fuel
load, preventing the merchant from jumping to escape...

iris valves, ensuring that a breach at the main airlock or cargo
hold will not vent the air from the bridge and crew quarters).
Assuming both sides are ready for fi ghting in vacuum, then the
pirates must battle their way onto the other ship and eliminate
any resistance. The weapons of choice in a boarding action are
cutlasses, gauss pistols and other zero–g weapons.

Ideally, the pirate vessel docks with the target, to allow cargo
and other loot to be transferred quickly.

_Finding the cargo hold:_ Recon+Intelligence, 1–6 minutes,
Average (+0)

Loot the target
If the pirate has secured its prize, the crew can begin looting.
Successful pirates have this part of the operation down to a fi ne
art, hunting down the most valuable items fi rst and dispatching
specialized teams to recover specifi c targets. Security systems
must be bypassed or destroyed; the pick of the cargo must be
transferred into the pirate vessel; subcraft and other vehicles
are cut free and stolen. Looting is as dangerous as any part of
the attack – if the pirate captain does not leave promptly, he will
be caught by the authorities. Many pirates have been left behind
on a crippled merchant ship when their captain abandons them
rather than stand and fi ght. A well–trained pirate crew will leave
behind what they cannot safely steal.

Average (+0)
_Finding the right cargo:_ Recon+Intelligence, 1–6 minutes,
Average (+0)
_Moving a cargo container manually:_ Zero–G+Strength, 1–6
minutes, Diffi cult (–2)

Escape!
The fi nal challenge for the pirate is to escape without being
captured. Once a pirate has taken its prize, it still needs to
make it back to the hundred–diameter jump limit to escape. One
common mistake made by inexperienced raiders is to chase a
target too far into a planet's jump shadow, so they cannot then
safely jump out. (Jumping within the hundred–diameter limit
incurs a –8DM to the jump check).

#### AVOIDING PIRATES

Obviously, the easiest way to avoid pirates is to stick to 'safe'
systems but this is not always possible. Any experienced
merchant will take further precautions.

Safe Jumping
The more accurate the jump roll, the closer to the target world
the ship arrives. A good astrogator is a valuable addition to any
crew, as an accurate jump not only shaves time off travelling
to the starport (and time is money) but also reduces the ship's
exposure to piracy.

Defensive Weapons
Pirates are opportunists and will go after the least–diffi cult
target. Given a choice between a free trader with a single laser
turret and an unarmed free trader, any pirate will go for the soft
target. Even an unmanned turret can dissuade attackers.

Scream Early, Scream Often
The instant a pirate locks on weapons, the merchant should be
broadcasting a distress call to everyone in the system. If the
pirates know that the authorities are en route, they may panic
and break off their attack. A merchant might even privately
contact the starport as soon as he arrives in–system, reporting
on suspicious behaviour by other ships in–system. The rumor
of piracy in a system is more economically damaging than the
actual piracy itself, so starports tolerate moderately paranoid
merchant captains if it makes the system seem safer.

Knowing When To Run
A wise captain knows his ship and crew. Inexperienced
merchants panic and dodge when attacked by pirates but every
evasive maneuver brings the ship off the optimum path to the
jump limit. In many situations, the safest tactic is just to ignore
the pirate attack and fl y right into the teeth of the barrage,
reaching the jump limit as quickly as possible and escaping into
hyperspace. Another solid tactic is to head straight back down
towards the planet and the safety of the starport or to go for the
nearest SDB.

Sacrificial Cargoes
If there is no escape from the pirates, then a wise captain will
minimise the damage they can infl ict. One common tactic is
to have a cargo container loaded with valuables ready to be
launched at a moment's notice. Instead of letting the pirates
board, the merchants throw the container out of the airlock. With
luck, the pirate vessel will be satisfi ed with a small safe profi t and
depart. External cargo pods also allow the merchant to relinquish
a portion of his cargo to preserve the rest. In case a sacrifi cial
cargo is worthless pirates will usually keep their guns locked onto
their victim until they can retrieve and examine the container.

###### PPPIRACYIRACYIRACY

#### PIRATE HUNTERS

Any system with suffi cient resources and trade will maintain a
fl eet of system defence boats and customs vessels. Even on
technologically primitive worlds, the government will either hire
private contractors or request Imperial aid. These SDBs patrol
the space around the mainworld, as well as other key locations
in the system such as gas giants or asteroid belts. While the
main purpose of an SDB fl eet is to protect against invasion, they
hone their skills hunting pirates.

Pirate hunting can also be an important duty for the Imperial
navy and subsector navies. The Imperial navy only bothers
with pirate hunting when training new crews or when a nest
of pirates proves especially troublesome. Many years can
go by before the navy bothers to act but when they do, they
use overwhelming force. Imperial navy ships are deployed to
besiege and destroy pirate bases.

Subsector navies are much more active when it comes to pirate
hunting and it is one of their primary roles. Subsector navies use
much smaller and more agile warships, making them ideal for
patrols and anti–pirate operations. Pirates often operate across
subsector borders to avoid subsector fl eets – the dead hand
of bureaucracy is a powerful weapon in the stratifi ed Imperium
and one duke may be unwilling to allow a neighbor's ships to
enter his space.

Any of these pirate hunters may respond to a distress call from
a merchant ship. Roll on the Response table when the pirate
attack begins.

Customs Ships
Customs ships are small, fast–moving lightly armed vessels,
designed to intercept smugglers and patrol the spaceways. A
customs ship is not designed to get into a shooting match with
another vessel, although most could infl ict signifi cant damage
on a small pirate. Customs vessels are normally the fi rst to
respond to a pirate attack, although they will call in support from
SDBs if necessary.

SDBs
System Defence Boats vary wildly in size. The largest SDBs
are hollowed–out asteroids bigger than any capital ship; these
supermonitors are designed to fi ght off invading fl eets and
could swat every pirate in the subsector with a single broadside.
The SDBs normally encountered by pirates are much smaller
escorts. SDBs are extremely dangerous, as they are usually
faster and better–armed than any pirate ship. They are incapable
of jump travel, though and their crew may not be as skilled as
a hardened pirate band, so a clever pirate can avoid or escape
from SDBs.

Q–Ships
Q–ships are merchant vessels with concealed weapons, used
as lures for pirates and commerce raiders. Most subsector
navies have a few old q–ships in storage that are hauled out
when pirate activity becomes a problem. The q–ship then
'conveniently' jumps into dangerous systems and offers itself a
tempting target for pirates. When the attack begins, the q–ship
responds by revealing its weapons and launching fi ghters.

and a fi ghter bay.
**Crimes:** Attacks on shipping in Trojan Reach subsector.
**Notes:** Believed to be a renegade Aslan noble. The Hungry One operates mainly outside the borders of the Imperium. Hunters are
advised not to engage him too close to the Aslan Hierate, as it is likely he has tacit support from within Aslan space.
**Reward:** Cr. 3,000,000 if H'raua'sa's ship is destroyed. Cr. 6,000,000 if he is captured within Imperial space and brought to the
naval base at Pax Rulin.

**Name:** Rose Kershaw.
**Aliases:** Rosered.
**Description:** Human female, genotype 7b, red hair, augmented physique.
**Vessel:** Corsair–class pirate vessel.
**Vessel Name:** _The Thorn of Kintyre._

**Notes:** Formerly part of the Joyeuse planetary navy, Captain Blaise went rogue two years ago for reasons unknown (speculated to
be related to internal politics within the Joyeuse government). His crew is believed to be utterly loyal to the renegade captain.
**Reward:** Negotiable. The Sword World Confederation consider the _Merlin_ to be a valuable asset and will not countenance its
destruction by anyone other than their own forces. However, the Imperium is not willing to permit a Sword World hunting party to
pursue the _Merlin_ without an Imperial navy escort. Negotiations are ongoing.

###### PPPIRACYIRACYIRACY

Some worlds use a variant on the q–ship concept, where
they send freighters loaded with booby–trapped cargo into
dangerous space. When the pirates steal the cargo, the booby–
trap is activated. High–explosive charges are the most common
form of booby–trap but other q–ships have concealed armored
marines, lethal toxins or even nuclear mines.

Naval Vessels
Small naval vessels like the Gazelle–class close escort are
ideal pirate hunters. These vessels can outgun and outrun most
pirate ships and unlike an SDB they have skilled crews and can
track corsairs from one system to another. Naval vessels may
also carry high–acceleration fi ghters, which can chase down
pirate vessels in the same way pirates chase down prey.

Small naval vessels are the bane of piracy. The only chance for
the pirate is to fl ee to a less well–patrolled subsector and start
again. Actually _destroying_ the naval vessel is the worst possible
course of action, as it ensures that the pirate will be hunted down
and exterminated by the navy. At least surrendering means the
pirate may survive.

[[Capital]] Ships
Massive capital warships are much too large and expensive to be
'wasted' on pirate hunting. Nonetheless, pirates do sometimes
encounter capital ships. There are two likely scenarios – either
the navy have detected a pirate base and wish to pound it into
free–fl oating dust or some infl uential noble or corporation has
made a fuss and the navy wishes to show how seriously it
takes the pirate situation. Both scenarios involve a great deal
of overkill.

Bounty Hunters
If all of the previous pirate hunters are unable to deal with a
particularly troublesome corsair, then the time–honored
system of bounties can produce results. Putting a price on a
pirate's head (or hull) means that every adventurer and bounty
hunter in the subsector will be looking for him. Often, this price
ends up getting collected by another pirate.

#### PIRATE LOOT

Once a target has been boarded, the looting can begin. Each
type of loot takes time to recover from the target ship, so pirates
must choose what they take carefully. The times listed all assume
a single pirate crewman is assigned to the task; assigning more
crew will reduce the time required but cannot reduce the time
below the minimum time listed.

Supplies
This covers spare parts, ship components, electronics, food,
oxygen, fuel and other immediately useful items. Pirates have
to go for months without docking at a fully equipped starport,
so they cannot resupply and maintain their ships in the usual

fashion. Cannibalising supplies allows a pirate to keep fl ying
without resupply. Looting supplies in this fashion takes 10–60
minutes.

Cargo
The merchant's cargo can be the richest prize on board but
handling a large number of cargo containers hastily can be
diffi cult.

On average, a freighter will have 40+1d6x10% of its cargo bay
fi lled. Half the cargo will be of a single type, chosen from either
the cargos available at the world the freighter just left or from
those that sell well at the destination world or by picking one of
the six basic cargo types. The rest of the cargo should be rolled
for randomly in smaller blocks.

The number of cargo containers that can be moved
simultaneously depends on the size of the cargo bay doors,
which varies from design to design. As a rule of thumb, assume
that the hatch is one container wide for every 50 tons of cargo
at minimum. Only one hatch can be used at a time, unless the
pirate is using a cargo net or cargo scoop (see page 88) and
pitching cargo straight out into space.

If the pirate has no cargo handling equipment, then each cargo
container must be handled individually.

Stolen cargo must be fenced.

Treasure
This covers cash, gemstones, precious metals, high–value trade
goods, software, exotic or alien equipment, art and other small,
valuable items. Many free traders carry treasure of some sort,
due to the delays in electronic transfer credits. Such treasure

Cargo Handling
Cargo is transported in many different forms across the Imperium. The standard shipping container takes up approximately
one dton, including enough room to access the container. There are also smaller shipping containers that take up half a dton
or 1/8th dton, as well as all manner of smaller boxes, drums, tanks and other storage methods. Often, smaller containers will be
loaded into one of the standard shipping containers for ease of handling.

Cargo may be transported internally in a cargo bay or externally in a frame. Both have their advantages. Large freighters
which are not designed to land on a planet carry their cargo in an external frame, open to space. This simplifi es loading and
unloading and brings the cost of the vessel down considerably as the ship's hull does not need to cover the cargo space. As
an added bonus, external cargo pods can be jettisoned in an emergency. Jettisoning a few cargo pods is greatly preferable to
being boarded by a band of bloodthirsty pirates. However, external cargo containers are not designed to survive the stress of
atmospheric entry, so most ships with external cargo rely on orbit–to–surface small craft.

Ships with internal cargo bays, such as most free traders, offer much more protection to their cargo. The armored hull
shields the cargo from heat, radiation, micrometeorite impacts or attack and the ship can enter the atmosphere and land at a
DownPort, delivering its cargo much more quickly. However, the cargo bay doors are a literal bottleneck on the amount of cargo
that can be transferred. If the airlock is only big enough to fi t a single container at a time, then unloading all two hundred cargo
containers will take a considerable length of time – hardly ideal when a pirate has you in his sights and is demanding you hand
over all your valuables immediately.

Starports have various automated cargo handling methods. Some have cranes or conveyor belts that reach into the hold and
pick up containers; others use more fl exible cargo robots to unload a vessel. Cargo robots are slower than a loading crane but
are much better able to adapt to unusual ship designs. Some freighters even carry their own cargo robots for use on worlds
lacking such support.

In the absence of cargo handling machinery, it is possible to move cargo containers with brute force. This is easier in zero–
gravity but trained zero–g stevedores are needed to move cargo safely. A multi–ton cargo container may weigh nothing but
retains all its mass. It is hard to start the container moving and just as hard to stop.

Cargo handling presents a problem for pirates. A cargo ship carrying a thousand tons of radioactives is a rich prize for any
corsair but it is worth nothing if you cannot get the cargo containers out of the freighter before the navy patrol arrives.

will normally be held inside a hidden safe on board. Finding this
cache requires a Diffi cult (–2) Intelligence + Recon roll taking
1–6 hours per hundred tons of ship. The value of the treasure is
generally equal to 20,000cr per 100 tons of ship.

Passengers on board ship may also have treasure. Assume
Cr. 10,000 for High passengers, Cr. 5,000 for mid passengers
and Cr. 1,000 for low passengers. Treasure is in cash or easily
sellable items and does not need to be fenced. Looting this
treasure takes 1d6 minutes per passenger.

Equipment
Equipment includes items such as armor, weapons, computers
and other personal gear that can be sold. Assume Cr. 1,000 per
crew member. This equipment must be fenced, so the pirate
may only get a fraction of the 'real' value.

Looting equipment takes 1d6 minutes per crew member.

###### PPPIRACYIRACYIRACY

Small Craft
Ship's small craft like boats, launches and shuttles are
extremely valuable to pirates. A 20–ton launch is worth 14MCr,
the equivalent of cargo worth 700,000 Cr. per ton! While these
vehicles must be fenced, they are still choice loot if they can be
stolen.

If the pirate's cargo bay is large enough to hold the stolen vehicle,
then the pirates need only fl y it across. If the pirates have no
suitable place to stow a vehicle, they may try docking it to an
external airlock, although this is risky or use docking clamps.
Any large object attached to the hull can cause problems when
jumping (assume a –2DM for every 10 tons of stolen vehicle).

Overriding security systems on a vehicle requires an Average
(+0) Security+Intelligence check taking 10–60 minutes. Flying
the ship across requires Pilot+Dexterity, Average (+0), 1d6
minutes.

Stolen vehicles must be fenced.

Prisoners
Some pirates take prisoners for later ransom. Ransoming is
a diffi cult process and should be handled as an adventure.
Prisoners are usually thrown into low berths for 'storage'.
Forcing an unwilling prisoner onto a pirate vessel requires a
Melee check and 1–6 minutes (or, better yet, a stunner).

What's Not Nailed Down
It is possible, albeit time–consuming, to strip every valuable
item from a captured ship; everything from computer cabling
and hydrogen fuel to jump drive components and fl oor tiles
can be stolen. Fully stripping a ship of all easily transportable
items takes 10–60 hours per 100 tons of ship. Every 100 tons
of stripped ship produces 10 tons of spare parts worth Cr. 5,000
each (or 50,000 Cr./100 tons).

Prize Ships
See page 41 for details on stealing and selling starships.

Sample Prizes
The table below summarises the value of several common captured vessels. It assumes that a single pirate crewman is sent to
collect all the loot – more crew would reduce the time taken. All cargoes are generated randomly using the rules on page 50.

Values are listed as either full (100% of market value) or fenced (assumes 25% of market value). Note that the chances of the
pirate actually obtaining the values listed here are remote unless he is very lucky. The pressures of time mean only a handful of
items can safely be secured.

# IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

From the petty thug who breaks a window to steal from a house,
to the skilled team of thieves who rob a high–security bank,
to the elite corporate ninja sneaking into an orbital station to
disable the rogue AI – all of these acts fall under the umbrella
of 'intrusion'.

As technology improves, physical intrusion becomes more
diffi cult. High–end security systems are designed to be
unbreakable and only the most skilled thieves can defeat them
with weeks of planning and preparation. Of course, advancing
technology also opens up more avenues of attack – a TL14
fortress is a lot more physically secure than a TL3 castle but you
can not subvert the computer system of a castle and order it to
open the drawbridge.

## BEFORE THE INTRUSION

The fi rst step in any intrusion is gathering information about the
target. Going in without a plan and some foreknowledge is utter
folly.

Casing the Target
The Recon skill allows a character to observe a target, noting
visible obstacles such as fences, security cameras, locked
doors, guard patrols and so forth. Depending on where the target
is, casing the target can involve walking past it on the street,
climbing trees and observing the target through binoculars,
bluffi ng your way in to have a look at the place from the inside
and so forth.

**Stake–Out:** The longer the characters observe a target, the
better their chances of fi nding an exploitable pattern. A quick
Recon shows that there are four guards and one robot sentry
present in the yard of a military depot at all times. Observing
for 48 hours lets the characters notice that the guards change
every six hours and there are four 15 minute breaks half–way
through each shift when each guard goes to the canteen, one
at a time. Observing for a week gives the information that the
Tuesday night guard is often careless and the robot guard keeps
mistaking rats in the storage shed for intruders.

For a successful stake–out, the thieves will have to set up a
base of some sort near the target. For an urban target, the
characters could rent an apartment overlooking it, hide on the
roof of a nearby building or just sit in an automobile for a week.
In rural environments, they could build a hide or fi nd some other
shelter. Other possibilities for a stake–out could involve using
satellites or drones to gain intelligence.
**Casing a Target:** Recon+Intelligence, 1–6 days, Average (+0)

**Planting Bugs:** Electronic surveillance can be even more
effective than a physical stakeout. Audio bugs or communications

taps can pick up illuminating conversations, video cameras can
give vital clues about guard movements or security codes, while
computer bugs can rely passwords and other useful data. The
characters will need access to the target to plant such bugs and
any competent security team will sweep for bugs regularly.
Installing a Bug: Stealth+Dexterity or Deception+Intelligence
or Security+Education, 1–6 minutes, Diffi cult (–2)

Following Leads: Recon and preparation can turn up other
avenues of investigation. For example, the characters could
follow staff from the target – why try robbing a bank blind, when
you can trace the bank manager to his home and interrogate
him there? Supply routes are another likely approach for an
intruder – the Imperial research base may be protected by a
network of high–tech security measures but the laundry that
washes their lab coats once a week and delivers them by van
is a much softer target.
Following a Lead: Investigate+Intelligence, 1–6 hours, Average
(+0)

Gathering Information
There are other sources of information about a target that the
characters can obtain.
Plans: These plans may be available from government offi ces,
construction contractors and so forth. A densitometer can be
used to scan a structure and identify internal features. Other
utilities, especially electricity, communications and air supply
can be of great interest to an intruder. If a building has, say,
air vents big enough to crawl through or a single connection to
the power grid and no back–up generator, the heist just got a
lot easier.
Collecting Plans: Investigate+Intelligence, 1–6 days, Average
(+0)

Rumors & Inside Information: Any target worth breaking
into must have been investigated by other thieves. Finding
people who know useful information about the target could be
an adventure in itself.
Gathering Rumors: Persuade+Intelligence, 1–6 days,
Average (+0)

Social Engineering: There are several ways to discover what
the four–digit keycode to an access door is. The characters
could wait until a security guard enters, then rappel down the
side of the building to take a thermal photograph of the keypad,
using residual body heat to determine the buttons that were just
pressed, then escaping before they are picked up by the roving
security camera. Alternatively, they could just get the guard
drunk and ask him or try some other method.

A good bluff and a charming demeanour, or even a terrible bluff
and a very pretty girl, are better ways of penetrating security

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

than any technological wizardry. The characters may be able
to get the make and model of the security program used in a
corporate offi ce by just calling a clerk in the offi ce and asking
him a few questions as part of a marketing survey.
**Lying Through Your Teeth:** Deception+Intelligence, 10–60
minutes, Diffi cult (–2)
**Drinking Them Under The Table:** Carouse+Endurance, 1–6
hours, Average (+0)

Set–Up
Preparation, preparation and preparation. The more prepared
the characters are, the better their chances.

**Acquiring Equipment:** Many heists need specialized
equipment, from plasma cutters for burning through safes
to fake uniforms to clown suits. Much of this equipment can
be obtained legally, depending on the planet's Law Level but
other equipment such as explosives, weapons and cutting
technology may be controlled. Planetary authorities may be
watching trade in controlled items – if the same credit account
is used to purchase an industrial–strength drill, four vacc suits,
a map of the planet's communications grid, highly advanced
computer parts and a charter spacefl ight that goes very close to
the central communications satellite, that would alert the police
that someone is plotting to sabotage or tap the grid.
**Buying Illegal Gear:** Streetwise+Social Standing, 1–6 days,
Average (+0)

**Preliminary Heists:** Getting through a locked door is a lot
easier if you pickpocketed the guard's passkey that morning.
The thieves may have to commit smaller preliminary heists
before the main event, such as breaking into a nearby building

so they can drill through the adjoining wall, stealing the vehicles
they need for their heist and so forth.
Breaking & Entering: Stealth or Security+Dexterity, 1–6 hours,
Average (+0)

Practise: Practise, as the saying goes, makes perfect. There
are millions of security systems in the Imperium and no thief
knows them all. A skilled locksmith might be able to intuit the
structure of a particular lock from general principles and past
experience but that will take time. Where time is critical, a better
approach is to obtain another lock of the same type as the target
lock and let the thief practise with that until he can open it in four
seconds with his eyes closed hanging upside down.
Practising That Lock: Security+Dexterity, 10–60 hours,
Average (+0)

Planning
The plan is where it all comes together. The players need to
come up with a plan to get into the target, bypassing or disabling
the security systems, do what they came for and get out again.

Concrete Planning: If the Referee is going to run through the
whole heist in detail and has maps and NPCs prepared for the
whole target, then the players should use concrete planning.
Fully planning and running a heist in this fashion is a lot of work
for both Referee and players and should only be used when the
heist is a major event in the campaign.

Abstract Planning: Not all heists need to be done in detail. If
the heist is only a side event or part of a much larger plot, the
Referee may wish to use the Abstract Heist Rules.

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

Abstract Intrusion Rules
The Abstract Intrusion Rules are designed to simulate the
planning and execution of a heist without going into detail.

**1. Determine Heist Length:
Easy (6):** An average domicile with a basic security
system.
**Routine (9):** A small business or apartment in a larger
structure.
**Average (12):** A small bank, secure factory or other location
that expects criminals; a high–quality domicile.
**Diffi cult (15):** A bank, weapons depot, secure corporate
facility or especially secure domicile.
**Very Diffi cult (18):** A secure bank, high–security prison,
military facility, noble's palace.
**2. Determine Preparation:** The characters may make the
skill checks described in the three sections on preparation
(Casing the Target, Gathering Information, Set–Up). Each
skill check may be made once. Take the skill check with the
highest Effect from each section and subtract these three
Effects from the Heist Length.

There is no penalty to failing these skill checks. The Heist is
not dangerous at this point.

**3. The Heist:** If the Heist Length is 0 or less, the Heist is
complete. Otherwise, the characters must make further skill
checks. Any appropriate skill can be used, as long as the
player can justify its use. The Diffi culty for these checks
matches the Diffi culty of the Heist. No skill may be used
more than twice. Subtract 2+the Effect of a successful check
from the remaining Heist length.

**Easy Heist:** +4
**Routine Heist:** +2
**Average Heist:** +0
**Diffi cult Heist:** –2
**Very Diffi cult Heist:** –4

**4. Success or Failure**
The _fi rst_ time a skill check is failed, the Referee may infl ict
a consequence on the character making the skill. The
character might be wounded or leave evidence behind or be
forced to sacrifi ce some piece of equipment or an ally.

The _second_ time a skill check is failed, the characters are
unable to complete the Heist without some greater sacrifi ce.

They may need to leave a portion of what they came for
behind or leave clear evidence of their presence or shoot their
way out.

If a third skill check is failed, the Heist has failed and the
characters must fl ee without getting what they came for.

Example: A pair of thieves plan to break into a corporate
research lab and steal the experimental medical drugs that
are being developed there. The Referee decides to use the
abstract rules and declares that this will be a Diffi cult heist
with a Heist Length of 15.

First, the thieves run through Casing the Target, Gathering
Information and Set–Up.
Casing the Target: One thief spies on the lab for a week,
rolling Recon+Intelligence and succeeding with Effect 3.
Gathering Information: Neither of the thieves is able to
succeed at a Gathering Information roll.
Set–Up: The thieves obtain specialized safecracking gear
from a supplier, succeeding at a Streetwise roll with Effect 2.

The two successes have a total Effect of 5; this is subtracted
from the Heist Length, bringing it down to 10.

Next, the thieves actually break into the lab. They may use
each skill a maximum of twice. 2+the Effect of each successful
check is subtracted from the remaining Heist Length. The
thieves' rolls are as follows:

Skill Used Result Effect Remaining
Heist Length
Stealth Success 0 (+2) 8
Security Failure 0 8
Security Success 4 (+2) 2
Stealth Failure 0 2
Gun Combat Success 1 (+2) 0

The Referee now translates the rolls into a description of what
happened. With two failures, the thieves have left considerable
evidence behind and have failed to make a clean getaway. The
fi rst Security failure triggered a silent alarm and the characters
were then spotted by the security robot. A quick and unsubtle
burst of gunfi re dealt with the robot but images of characters'
faces were recorded and transmitted to the authorities...

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

#### SECURITY MEASURES

This section describes common security measures in use
throughout space. Each security measure lists the skills needed
to bypass it. Most security measures can be combined with
each other.

No costs are listed for these measures, as prices vary widely
depending on conditions, technology level and the size of the
secure location. Instead, items are rated as Common (found
everywhere), Uncommon (found only in secure locations), Rare
(found only in very secure locations) and Exotic (found only in
very secure and very high–tech locations).

External Barriers
**Wall (TL1+, Common):** The simplest method of keeping
intruders out, walls are a trivial obstacle to most thieves. Walls
can be climbed using the Athletics (dexterity) skill or smashed

**Climbing a Wall:** Athletics (co–ordination) + Dexterity, 10–60
Seconds, varies

**WALL DIFFICULTY**

Wall Height Handholds DM
<3 meters Many +2
3–5 meters Few +0
5–10 meters None –2
10 meters+ Utterly Sheer –4

A character may attempt to climb a wall in stages, breaking the
attempt into multiple climbing rolls.

**Hardened Wall (TL3+, Uncommon):** Hardened walls are
made of especially strong stone or other materials and cannot
be easily destroyed or penetrated.

**Baffl e Wall (TL13, Exotic):** Baffl e walls use exotic
metamaterials that create a repulsive effect when charged.
When a baffl e wall is activated, any objects adhering to the
wall are lightly repulsed. This is enough to shake any dirt, dust
or other markings from the wall but also forces out climbing
spikes or grappling hooks and makes climbing exoskeletons
(see page 82) useless.

**Fence (TL1+, Common):** Fences are cheaper but even easier
to climb than walls. Use the Wall Diffi culty table for fences but
reduce all penalties by 2. Fences are often equipped with Circuit
Alarms (see page 60).

Barbed–Wire Fence (TL4+, Common): A barbed–wire fence
infl icts 1d6+2 damage on a character who climbs it. This damage
is applied to Dexterity fi rst.

Electric Fence (TL5+, Uncommon): The damage infl icted by
an electric fence varies depending on the amount of current
passing through the fence. Even a low–level of current will
increase the diffi culty of climbing the fence by –2, unless the
thief is wearing insulated gloves. A high level of current can
incinerate those unwary enough to touch it.

Sonic Fence (TL8+, Uncommon): A sonic fence broadcasts
short–range high–frequency sound waves that are intensely
painful. Prolonged exposure can cause deafness or injury.
Sonic fence transmitters are shallowly buried under the surface,
so the fence is invisible to the naked eye. Most trespassers turn
back as soon as they encounter the fringe of a sonic fence; only
a thief with astonishing endurance or protection against sound
waves can walk through an active fence.
Pushing Through A Sonic Fence: Athletics
(Endurance)+Endurance, 10–60 seconds, Very Diffi cult (–4),
infl icts 3d6 damage.

Earthworks (TL1, Uncommon): Earthworks such as berms or
ditches provide only a minor obstacle to a thief on foot but can
impede the movement of most civilian vehicles. If a Drive roll
to navigate such a barrier fails, the vehicle takes 1–3 hits to its
Drive and Hull.
Driving Over An Earthwork In A Ground Car: Drive
(wheeled)+Dexterity, 1–6 minutes, Very Diffi cult (–4)
Driving Over An Earthwork In A Tank: Drive (tracked)+Dexterity,
10–60 seconds, Average (+0)

Antivehicle Barriers (TL5, Uncommon): These are portable
blocks of concrete or metal that are designed to impede military
vehicles such as tracked tanks, hovercraft or walkers.
Driving Over An Antivehicle Barrier In A Tank: Drive
(tracked)+Dexterity, 10–60 minutes, Average (+0)

Surveillance
Motion Detectors (TL6, Uncommon): Electronic motion
detectors use infrared beams to detect movement. They can
be fooled by exceedingly slow and subtle movements or by
minimising heat emissions.
Sneaking Past A Motion Detector: Security

###### IIINTRUSIONNTRUSIONNTRUSION

**Security Camera (TL7, Common):** Security cameras observe
their surroundings. A security camera may be monitored by a
Controller (see page 62) or simply store its recorded images for
later retrieval. Security cameras have a limited arc of vision and
so it is possible to avoid being observed.

More advanced (TL8) security cameras incorporate infrared
imaging and armored housing, protecting them from damage
or interference.
**Sneaking Past A Security Camera:** Security
(electronics)+Dexterity or Intelligence, 10–60 seconds, Diffi cult
(–2) or Very Diffi cult (–4)

**Roving Security Camera (TL9, Uncommon):** Roving security
cameras are mounted on small mobile drones which patrol
along a set path or can be remotely guided by a Controller. Most
roving cameras are built into small tracked robots the size of a
dog but other models are hovering micro–copters or (at TL12)
grav fl oaters. Other roving cameras move along tracks set into
the external wall of a building.

**Concealed Security Camera (TL9, Rare):** Advances in
miniaturization and lenses allow the development of microscopic
cameras. A concealed camera can only be detected using
sensors such as an Electromagnetic Probe (see the _Traveller
Core Rulebook_ , page 96). Concealed cameras cannot be
combined with other camera types. Concealed cameras are
used only in rare cases; part of the virtue of a security camera
is scaring away prospective intruders.

**Intelligent Security Camera (TL11, Rare):** Intelligent security
cameras have built–in image fi ltering and interpretation software.
They can, for example, compensate for weather such as rain or
fog, spot inconsistencies such as a new face in a crowd or a
vehicle that has been parked in the same spot for several days
or even highlight subtle clues such as footprints in wet mud or
movements that do not correspond to the wind.

Intelligent security cameras can be built into roving drones.
**Sneaking Past An Intelligent Camera:** Security
(electronics)+Dexterity or Intelligence, 10–60 seconds,
Formidable (–6)

**Smart Building (TL12, Rare):** Smart buildings are computer–
controlled structures with advanced environmental systems;
the building monitors air fl ows, internal temperatures, the
movements of employees and so on. A smart building tracks
when every door or window opens or closes; it monitors the
oxygen levels in every room; it anticipates the needs of the
building, moving elevators to the right fl oor when it sees an
employee approaching the lobby or routing service robots to
avoid busy areas.

All this is aimed at improving quality of life in the structure but
it also makes a smart building a formidable security system. To
avoid being spotted by a smart building, the thief must:

z Wear a self–contained air supply or breathe very shallowly
z Disable door sensors or sneak through only when someone
else opens a door
z Avoid the building's surveillance cameras and biosensors

Watchbugs (TL13, Exotic): Watchbugs are cybernetic insects
or tiny drones, designed to fl y around a building or other secure
area and watch for intruders. Watchbugs are deployed in swarms
of hundreds of insects. In addition to built–in cameras, the bugs
have chemical sensors enabling them to 'smell' and 'taste'
intruders. A bug could land and bite a suspicious intruder, taking
a blood sample for quick DNA matching. The sheer number of
watchbugs makes a swarm hard to avoid. Watchbugs must be
used with an AI Controller (see page 62).

Avoiding watchbugs using non–technological means is virtually
impossible. Intruders use Bugzapper Gas (see page 85) or
Chameleon Suits (see page 82) to avoid watchbugs.

EM Scanner (TL14, Rare): An EM scanner is a highly sensitive
detector suite designed to watch for transmissions from within
the secure area. It must be used with a Controller; all outgoing
transmissions must be cleared with the controller or they will be
fl agged as a security breach. An EM Scanner can detect radio,
laser and microwave communications, the control transmissions
for robots or drones, outgoing computer connections and other
potential methods of covert communication.

To avoid an EM scanner, the thief needs to either use the target's
own communications, use non–interceptable means such as
a shielded hardwire or a meson communicator or disguise
his communications as natural background electromagnetic
activity.
Disguising a Communication: Comms + Intelligence, 1–6
minutes, Diffi cult (–2)

NAS Sweep (TL15, Exotic): A Neural Activity Sensor sweeps a
building or other zone for neural activity. The brainwave patterns
of authorized staff and visitors are programmed into the NAS
Sweep, so any thoughts detected that do not match these
patterns are tagged as belonging to unwelcome intruders. NAS
Sweeps can penetrate walls and other physical obstacles.

A NAS Sweep can be avoided by psionic conditioning, by a
Neural Hood (see page 82) or Neural Sheathe or by staying
close to powerful EM sources such as power cables that mask
the thief's brainwaves.

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

External Security
**Floodlights (TL4, Uncommon):** High–intensity fl oodlights
illuminate the exterior and grounds of the building. Floodlights
give a –2DM to all Stealth checks.

**Searchlights (TL4, Rare):** Searchlights sweep the area,
searching for the intruder. A character pinned by a searchlight
has a –4DM to all Stealth checks; however, a successful Stealth
or Athletics check will enable him to escape the light's damning
glare and slip into the shadows.

**Infrared Searchlight (TL6, Rare):** Works just like a regular
searchlight, except the beam is invisible to anyone not wearing
IR goggles.

**Sweep Drones (TL9, Exotic):** Remote controlled fl ying
searchlights. Constellations of sweep drones work together to
keep their target pinned in the searchlight, making any attempts
to escape their beams Formidable (–6).

**Densitometer Imaging (TL14, Exotic):** Densitometer imaging
uses a large densitometric gravitational imager to create a
near–real–time three–dimensional image of the building and
its surroundings, including invisible or concealed objects or
people. The image can then be examined to locate suspected
intruders (few organizations have the capability or processing
power for a constantly updated densitometer image of a large
area, although some especially secure chambers might be
constantly scanned).

A densitometer imager can be avoided using a Grav Fuzzer or
Densitometer Cloak (see page 82)

Guards
Watch Animals (TL0, Uncommon): No matter how far
technology advances, the Mark 1 Big Nasty Dog is hard to beat
as a security measure. Guard animals such as dogs can be
trained to sound an alert when they scent an unfamiliar person;
they can also follow trails and attack intruders.

Dogs can be dealt with using drugged food, anti–scent sprays
or training.
Saying 'Nice Doggy' Convincingly: Animals
(training)+Intelligence, 10–60 seconds, Diffi cult (–2)

Sentries (TL1+, Common): Another old–fashioned security
system is having wary and heavily armed men on watch. The
average sentry has an Intelligence DM of +0 and two levels of
the Recon skill; a good sentry has a +1 Intelligence DM and
three or four levels of Recon.

Robot Sentry (TL12+, Rare): Robot sentries are autonomous
security robots, heavily restricted on many worlds due to laws
against combat robots. Most robot sentries are therefore
equipped only with non–lethal weapons such as stunners.

Alarms & Alert
For the purposes of these security system, an alarm is a sensor
or mechanism used to trigger an alert; an alert is a siren or other
means of attracting attention and informing the security staff
that something is amiss. In common use, of course, alarm and
alert are used interchangably.

###### IIINTRUSIONNTRUSIONNTRUSION

**Manual Alarm (TL3, Uncommon):** A manual alarm is one
that must be activated by a sentry or other individual who has
spotted an intruder. A manual alarm might be anything from a
concealed button beneath a cashier's desk to a slap–bar on
every wall to a big red button in the security control center.

Manual alarms can be defeated easily by not giving the security
staff reason or opportunity to hit the button.

**Siren Alert (TL3, Common):** A very, very loud noise. Siren alerts
may be accompanied by strobing lights and other signals.

**TL7:** The siren alert includes an intelligent briefi ng, informing
security of the location of the breach immediately. (' _Intruder
alert, Grid 7! Intruder Alert, Grid 7_ '.)
**Disabling a Siren:** Security (electronics)+Education, 10–60
Seconds, Average (+0)

**Triggered Alarm (TL5, Common):** Triggered alarms are wired
into the building's doors or windows. When a door is forced or a
window is broken, the alarm goes off. These alarms may run a
current through a wire (opening the portal breaks the circuit) or
detect the sound of breaking glass.

**Silent Alert (TL6, Uncommon):** In locations where a silent alert
is used, there is no loud siren or other visible sign that the alarm
has been raised. Security staff are informed of the situation by
buzzers, comm messaging or other direct communication. The
thief has no idea he has tripped an alarm.

**Remote Alert (TL6, Uncommon):** A remote alert is a variation
on the silent alert; instead of informing local security staff, it
alerts some other group such as local law enforcement, a fast–
deployment security team or a private security fi rm.

**Lockdown Alert (TL7, Rare):** When a lockdown alert is
triggered, the building seals itself. All doors (and internal
lockdown doors) automatically shut and no–one goes in or out.

**Deadman Alarm (TL9, Rare):** A deadman alarm is a simple
implant that is injected into the skull or neck of all security
personnel. The deadman alert monitors the wearer's life signs
and brain activity. As soon as life signs are terminated or the
brain waves indicate unconsciousness or other impairment
or the signal from the alarm implant is lost, then the alert is
raised.

The easiest way to deal with a Deadman Alarm is to not encounter
the security teams. If that is impossible, then a thief can use a
computer to mimic the signal from a deadman alarm.

**Security Net (TL12, Rare):** Security nets make silent alarms
look like smoke signals. The security net works with a Computer
or AI Controller to give all security personnel realtime updates
on the situation. Guards are kept appraised of each other's

movements and positions; data from integrated sensors is
provided when needed into an Augmented Reality display. A
guard with a security net would see the building he is guarding
as it really is but he would also see the positions of other guards
within the building, he would see the dimming red footprints of
the intruder's heat traces and the forced door would show up as
a brilliant green.

A Security Net gives its users a +2DM to Recon & Investigate
checks made within the networked zone.

Entry Control
Entry control covers all means of fi ltering entry to the secure
location through standard access points – or, in real life terms,
ways to stop people just walking through the front door and
stealing stuff. It falls into two categories: ways to ensure that
only authorized people can gain access (from basic locks and
keys to brain scans) and ways to scan unauthorized personnel
to ensure they do not pose a threat (metal detectors and so
forth).

Mechanical Lock (TL2, Common): A basic lock, opened with
a matching key – or a lockpick.
Opening a Mechanical Lock: Security (mechanic)+Dexterity,
1–6 minutes, Easy (+4)

Advanced Mechanical Lock (TL4, Common): An advanced
mechanical lock uses smaller tumblers and a more complex
key. This is a basic Yale lock.
Opening an Advanced Mechanical Lock: Security
(mechanic)+Dexterity, 1–6 minutes, Average (+0)

Fractal Lock (TL12, Exotic): Mechanical locks fall out of
favor for several technology levels but see a brief return with
the development of the 'unpickable' fractal lock, which uses
nanomaterials and a unique fractal pattern for the key's teeth.
Fractal locks cannot be picked but can be forced or otherwise
removed.

Electronic Lock (TL6): An electronic lock is opened with a
matching electronic swipe card or other token or signal. The
easiest way to override an electronic lock is to actually have a
swipe card (or a copy of the code). It is possible to connect a
set of Thieves' Tools to a lock and use Security or Computers
skill to break in.
Opening an Electronic Lock: Security (Electronics) or
Computers+Intelligence, 1–6 minutes, Diffi cult (–2)

Keypad (TL6, Uncommon): To open a door controlled by a
keypad, an authorized user enters a predetermined code. The
keycode can be a password, a unique identifi er for each user,
determined by a formula based on the current date or a random
string of digits. If the wrong code is entered, an alarm is triggered.
It may be possible to steal the code by observing an unwary user
operating the pad, by observing heat traces or skin–oil deposits

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

on the keys, by telepathy or by other means. A skilled intruder
can also attempt to hack the keypad electronically by fooling it
into thinking it has received a correct entry sequence.
**Opening a Keypad:** Security (Electronics) + Intelligence, 10–
60 minutes, Diffi cult (–2)

**Biometric – Skin (TL6, Uncommon):** This security measure
confi rms the identity of an authorized user by scanning fi nger or
palm prints. The scanner can be fooled using a plastic fi lm copy
of a fi ngerprint.

**Biometric – Retina (TL7, Rare):** Retina scanners look for the
unique pattern of veins at the back of the human eyeball. They
can be fooled using specially–made contact lenses.

**Biometric – Voice (TL8, Uncommon):** This method matches
a user's voiceprint, either by having him recite a passphrase or
just recognizing specifi c cadences in speech. Most models can
distinguish between recordings and live voice but can be fooled
by advanced speech synthesisers that have been 'trained' with
multiple lengthy samples of the user's voice.

**Biometric – DNA (TL8, Exotic):** DNA scanners take a blood
or other tissue sample, such as saliva or sweat and quickly
sequence the DNA to confi rm the user's identity. It can be
fooled by obtaining the DNA of an authorized user, although
more advanced biometric scanners will check the condition of
the sample – a blood sample, for example, would have to be at
the correct temperature and contain the right mix of enzymes.

**Biometric – Face (TL9, Rare):** At this technology level,
computer software is reliable enough to correctly identify a
person by facial features. It can even discern and interpret
changes in appearance, such as make–up or glasses, and
distinguish them from disguises. Biometric face recognition can
be fooled with a prosthetic mask but such prosthetics must be
of exceedingly high quality.

**Recognition (TL10, Rare):** Recognition combines a computer
controlled challenge/response system with other biometric
scanners. The user might be asked to give a password or
questioned on some other detail of his life. Recognition
software is not limited to a few passwords; it can intelligently
ask questions based on current events ( _'Dave, what meeting
did you attend on Tuesday morning?'_ ) and notice odd behaviour
(' _Dave, you rarely come to the offi ce after 10pm. This is outside
your normal work routine. Is everything OK?'_ )

**NAS Lock (TL15, Exotic):** A NAS lock reads the brain patterns
of authorized users. Only those whose minds are clearly
recognized are admitted. A NAS Lock can be fooled with a
properly prepared Neural Hood.

Metal Detector (TL6, Uncommon): Metal Detectors are
installed at the entrance of many secure locations. The detector
spots weapons, tools, cyberwear or other concealed metallic
objects. Metal detectors can be fooled by making items out of
carbon composites instead of metal.

X–Ray Scanner (TL6, Uncommon): X–Ray security scanners
are supposed to be used on baggage and non–living objects, not
people. The x–ray allows the security staff to examine baggage
from the inside; more advanced scanners use ultrasonics and/
or image recognition software to improve detection rates.

Security Sniffer (TL10, Uncommon): This is a smaller,
simplifi ed version of the electromagnetic probe tool. It allows an
untrained user to detect concealed electronics by just waving the
wand over a subject. It also detects certain organic compounds,
including explosives.

Densitometer Scanner (TL14, Rare): This scanner provides
a whole–body, three–dimensional scan of a subject from
the inside out. Any concealed weapons or other items are
detected. The only way to fool a densitometer scan is to wear
an obvious grav fuzzer or Densitometer Cloak (see page 82)
or to use tools that can be folded into shapes not obvious to a
densitometer scanner.

Internal Barriers
Tripwire (TL1+, Rare): This could be connected to an alarm
system or simply impede movement.
Spotting a Tripwire: Recon + Dexterity, 1–6 Seconds, Average
(+0)

Pressure Plate (TL3+, Uncommon): Pressure plates are
harder to spot than tripwires. If an intruder steps on the plate,
an alarm is triggered. More advanced pressure plates (TL8+)
sense vibrations, so even a footstep within the detection zone
triggers the alarm.
Spotting a Pressure Plate: Investigation or Security (mechani
cal)+Intelligence, 10–60 seconds, Diffi cult (–2)

Electronic Tripwire (TL6+, Common): This covers all manner
of infrared, microwave, laser or other beams that are triggered
when interrupted by an object – such as an intruder. Electronic
tripwires can be spotted using IR goggles.

Lockdown Doors (TL6, Rare): Lockdown doors are heavy
internal blast doors or other barricades that seal off sections of
the building. Lockdown doors are commonly used to block exits,
divide a large building to smaller, more manageable portions or
prevent exits.

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

**Laser Grid (TL7, Rare):** This is the classic 'web of criss–
crossing beams'; breaking any of the beams triggers an alarm.
The beams are invisible to the naked eye. Specialist aerosols
can reveal them as can infrared goggles.

**TL9:** A high–intensity laser pulse is triggered if a beam is
broken, infl icting 1d6 laser attacks each infl icting 2d6 damage
on the unfortunate thief.
**Navigating A Laser Grid:** Athletics (dexterity) + Dexterity, 1–6
minutes, Very Diffi cult (–4)

**Gas (TL5, Exotic):** This security measure fl oods the whole
building or a subsection of the building with gas or smoke. The
standard gas used is a knockout gas (Routine (+2) Endurance
roll required each round or fall unconscious) but high–security
installations may use lethal countermeasures. Gas masks block
gas attacks.

**Stunner Fields (TL12, Rare):** By TL12, stunner technology
develops a wide–beam fi eld. Stunner fi eld generators are built
into the walls of a secure structure; when the alarm is triggered,
the fi eld blankets the whole room, knocking everyone in the room
unconscious. Anti–stun armor protects against stunner attacks.

Security Controllers
Security controllers co–ordinate the information gathered by
surveillance cameras and other security systems. Without a

controller, the information is simply recorded for future reference.
Taking out or otherwise disabling the security controller may be
key to a successful intrusion.

Security Station (TL1, Uncommon): The simplest form of
security system is one manned by humans. At low Technology
Levels, this is just a guard post or barracks; at higher TLs, this
is a secure room with banks of monitors and communications
equipment.

The staff at a security station may spot intruders on the security
cameras and co–ordinate the response of other guards. They can
also manually enable or disable security countermeasures.

Computer Controller (TL9+, Uncommon): A computer
control system provides a centralised archive of surveillance
data. It can be accessed or commanded remotely by security
staff. Computer or AI controllers are required for certain
security systems.

Artifi cial Intelligence Controller (TL13+, Rare): AI controllers
combine the benefi ts of computer controllers and human
supervisors; the AI can correlate all the data from surveillance
systems and take the necessary response to secure the
building.

Other Security Systems
Short Range Ultra Radar (TL12, Rare): At higher technology
levels, personal fl ying machines such as grav belts become
common and easy to use. This makes certain forms of attack
much easier – a thief can fl y over fences and land on the lightly–
defended roof instead of sneaking up to the guarded door. Short
Range Ultra Radar installations sweep the skies directly over
the secured installation and are capable of detecting any fl ying
intruder larger than an insect.

Densitometer Baffl er (TL13, Exotic): Densitometers use
gravitic technology to gather information about objects. They
are incredibly useful sensors but are also extremely effective
when put to illegal use. A criminal with a densitometer and a
lot of patience can build up a three–dimensional image of the
internal structure of a building, spotting weak points and holes
in the security.

A densitometer baffl er uses extremely weak gravity plates to
'fuzz' the densitometer readings within a building, making it
impossible to use densitometers within its area of effect.

#### RUNNING A HEIST

Heists are a cross between a nerve–wracking surgical opera-
tion and a dungeon crawl. They may require a lot more prepa-
ration by the Referee than most encounters but they also chal-
lenge the players to think creatively and use all the skills and
resources at their disposal. A heist can appear challenging,

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

even impossible but if the characters are lucky and clever, they
can accomplish the impossible.

The Referee should avoid making the challenge too easy for
the players. Heists work best when the players know that the
danger is real but walk into the jaws of death anyway. Neither
players nor Referee should pull their punches in a heist game.

The Target
Unless the abstract heist rules are being used (see page 56), the
Referee should prepare maps of the heist's target. He should
also determine how many people are there at any time, what
activities are performed there and the routine of daily life at the
target. He should anticipate likely questions from the players.
For example, if the characters are plotting to break into a prison,
then the Referee should know what visitors are permitted to
do, how hard it is to communicate with inmates, the terrain
surrounding the prison and so on.

Consider the following:

- Where is the target? What surrounds it?
- How do people usually travel to the target?
- What entry points are there?
- How is the target powered? What communications links
    does it have?
- What are the emergency protocols in case of a fi re or other
    dangerous event that might be used as a distraction?

Security Protocols
Once the Referee has an idea of the target, the next step is
deciding how to protect it. How important is the target? What sort
of security systems can they afford and what security systems
can they justify? The desert compound of a crazy religious sect
might not be able to afford cutting–edge technology but they
can surround the place with barbed wire and landmines. By
contrast, a prestigious bank vault can have the most advanced
security system money can buy but cannot put a platoon of
battle dress–armored marines in the lobby.

When considering the security protocols, imagine how the target
would defend itself from the following attacks:

- A direct frontal assault
- A thief trying to sneak in through a side door
- A thief trying to sneak in disguised as an employee or hiding
    in a delivery vehicle
- A thief landing on the roof or travelling through the sewers
- A hostage situation
- A traitorous employee trying to steal from the target

Casing & Planning
In the casing and planning phase of a heist, the players are the
ones driving events as they gather information about the target
and prepare for the intrusion. In general, players come up with
three sorts of plans:

- Good plans the Referee has predicted. ( _We're going to rob_
    _the orbital station by stowing away in a cargo shuttle_ )
- Good plans that the Referee has not anticipated ( _We're_
    _going to rob the orbital station by precisely calculating its_
    _orbital path and velocity, then dropping out of our ship in_
    _the same path but with a relative delta–V of –0.25 meters/_
    _second. Basically, we're going to fl oat in stealthvacc suits_
    _until it comes to us. They'll be looking for approaching ships_
    _and won't spot us.)_
- Bad plans that the Referee has not anticipated ( _We're_
    _going to rob the orbital station. The whole thing. We've got_
    _a really big tow–rope welded to the back of our type–S._ )

The Referee should subtly steer the players away from a bad
plan and give them a hint towards a good plan if they are very
stuck but for the most part, players should be allowed make
their own preparations. The Referee should not let planning
happen in a vacuum – strange inquiries and recon missions
may result in the target's security personnel investigating the
characters.

Intrusion
The intrusion phase of the heist is where the players' plans and
the target's defences interact, possibly violently. The characters
are now committed to the heist; it is too late to retreat now.

One useful trick is to track the alert status of the target's guards.
Alert status can be mapped on a scale, as follows:

- **Unwary:** The security guards not only have no idea
    that an intrusion is underway, they are also sloppy and
    undisciplined. Doors may be left unlocked, identity cards
    left unchecked and basic security protocols ignored.
- **Average:** The standard level of alert. No–one is expecting
    trouble but security protocols are observed.
- **Wary:** The guards suspect trouble. Patrols are stepped up,
    security systems rechecked.
- **Alert:** The guards know there are intruders and are actively
    searching for them.
- **High Alert:** The guards know there are intruders and will
    do anything possible to stop them.

Events could be tied to different alert levels. For example, if the
players are infi ltrating the target using a false ID that that will be

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

#### HIJACKING

Stealing a ship is a common enough event in _Traveller_ games to warrant a discussion of its own. A hijack is a special form of
heist.

Getting On Board
If the ship is on the ground, then the hijacker can just walk up to it – assuming the hatches are not locked. Most spacecraft use
electronic locks that are Diffi cult (–2) or Very Diffi cult (–4) to open and a failed attempt triggers an alarm. Another approach is to
sneak aboard when cargo is being loaded or when a hatch is left open at a starport.

If the ship is in fl ight, then the only way on is to board it or somehow convince the crew to permit a docking.

Many would–be hijackers try taking passage on board ship, planning to seize control once it is in fl ight. The main problem with
this approach is that any passengers will be kept under close watch by a half–way competent crew. Common security precautions
include:

- Scanning or searching all passenger baggage; most passenger baggage is kept in a sealed hold, with only a small amount
    of hand luggage permitted in the cabin
- Passengers are permitted only in a small area of the ship, away from any sensitive areas like the bridge. Passengers must
    return to their cabins whenever an alarm sounds and stay there until the alarm stops or they are ordered to the escape pods.
- The door to the bridge is kept locked at all times; there is someone on duty there at all times. The bridge is never left
    unattended.

While most internal locks on a spacecraft will be comparatively simple ones, the locks to the bridge, armory, engine room and
external airlocks will all be high–quality. Biometric locks may be used or a security camera may be attached to each door; the door
is operated from the bridge, after the bridge offi cer has confi rmed the identity of the individual operating the door controls.

If there is any sign of a potential hijacking situation, the ship's crew will likely deploy crowd control weapons such as stunners,
tranq gas or gravity manipulation. It is better to annoy a group of legitimate passengers and give them free passage plus a few
thousand credits compensation than loose the whole ship to a hijacker who got past security.

Control & Tracking Systems
Assuming the hijacker manages to disable or avoid the crew, he still needs to override the ship's security controls. A ship in
dock usually has its M–drive locked out, requiring a specifi c code or key to reactivate it. Breaking through this security measure
requires a Formidable (–6) Security, Computers or Engineer (electronics) roll taking 10–60 seconds.

There are also numerous ways to trace a ship. In order of importance, these are:

- **Navigation Beacon:** All legal ships broadcast a navigational radio beacon, announcing their identity, position and course.
    Offi cially, this beacon should be active as long as the ship is in fl ight but it can be deactivated by pulling the power wire (most
    ships have long since fi tted an on/off switch for the beacon).
- **Identity Transponder:** According to Imperial policy, all ships must have a transponder that broadcasts the ship's name and
    serial numbers. Transponder data is included in the navigational beacon transmission but even if the beacon is switched off,
    the transponder can be read with a sensor scan. It is possible to remove or change a transponder but it is very diffi cult to
    do so. The transponder is designed to last for the lifetime of the ship and to never be removed or tampered with. Often, the
    transponder is built _into_ the jump drive.
- **Exterior Appearance:** Every ship is unique. Even two Type–S scouts from the same shipyard have slight differences, such
    as micrometeorite scars on the hull or a varying leakage rates from the reactor. It is possible to change a ship's appearance
    easily – a coat of paint and a few new hull plates will do it – but this takes time.
- **Ship's Papers:** Every legally owned ship has accompanying documentation. It is impossible to sell a ship for anything close
    to its market price without the papers.
- **Serial Numbers:** Finally, there are serial numbers all over every ship. Every major component has serial numbers embedded
    into it and these cannot be removed without replacing the component. These serial numbers may be physical digits embedded
    in the metal or a specifi c combination of radioactive isotopes doped into the component.

noticed a few minutes after being scanned into the computer, the
alert status could rise to Wary 10 minutes after the characters
pass through the main gate.

Timing
Keep precise track of the amount of time elapsed in a heist. The
Player Characters should be up against a constant ticking clock

- the longer they delay, the more chance they will be discovered.
Try using graph paper – each box represents one minute and
the Referee can tick off boxes as time elapses. Upcoming events
such as the arrival of guards can be marked ahead.

Complications
No plan should go completely smoothly. While the Referee
should avoid arbitrarily ruining the players' carefully laid plans,
he should certainly perturb them. For example, if the plan is to
hijack a cargo shuttle, then the Referee should not decide that
on this particular day, the shuttle breaks down and cannot be
used. However, he could stick an unexpected group of security
guards onto the shuttle as passengers; the characters will need
to modify their plans to deal with this new obstacle.

Security Response
The Referee should prepare likely security responses to
threats. Decide in advance how many guards and other security
personnel are stationed at the target and use appropriate force.

#### COMPUTER HACKING

Illicit manipulation of computer systems is a powerful criminal
tool in technologically advanced societies. Assuming he can
bypass the defensive programs, the hacker may be able to
shut down a target's surveillance cameras and other security
measures, steal data about a target's defences or even take
what he wants remotely.

Conservative Computing
It is a sobering thought that in Traveller terms, all of modern computing from World War II codebreakers to the internet fi ts into a
span of about two Technology Levels. Computers have doubled in power roughly every 18 months and the average cellphone
now has more processing power than a top–end computer of a few years ago. While predicting the future of any technology is
hit–and–miss, predicting changes in computing is even more so, especially as computers are integrated into more and more
aspects of life.

The default assumption in Traveller is always that technology does not fundamentally alter society. Computers get faster but
they are used for much the same purposes no matter what the technology level. They do not change how society functions;
there is no post–scarcity era, money is still used as a medium of exchange and one can talk about aspects of computing such
as fi rewalls and internet connections having a vaguely similar meaning at TL15 as they do today at TL7.

This may not be a realistic extrapolation of current trends but it is a necessary one. Just as Traveller assumes that future wars
will still be fought by humans with personal weapons (battle dress and FGMPs, admittedly) instead of swarms of drones or
berserker robot–ships, it also assumes that humans will still be operating and programming computers and using them for some
but not all tasks. Some worlds may be an exception – one world might be a TL15 sphere of computronium fi lled with a trillion
uploaded sentient minds but in the Imperium as a whole, computers are just tools like any other.

Hacking uses similar rules to a physical heist. The diffi culty of
the heist depends on how secure the target network is and what
intrusion countermeasures it is running.

Casing The Target
Most hacking attempts begin by determining the method of
attack. What sort of computer network does the target have?
Is there a planetary internet or is the network purely a local
one? Is there an external network at all or is the target entirely
self–contained? If there is no external connection whatsoever,
then the hacker will need to physically penetrate the target fi rst
before connecting to the computers.

Test Runs: Preliminary hacking attempts can probe the
defences of the target, determining what sort of system the
hacker is dealing with.
Test Run: Computers + Intelligence, 1–6 days, Varies

Background Information: Any secure site will conceal what
defensive software it possesses but just knowing what operating
systems and other applications it uses can give a hacker an
edge. An advanced fi rewall is of little use if there is a known
exploit in the corporation's email client. Background information
about the target can be obtained by spying on suppliers, social
engineering or even dumpster diving.
Gathering Background Information: Streetwise, Persuade or
Computers + Intelligence, 1–6 days, Diffi cult (+2)

Specifi c Target: When trying to steal data or compromise a
security system, defi ning your goal is very important. If the
hacker has to sort through thousands of fi les to fi nd the one
he needs, that takes longer than having the exact fi lename (or,
more likely, a prewritten routine that queries the compromised
system and pulls down any fi les matching a set of conditions).
Specifying A Target: Computers + Education, 1–6 hours,
Average (+0)

###### IIINTRUSIONNTRUSIONNTRUSION

Gathering Information
Hacking a system is hard. Stealing passwords is easy. If the
hacker can steal the access codes of an authorized user, it
makes his job vastly easier. An intruder may not be able to
get high level passwords in this fashion – users with high level
access are a lot more paranoid about security.

**Social Engineering:** Also known as lying. This covers everything
from walking into the offi ce and spying over someone's shoulder
as they type their password, to pretending to be service
engineers and installing a data tap on the target's phone line,
to learning the name of the senior marketing manager's pet cat
(which also happens to be his password).
**Social Engineering:** Deception + Social Standing, 1–6 hours,
Diffi cult (–2)

**Malware:** This covers installing programs such as keyloggers,
Trojan horses, computer viruses and other programs that aid
the hacker in penetrating a secure system. The hacker might
break into a corporate executive's home and install a virus on
his hand computer; when the executive goes to the secure site
and connects his hand computer to his work terminal, the virus
spreads to the secure system and opens a backdoor for the
hacker. Finding out a way to successfully install malware can
be a heist in itself.
**Writing Specialised Malware:** Computers + Education, 10–60
Hours, Average (+0)

**Observing System Operations:** What is the target computer
system being used for? Spying on how a computer is used can
give valuable clues on ways to compromise it. For example, the
computer system at a starport might be put under extreme load
when a megafreighter arrives, as it has to co–ordinate the fl ight
plans of dozens of cargo shuttles. A hacker would therefore
mount an attack at the moment of maximum confusion and
load, to minimise his chances of detection.
**Observing System Operations:** Recon + Intelligence, 10–60
days, Routine (+2)

Set–up
If the target is connected to an accessible network, the hacker's
task is easier. Few secure targets, though, are conveniently
accessible, forcing the hacker to take extra steps before the
heist.

**Obtaining Intrusion Software:** While there are 'toolkit'
programs (see Intrusion Software, below), it is also possible to
obtain or write programs designed to crack a particular system
or to perform other tasks. For example, a thief who intends to
subvert a security camera network might fi nd it useful to get the
software to manage the cameras fi rst. It is embarrassing getting
caught trying to download a camera management suite when
you are hanging off the side of a building in the middle of the

night, trying to avoid being spotted by the guards as you hack
their security controller computer.
Obtaining Software: Streetwise + Intelligence, 10–60 days,
Routine (+2)

Connecting To The Target: If the target is not directly
accessible, the hacker needs to fi nd a way in. This may be
resolved as part of the main heist or as part of preparation.
Remote connection to an isolated system involves fi nding
backdoors or secondary communications channels; for
example, if a target computer is networked only to the
corporate mainframe via a satellite relay, the hacker might
have to compromise the satellite fi rst.
Connecting To The Target: Recon, Stealth, Security or
Computers + Intelligence, 1–6 hours, Diffi cult (–2).

Avoiding Tracers: A good hacker assumes that something
will go wrong and therefore takes steps to protect himself.
Instead of hacking the target directly, he goes through a series
of intermediary servers to hide his identity. He uses stolen
identities instead of his own and he avoids leaving a trail of
electronic credits or other personal data. Taking preparations
like this takes time but also make a failed heist less likely to
result in the hacker being discovered by countermeasures.

The hacker can take this step even when physically
compromising a target. If you are hacking the computer in
Room 7, then you can still buy yourself time by making the
security program in Room 8 chase you around the planetary
network a dozen times before fi nally identifying the source of
the breach.
Avoiding Tracers: Computers + Education, 10–60 hours, Easy
(+4)

###### INTRUSION

Security Software
Security software comes in three forms:

**Anti–Intrusion:** This is the basic security program, described on page 92 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Anti–intrusion programs
raise the diffi culty of hacking into a system, as long as they are running. Most computers default to running the best possible
anti–intrusion program with their available resources – for example, a Computer/3 would run Security/3 when idle, dropping to
Security/1 when running an Expert/2.

The table below notes the required Computer /rating for each program. Anti–intrusion programs affect the diffi culty of _all_ hacking
checks made within a system, unless the hacker has managed to masquerade as an authorized user.

**ANTI–INTRUSION PROGRAMS**

Technology Level Average (+0) Diffi cult (–2) Very Diffi cult (–4) Formidable (–6) Impossible (–8)
TL7 0 10 25 — —
TL9 0 1 10 25 —
TL11 0 1 2 10 —
TL12 0 1 2 3 25
TL14 0 0 1 2 10

**Monitors:** Monitor programs watch for potential intrusions or other suspicious behaviour and activate a more powerful anti–
intrusion program if they spot trouble. Whenever a hacker does something not permitted by his Clearance level or fails a hacking
check, roll 1d6 and compare it to the monitor threshold. All Monitors are Rating/0.

**Common Monitor:** 5+
**Uncommon Monitor:** 4+
**RareMonitor:** 3+
**Exotic Monitor:** 2+

Backdoors
There is a backdoor of some sort into most systems. A corporate network may be entirely self–contained and have no
direct link to the outside world but if some drone in Sales leaves his TL12 smartphone connected to both the corporate
intranet and the planetary datagrid, then an enterprising hacker can sneak in via the phone connection and compromise
the corporate network. A roving security drone might have an automated maintenance routine that compels it to 'call
home' to its manufacturer when it perceives fault; a hacker could subvert the manufacturer's system, trigger a fault (say,
by sabotaging a shipment of spare parts) and then upload a new set of commands to the security drone ordering it to open
a connection to the secure network of the site it is guarding.

Combined Heists
Computer hacking can be dull for the characters not involved; like any predominantly solo activity, the Referee should
avoid letting a hacking attempt take too long. One option to involve the other players is a combined heist – the hacker
needs his allies to either get him into the target site so he can access their closed network from the inside or needs them
to open up a hole in the defences so he can remotely access the target.

Hackers can also be of use in physical heists; a hacker could switch off security measures at just the right time or feed
false data to a security controller.

###### IIINTRUSIONNTRUSIONNTRUSION

**Countermeasures:** Countermeasure programs fi ght back
against hacking attempts. They are triggered by a Monitor.

Common responses include:

- Tracing the source of a hacking attempt to identify the
    hacker. The hacker must make a Computers check at a
    penalty equal to the Rating of the Countermeasure program
    or be identifi ed.
- Locking out accounts. All user accounts are temporarily
    suspended, meaning the hacker is pushed back down to
    Null clearance.
- Alerting the security controller. Rating/0
- Alerting network administrators. Rating/0
- Shutting down external network access. Rating/1
- Automatically backing up key fi les to a read–only memory.
    Rating/0
- Activating more powerful Anti–Intrusion programs. Rating
    is based on the program used.
- Running standard anti–intrusion protocols that counter the
    DM from Intrusion programs. Rating/3.

Clearance
During a hacking attempt, the hacker can have any one of
fi ve abstract clearance levels. The Referee determines what
clearance level the hacker needs to accomplish any given task.
Secret data might be available only at User clearance; turning
off the security system might need Admin–level clearance;
turning off the safety interlocks and blowing up the main reactor
needs Complete Control.

**Complete Control:** The user has complete control of the
computer. He may do anything within the system. It is assumed
that he has deactivated any security systems that might detect
or impede him. Effectively, he owns the computer.

**Admin:** The user has full privileges and can do almost anything
he wants. The main difference between Admin and Complete
Control is that an Admin is still a 'legal' user of the system and
may still run afoul of Monitor programs if he does anything that
a legal user of the system should never ever do under any
circumstances.

**User:** The user has limited access to the system but may do
certain actions without tripping a Monitor.

**Null:** The user does not have legitimate access to the system.
Anything he does may trip a Monitor.

**Detected:** The user has been detected by the system. The
best available Anti–Intrusion or Countermeasure programs are
now activated.

Intrusion Actions
When hacking a system, there are several likely actions a
hacker might take. The basic diffi culty for any hacking attempts
is Average, modifi ed by any Anti–Intrusion programs running.

Upgrade Security Clearance: This allows a hacker to increase
his security clearance. The easiest way to do this is to have the
authorization codes of an existing user but it can also be done
by hacking the system.
Upgrade Security Clearance: Computers + Education, 1–6
minutes, Varies

Current
Clearance

Desired
Clearance Diffi culty
Null User Diffi cult (–2)
Null Admin Formidable
(–6)
Null Complete Control Impossible
(–8)
User Admin Diffi cult (–2)
User Complete Control Formidable
(–6)
Admin Complete Control Diffi cult (–2)

Search the System: The hacker looks for a particular fi le in
the system. The time taken depends on the size of the system.
Knowing what you are looking for and/or having a prewritten
search routine halves the time required.
Search: Computers+Intelligence, 1–6 minutes, Varies

Override a Critical Subsystem: This covers security
systems like cameras or alarms, life support systems, internal
communications, access control of external doors and so on.
Override a Critical Subsystem: Computers+Intelligence, 1–6
minutes, Varies –2

Override a Non–Critical Subsystem: This includes lights,
basic environmental controls, internal doors, sanitation and
maintenance and so forth.
Override a Non–Critical Subsystem: Computers+Intelligence,
10–60 seconds, Varies

Data Theft: Copying or deleting fi les. Computers+Education,
1–6 seconds (or more, depending on the size of fi le), Routine
(+2)

Data Alteration: Altering data fi les. Computers+Intelligence,
10–60 minutes, Routine (+2)

###### INTRUSION

Example of Hacking
_Cyrus the hacker wishes to obtain key data from an Imperial
Ministry of Justice citadel. He begins by casing the target and
discovers that the citadel has its own computer system that is
not networked. He will need to physically break into the citadel
fi rst, using a conventional heist._

_Once Cyrus is inside the citadel, he sits down at one of the
terminals and begins hacking. The citadel's computer is running
an Anti–intrusion Program that increases the diffi culty of all
hacking attempts by –4 but Cyrus has a hand computer with
Intrusion/3 on it, giving him a +3DM to hacking, so the total
effective DM to his hacking is –1. Furthermore, the Referee
rules that monitors are tripped on a 3+._

_Cyrus begins the hacking attempt at Null clearance. He
begins by poking around the system. The data he wants is not
immediately apparent, so the Referee calls for a search. Cyrus
rolls Computers + Intelligence with a total –1DM and fails the
check. The Referee secretly rolls to see if Cyrus has tripped
a monitor. Nothing happens, so Cyrus assumes he has not
alerted the security system._

_Realising that fi nding the data may take longer than expected,
Cyrus decides to obtain a user account. He could use the
Upgrade Clearance action but why bother with that when he
has just spotted another terminal that is still logged onto the
system. This user has the authority to search the system, so
Cyrus runs another search with no modifi ers and succeeds. He
has found the location of the fi le he is looking for. Unfortunately,
the user does not have the access rights to read that fi le._

_Cyrus could spend several minutes hacking the system or he
could just grab the fi le. He just grabs the fi le, succeeding in
his Computers check. Unfortunately, the user account he is on
does not have the access rights to do so, so the Referee rolls to
see if a monitor has been tripped. The Referee rolls a 5 – and
the alarms go off all around Cyrus._

_The system's countermeasures are activated. Instantly, a more
powerful Anti–Intrusion program is brought online, increasing
the diffi culty of any future hacking attempts. The guards are
alerted. Worse, the building is automatically sealed off. Cyrus
is trapped inside and has only a few minutes to escape before
the guards arrive._

_His only hope is to override the door controls. This is overriding
a critical subsystem, which would normally be a Diffi cult (–2)
check. The added Anti–Intrusion protocols increase this DM to_

–4. It would take Cyrus 1–6 minutes to hack the doors normally
but the guards are coming soon, so he elects to increase the
DM again to reduce the time to 10–60 seconds. He makes his
last Intrusion check at a –6DM, praying that he will succeed and
force the doors open before he is caught...

#### SAMPLE TARGET

Horizon Corporation Branch Office
Diffi cult Heist
Background: The Horizon Corporation specializes in interstellar
trade and shipping, with a special emphasis on opening new
markets by developing backward worlds. They have a reputation
for shady dealings and oppressive economic colonization; some
worlds are locked into punishing contracts with the company,
where Horizon gets a cut of every export and import.

Target: The physical safe where Horizon keeps several hundred
thousand in credits, as well as sensitive documentation and
contracts.

Description: The Horizon offi ce is located on the north–east
corner of the 20th fl oor of a skyscraper on a TL12 world. Directly
above the Horizon offi ce, on the top level of the building, is a
fi ve–star restaurant; directly below are offi ces belonging to an

Computer System Checklist

- What is the computer's Rating? Personal computers
    range from Rating/0 to Rating/5; large computers
    range from Rating/5 to Rating/100. The computer's
    Rating determines how many programs it can run

- What Anti–Intrusion program is running? What Anti–
    Intrusion programs are available at the computer's
    Technology Level? Generally, a secure installation
    runs the best Anti–Intrusion program it can but it may
    be forced to run a lower–rated program to free up
    processor cycles for other tasks.
- What is the threshold for the Monitor programs?
    Monitor programs look for suspicious behaviour and
    may be tripped if a hacker fails a hacking roll or does

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

investment company, NESF holdings. The Horizon offi ce has a
staff of 200, mostly analysts and brokers.

Inside, the offi ce is divided roughly into three sections. Public
visitors and clients are shown the corporate face of Horizon;
it is all gilt and synthetic marble, a carefully crafted corporate
image showing Horizon's many contacts and clients across
the galaxy. Most employees work in the main trading fl oor (4)
and the smaller rooms around it which take up half the offi ce's
fl oor space. Finally, there is what the employees refer to as 'the
hallows', where the senior executives work. The hallows has a
higher security level than the rest of the offi ce.

**Security Measures:** Access to the building itself is controlled;
visitors must pass through a metal detector & security sniffer on
the ground fl oor; weapons and other dangerous items are not
permitted inside.

Two of the offi ce walls as well as the fl oor and ceiling have been
specially reinforced. The exterior walls are made of transparent
panes of a synthetic crystal that is nearly as hard as diamond.

Public access to the offi ce is via the three main lifts or stairs, all
of which exit into the public corridor outside the offi ce entrance.
There is a private lift for executives, which is accessible only
with a biometric scan and a card swipe.

The computer network is linked to the planetary grid. It has a
Computer/20 running Anti–Intrusion/3 at all times.

There are numerous security cameras in the building (each one
marked with a c ). The security cameras in the corridor feed into
both the building's security center and Horizon's own security
controller (3).

During the day, there are 10 security guards on duty; at night,
there are four. One is stationed in the security control room at all
times. Sentry positions are marked on the map with an s.

This is a Smart Building, although the guards rarely use this
monitoring ability.

###### IINTRUSIONNTRUSION

**Notable Security Measures:
A:** The main door for visitors. It is controlled from the reception
desk in room 1. Visitors are seen by the security camera mounted
above the door and may communicate with the reception staff
by intercom. Visitors are not permitted access without a prior
appointment.

**B:** Staff entrance. There is a biometric palm scanner and a card
reader; both are required to open the door.

**C:** Service entrance. This door is concealed in the wall and
is not visible to a casual glace. It is also operated by a palm
scanner and card reader. It is normally used for deliveries to
the cafeteria.

**D:** Doors into 'The Hallows'. These doors are controlled from
the security control room (3), although the sentry at the door
usually contacts the control room by radio and asks them to
open the door. (In practise, during the day, the doors are left
unlocked if executives are constantly going in and out). There is
no sentry at the door from the executive lift.

**E:** This is two–meter thick pane of diamond–hard crystal, as
tough as starship armor. It can be polarised to block out light.
Cutting through it is virtually impossible. An explosives expert
could plant charges at the corners, blowing up the braces that
hold the pane in place. However, using explosives to drop a
chunk of crystal weighing more than 100 tons down 20 stories
onto a crowded street is not exactly a subtle heist.

**F:** Security Atrium. To get to the safe in room 6, one must fi rst
step into this room and close the door. The room is then scanned
to confi rm that there is only a single occupant and that his face
matches the approved list of users. The occupant must then
enter a code into a keypad. If the user fails any of these checks,
the room automatically seals itself and will not open. There is
a pressure plate in the fl oor that precisely measures the user's
weight; taking any items from the safe will change the user's
total weight, sounding an alarm unless the user is permitted to
remove an item.

**Notable Locations**

**1.** Main Lobby. There is an imposing desk which doubles as a
fortifi ed defensive position dominating the room. At least one
security guard is here at all times.
**2.** Conference Room. Visitors are escorted to this room and met
by an executive from the Hallows; very few visitors are permitted
beyond this point. The room is tastefully decorated with items
from a hundred worlds, all of which are clients of Horizon. The

couches are leather from one world, the granite table imported
from another and so forth. The room is bugged and under
constant observation via the concealed security camera.

**3.** Security Control Room. Horizon has a Security Control
Computer with a human security guard present at all times.
**4.** Main Offi ce Floor. A large room full of desks, computers and
(during the day) overly aggressive young businessmen on a lot
of caffeine.
**5.** Main Conference Room. This room is used regularly
throughout the day but is not part of the guard's standard patrol
at night, making it a good starting point for an incursion.
**6.** Vault. The safe is in this room. The combination for the safe
consists of a six–digit code unique to each authorized user,
coupled with an iris scan. If either of these is incorrect, a stunner
fi eld is activated and an alarm sounds.
**7.** Environmental Controls. The offi ce has its own environmental
support and is capable of recycling its own air and water for up
to 72 hours. It has 128 hours of backup battery power.

Notable NPCs:

- **Erik Danan:** The head of the branch offi ce and a rising star
    in Horizon. Physically, he appears to be in his mid–forties;
    he's actually twice that, thanks to the use of anagathics.
- **Rai Zaenar:** Another executive in the company; she has
    her eye on Danan's job and would consider aiding a heist
    that led to a scandal tarnishing her boss's reputation.
- **Yamaril Swina:** The head of security. She is an ex–marine
    who takes her job very seriously indeed. She was formerly
    Danan's personal bodyguard. Swina has many connections
    in the criminal underworld.
- **Haro Naom:** One of the two kitchen staff, Naom comes
from a community that was economically ruined by Horizon.
He hates working for the company but lacks the courage to
do anything with his venom.

Security Responses:

- **Unauthorized Access of A, B or C Door:** Send a security
    team to investigate, lock down the Hallows
- **Unauthorized Access of D Doors:** Send a security team
    to investigate, sound an alarm
- **Intruders Sighted:** Alert security control to alert other
    security staff; lock down the Hallows
- **Gunfi re:** Order all employees to hide under their desks;
    break out body armor and heavier weapons from the
    security control room.

# SSMUGGLINGMUGGLING

Every world has some limits on what can be brought ashore.
Even planets with law level 0 and barely any functional
government at least attempt to restrict trade in nuclear weapons.
More civilised planets try to prevent traffi cking in illegal drugs,
disruptive technologies or especially cheap goods. A smuggler
can make a fortune sneaking past customs patrols and starport
guards – as long as he avoids getting caught.

Hives of Scum and Villainy
Smugglers in the Imperium fall into three categories.
**Bootleggers** are small–time smugglers, illegal speculative
traders who buy and sell goods banned on a particular planet.
The average bootlegger is nothing more than a nuisance with
a free trader.

**Smuggler rings** are part of criminal syndicates and are involved
in large–scale smuggling operations that transport thousands of
tons of illegal cargo.

Finally, **blockade runners** are elite professional smugglers
who specialize in smuggling cargoes past Imperial cordons.
Blockade runners are hired by clients to transport diffi cult or
dangerous cargoes.

Smuggler's Cargo
The most common items transported by smugglers are items
with high import taxes and illegal items such as drugs or
weapons. Most smugglers carry perfectly legitimate items in
addition to illegal ones, using them as cover.

Smuggled goods fall into the categories below:
**Biochemicals & Drugs:** Chemicals, pharmaceuticals, controlled
substances, dangerous substances including explosives.
**Cybernetics & Electronics:** Any advanced electronics,
especially computers or cybernetics.
**Weapons:** Firearms, lasers, ammunition, missiles, including
vehicles and vehicle parts
**Living Beings:** Slaves, rare animals, illegal immigrants
**Other Goods:** Anything else.

## CUSTOMS CHECKS

The more closed and secure a planet is, the more invasive the
security measures used. However, even on comparatively open
planets, if a vessel acts suspiciously or draws attention to itself,
the customs offi cials will take a greater interest in it. In game
terms, the two key values are the planet's Law Level and the
smuggler's Trust.

Law Level
Roll 2d6 and compare it to the planet's Law Level whenever
checking to see if the smuggler encounters a possible customs
check. If the dice roll is equal to or lower than the law level, then
the customs offi cial checks the smuggler in some fashion.

Circumstances may apply DMs to these Law Level checks.
For example, if the planetary government is trying to suppress
a rebellion, the customs offi cials will be on the look–out for
weapons shipments and will check incoming ships more
thoroughly.

Trust
Trust measures the customs offi cials' attitude to a merchant.
Trust starts at +0 for most travellers. A corporate ship from a
well–known corporation might have a Trust of +2; a ship that
has visited the system several times before without problems
might have a Trust of +1. By contrast, a ship acting suspiciously
will have a lower Trust. Failing to comply with customs offi cials'
request reduces Trust.

Trust is applied as a DM to Law Level checks. A high Trust
makes it more likely that the traveller will be waved through a
customs check.

Regular Visitors: A clever smuggler will regularly visit a
world making legitimate cargo runs, building up Trust with the
local customs patrols to make it easier to sneak illegal cargos
through.

Bribery: An even better method to build up Trust is to bribe
offi cials. A bribe to the right person can increase the smuggler's
effective Trust or allow the smuggler to reroll a customs check.

#### CUSTOMS PATROLS

Customs vessels patrol the space around civilised worlds,
keeping watch for pirates, smugglers and other unwanted
visitors. Small free traders are likely to be challenged if they are
not regular visitors to that planet.

Responding to a challenge requires a Routine (+2) Deception

- Social Standing check. If the check is failed, reduce the
smuggler's Trust by 1.

Make a Law Level check as the smuggler approaches the planet
and compare the results to the Customs Scan table below.

See _Security Measures_ on page 70 for explanations of the
various response types. If the smuggler ship fails to co–operate,
reduce his Trust by 2 and roll again.

#### STARPORTS

On the average planet in the Imperium, there is a single starport
and all interplanetary and interstellar traffi c must go through
the port. There are several reasons for this beyond control
over incoming traffi c. A single starport minimises the need for
spacecraft cargo handling facilities, border control, quarantine
and security measures. The peculiar status of the starport as
an extraterritorial Imperial holding also encourages planetary
governments to have only one such 'port, to avoid handing over
too much power and land to the Imperium. On large, highly–
populated planets there tends to be a single HighPort and
multiple smaller DownPorts but all traffi c is supposed to pass
through the HighPort fi rst.

All this makes smuggling a dangerous proposition. The fi rst
question for any smuggler is to go via the starport or attempt to
land elsewhere on the planet. Both have their advantages and
disadvantages.

Landing At The Starport
Landing at the starport allows the smuggler to blend in with
the legitimate traffi c going to the planet. He just fl ies along
being a nice innocent free trader but then has to deal with the
security checks and customs scans at the starport. Depending
on the planet's law level and technology level, these can be a
mere formality or a rigorous inquisition – and if the smuggler is
discovered, then he is trapped in the middle of the starport with
no chance of escape.

At the starport, make a Law Level check and compare it to the
table below.

###### SSSMUGGLINGMUGGLINGMUGGLING

**Avoiding Starport Customs:** Some canny smugglers land at
the starport, then dispose of their cargo before passing through
customs. This requires the co–operation of other agents at the
port. Cargo might be transferred to the hold of a ship that has
already been expected or moved through hidden tunnels under
the port.

Landing Elsewhere
Flying out to the middle of nowhere allows the character to
avoid customs checks at the starport but immediately draws
the attention of the authorities. If the ship's course change is
detected (a virtual certainty on any world with a Technology Level
of 5 or more and a Population of 5 or more), then reduce the
ship's Trust by 4 and roll another Customs Patrol encounter.

#### SECURITY MEASURES

These are the hurdles and obstacles that a smuggler must
navigate when customs patrols and starport security investigate.
Each of the three types of security measure (Bureaucracy
Checks, Sensor Scans, Physical Scans) pose a different set
of problems.

Bureaucracy Checks
All goods and starships are supposed to have accompanying
documentation. These documents exist in both physical and
electronic form; electronic documentation is acceptable on
worlds with TL7 or more or in starports built to that technology
level. In practice, much of this documentation is ignored
or forgotten, making it easy for a forger to produce the bare
minimum of paperwork and get past a documents check.

Electronic Documentation Check: The customs vessel
demands that the smuggler transmit a copy of all relevant
documentation. The transferred fi les are automatically scanned
and cross–checked by computer.
Physical Documentation Check: The smuggler presents a
print–out, signed bill of lading, sealed letter or other physical
document. This is then examined by the customs offi cial.

In both cases, the important thing is the Effect of the Forgery
check used to produce the fake documents. If the Effect of
the Forgery check is equal to or greater than the Intelligence
DM of the customs offi cial, the bureaucracy check is passed.
Electronic checks have the equivalent to a +1 to +5 Intelligence

Smuggling Example
Diamond Joe intends to smuggle eight tons of illegal luxuries onto Regina. Regina has a Law Level of 9.

Joe's scoutship jumps into the system and sets course for Regina. The gas giant of Assiniboia looms large in his port viewscreen
when he encounters the fi rst customs patrol. ' This is Regina C21 to unidentifi ed Scout, transmit your ident details now.'

Joe makes a successful Deception check, leaving his Trust unaffected at +0 and respondsafter giving the required details
'H eh, yeah, been out on the frontier a long time. Can't wait to get out of this tin can, the air smells like...well, heh, me.'

Next, the Referee rolls 2d6, adds Joe's trust DM of +0 and compares the result to the Customs Scan table. He rolls a 5, which
is four less than the planet's Law Level of 9. This means a Close Range Scan. The customs ship orders Joe to change course
to fl y within 10 kilometers. He complies and the scout ship is scanned with visual, thermal, EM and active radar. He holds his
breath... but the luxuries are safely stowed away and only the radar can penetrate his ship's hull. He's safe.

At Regina Starport, the Referee checks the law level again. This time, he rolls a 3, a whole six less than the planet's law
level. He has run into a particularly offi cious clerk who wants to impound the vessel until it can be searched fully. Not wanting
to have his cargo hold examined, Joe offers a bribe of 9,000 credits. The clerk considers the offer, the Referee rerolls...and
gets a 10. Pocketing the bribe, the clerk stamped 'cleared' on Joe's falsifi ed documentation. There is another cursory scan
of the cargo but the luxuries are not detected.

Another successful run.

###### SSMUGGLINGMUGGLING

DM, depending upon the complexity of the programming,
although most will tend to be at the lower end of the scale.

**Avoiding Bureaucracy:** The Forgery skill is used to produce
false documentation. Alternatively, a Very Diffi cult (–4) Deception
check may allow the smuggler to bluff his way past by claiming
he has lost his papers.

Sensor Scans
Spacecraft have diffi culty getting useful information from
a sensor scan, although ships equipped with an advanced
densitometer can determine the contents of a ship from
outside. Sensor scans are more dangerous to the smuggler in
the starport, as starport scanners are larger and more powerful
than those on a ship.

**Ship Sensor Scans:** First, compare the sensor suite possessed
by the customs vessel to the tables below to determine what
sort of scans can be used.

System TL DM Includes
Standard 8 –4 EM, Radar/Lidar
Basic Civilian 9 –2 EM, Radar/Lidar
Basic Military 10 +0 EM, Radar/Lidar,
Jammers
Advanced 11 +1 EM, Radar/Lidar,
Densitometer, Jammers
Very Advanced 12 +2 EM, Radar/Lidar,
Densitometer, Jammers,
Neural Activity Sensor

Next, for each available scan, roll 2d6 and compare to the target
numbers below. Add the Sensors DM to the roll.

**EM:** EM sensors may be able to detect weapons, cybernetics
& electronics.
**Close:** 6+ **Short:** 8+ **Medium:** 10+
**Long:** 12+

**Radar/Lidar:** Radar/Lidar may be able to determine the contents
of external cargo pods. Any illegal contraband inside external
pods only will be detected if the sensor scan is successful.
**Close:** 6+ **Short:** 10+ **Medium:** N/A
**Long:** N/A

**Densitometers:** These can discern the shape and density of
objects, even those inside a ship's hull. A densitometer can
detect any illegal contraband.
**Close:** 8+ **Short:** 10+ **Medium:** 12+
**Long:** N/A

NAS: Neural activity scanners can only detect living beings but
are extremely good at it.
Close: 4+ Short: 8+ Medium: N/A
Long: N/A

If the roll is equal to or greater than the target number, the
sensor sweep has detected something unusual. The customs
vessel may demand that the smuggler prepare to be boarded
or simply reduce the smuggler's Trust by 4, ensuring a more
thorough sweep at the starport.

Starport Sensor Scans: Starport sensor scans work in the
same way as customs vessel scans. A cursory scan uses the
same values as a short–range scan. A full scan uses the same
values as a close–range scan.

Avoiding Scans: Some sensor suites (Military, Advanced, Very
Advanced) include jammers, allowing the operator to jam other
sensors by sending out false data or noise. When jamming
sensors, use opposed Sensors rolls. Jamming is both obvious
and suspicious in normal circumstances but it is sometimes
possible to blame the jamming on solar fl ares, leakage from a
perfectly legitimate cargo, a damaged communications system
and so on.

Most smugglers store their cargo in internal cargo bays, avoiding
radar sweeps. Various upgrades provide added protection
against sensor scans (see page 82).

Physical Scans
When a customs offi cial boards a smuggler's ship, the smuggler
is in grave danger. A physical scan is much more likely than a
long–range sensor scan to fi nd illegal cargoes. A physical scan
ranges from a cursory sweep with a hand–held sensor wand to
tearing open every access panel and cargo container.

Basic Chemical Sniffer: Chemical sniffers detect biochemicals/
drugs and living beings. A basic chemical sniffer locates such
cargo on a roll of 6+.

Advanced Chemical Sniffer: An advanced chemical sniffer
also detects biochemicals, drugs and living beings; it succeeds
on a roll of 2+.

Physical Examination: A physical examination involves walking
the decks of the smuggler ship, opening cargo containers at
random and so forth. A physical examination locates any illegal
cargo on a roll of 8+.

Impounded: An impounded vessel is held under guard by
starport authorities. The crew may be confi ned to quarters,

###### SSSMUGGLINGMUGGLINGMUGGLING

asked to wait in a lounge or even held in a brig. Impounded
crews cannot interfere with inspections of their vessel.

**In–Depth Physical Examination:** An in–depth physical
examination involves a full examination of the cargo bay and all
containers, a sweep of the crew quarters and other rooms and
may even involve inspectors walking along the exterior hull. Any
contraband is located on a roll of 4+.

**Full Search:** The ship is stripped down almost to its airframe.
A full search may take several days. Any contraband is located
on a roll of 2+.

**Avoiding Physical Scans:** Simple precautions include
concealing the illegal contraband within legal cargo (for example,
burying cases of cybernetics under tons of minerals). Smugglers
may also install hidden cargo compartments to hide cargo.

Visitors to a ship can also be distracted or otherwise dealt with.
If a customs offi cial is about to uncover your cache of illegal
drugs, then blasting him with a stunner is better than being
arrested. True, you then have to deal with an unconscious
customs offi cial but at least the trouble has been deferred.

#### SMUGGLING ADVENTURES

Smuggling adventures work best when the characters are
bootleggers or blockade runners – they need to be independent
agents, planning their own runs and dealing with problems on
their own. Smuggling should be more than a series of rolls to

False Positives
Any scan can result in false positives, where the scanner
mistakes a perfectly legitimate and legal item for contraband.
A cargo of genetically engineered wheat might have a
similar biochemical signature to a particular type of drug;
that container full of perfectly legal computer parts could be
identifi ed as a container of illegal cybernetics. For legitimate
traders, false positives are an irritating and expensive
mistake, as they force the trader to wait for hours or days
while the problem is resolved.

For smugglers, false positives are a veritable godsend, as
they can be used to explain away an incriminating scan. In
game terms, if a scan succeeded by a margin of 0–2 and
the smuggler has a similar legal cargo on board, he may
attempt to blame the positive scan result on the legal cargo.
With good roleplaying, the smuggler may be able to force a
reroll of the scan.

see if the characters are detected, it should be a nerve–wracking
battle of wits between the Player Characters and the authorities.
Each planet and starport should present its own challenges and
unique experiences. Smuggling drugs onto a world–spanning
megacity is a very different game to smuggling weapons to a
peasant rebellion on a feudal technocracy.

One downside of smuggling games is that a 'successful run' is
also a boring one. If the characters fl y past the customs patrols
and bypass station security without a hitch, it makes for a dull
game. Throwing arbitrary barriers and problems is fun if done
on a rare occasion but making something disrupt their carefully
plotted smuggling operation every time will just frustrate the
players (' what do you mean, the nuclear bomb is leaking' ).
Therefore, the Referee should assume most smuggling runs will
go smoothly and make events around the smuggling operations
fun and involving too. Drag the characters into business with
criminal syndicates and shady brokers, send Imperial Ministry
of Justice agents after them, let them plot the takeover of
smuggling operations across a whole subsector. Han Solo was
not an interesting smuggler because he had a really fast ship
that could outrun pursuers, he was interesting because he owed
a crime boss a debt and had a soft spot for lost causes.

Boss Pallas
A notorious crime boss hires the characters. Boss Pallas is
feared in the criminal underworld; he is incredibly rich and
powerful but also vengeful. Fail him and you end up with your
throat cut. If the characters can keep Boss Pallas happy, they
will make a fortune. What does Boss Pallas want?

###### SSMUGGLINGMUGGLING

1. He has got several thousand tons of drugs sitting in a
warehouse. It needs to be moved to market _immediately._ A
thousand dtons is well beyond the capacity of the average
smuggler. The characters will either have to recruit more
smugglers or somehow obtain a big freighter.
2. Boss Pallas's son is supposed to be his heir but young Jerek
is absolutely useless. Pallas wants the characters to train the
boy in the criminal arts by taking him on a few smuggling runs.
Jerek will be a liability, always saying the wrong thing and
drawing the attention of the authorities.
3. As above but one of Pallas's lieutenants wants the characters
to arrange for Jerek's convenient death. With Pallas's blood heir
out of the way, the old crime lord is much more likely to hand his
organization over to one of his subordinates.
4. Boss Pallas's gang is feuding with a pirate band. The
smugglers will have to contend with pirate attacks as well as
customs patrols.
5. Boss Pallas wants the characters to get caught, so they can
feed false information to the authorities about his operation.
6. Boss Pallas wants to retire to his old family home but he is
a wanted criminal on his homeworld. He wants the characters
to smuggle him home. Every criminal in the subsector who has
ever been hurt by Boss Pallas will be gunning for him...

Smuggling People
Traffi cking in humans (and other sophonts) is the dark side
of smuggling. It can be a source of absolute misery and
degradation but can also be a genuinely good act. It all depends
on the destination...

1. A powerful crime lord hires the characters to transport a cargo.
It turns out to be a cargo of human slaves. If the characters
refuse the job, they will insult a powerful ally.
2. As above but the cargo consists of a gang of hardened
criminals and terrorists; highly dangerous thugs who are being
smuggled onto the target world to establish a new criminal
network there.
3. The cargo consists of telepaths, who are heading to a secret
psionics institute for training. The cargo is kept in low berths
for safety. During jump, one of the PCs starts to have strange
dreams about people asking him for help...
4. As above but the telepaths are said to be dangerous
psychotics who will be tamed by the teachers at the institute.
Opening any of the low berths might release a psychic killing
machine...
5. The cargo consists of refugees, fl eeing the oppressive
government of their homeworld. Unfortunately, the destination
world is unwilling to accept them, so they must be smuggled in.

###### SSMUGGLINGMUGGLING

6. As above but the refugees are part of a bizarre religious sect
that practises some belief that appears alarming or threatening
to the Player Characters.

Forced Uplift
A primitive (TL1–3) world is under interdiction by the Imperium.
It is a Red Zone, patrolled by naval cutters and defence drones.
The characters are hired to smuggle cargo past the blockade.
What is the cargo? Books, blueprints, tools and supplies, an
industrial revolution in a box that could lift the planet four TLs
in a generation! The characters' patron wants to transform this
primitive world – why?

1. The patron believes that everyone should enjoy the benefi ts
of advanced technology and the shock caused by the sudden
disruption is worth it. He will pay the characters extra if they go
undercover and help introduce the new scientifi c paradigm.
2. The patron wants access to the mineral wealth of the planet
but the natives do not have the legal or fi nancial wherewithal to
deal with his needs. Therefore, step one is remake society, step
two is buy stuff.
3. It is all a sociological experiment by the Imperium, to study
the effects of 'enemy subversives' on primitive frontier worlds.
If a band of smugglers can turn a TL2 world into a TL5 world
quickly, then other polities could do the same, turning previously
irrelevant border worlds into potential bases.
4. It is a sociological experiment by a mad scientist; she is
remaking this world to prove a thesis. Unfortunately, her thesis
states that rapid socio–technological change will result in
anarchy and war.
5. The patrons are actually nobles from the primitive world, who
intend to import technology despite the Imperial ban.
6. As above but the nobles plan to use this technology to
conquer their homeworld.

Plague
A potentially lethal plague called Hiver Flu has broken out on a
high–population world. The governments of neighboring worlds
panic and jump their planetary navies into the quarantined
system to prevent anyone getting in or out. This is a golden
opportunity for smugglers.

1. The characters are hired to extract a corporate executive and
his family from the world. They claim to be free of the plague...
2. As above but the executive's daughter is in love with a native
of the planet. On hearing of her father's plans to leave, she ran

away and is now somewhere in the plague–ridden megacity.
The characters need to fi nd her before they can leave.

3. The characters are hired to deliver anti–viral drugs to
uninfected sections of the planet. The neighboring worlds are
stockpiling their own supplies of these drugs and do not want to
waste them on a 'doomed planet'.
4. As above but the patron is a shady criminal who stole the
drugs and wants to deliver them only to the rich and powerful.
5. The virus is much more dangerous than expected. Everyone
on the target world is dead by the time the smugglers arrive.
6. The characters are hired to smuggle the virus out. The
neighboring worlds will only work on a vaccine if the virus
threatens them, so the government of the affected world wants
to covertly spread the plague.

Smuggler's Prize
An infamous smuggler ship, the Clavid, was lost 100 years ago.
She was carrying a fabulously valuable but highly illegal cargo
when she misjumped. Now, the Clavid's been sighted by a scout
ship and the chase is on. Can the characters recover the Clavid
and her cargo before the navy impound her?

1. The Clavid's cargo consists of stolen art, including an alien
relic. This relic caused the misjump.
2. The navy want to retrieve the Clavid, not destroy it. Even if
the characters lose the race, they may be able to take the prize
by force.
3. The Clavid is falling into the upper atmosphere of a gas giant.
Recovering her will be extremely diffi cult – especially as there
is something living there.
4. The Clavid was not lost – her smuggler crew retired to a
pleasure planet and left her drifting in space. She is fi lled with
booby traps, a fi nal insult to the navy who hunted her for so
long. The characters will need to board the Clavid, avoid the
traps and read her navigational logs to fi nd the treasure.
5. The Clavid was not lost, she was buried in deep space. Her
crew knew they could not sell their cargo, the goods were too
hot. Therefore, they deliberately jumped their unmanned ship
into a distant system, to be picked up a few years later. The
original smuggler crew are after the ship, too.
6. Hey, that low berth is still running...

###### SSMUGGLINGMUGGLING

# FFENCESENCES ANDAND I ILLEGALLLEGAL G GOODSOODS

Before a character can profi t from his piracy, theft or smuggling,
he must sell his illegal goods. This requires a fence, who can
dispose of stolen goods and pay the character in clean credits.

Skip to the Loot
If your players are more interested in jumping to the next
adventure than negotiating with fences and calculating profi t
margins, then assume they can get 10% of the value for hot
goods and 25% of the value for other stolen goods. Ignore
Purchasing Capability unless the characters are trying to
sell exceptional amounts of stolen material.

Finding a Fence
The best fence is an existing Contact, Ally or, even better, an
Organization. If the characters have no such contacts, they
must fi nd one. This can be diffi cult depending on the law level
of the planet.

Just because you have found a fence does not mean that he
can purchase all your stolen goods. A back–street electronics
broker might be able to buy a hand computer that you looted
from the corpse of a defeated guard but cannot buy the 50 tons
of electronics you stole from the cargo hold of a trader. A fence's
purchasing capability is the cap on how much the fence can
afford to pay in any given month.

A powerful fence may be able to demand lower prices on goods
from the character.

Hot Goods
Some items are easier to sell illegally than others. A tank of
petrochemicals is identical to every other tank of petrochemicals
(more or less – a chemist might be able to analyse the chemical
content and trace minerals and so distinguish one tank from
another). By contrast, every starship is unique, with numerous
serial numbers, tracer beacons, signatures and ownership
papers. It is a lot easier for the fence to dispose of untraceable
goods than hot goods.

Common hot goods include:

- Starships
- Art and other unique items
- Recently stolen items

Characters may be able to take the heat off stolen goods by
various means, such as erasing serial numbers, creating false
ownership papers, waiting several years to sell or otherwise
disguising the origin of the goods.

Selling Stolen Goods
Stolen goods use the same system as selling regular goods,
as described on page 164 of the Traveller Core Rulebook but a
different Modifi ed Price Table is used. Apply the following DMs
in addition to the standard DMs for trade.

- Hot Goods: –4 DM
- Damaged or Second–Hand Goods: –4DM

This means most goods sold through a fence will have a –4DM
at least and most stolen items will have a –8DM. Characters are
very unlikely to get anything close to the 'real' price for ill–gotten
gains.

###### FFFENCESENCESENCES ANDANDAND I I ILLEGALLLEGALLLEGAL G G GOODSOODSOODS

Determining Base Price
When selling stolen cargo, use the standard prices from the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_. When selling equipment, use the
standard prices but assume that all stolen equipment counts
as 'damaged or second–hand' and so incurs a –4DM to the
Sale price roll. Most stolen equipment counts as Advanced
Manufactured Goods.

Next, roll 3d6, adding the following DMs:

- +The character's Broker skill
- +The character's Intelligence or Social Standing DM,
    whichever is higher
- +The largest DM from the Sale Price DM column
- –The largest DM from the Purchase Price column
- –any dice modifi er from the fence. Richer, more powerful
    fences can drive the price down

Example
Kern the Pirate has captured a free trader and stolen the
following:

- _60 tons of advanced machine parts (75,000 each base_
    _price)_
- _30 tons of robots (400,000 each base price)_
- _Six vacc suits (10,000 each base price)_
- _Four accelerator rifl es (900 each base price)._

All of these goods are stolen (–4) and the robots, vacc suits
and rifl es are hot (–4). The machine parts are fortunately more
anonymous and are not hot.

A fi ne haul, the sort of prize that a pirate dreams of. He fl ees to
the nearest safe planet, an Amber Industrial Desert planet called
Baracha. Baracha has Law Level 3 and a Class B starport.

First, Kern needs to fi nd a fence. He will need a very rich fence
indeed to buy all those stolen goods, so he looks for a Very
High purchasing capability broker. This calls for a Streetwise
roll, modifi ed as follows:

- _Law Level 3: +0_
- _Class B Port: +2_
- _Very High: –4_

Kern succeeds in this check and fi nds a fence called Harri the
Snake.

Next, Kern determines how much Harri is willing to pay.

The Referee then rolls 3d6, adding Kern's Broker skill (+3), his
Intelligence DC (+0) and the DMs on the table above. Harri is a
Very High fence and applies a –3 DM.

For the Advanced Machine Parts, he rolls an 8–1=7, letting
him sell the machine parts at 30% of the base price or 22,500
credits per ton. At 60 tons, this is 1,350,000Cr.

For the Robots, he rolls 9–4=5, for a price 20% of the base cost or
80,000 Credits per ton. This is worth another 2,400,000 credits.

For the Vacc Suits, he rolls a 6–9=–3. Harri offers him 1% of
their value, or 100 credits each, for another 600 credits.

For the Accelerator Rifl es, he rolls a 9–6=2, for 10% of the value
of the weapons or 90 credits each, for a total of 360 credits.

The total value of the prize is: 3,750,960 credits.

Illegal Goods
The value of universally illegal goods (see page 164 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook ) already takes into account the
diffi culties of fencing such items. Use the regular Modifi ed

dealing with such items.

PCs (roll 1d6) 1 – a dog, 2 – drugs, 3 – guns, 4

- information, 5 – tickets to sporting events, 6
- his grandmother.

41 Extremely dangerous criminal, marked with prison
tattoos and combat augmentations; will kill the
Player Characters if they cross him.

12 Scrap dealer; eyes up the PCs' vessel as if
appraising how much it's worth

42 The fence conducts all his business via comms
and computer link; the characters never see his
true face.
13 Crooked shopkeeper; his dealings with the PCs
are nothing to do with his front business, so the
characters will fi nd themselves hauling crates
through a restaurent kitchen or speciality food
store.

43 Elderly fence; he has been doing this for years,
knows all the tricks and worked with legendary
thieves.

14 Street gang boss; has connections everywhere. 44 Megacorporation; the characters deal with a
different corporate representative each time
15 Offworlder with a strange accent; may also be
an alien. Prefers to deal only with people of the
same ethic minority.

45 The fence is obviously building up a private
armada or army; the fenced goods go to pay for
weapons and mercs.
16 Beggar king; commands an army of beggars,
pickpockets and charlatans.

46 Wealthy businessman, now a respected property
developer or industrialist but who remembers his
connections to his criminal youth.
21 Free trader based at the starport; he will leave
after the deal and so cannot be reused on this
world.

51 Manipulative and inscrutable alien or psion;
fencing the goods is part of some strange plan.

22 Gang of petty thugs, always heavily armed. 52 Representative of a corporation, willing to make
shady deals to get ahead.
23 Second–hand equipment store owner; lots of
bargains.

53 Former pirate, now a shipping magnate with ties to
criminal underworld.
24 Loud and overly friendly fence; invites the
characters to dine with his family.

54 Organised crime syndicate; cross them at your
peril.
25 Extremely paranoid; convinced the authorities
are on his trail.

55 Ostentatious to the extreme; considers himself to
be untouchable.
26 Once–feared criminal overlord, now scraping a
living and dreaming of glories past.

56 Old or sick and requires constant life support.
Despite this handicap, the fence is a feared
member of the criminal underworld.
31 Antique collector, with an extensive collection of
strange items.

61 Starport administrator on the take; the whole
starport is a haven for criminals.
32 Surly broker at the starport, brusque and to the
point.

62 Highly professional fence; has his own high–
security warehouse and private security force.
33 Obviously wealthy noble, doing some illegal
dealing on the side. Adds a touch of class to the
whole affair.

63 Vastly wealthy crime lord; failing to show him the
proper respect will result in the characters getting
airlocked.
34 Exile from another world, collects relics of home. 64 The fence has an ulterior motive for purchasing
the goods.
35 Fast–talking businessman and speculative
trader.

65 Local noble, engaged in illegal trade to prop up his
failing control of the planet.
36 Takes an interest in the characters' fortunes and
suggests other heists for them.

66 Fence is actually a government agent.

Entries 11–26 are especially suitable for small–scale fences; entries 41–66 are for especially large and wealthy criminal brokers.

Items marked with a (!) after the price are considered suspicious
if purchased by a civilian, as their primary use is by criminals.
They may still be purchased if the planet's Law Level permits it
but unless characters use a black–market supplier or contact,
they may be noticed by the authorities.

Armor & Clothing
**Boarder's Vacc Suit (TL9):** Half–way between the standard
vacc suit and the HEV suit, the boarder's vacc suit incorporates
high–burn, short–range thrusters, improved body armor,
magnetic grapples and an arm–mounted blade and snub
pistol.

**Cargo Waldo (TL9):** This is a exoskeletal framework that fi ts
around the wearer's limbs and greatly increases his strength,
allowing him to lift heavy loads. The basic cargo waldo is open
and provides minimal protection but increases the wearer's
Strength by +6. The waldo reduces the wearer's Dexterity by 4
and gives a –4 penalty to Initiative.

A character may wear a vacc suit or cloth armor while wearing
a cargo waldo but the Dexterity penalty is increased to –6.

**TL13:** This more advanced waldo is quicker and easier to
use. It increases the wearer's Strength by +6 but only reduces
Dexterity and Initiative by –2. The TL13 waldo design also
includes a vacc suit, making it better suited for use in vacuum.

**Climbing Exoskeleton (TL10):** This is a lightweight
exoskeleton, small enough to be worn under most clothing and
fl exible enough to bend with the user's body. When activated,
parts of the exoskeleton stiffen to bear weight, making climbing
easier. The hands, feet and kneepads of the exoskeleton have
synthetic setae (bristles) that allow the suit to 'stick' to a wall. A

climbing exoskeleton gives a +4DM to any climbing attempts.

Chameleon Suit (TL9): The basic IR Chameleon Suit is a
simplifi ed version of the IR chameleon option (see the Traveller
Core Rulebook , page 89); the suit hides the user's heat traces,
making him invisible to infrared (Very Diffi cult (–4) to detect with
sensors). The suit also muffl es heartbeat, breathing and other
noises that might be detected, giving a –2DM to attempts to
locate the wearer with sensors.

TL12 : The TL12 Vislight Chameleon Suit bends light around
the wearer, making him invisible to the naked eye and giving a
+4DM to Stealth checks. At TL13, vislight chameleon technology
can be integrated into armor (see the Traveller Core Rulebook ,
page 89).

Densitometer Cloak (TL15) : A densitometer cloak distorts the
gravitic sensing used by a densitometer. An object wrapped in
the cloak cannot be detected by densitometers – they show
up as a vacuum. A human operator may notice a suspicious
person–shaped vacuum but automated densitometer sensors
will be baffl ed by the cloak.

Neural Hood (TL15 ): Neural hoods are an experimental
variation on NAS Sensors but the design has leaked into
the criminal underworld. A Neural Hood shields the wearer's
brainwaves and prevents them from being detected by a NAS
Scanner. It can also be programmed with a NAS scan of another
individual; a NAS Scanner will perceive the hood's wearer to be
that individual, fooling the scanner.

The Neural Hood also blocks telepathy, rendering the wearer
immune to the Telepathy talent.

###### EQUIPMENT

**Stealthsuit (TL15):** The stealthsuit combines the sensor–
baffl ing technologies of the chameleon suit, densitometer cloak
and neural hood with form–fi tting body armor. Stealthsuits are
also equipped with Computer/2 weave and smart fabric.

Options
**Densitometer Weave (TL15):** This incorporates the benefi ts of
a densitometer cloak into a suit of armor. It costs Cr. 25,000.

Augments
**Concealed Blades (TL9):** These are small, virtually undetectable
blades that are concealed within the user's fi ngertips. The
blades are razor–sharp and increase hand–to–hand damage
by +1. Furthermore, they can be very useful for picking locks,
cutting wires and so forth. Cr. 20,000.
**TL13:** Instead of metal, the blades are made out of a carbon
composite that cannot be detected by metal detectors or x–
rays, as the blades are concealed within the distal phalange
bones. Cr. 30,000(!).

Intrusion Interface (TL13): This is a specialized form of skill
augmentation, where the user's neurons are stripped to reduce
his reaction time and optimize his brain for hacking. A character
must have a wafer jack or TL12 Neural Comm to benefi t from
an intrusion interface. An intrusion interface gives a +2DM to all
hacking attempts but if the user fails a Computers roll against
a system with countermeasures, he suffers 2d6 damage. Cr.
200,000(!).
Neural Sheathe (TL15): The neural sheathe blocks telepathy
and NAS detectors, like a neural hood. Costs Cr. 100,000(!).

Variable Tattoos (TL9): These tattoos are made with a pigment
that can be made temporarily colourless by applying a tiny
electric current through an implant. The wearer may cause
his tattoos to vanish or appear by touching the subcutaneous
implant. Costs Cr. 250+, depending on the size and complexity
of the tattoos.
TL11: The implant can be wired to your nervous system allowing
the wearer to turn the tattoos on and off with a thought. At this
TL, the tattoos can also be made animated or bioluminescent.

Communications
Electronic Thumb (TL10): The 'electronic thumb' is a compact,
powerful transceiver used by drifters and hitchhikers. The
thumb has an extremely long range but cannot be used to
send a message easily – it just sends out an easily detectable
high–intensity radio pulse that basically says 'I AM HERE AND
I WANT A LIFT!' An electronic thumb has a range of 45 million
kilometers and has a mass of 8kg. Costs Cr. 5,000.

Narrowcast Comm (TL+2): This is a variation on the standard
comm models (see the Traveller Core Rulebook , page 90) that
restricts its transmissions to a narrow beam, making it much
harder to detect or intercept. Narrowcast comms require a
direct line of sight between the comm and the receiver (or a
suitable relay such as a satellite or a narrowcast laser relay).
Using a narrowcast comm gives a –4DM to any attempts to
detect or intercept the communication. The cost is twice that of
the basic model.

Narrowcast Relay (TL12): A pack of narrowbeam relays
contains 20 'slap patches'. Each patch is the size of a fi ngertip
and contains a tiny laser and a receiver. Narrowcast relays are
used in places where a narrowcast comm would have trouble
communicating with other comms. For example, if there is an
intervening wall, there is no path for a laser narrowcast to reach
the receiver. Placing a narrowcast relay atop the wall lets the
beam 'hop' over the obstacle. Chains of narrowcast relays may
be created. A pack of 20 costs Cr. 100.

**Painkillers:** Painkillers allow a character to ignore some of the
effects of damage. Normally, when a character is wounded,
the damage to his Characteristic causes his Characteristic DM
to change. For example, a character with Dexterity 12 has a
Dexterity DM of +2. If that character then takes 10 damage to
his Dexterity, he is reduced to Dexterity 2 and a DM of –2.

Painkillers prevent the loss of characteristic DMs. Each
painkiller has a rating; this measures the amount of damage
that the character may ignore for the purposes of determining
characteristic DM changes. For example, if a character is on

Computers
**Intrusion Deck:** An intrusion deck is a specialized hand computer
designed for use with hacking. It is designed to be as portable
as possible and has a connector for an Intrusion Interface, as

well as built–in defences against security countermeasures.
Some of the software on an Intrusion deck is on ROM chips
and cannot be rewritten or changed but is cheaper. All Intrusion
Decks are specialized for running the Intrusion program.

a painkiller with a rating of 12, then the fi rst 12 damage to any
characteristic does not affect the character's DMs. However, if
the character takes more than 12 damage, then the painkiller's
effects are lost and all the effects of damage are felt normally.
Note that this means that a character using painkillers may
have a sudden catastrophic loss of characteristic DMs instead
of a slow decline.

The onset time listed for each painkiller determines how long it
takes the drug to take effect.

Sensors & Sensor Bafflers
**Bugzapper Gas (TL12):** Bugzapper gas consists of a high–
pressure canister containing a synthetic gas. The gas particles
strip loose electrons away from the air molecules when sprayed,
causing a burst of static electricity. This burst of static is strong

enough to damage or disable sensitive components like most
sensors or computers.

Roll 2d6 and compare the result to the target values below to
determine the effects of a bugzapper spray.

Object Examples Success Effects
Unshielded Exposed microcircuit, bug 6+ Destroyed
Average Computer terminal, sensor 8+ Destroyed
Shielded Rugged computer, security camera 11+ Temporary shutdown
Hardened Military computer, outdoor camera 12+ Temporary shutdown

A can of bugzapper gas costs Cr. 1,000(!) and has six sprays.

**Grav Fuzzer (TL13):** A poor man's Densitometer Cloak, a
grav fuzzer is a small portable device that creates extremely
weak gravitational distortions within a fi ve–meter radius. These
distortions are undetectable to humans (despite what some
people claim) but do prevent densitometers and other gravitic
sensors from determining what it within that area. The distortion
fi eld itself is obvious to a densitometer. Cr. 5,000, 2kg.

Tools
**Smartrope (TL11):** Smartrope is an improved form of normal
rope. A smartrope contains a series of electrically activated
myomer 'muscles' along its length, allowing it to be commanded
using a simple control panel. The rope could be commanded

to coil itself, to retract or extend by up to 50% of its normal
length, to constrict or to loosen. It can also be used as a data
cable. The standard method for controlling smartrope is with
a controller module that plugs in anywhere along the rope but
there are remote smartropes available.

Smartrope can be commanded to wriggle forward but it moves
extremely slowly (about one meter every minute) and tends to
get tangled up (roll 8+ on 2d6 every minute to avoid this). It has
an effective Strength of 8 (+1). A 50–meter length of smartrope
costs Cr.2,000.

Wrecker Bar (TL5+): The iconic tool of the scavenger, a wrecker
bar is a 1.5 meter–long bar of metal with a hooked head at one
end, used for tearing objects or vehicles apart. The other end
can be fi tted with a number of attachments.

###### EQUIPMENT

Composite Items
Metal items are extremely easy to detect using magnetic metal detectors, x–rays or densitometers. This makes smuggling
guns and other tools diffi cult for a thief. Replacing ferrous metals with fi breglass or more exotic variations of carbon makes
such weapons harder to detect with sensors (–2DM to Sensor checks). Composite items cost three times as much as the
basic item and are two TLs higher (at a minimum of TL7).

Shielded Items
Active electronic items can also be detected easily by scanning for electromagnetic activity. Shielded electronic items are
harder to detect (–2DM to Sensors checks) but cost 50% more. Shielded items are also more rugged and better able to resist
radiation, environmental damage and other hazardous conditions.

#### SHIP COMPONENTS

Hull Modifications
**External Cargo:** Instead of carrying its cargo _inside_ the hull,
a ship may be designed to mount cargo in an external rack
or framework. This allows a smaller hull to be used instead,
making the ship considerably cheaper.

When designing a ship with external cargo, fi rst determine the
total displacement of the ship as normal. The total displacement
will be used to determine the size of the Jump Drive, Maneuver
Drive and Power Plant needed.

Next, determine how much of the ship will be allocated to
external cargo and how much will be enclosed by the hull.

Hull components and pricing are determined as normal. Ships
with external cargo may not be Streamlined or Distri buted.
Remember, the drives must be capable of moving the ship's
total displacement, not just the displacement of the smaller hull.

The cost of the cargo frame is 1,000 Cr./dTon.

_For example, a 1,200 ton ship would normally have a hull
costing 120MCr. By designating 800 tons of that as external
cargo, the ship only needs a 400ton hull costing a mere 16MCr.
(plus another Cr. 800,000 for the cargo frame). Into that 400
ton hull, the designers cram the drives, bridge, fuel and other
components for the freighter._

**External Cargo Handling:** External cargo containers are
attached to a framework and can only be accessed by travelling
outside the ship in a vacc suit or in a transport vehicle such as a
shuttle. Landing an external–cargo ship is extremely dangerous
and diffi cult, so external cargo vessels can have diffi culties
trading at worlds without a shuttle fl eet or highport.

**External Cargo Jettisons:** External cargo can be jettisoned
remotely. The framework is built with explosive bolts, allowing
specifi c cargo canisters to be released if necessary.

Internal Components
Concealed Compartment: Up to 5% of a ship's volume may
be designated as a concealed compartment. A concealed
compartment costs an extra Cr. 20,000 per ton. The concealed
compartment is shielded from detection (–2DM to Sensors
checks) and is hard to fi nd by physical examination (–4DM to
Investigation checks).

Fuel Tank Compartments: Fuel tank compartments are
containers that fl oat within the hydrogen fuel tanks of a starship.
Such compartments can only be accessed when the tank is
at least 75% empty. Fuel tank components are even harder
than a concealed compartment to detect, as even a thorough
examination of the ship will not detect the compartment unless
the fuel tanks are opened and searched but they are less suitable
as shelter. Fuel tank compartments cost Cr. 40,000/ton.

External Cargo & Combat
External cargo is very vulnerable in combat. Use the table
below for attacks on the exterior of the ship.

###### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

**Grav Screen:** A gravity screen blocks densitometers from
scanning the inside of a ship. A grav screen weighs 5 tons per
1,000 tons of ship shielded and costs 5MCr.

**High–Burn Thruster:** This is a powerful chemical rocket that
can give a temporary speed boost to a ship. To determine the
effects of the thrusters, choose an M–Drive that produces the
desired speed. (For example, to get 6–g acceleration on a 200–
ton ship requires M–Drive F.) The high–burn thruster weighs
20% and costs 20% of that M–Drive (2.2 tons and 4.8MCr, in
the case of a M–Drive F).

Thrusters require fuel depending on the thruster's drive number.
Fuel equal to 25% of the mass of the drive gives enough for
one full hour of operation (10 space combat turns). Fuel costs
10,000 Cr./ton. A high–burn thrusters may not operate for more
than one hour before requiring a shut–down period equal to the
duration of operation.

# TTRAMPSRAMPS ANDAND T THIEVESHIEVES

The notion of a 'pirate ship' or 'drifter ship' is largely nonsensical. Pirates use common trader ships, refi tted with added weapons
and boarding gear. Drifters take passage on whatever ships will carry them. That said, there are a few designs uniquely associated
with these groups; the pirate corsair and the Seeker–class miner are the most common but there are also pirate ships like the
_Buccaneer–_ class Interceptor or the Blockade Runner.

In addition to these ships, this chapter covers customs inspection vessels and q–ships.

Hey, What's With The Cheap Fighters?
Several designs in this book use 10–ton fi ghters, which cost 18MCr according to the Traveller main rulebook. The High Guard
supplement contains revised design rules for small craft and recalculates the price for a 10–ton fi ghter to 9.837MCr. Similarly
the lower costs for the ship's boat and launch are also used.

Smuggler
This is a refi t of the venerable 200–ton Type A Free Trader. It strips the staterooms and low berths to cram in extra concealed cargo
space. A casual inspection of the ship shows it to be no different than a standard Type A, as long as the inspector stays out of the
crew quarters. For emergency defence, there is a double turret with twin beam lasers. If the fuel tank compartments are used solely
to carry fuel they will allow the ship to make an additional Jump–1.

External Cargo Trader
This ungainly vessel has been described as a 'spider sitting on a brick' but even that is much too poetic for such an ugly ship. The
engines, jump drive, fuel tanks and, almost as an afterthought, the crew section are all crammed into the 300–ton hull, while the
500–ton cargo module (comprising 50 tons of fuel and 450 tons of cargo) is held in a framework of struts and spines. A 40–ton slow
pinnace nestles in the midst of the cargo. This small craft is used for carrying cargo to worlds without a High Port or shuttle fl eet.
The crew usually consists of a captain, pilot navigator and 2 engineers.

At 160MCr, the ExCT is more than 50MCr cheaper than the Heavy Freighter while carrying almost as much cargo. The downside is
that the ExCT is extremely vulnerable to attack. Any pirate or scoundrel can easily blast holes in the cargo section, so ExCTs must
either be given armed escorts or permitted to jettison their cargo at the fi rst sign of a threat.

Jumpcusser (Type S)
This jumpcusser is a refi t of the nigh–ubiquitous Type S scout. Two of the staterooms and the air raft are removed to increase
the fuel tank space and the cargo hold. The jumpcusser can jump in, attack a ship and jump out again without stopping to refuel
(note that the fuel processor has also been removed, so the jumpcusser has to use unrefi ned fuel or purchase refi ned fuel from
elsewhere). A concealed triple turret mounts a pair of pulse lasers and a grapple line. The standard jumpcusser carries four crew
in shared staterooms; two of the crew are armored boarders, who climb down the grapple line to attack freighters. The other crew
are the pilot/navigator and an engineer.

A cargo scoop at the prow allows the jumpcusser to pick up jettisoned cargo and salvage or to recover the armored boarders if
they are forced to make a quick escape into space.

Pirate Interceptor
A small, combat–ready ship, the 200–ton interceptor has an excellent array of features for any pirate, from its grappling arm to
retrieve cargo to its excellent double–jump range. It is well armed, with three beam lasers, a grappling line and a light fi ghter and
has six staterooms allowing it to carry a full crew of six (Pilot, navigator, engineer, fi ghter pilot and 2 gunners) and six “marines”,
while the low berths can be used to hold prisoners or to survive in an emergency.

However, with only 3Gs of thrust, the interceptor has problems actually _intercepting_ anything. It can chase down a sluggish trader
given enough of a chase but capturing anything faster is tricky. Worse, the interceptor has less acceleration than the average patrol
vessel. Using an interceptor in a high–security system is suicidal – but with a jump range of only one parsec, the interceptor lacks
the range to travel to isolated systems, unless its captain risks jumping into empty space.

Pirate Carrier, Indigo class
The 300–ton ship is a tiny light carrier. It carries ten 10–ton fi ghters in docking clamps along its outer hull. These fi ghters, each
armed with a single pulse laser, fl y out and attack the target while the carrier fl ies along behind. The fi ghters blast the target to
pieces and the debris is scooped up by the carrier's cargo net.

As the carrier is quite slow, it can expect to be intercepted by customs vessels. The six fi ghters and the carrier's own turrets can
see off most customs vessels long enough for the carrier to jump. Common refi ts replace some of the fi ghters and cargo with an
expanded drive section, giving the carrier a much more respectable acceleration. Drives and fuel assume that the fi ghters are
carried in their clamps, giving a total size of 400 tons. Normal crew consists of a captain, 2 pilots, a navigator, 2 engineers, 3
gunners and 10 fi ghter pilots.

Heavy Belter, Finder class
Nicknamed the 'worm', this cylindrical ship is a fl ying factory. It has jump–2 range, allowing it to travel off the jump mains in search
of undeveloped asteroid belts. It carries 30 tons of mining drones to chop up and process ore. The 20–ton launch is sometimes
used to haul ore to a trading station but more often the miners just take it on joy rides to stave off boredom. For defence, the ship
has a lone turret with twin pulse lasers; these lasers are also adapted for mining. Normal crew consists of a captain, navigator, pilot,
engineer and gunner, although it is not unusual for such a ship to run with just a pilot and an engineer.

Salvage Hauler, Bug class
One of the most distinctive designs in known space, the _Bug_ is easily recognized by the two grappling arms at the front of the ship.
The _Bug_ can rip pieces of salvage off a wrecked hulk and feed them into its 'mouth', a cargo opening at the prow. The bulbous
cockpit and stinger–like turret reinforce this insectoid impression. The hauler has an excellent cargo capacity and a 2–parsec jump
range, allowing it to double as a trader. In addition to the 20–ton launch, the hauler has a set of probe drones for investigating
wrecked ships. Normal crew consists of a captain, pilot, navigator, engineer and gunner.

A variant of the hauler, the _Mantis_ , reduces the cargo space to add armor and a larger M–Drive, making the ship more useful to
adventurers.

Passenger Cruiser, Genevieve class
'Cruiser' is perhaps a misnomer – this mid–sized
vessel is more like a commercial airliner making
short hops between worlds. It has a respectable
jump–3 range, while the 2G thrust capacity reduces
the travel time between arrival in the target system
and debarkation (express passengers may use
the ship's boat to cut the travel time down even
more). A ship of this size normally has a crew of 25
(captain, 3 pilots, navigator, 3 engineers, 2 medics,
3 small craft crew and 12 stewards) and carries 64
'live' passengers. There are also 100 low berths,
although these can be removed to make room for

Customs Patrol Boat, Grassnake class
The _Grassnake_ is an unfortunate example of redesign–by–committee. The original concept for this 50–ton space craft was a
high–speed inspector. Such a ship would have two to three crew and be equipped with missile launchers for self–defence. It would
wait in high orbit until a suspicious ship was detected; it would then intercept this vessel and scan it.

However, planetary governments wanted the _Grassnake_ to be capable of carrying out physical inspections. A two–man crew is
too small for this task, so the cabins were converted to double occupancy. Furthermore, to save costs, the missile launchers were
replaced with pulse lasers. The _Grassnake_ was converted to use a smaller drive instead of that originally intended. The result is a
high–speed interceptor that lacks the performance to chase down a determined target, with weapons which encourage it to stay in
combat when it patently lacks the staying power to do so and a four–man crew crammed into a space designed for half as many.
Some _Grassnakes_ add extra fuel tanks, replacing the low berths and some of the cargo space to give it more range.

Customs Patrol Cutter, Rattler class
The _Rattler_ class is a pirate's nightmare. At 600 tons, it is bigger than any pirate corsair but is faster and much more heavily armored.
The _Rattler_ has the most advanced electronics money can buy, as well as plenty of cargo and stateroom space for combat marines.
The _Rattler_ serves as the mothership for three _Grassnake_ patrol boats but has plenty of fi repower of its own. Five turrets would
be impressive enough but it is the massive fusion gun along the ship's spine that lifts the _Rattler_ from _threatening_ to _devastating_.
_Rattlers_ are normally seen only in rich, high–technology systems; occasionally, they are shipped to other systems to deal with a
particularly dangerous piracy problem. The normal crew consists of a captain, 3 pilots, 2 engineers, 6 gunners and 10 marines.

Q–Ship
A Q–ship is a merchant vessel refi tted with weapons to entrap pirates and this particular model is a very nasty surprise for any
corsair. It is based on the Type R 'fat trader' hull, a particular tempting target for pirates. The basic Type R is slow, unarmored,
lightly armed and full of rich cargo and from the outside, the Type RQ looks identical to its parent.

In combat, the differences become immediately apparent. The 'cargo hold' actually contains four 10–ton fi ghters, concealed by thin
metal panels that are jettisoned. The ship is protected by 40 tons of crystaliron armor. Advanced sensors and computers let the
crew track and eliminate pirate threats, while four concealed triple turrets give the Q–ship a devastating punch and with a large
complement of marines it can quickly overwhelm any pirate vessel it can attach its breaching tube to. Normal crew consists of a
captain, 3 pilots, navigator, 2 engineers, 4 gunners, 4 small craft crew and 16 marines.

# BBELTELT M MININGINING

A full discussion of belt mining, including a full adventure and
the Belter career, may be found in _Adventure 1: Beltstrike!_ For
those without access to that book, this chapter provides a brief
overview of asteroid mining.

The types of asteroids commonly found in a typical belt vary
considerably but tend to fall into four classes: Silicates (S
class), Metals (M class), Carbonaceous (C class) and Iceballs
(I class). S–class asteroids contain no useful materials but the
other three may be worth exploiting.

Asteroid Zones
There are several locations in a typical solar system where
asteroids are clustered.

**N Zone:** The inner belt. This band contains predominately M
class planetoids and debris, usually with a high concentration
of nickel–iron, hence the N designation. The N zone occurs
roughly 1.25 times the star's optimum zone for supporting life

- so, in the case of our own solar system, the N zone of Sol's
asteroid belt occurs 187 million kilometers from the sun.

**M Zone:** The mid belt. A zone of transition between the N and
C zones, here the asteroids and planetoids are a mixture of M
class and C class. The M zone is located between 1.25 and 1.5
times the distance of the optimum zone for supporting life.

**C Zone:** The outer belt. C class asteroids and planetoids
predominate; fi gure on 90% of the material being carbonaceous.
The C zone is greater than 1.5 times the distance of the optimum
zone for supporting life.

**Trojan Clusters:** These are asteroid clusters found in the Trojan
points of gas giants, if present in a star system. Trojan points
are empty points of space that exert their own gravitational
infl uence due to the gravitational forces of two larger celestial
bodies – such as a gas giant and its parent star. An object in
a Trojan point remains in place as long as no other force is
brought to bear. Trojan points are remarkably stable points
in a solar system and tend to collect C class asteroids and
planetoids. These are found in the same orbit as the gas giant
but 60–degrees ahead of and behind the planet.

**Planetary Rings:** The rings of gas giants or other large
bodies.

Searching for Asteroids
Searching for suitable asteroids is a long and laborious process.
The belt miner cruises on a long orbit that intersects with one
of the belt zones, scanning for asteroids that are worth mining.

A belter with a good Sensors skill or advanced sensors may be
slightly quicker at fi nding a potential mine site but this phase
often comes down to luck and patience, not skill.

Determine Asteroid Type
Once a potentially exploitable asteroid has been discovered,
the Referee should roll secretly on the Composition and
Resource Presence tables to determine what exactly is in
the asteroid. Firstly, cross–reference the location with the
Composition roll to determine the type of asteroid; next, consult
the Resource Presence table to determine the target values for
each resource.

Mining Asteroids
Belters use a variety of tools, from manual mining using hand–held lasers to remotely operated mining drones to huge mining
platform ships that swallow whole asteroids and tear them apart. The amount of ore produced in a six–hour watch varies depending
on the tools used.

Method Ore Per 6–hour work shift
Manual 2–3 tons
Mining Drone, TL11 1d6+3 tons
Mining Drone, TL13 1d6+6 tons

#### BELTER LIFE

A high–technology, high–population world has a voracious
appetite for raw materials, especially rare metals. Belt mining is
a vital part of the economy of many worlds and so is controlled
by corporations and syndicates. Independent belters exist
on the fringes of this industry; they work the regions that are
too isolated or too poor for a corporation to make a profi t on
or they work as prospectors, selling the location of valuable
rocks to the corporate machines instead of trying to develop
the claim themselves.

The belt region is too big to be effectively patrolled by the
authorities, so even in highly populated and civilised systems,
the average belter has to be ready to take the law into his
own hands (or, more likely, lasers). Pirates, claim jumpers and
long–running blood feuds are common and corporate mining
concerns regularly employ private security forces.

Of course, a belter has a much bigger chance of dying because
of a mining accident or blown airlock seal than because
of violence. Belters spend hundreds of hours in tiny metal
bubbles, tens of millions of kilometers from the nearest world,
separated from the endless vacuum by only a few centimeters
of metal. Between these long lonely sojourns in the belt, the
miners congregate in settlements cut out of larger planetoids. If
the belt is the Wild West, then these planetoids are one–horse
towns with saloons, whorehouses and blacksmiths. They are
also railroad towns; rather than fl ying to the starport with a load
of ore, the independent belter sells his ore to a trader with a
large cargo ship, who then heads planetwards with a full cargo
load. A belter might set foot on an actual planet only once or
twice every fi ve years.

Belter Clans
By nature, belters are a hardy, independent breed who are
willing to endure long periods of isolation and commonly

associate only with other belters. In many systems, belt mining
quickly becomes a culture; belters form into clans and mining
ships are handed down from parent to child. (The fact that
the average belter spends vastly more time in zero–gravity
and is exposed to much more radiation than a planet–dweller
and the commensurate effects on physical development and
reproduction hasten this cultural bifurcation.) These belter clans
can be major players in the economy of a system, thanks to their
infl uence over belt mining. A clan may only have a fraction of
the production capacity of a mining corporation but the lifelong
belters know the asteroid fi elds better and can attack shipping
with relative impunity, unless the planetary government is willing
to search every asteroid in the system for hidden bases.

Mining Outsystem
With the development of jump travel, new asteroid belts open
up for development. Many belters use jump–capable mining
ships; they stay a few jumps ahead of the mining corporations,
staking claims on valuable sites and selling the locations. Some
miner clans are nomadic, crossing the galaxy in search of virgin
systems. Others have become corporations themselves, with
their own mining barges and cargo ships. Still, the universal
concept of the belter is that of a slightly crazed lone miner, who
knows the rocks and the control panel of his Seeker better than
he knows the back of his own hand.

Belters in Play
The life of a belter is rarely suitable for Traveller campaigns,
although a group of wandering ex–belters with a few mining
drones could make some extra cash on the side through
asteroid mining. However, an ex–belter is still a part of the belter
community and so can visit the belt settlements. These isolated
planetoids often have excellent ship repair facilities and skilled
mechanics, as well as weapons dealers, criminal contacts or
places to hide.

# OODDDD J JOBSOBS

There are some jobs that every traveller does at one time
or another. Transporting freight from one world to another,
mercenaries for hire, bodyguards or tour guides for a bored
noble, searching for a lost ship; hang around any starport bar
long enough and some shadowy patron will offer you one of the
usual _Traveller_ jobs.

Then there are the odd jobs. The jobs you do when you are
desperate for enough credits to get offworld, the jobs you do
when you can not fi nd anything else. The jobs you never talk of
again. This chapter is all about _those_ jobs.

Each odd job is described according to the following template.
**Job Number and Title:** Jobs are numbered from 11 to 66, so
the Referee can roll d66 to fi nd a random odd job. Jobs 11–26
are associated with starports or space travel; jobs 31–46 are
industrial or rural and jobs 51–66 are just _strange._
**Skills Required:** What skills are required to complete the job
with the least diffi culty. The characters do not necessarily have
to have these skills but they will be useful.
**Patron:** Who the patron is.
**Description:** What the job entails.
**Reward:** The credit reward for the job, per Player Character.
**Complications:** A list of six optional complications to turn an
odd job into an adventure.

11. Salvage Team
**Skills Required:** Zero–G, Mechanic, Vacc Suit
**Patron:** Grendel Thorn, Scrapper
**Description:** The wreck of an old 800–ton freighter, the _Mirabel_ ,
is in orbit. The jump drives and other key components have
already been stripped but there are still thousands of kilometers
of fi bre–optic cabling, superconductive power cables, jump
gridding, computer terminals and other salvageable parts. The
ship lacks life support, gravity and power; here is a vacc suit
and a crowbar, salvage what you can. Oh, the ship will hit the
atmosphere and start burning up in a few weeks.
**Reward:** Cr. 500/week.
**Complications:** The _Mirabel_ has a secret...
1. The _Mirabel_ was a former smuggler ship and there is still
valuable cargo hidden in a concealed compartment. A band of
smugglers knows this and intends to retrieve the cargo.
2. The _Mirabel_ 's jump drives were not removed and a random
fl uke in the ship's decaying power plant causes it to misjump
with the salvage team on board.
3. One of the _Mirabel's_ crew is still stowing away on board the
wrecked ship. He is looking for some hidden treasure on board,

such as a jump map to a rich asteroid belt or treasure cache. He
is the ghost on board the ship.

4. There is a literal ghost on board – the psychic echo of a
former crewman who was killed by pirates. Psionic characters
may be infl uenced by this echo.
5. The _Mirabel_ is not quite as badly wrecked as it fi rst appears
and has not been as thoroughly stripped as Thorn believes;
patch the holes in the hull, fi x the fried computer and fi ll up the
hydrogen tanks and you might be able to fl y her again. Do the
characters want to try stealing the wreck?
6. Grendel Thorn made a slight miscalculation when he plotted
the _Mirabel's_ orbit. The ship hits the atmosphere and begins
re–entry with the characters on board...
12. Concession Stand
**Skills Required:** Broker, Persuade, Streetwise
**Patron:** Alecca Broom, Trader
**Description:** Alecca has a 50–year lease on a booth in the
starport's main concourse, which she sublets to other traders.
Unfortunately, the last trader she rented the booth to was
arrested for fraud and one of the obscure clauses in her lease
states that the booth has to be occupied for at least 95% of the
year. She needs a business – _any_ business – to occupy the
booth for a few weeks while she fi nds a real tenant.
**Reward:** Whatever profi t the character's make, plus Cr. 100/
week.
**Complications:**
1. One of the other traders in the starport covets Broom's lease
and will sabotage whatever business the characters come up
with.
2. There is a remarkably annoying and offi cious health inspector
at the starport named Steanus Chwat, who will poke his nose
into whatever the characters are doing.
3. Broom is actually running a front for an organised crime
syndicate; whatever the characters' business is, it will be visited
by shady characters and smuggled goods.
4. It is a front for an organised crime syndicate all right but
Broom had no idea what was going on. The previous tenant
had the connections to organised crime. The syndicate contacts
the characters – their contacts from offworld know to come to
this booth at the starport, so they need the characters to play
along.
5. The starport is attacked by terrorists, protesting against some
Imperial or government policy.
6. The business is too successful and promises to make the
characters a lot of money but Broom has already found another
tenant to take over the booth. What do the characters do?

###### OODDDD J JOBSOBS

13. Starport Security
**Skills Required:** Melee, Investigate, Recon
**Patron:** Varo Moll, Starport Security Chief
**Description:** The characters will patrol the starport, looking
for trouble. Their duties include dealing with rowdy drunks in
the starport bar, watching for pickpockets and petty thieves,
patrolling the edge of the port district and hangars and generally
keeping order.
**Reward:** Cr. 750/week.
**Complications:**
1. A gang of thieves intends to steal a ship from the starport
hangars. The thieves' plan is to cut through the starport fence,
start a fi re near the hydrogen storage tanks and then break into
the hangar while the guards are distracted by the blaze.
2. Weapons are banned in the starport bar for everyone –
including security guards but there is a brawl involving a Vargr.
Everyone else in the brawl is using fi sts and chairs; the Vargr's
got lethal teeth and claws.
3. A local religious or political group starts protesting just outside
the starport, complaining about the infl uence of offworlders.
The planetary government supports their right to protest but
the starport wants them gone. How do the characters deal with
this?
4. A starship carrying refugees from a war–torn world arrives.
The starport authorities need the characters to keep order until
they can process their applications for sanctuary. How do the
characters deal with hundreds of terrifi ed, sick and starving
people?
5. A scoutship arrives in orbit and is brought to the starport.
The lone scout on board is in a coma; something poisoned him
and he obviously barely escaped with his life. What if that same
danger is now loose on the starport?
6. A smuggler band is using the starport to fence goods. They
offer to cut the characters in on the action if they 'overlook' a
few shipments.
14. Vermin Control
**Skills Required:** Animals, Sensors, Melee
**Patron:** Captain Rorik, Freighter Captain
**Description:** Some species of vermin thrive on spacecraft.
Even a 100–ton scout has hundreds of miles of corridors, access
tubes, pipes, cargo spaces and other places for vermin to hide.
Rats and other vermin pose a problem to a ship – they can
damage cargo and supplies but worse, they _breathe_ , putting
extra stress on the life support systems. The vermin must be
removed. Chemical sprays are not always effective – a tramp
trader from a distant system might carry a weird alien vermin
that is immune to conventional poisons. Sometimes, the only
way to get rid of the bugs is to hunt them down.
**Reward:** Cr. 250/day.
**Complications:**
1. The vermin are hunting spiders the size of a man's hand.
They are also poisonous, with fangs that can punch through a
vacc suit.
    2. The vermin are a colony of insects that breed at prodigious
    rates. There is a nest containing hundreds of thousands of bugs
    somewhere on the ship...
    3. The vermin are carrying a dangerous disease. If the characters
    are infected, they will have to be quarantined.
    4. The vermin are actually the ship's cargo – they were intended
    as pets but they have escaped. The characters need to hunt
    down the cute fuzzy–wuzzy things without killing them.
    5. The vermin are actually sentient; they have a hive mind. The
    vermin wandered onto the ship without understanding what
    they were doing and are terrifi ed.
    6. There are no vermin on the ship – there is actually a stowaway
    on board.
    15. Alien Hosts
    **Skills Required:** Diplomat, Steward, Social Science
    **Patron:** Starport Administrator Olin Ward
    **Description:** A trade route opened up recently between the
    Imperium and an alien polity. The starport is expecting a fl ood
    of alien visitors, many of whom will not be familiar with human
    customs and beliefs. The characters look trustworthy – can they
    keep the alien visitors out of trouble?
    **Reward:** Cr. 400/week.
    **Complications:**
    1. The alien visitors are honor–bound warriors who take
    offence easily. Unless the characters intercede, the starport will
    be littered with corpses hacked apart in honor duels.
    2. The alien visitors have trouble distinguishing between one
    human and another. _You all look the same to us_.
    3. The visitors are actually scouting the starport's defences for
    an invasion.
    4. The aliens are all telepathic and fi nd human emotions painful
    and wildly uncontrolled.
    5. One of the aliens wishes to defect and needs help escaping
    from his companions and minders.
    6. The aliens are being stalked by an assassin, an agent of a
    faction opposed to further contact with humans.
    16. Customs Inspectors
    **Skills Required:** Investigate, Sensors, Recon
    **Patron:** Customs Offi cer Cabreac
    **Description:** The starport is seeing a marked increase in traffi c
    and the existing customs offi cials cannot cope with the number
    of ships coming through. The characters will be employed to
    search ships for concealed cargo spaces and contraband
    goods. Offi cially, they are supposed to call in the actual bonded
    customs agents whenever a problem arises.
    **Reward:** Cr. 700/week.
    **Complications:**
    1. A smuggler tries to bribe the characters, offering them Cr.
    5,000 if they report that his ship is clean.
    2. As above but it is actually a test by Cabreac, to see if the
    characters are honest.

###### OOODDDDDD J J JOBSOBSOBS

3. While the characters are on board a ship, they discover that
the captain has left the security system offl ine. The characters
could steal the ship with ease...
4. An organised crime syndicate targets one of the characters'
Contacts, Allies or family members, planning to kidnap the
target and use him as leverage to force the characters to let
contraband through.
5. A freighter captain panics and jettisons his cargo in orbit while
the characters are on board. Hundreds of tons of freight are
now plummeting into the atmosphere. What do the characters
do?
6. In the course of an inspection, the characters fi nd something
unusual on board – not illegal but very unusual or suspicious.
21. Low Berth Medtechs
**Skills Required:** Medic, Persuade, Engineering (life support)
**Patron:** Starport Administrator Theyd Alin
**Description:** When a big transport ship comes through, it brings
hundreds of deep–frozen passengers in low berths. A medic
is needed to revive these passengers safely but the starport's
medical staff are severely overworked. In addition to medics,
technicians are needed to fi x failing low berths and counsellors
to calm disturbed or terrifi ed people who have just been thawed
out while their legs are still frozen.
**Reward:** Cr. 250/week.
**Complications:**
1. One of the passengers being transported is an extremely
dangerous criminal, a serial killer with psionic powers. He is
supposed to be defrosted only in a maximum security prison.
Unfortunately, the ship's passenger manifest was damaged and
no–one is quite sure which berth he is in...
2. The characters come across a passenger who died in the
low berth. Strangely, his identity papers show him to be a minor
noble with a signifi cant line of credit. One of the characters
could masquerade as this noble...
3. According to the manifest, this low berth was not defrosted on
schedule. In fact, it should have been opened... 70 years ago. It
has been overlooked all this time. Who is inside?
4. The passenger in the low berth is actually a drug smuggler;
his body is pumped full of drugs that will be extracted after his
death. He is not supposed to survive.
5. This low berth has been deliberately sabotaged. The dead
occupant was the agent of a trading corporation. Who killed her
and why?
6. One of the character's Enemies is in the low berth! All it would
take to remove this long–running foe is the fl ick of a switch...
22. TAS Stringers
**Skills Required:** Investigate, Comms, Art (writing)
**Patron:** The Traveller's Aid Society
**Description:** The Journal of the Traveller's Aid Society is one
of the most respected and widely–read publications in the
Imperium. Assembled from the reports of TAS members and
journalists, JTAS prides itself on being an indispensable guide

to known space. Lately, though, the editors have seen few
reports from this subsector, so they intend to hire a few amateur
stringers to fi le reports from the worlds they visit.
Reward: Cr. 5,000/article.
Complications:

1. JTAS has seen few reports from this subsector because of
an offi cial news blackout. The Imperial navy has discovered
something unusual and the x–boat network has been ordered
not to carry information out of the subsector.
2. A corporation approaches the characters, offering them a bribe
if they will report favorably on the corporation's increasingly
disastrous effort to terraform a border world. The corporation is
trying to attract settlers to the planet.
3. JTAS sends the characters a packet of tickets for bizarre
tourist attractions across the subsector; they need to review
attractions like the Sector's Largest Ball of Monofi lament Wire
or the birthplace of some long–forgotten grand duke, where the
duke's brain is kept in storage and rubbed for good luck.
4. A pirate band targets the characters, planning to force them
to write articles that will attract vulnerable passenger traffi c to
an out–of–the–way system.
5. The government of a world in this subsector took offence at
a JTAS article and has dispatched agents to assassinate any
JTAS journalists they fi nd.
6. A recent JTAS article fi led by another stringer contained
military secrets. The characters are suspected of having access
to secret information and shadowy fi gures start spying on them
to learn how they breached security. The only way they can
clear their name is by fi nding that other journalist.
23. Liner Crew
**Skills Required:** Steward, Mechanic, Diplomat
**Patron:** Cunard Starlines, LLC
**Description:** A massive starliner, the _Grand Spinward_ , docks
at the starport. She is one of the biggest and most luxurious
passenger liners in the whole Imperium. Several of her
stewards and other staff have fallen ill, so the characters have
an opportunity to work on board a prestigious starliner.
**Reward:** Cr. 2,500/month.
**Complications:**
1. A band of Ine Givar terrorists attacks the ship, holding the rich
passengers hostage.
2. The characters are assigned to serve one particularly
troublesome passenger, a rich twit named Witerote Bores. He
recently quarrelled with his manservant and is travelling alone
and has a habit of getting into amusing scrapes and confusing
situations.
3. One of the passengers is targeted by an assassin, who plans
to infi ltrate the stewards.
4. Captain Esmith of the _Grand Spinward_ is a tyrant who mistreats
his crew. Do the characters stand up to his unreasonable
demands?
5. The characters discover that the _Grand Spinward_ is about to
be scuttled for the insurance and that the engines have been

###### ODD JOBS

rigged to fail at a critical moment, sending the ship sailing into
the sun. There is no danger to the passengers, who can fl ee in
lifeboats – but if the characters hide about, they might be able
to steal the whole liner!

6. The _Grand Spinward_ misjumps and crashes on a jungle world.
The characters and passengers need to survive until rescued.
24. Bar Staff
**Skills Required:** Carouse, Steward, Streetwise
**Patron:** Dirk the Bartender
**Description:** Serve drinks. Clean up drinks.
**Reward:** Cr. 100/night.
**Complications:**
1. Vargr. _Drunk_ Vargr.
2. An old belter wanders into the bar and drunkenly tells the
characters about a 'ghost ship' that jumps into the system on
moonless nights. Well, not moonless nights, obviously. but only
rarely. Anyway, it is a _ghost ship._ Really it is. He will even tell the
characters where to fi nd it if they give him another drink.
3. A prissy health inspector threatens to close the bar down.
Actually cleaning the place is impossible – the dirt here is so old
it is of archaeological signifi cance – so the characters will need
to fi nd some other way of dealing with the problem.
4. ' _Make me a Lunion Sunburst'_ demands the drunken noble.
The bar computer has no record of such a cocktail. What do the
characters do?
5. A corporation offers the characters a bonus if they can sell
their new drink to the bar's clientele.
6. While in the bar, the characters overhear a shadowy patron
offer a job to a group of Travellers. Do the characters try to steal
someone else's plot hook?
    25. Undercover Agents
    **Skills Required:** Deception, Stealth, Investigate
    **Patron:** Undersecretary Molder, Imperial Ministry of Trade
    **Description:** The Imperial Ministry of Trade suspects that the
    starport has fallen under the infl uence of criminal gangs and
    smugglers. Worse, the offi cials assigned to the starport cannot
    be trusted and may be corrupt, so undersecretary Molder must
    work outside the normal guidelines. He hires the characters to
    spy on the starport and report back.
    **Reward:** Cr. 5,000 plus transport there and back.
    **Complications:**
    1. The starport is not corrupt – the whole planet is. The planetary
    government is being bribed by the criminal syndicates to permit
    the whole world to be used as a free port for illegal goods and
    pirate ships.
    2. The planetary economy has collapsed and it is only by dealing
    in illegal goods that the government can stave off collapse. If
    the characters report what they have found, they will doom the
    planet to chaos.
    3. The starport offi cials are indeed corrupt – and they have
    got their own spies in the Ministry of Trade. They know the
    characters are coming and will offer to cut a deal with them. Tell
    Molder that everything is fi ne and they will get paid.
    4. As above but why bother _paying_ the characters when they
    can be eliminated in a convenient accident.
    5. Molder is actually a former citizen of this world; he hates the
    planetary government and is trying to cause trouble by having
    the starport shut down.
    6. Nothing unusual is going on; someone is feeding false
    information back to Molder. Why?
    26. Patrons
    **Skills Required:** Carouse, Broker, Deception
    **Patron:** Any
    **Description:** Some days, it seems like every starport bar has
    a mysterious fi gure lurking in a corner, looking for a bunch of
    'ethically challenged merchants' or mercs for hire. This patron
    might be an eccentric noble, a corporate agent, another
    merchant, a spy, a revolutionary or a prophet, an alien or a
    madman. Anyway, even the mysterious fi gure in the corner
    needs to take a break sometimes and so the patron wants to
    delegate his mission to the Player Characters. They get to sit in
    the starport bar and offer jobs to other groups of adventurers.
    **Reward:** Cr. 5,000 if the Player Characters fi nd a suitable group
    of adventurers.
    **Complications:**
    1. The patron wants absolute discretion – the Player Characters
    must fi nd a way to test the loyalty of applicants.
    2. The mission requires considerable combat skills, so the
    applicants must prove themselves under fi re fi rst.
    3. The mission is technically illegal – the characters need to fi nd
    applicants who are willing to break the law.
    4. The applicants are extremely paranoid and mistrust everything
    the characters say.

###### OOODDDDDD J J JOBSOBSOBS

5. The applicants are a bizarre mismatched group of ex–military
offi cers, burned–out scouts and apparently insane aliens, all of
whom hate each other.
6. The patron vanishes – if the applicants complete the mission,
they will come looking for payment from the Player Characters.
31. Fren Herders
**Skills Required:** Animals (farming), Survival, Drive (hover)
**Patron:** Farmer Ezakhel
**Description:** Frens are a large animal similar to the [[Terra|Terran]]
bovine that are a vital part of the agricultural sector on many
worlds. Frens are hardy, disease–resistant, good–natured and
can eat a wide variety of plant matter. Also, they are delicious
with a little garlic butter. There are a few problems with fren,
though; they panic easily and when they panic, the fren either
stampede (if there are lots of fren in sight) or freeze up and fall
over (if they are alone). The farmer has a herd of some 10,000
fren that need to be moved to their winter feeding grounds. This
means he needs a lot of farmhands to zip around the range on
hoverbikes herding the fren south.
**Reward:** Cr. 200/week.
**Complications:**
1. Fren rustlers are stealing the animals using an armed zeppelin.
2. A local landowner objects to the fren herd crossing his land,
as he fears the voracious creatures will destroy his crops.
3. A damaged spacecraft plunges through the atmosphere over
the herd, causing a huge stampede.
4. A mutant psionic fren takes control of the herd. This mutant
fren is much more intelligent than the rest.
5. These fren are actually genetically engineered by a
corporation for faster growth. A rival corporation wants samples
of their DNA.
6. As above but 'faster growth' ends up meaning 'carnivorous
monsters'.
32. Ice Miners
**Skills Required:** Mechanic, Vacc Suit, Trade (miner)
**Patron:** Uthgard Mining Corporation
**Description:** On many worlds water is a rare and precious
commodity. Even a planet with a minimal Hydrographic score of 0
or 1 might have water locked in its ice caps or deep underground;
in other systems, the best source of water is in ice asteroids.
Either way, this ice must be mined, melted, purifi ed and used.
**Reward:** Cr. 500/week.
**Complications:**
1. The corporation has an extremely lax safety regimen. The
characters will be exposed to dangerous conditions.
2. The ice miners complain about poor conditions and low
pay and plan to go on strike. Do the characters support this
industrial action?
3. A pirate band plans to use the hollowed–out ice asteroid as a
base. Do the characters report these thieves to the authorities
or take a cut of the profi ts as hush money?
4. A moonquake causes one of the ice mines to collapse, trapping
the characters deep underground in freezing conditions.
    5. The characters discover an eccentric hermit, living in the ice
    caves. The hermit objects to his home being melted away from
    under him.
    6. There is something buried beneath the ice, such as an alien
    spaceship.
    33. Alien Hosts, Take Two
    **Skills Required:** Medic, Athletics (endurance), Life Science
    **Patron:** Telesma Research
    **Description:** The research corporation has discovered a
    fascinating new life–form, an alien parasite that thrives in living
    human fl esh. They need a few volunteers to be implanted with
    parasite embryos so they can study the creature's lifecycle.
    **Reward:** Cr. 5,000 once the study is complete.
    **Complications:**
    1. The erupting alien bugs leave distinctive scars.
    2. The alien bugs cause insanity and hallucinations.
    3. The corporation wants the alien bugs smuggled through
    Imperial cordons.
    4. The corporation vanishes before the bugs are removed;
    something about illegal experiments in genetically engineered
    killing machines. If the PCs report to the authorities, they will be
    arrested too.
    5. The bugs reproduce quickly. The PCs are walking plague
    vectors.
    6. The bugs are symbiotic, giving the characters enhanced
    abilities but also warping them over time.
    34. Spice Gatherers
    **Skills Required:** Recon, Survival, Mechanic
    **Patron:** Baron Vilad Horvath
    **Description:** Dust–spice is a mildly euphoric hallucinogen
    harvested from various desert plants and other sources, such as
    dry river–beds or worm tailings. It must be gathered by hand or
    using basic tools, as industrialised methods of gathering dust–
    spice invariably ruin the subtle fl avors and scents that make
    the spice so sought–after. Dust–spice can only be gathered for
    a short period each year, so thousands of migrant labourers
    travel to dust worlds to work the harvest.
    **Reward:** Cr. 1,000/week.
    **Complications:**
    1. The characters are contacted by a smuggler, who offers to
    buy any dust–spice they can steal.
    2. A desert sandstorm strikes the harvest fi eld. The workers are
    ordered to keep working, in the hopes of salvaging as much
    spice as possible before the winds ruin it. Do the characters
    step out into the teeth of the stinging winds?
    3. The baron's spice fi elds give a poor harvest this year, so he
    plans to invade his neighbor's territory.
    4. One of the characters develops a strange allergic reaction to
    dust–spice, turning the whites of his eyes turquoise.
    5. Some fearsome monster is lurking in the desert, a predator that
    feeds on dust–spice and the workers who are dusted with it.
    6. The characters hear a rumor that excessive dust–spice
    consumption gives psionic powers.

###### OODDDD J JOBSOBS

35. Weedkillers
**Skills Required:** Recon, Life Science, Athletics
**Patron:** Utabi Agricultural Products
**Description:** An alien weed has taken root on an agricultural
planet. The only chemical spray available that would destroy it
would also ruin the planet's fragile biosphere. The only solution
is to wipe out the infestation before it spreads too far beyond
the starport.
**Reward:** Cr. 250/day.
**Complications:**
1. The alien weed releases poisonous spores; not lethal but
they cause scarring and swelling.
2. The corporation was transporting the weed illegally; this
operation must be kept secret from the planetary authorities.
3. One of the native species becomes addicted to the weed;
removing the infestation will anger the creatures.
4. The weed is a deliberate attempt by the corporation to
destroy the planet's ecosphere; the characters are being hired
as cover.
5. The weed is a deliberate attempt by the corporation to sell
weedkiller spray; the characters are being set up to fail, so the
corporation can sell expensive chemicals to the government.
6. The weed is actually the fi rst stage in an invasion; it is a
genetically engineered form of the weed that produces a toxic
gas when mature.
36. Wasteland Scavengers
**Skills Required:** Recon, Gun Combat, Security
**Patron:** Jahanum Archaeological Society
**Description:** The characters are hired to visit a ruined planet.
Civilization collapsed here a century ago, wiped out in a

cataclysmic nuclear war. There are only a handful of survivors
in the bombed–out ruins of the cities. The whole planet is under
Imperial interdiction but the Jahanum Archaeological Society
want to recover artefacts and records that reveal the history of
the dying world. The characters will be smuggled past Imperial
lines, dropped in the wilderness and given a few weeks to
scavenge what they can before pick–up.
Reward: Cr. 5,000/week.
Complications:

1. Radiation levels on the planet are very high; HEV suits are
needed if the characters are to survive.
2. The planet is under interdiction not because of the dangerous
environment but because of a doomsday weapon left over from
war.
3. The war is still being fought; the two sides both have deeply buried
bunkers and armored warriors emerge from these underground
fortresses to fi ght for a few kilometers of scorched earth.
4. The JAS is specifi cally interested in recreating the events that
led up to the war, such as the recordings made inside the offi ce
of the President of the Union.
5. Fallout from the nuclear war has mutated the survivors into
crazed predators.
6. The JAS is a cover for Imperial intelligence; there is evidence
that the war was deliberately triggered by aliens and they want
to know who caused a once–peaceful world to descend into
nuclear war so easily.
41. Whale Herders
**Skills Required:** Seafaring (submarines), Animals (farming),
Survival
**Patron:** Third–son–of–second–daughter–of–fourth–son–of–
fi rst–daughter–of–wavebreaker
**Description:** The characters are hired by an uplifted dolphin
noble from a water world. He claims a huge section of the ocean
as his domain, where he farms the local megafauna (whale–
sized fi sh–like creatures). He needs some ranch–hands to do
some undersea work.
**Reward:** Cr. 300/week.
**Complications:**
1. The dolphin noble is something of an aberration on his world;
most of the other cetaceans have no interest in the Imperium and
do not want to see industrial fi sh farming on their waterworld.
2. The megafi sh are being harvested not just for their meat
but for their bones which contain valuable minerals. There are
legends of a 'megafi sh graveyard' somewhere in the depths.
Find that and you are rich for life.
3. The dolphin intends to sink an old starship in the middle of
his domain; the starship is still functional, merely outdated. It
can still serve as a ready–made airtight structure. Who wants to
volunteer to crash a 20,000–ton starship into the water?
4. A native race of primitive humanoids hunts the megafauna.
The noble's plan would rob them of their hunting grounds.
5. Someone is stealing megafi sh from the noble's domain. The
characters need to stop these rustlers and fi nd out how they're
abducting the giant creatures.
6. Megafi sh implies megasharks.

###### OOODDDDDD J J JOBSOBSOBS

42. Terraformers
**Skills Required:** Life Science, Physical Science, Remote
Operations
**Patron:** KSR Holdings
**Description:** The corporation is slowly terraforming a desert
world (C410313–A) to an Earth–like garden. This procedure will
take centuries and there is plenty of work to be done during the
intervening years.
**Reward:** Cr. 200/week.
**Complications:**
1. The characters are sent to survey the planet's surface,
searching for signs that the genetically modifi ed lichen has
taken hold.
2. The characters are sent to transport some ice asteroids from
the asteroid belt, to thicken the planet's trace atmosphere and
add to the water content.
3. The corporation erected a solar mirror in orbit to heat the
frigid world. Something has gone wrong with the mirror – it is
now fi ring blasts of intense heat at random points.
4. A group of environmental protestors are sabotaging the
terraforming effort, as they believe the planet should be left
alone in its natural state. Let humanity go elsewhere, instead of
turning the whole galaxy into a homogenous parade of cheap
Earth knockoffs!
5. The characters discover alien ruins on the planet's surface.
6. As above but the corporation knows about the ruins and is
trying to cover them up. They have invested too much in the
terraforming project to be stopped now!
43. Waste Storage Technicians
**Skills Required:** Remote Operations, Engineering (power
plant), Recon
**Patron:** Baron haut–Paad
**Description:** This minor world used fi ssion reactors for much of
its power during a long period of isolation. Now it is part of the
Imperium, with easy access to clean fusion power and cheap
space travel. Unfortunately, there is rather a lot of dangerous
nuclear waste stored in an artifi cial cave system deep
underground. The planetary government have decided that the
best approach is to hire experts to move the nuclear waste out
of the storage facility and into the sun.
**Reward:** Cr. 250/week.
**Complications:**
1. The maps of the storage facility are faulty; the characters
get lost in a lightless maze of tunnels fi lled with a lethal soup
of melted stone and nuclear waste... and they are not alone
down there.
2. The storage facility was never supposed to be opened.
There are automated defences down there designed to remove
trespassers.
3. haut–Paad is not a baron at all – he is a terrorist, who plans
to use the toxic waste to make a bomb.
4. Other things are buried down with the waste, such as sealed
government records.
    5. The toxic storage facility was badly situated and is vulnerable
    to earthquakes.
    6. The characters discover that the toxic waste has vanished.
    Where has it gone?
    44. Spider Farmers
    **Skills Required:** Animals (farming), Melee (blade), Life
    Science
    **Patron:** Tribe of the Tenth Moon
    **Description:** The spider–like creatures of this jungle moon
    produce a valuable silk in their webbing. Gathering the silk is a
    hazardous and unpleasant job but someone's got to do it.
    **Reward:** Cr. 50 per web harvested.
    **Complications:**
    1. The spiders are the size of large dogs and think of humans
    as dinner.
    2. The Tribe of the Tenth Moon is only one of the human tribes
    living in the jungle; the other tribes fear outsiders and will stalk
    and kill intruders in their jungle.
    3. A scientist is researching the spiders and will pay the
    characters 200 Credits per web; if they aid him, though, his
    research will end up depriving the tribes of their monopoly on
    spider silk.
    4. The characters come across the body of a scout, wrapped
    in webbing. His scout–ship might still be out there somewhere,
    buried beneath the jungle foliage for years.
    5. The Tribe of the Tenth Moon weave the spider–webs into
    beautiful iridescent clothing; the characters will get some very
    nice clothes as a bonus if they collect enough webs.
    6. The spiders are sentient; the webs are a communication
    network.
    45. Slime Vat Stirrers
    **Skills Required:** Athletics (endurance), Mechanic, Life
    Science
    **Patron:** GCX Chemicals
    **Description:** This covers any one of a thousand unpleasant
    industrial jobs.
    **Reward:** Cr. 150/week.
    **Complications:**
    1. The fumes from the slime vats give the character a
    persistent cough.
    2. The fumes from the slime vats give the character a
    persistent rash.
    3. While working in the slime vats, the characters overhear other
    workers talking about a local criminal group that is hiring.
    4. The corporation plans to import slime vat stirring robots from
    another planet. The workers plan to rise up and smash the
    machines. Do the characters help them hold back progress?
    5. Slime vat stirring is boring. Nothing happens.
    6. Nothing happens but the characters are assigned to the night
    shift so they are bored and tired.

###### OODDDD J JOBSOBS

46. Regolith Harvesters
**Skills Required:** Drive (tracked), Vacc Suit, Remote
Operations
**Patron:** Lunamines
**Description:** While hydrogen–fuelled fusion reactors are the
most common source of power in high–TL worlds, they are not
always the most effi cient. Helium–3 works even better and the
surface of moons like that of Terra is a good source of He3.
Harvesting the lunar regolith requires a fl eet of rovers that
scoop up the earth and extract the He3.
**Reward:** Cr. 100/day.
**Complications:**
1. There is little to do on lonely nights except drive across the
dusty plain and listen to the radio. The characters pick up a very
strange transmission...
2. A civil war breaks out on the planet below and the regular
lunar shuttle service is halted. The characters are trapped on a
barren moon with dwindling resources.
3. The characters run into a noble's private lunar villa and are
invited to dine with him.
4. The characters fi nd a deposit of valuable minerals; do they
inform their employers or try to develop the mine on their own?
5. A scout ship lands on the moon, looking for a crew.
6. Think of the moon as a very, very wide canvas and your rover
as a brush. What do you write on the face of the moon?
51. Safari Guards
**Skills Required:** Steward, Survival, Gun Combat
**Patron:** Marchesa Saddiv von Varren.
**Description:** The Marchesa and her favorite rocket launcher
are going on safari. She needs a few strapping servants to herd
the local wildlife into her crosshairs.
**Reward:** Cr. 300/week.
**Complications:**
1. The Marchesa likes _big_ animals. Saurians, for preference;
they look just _spiffi ng_ when mounted above the fi replace.
2. The safari draws unwelcome attention from the local
population, who object to some crazed offworld noble landing
with enough artillery to start a war.
3. A pirate targets the Marchesa's safari ship. On the downside,
the pirate ship completely outguns the little safari ship. On the
upside, as soon at the pirates open the airlock, it'll be pirate
hunting season for the Marchesa.
4. The Marchesa wants to bring the animals back alive. Work
out a way to get that monster onto the ship.
5. Another noble is also on safari to this world. His expedition
must be sabotaged!
6. The whole expedition is a cover for some other mission.
52. Psionic Research Subjects
**Skills Required:** Deception, Streetwise, Life Science
**Patron:** Psionics Institute
**Description:** An underground psionics institute secretly
contacts the characters. They need interesting minds for the
students to practice on. The tests will be quite harmless and the

characters' privacy will be absolutely respected.
Reward: Free psionic testing.
Complications:

1. One of the students is too eager with his telepathic scans
and accidentally probes too deeply, learning something that the
character would rather keep secret.
2. There is an accident and the character is teleported
somewhere unfortunate, like the inside of a bank vault.
3. A psion mystic predicts the character's future.
4. A desperate psion begs the characters to help him smuggle
psionic drugs to boost his powers.
5. While testing the character, the psions discover that his mind
has _already_ been touched by psionic powers. Someone erased
several months of his memories and replaced them with false
ones!
6. The psionics institute is raided by the authorities and the
characters are arrested and charged with aiding and abetting
illegal thought.
53. Tutors
**Skills Required:** Steward, Persuade, any Science
**Patron:** King Veremis
**Description:** The ruler of a primitive planet intends for his son,
Prince Veremar, to have the very best start in life. To that end,
he has hired the best tutors his little kingdom can afford to teach
the boy wisdom, honor and science!
**Reward:** The local–currency equivalent of Cr. 100/week; room
& board in a castle.
**Complications:**
1. Prince Veremar is a spoiled brat who wants to spend all his
time hunting, not learning.
2. The prince is regularly targeted by assassins; tutors are
expected to double as bodyguards.
3. King Veremis is a good–hearted ruler but woefully
incompetent. Viva la revolution!
4. The king intends for his son to oversee the modernization of
the kingdom. Can the characters lay the groundwork for a jump
from TL2 to TL8+ in a generation?
5. Prince Veremar dreams of seeing space and argues that he
would learn best if he got to see a few other planets before
settling down to rule.
6. Prince Veremar gets bored and throws his tutors into the
dungeon.
54. Government Informants
**Skills Required:** Investigate, Deception, Streetwise
**Patron:** A shadowy fi gure from the Ministry of Justice
**Description:** The characters are hired to infi ltrate a criminal
organization. Their mission is just to pass information back to
the authorities; they will be contacted covertly by an agent on
a regular basis.
**Reward:** Cr. 500/month.
**Complications:**
1. The criminal syndicate demands oaths of loyalty from
the characters. If the criminals fi nd out the characters are
government snitches, they will be punished horribly.

###### OOODDDDDD J J JOBSOBSOBS

2. The government demands more and more from the
characters, asking that they identify the highest ranking
members of the syndicate.
3. There is a gun battle between syndicate members and the
police, resulting in the characters getting pinned down in a
ruined building. If they reveal themselves as informants, they
can just walk out – but they will blow their cover completely. If
they stay where they are, they might be able to escape. What
do they do?
4. The syndicate suspects that someone is passing information
onto the government. How do the characters keep from being
discovered?
5. The government agent vanishes. Are the characters under
surveillance or have they been abandoned?
6. The characters discover that the syndicate is actually a plot
to overthrow the oppressive government regime. Who do they
support?
55. Prophets
**Skills Required:** Persuade, Deception, Engineer (electronics)
**Patron:** Taragun Vonter, Philanthropist
**Description:** Vonter is an eccentric researcher – or madman

- who intends to remake the culture of an entire world. His
target is a primitive, wartorn planet wracked by tribal confl icts.
His method is religion. He has developed a set of religious
teachings that promote peaceful trade and co–existence but he
needs salesmen to convince the tribesmen to adopt these new
ways. A few simple tricks like electric–light glows and grav belt
levitation should allow the Player Characters to masquerade as
divine prophets...
**Reward:** Cr. 1 per soul saved.
**Complications:**

1. There is an existing religion on the planet, a form of ancestor
worship. Anyone defying the word of the ancestors is a demon
and must be burnt at the stake.
2. One of the warring tribes agrees to convert to this new religion

- if the characters provide 'divine weapons' to blast their foes.

3. Two tribes are suffering from disease; one has already
converted, the other holds to the older religion. Which tribe do
the characters supply with advanced antibiotics?
4. The characters hear of a young convert to their new faith who
is demonstrating divine gifts. She is a naturally powerful psion
but she is preaching a strange version of their faith. How do
they co–opt this young woman without her discovering the truth
behind the religion?
5. Vonter is a psychohistorian, who is using this planet as a test
subject. Once his experiment is done, he will move on, leaving
the characters with a whole planet depending on them.
6. Vonter is a madman; he intends to set himself up as a god
once the religion is established.
56. Food Tasters
**Skills Required:** Steward, Medic, Life Sciences
**Patron:** Duke haut–Zilla

Description: haut–Zilla is a man with many enemies. He is
currently engaged in sweeping reforms of trade policy in the
sector and that has angered many powerful people, a lot of
whom have the money to hire assassins. In the last month,
he has been shot at, stabbed, bombed and poisoned, not to
mention the teleporting psionic assassins who interrupted his
breakfast this morning. He has bodyguards and other defences
but he is especially paranoid about poison. There are chemical
detectors and sniffers that detect most poisons but not all. The
only safe approach is for someone to taste his food fi rst...
Reward: Cr. 250/day plus funeral expenses.
Complications:

1. haut–Zilla is a glutton who delights in the richest foods. He
has even had his metabolism adjusted so he can cope with
eating a dozen meals a day. The characters do not have the
same augmentations...
2. The duke is insanely paranoid. There were one or two
real assassination attempts but the rest are fi gments of his
imagination.
3. The characters are contacted by enemies of the duke, offering
them a fortune if they help assassinate him.
4. One of the duke's meals is indeed poisoned with an alien
drug. The character who tastes it starts to have strange visions
of distant worlds. What does this have to do with the duke's
reform plans?
5. The duke is secretly addicted to anagathics. He wants one of
the characters to test his drugs before he uses them. Each vial
could bring death or extended life...
6. The duke delights in eating the most alarming and disgusting
things. He especially likes the eggs of a particular species of
slug.
61. Travelling Circus
**Skills Required:** Athletics, Art, Streetwise
**Patron:** The Fabulous Cagliostro
**Description:** Cagliostro's travelling circus wanders the fringe
worlds, bringing a little wonder, thrill and exotic delight to these
benighted planets. The circus has lost several performers
recently, so Cagliostro is willing to hire some untried travellers.
He can always use more freaks.
**Reward:** Cr. 150/performance.
**Complications:**
1. The psychic in the circus is a genuine one, who has potent
psionic powers.
2. The circus collects alien species; mostly harmless non–
sophonts but there is a bedraggled Aslan in a cage at the back
of the animal tent.
3. The circus is actually a front for smuggling.
4. Cagliostro is an alien spy, masquerading as a human.
5. Cagliostro vanishes, leaving the characters running the
circus.
6. If the characters have no performance skills, then Cagliostro
knows some excellent surgeons who can make freaks.

###### OODDDD J JOBSOBS

62. Holoshow Extra
**Skills Required:** Deception, Broker, Art (perform)
**Patron:** TLS Holotainment
**Description:** Many holoshows on border worlds are about
spacers and space travel. Space is exotic and exciting! Many
travellers can fi nd easy employment as a holoshow extra,
lurking in the background of a cantina or starport to make the
place look strange and alien.
**Reward:** Cr. 50/day plus lunch.
**Complications:**
1. The lead actor falls ill and one of the Player Characters looks
just like him. Congratulations, you have just been promoted.
2. The script for this holoadventure is riddled with factual errors.
Do the characters bother to correct it or do they just grit their
teeth and keep going?
3. The characters hear a rumor that the holoshow will be
shooting several episodes offworld. If they can make their
background extras into returning minor characters, they might
be able to get a free passage offworld.
4. There is an action scene – and the lead actor is shot dead.
Someone swapped the prop laser pistol for a real one. Who
wanted the hero dead?
5. A journalist offers the characters a bribe if they spoil the plot
of upcoming episodes.
6. The director quarrels with the writer and ends up throwing the
script out. 'You lot! You've been in space!' he shouts, 'write me
an adventure!'
63. Starship Spotter
**Skills Required:** Recon, Comms, Sensors
**Patron:** Ship Tracer Dirk Koggle
**Description:** Ship tracers are bounty hunters who search for
stolen ships. One of the simplest tools in their arsenal is the
starship spotter; an amateur with a telescope and a notebook
who records the movement of ships at the starport. Spotters
may also be employed by coast watcher pirates (see page 41).
**Reward:** Cr. 10 per ship.
**Complications:**
1. The character spots a stolen ship landing at the starport. The
ship tracer is not in the system and the thieves will be long gone
before he returns. How does the character ensure the stolen
ship does not escape?
2. One ship keeps a very odd schedule; it is not seen for months,
then visits the starport every other week, as if jumping back and
forth between two systems. What is going on?
3. An obsessive amateur ship spotter starts stalking the
character.
4. Coast watchers contact the character, offering to pay him to
report on freighter traffi c for them.
5. By cross–referencing schedules, the character works out the
route of a naval patrol. This information would be very valuable
to pirates...
6. The ship tracer is retiring and offers to take the characters on
as apprentices.
    64. Guide Correspondent
    **Skills Required:** Investigate, Art (writing), Streetwise
    **Patron:** Megadodo Publications
    **Description:** The character is hired by a publishing company
    to write reviews and tips for a budget traveller's guide. Almost
    anything can go into the guide, from restaurant reviews to
    extended rants about Vargr raiders.
    **Reward:** Cr. 0.01/word
    **Complications:**
    1. The last edition of the guide insulted a local noble; guide
    writers are now treated as criminals.
    2. The publishers are especially interested in extreme sports.
    Go jump off a cliff.
    3. A restaurant owner will do anything to ensure a good review,
    including kidnapping and murder.

# SSCAVENGERSCAVENGERS

The Imperium is thousands of years old and it was not the fi rst
civilization to settle this region of space. The present is built on
the ruins and remains of the past. On many worlds, there is more
metal locked in the wreckage of the past than there is left in the
ground; the crumbling works of the past must be scavenged and
salvaged to build the future. Scavengers – garbage collectors
and harvesters of scrap – are an often overlooked but vital part
of the Imperium.

Most scavenging is done on an industrial scale; an old city block
is bulldozed and the rubble sifted by machinery for usable scrap
metal. Many advanced planets, including Terra, went through
a resource crunch in the years between the development of
industry and the conquest of space, so reclamation technology
is quite a mature one. However, there is always salvage that
does not fi t neatly into the established reclamation industry and
it is this that attracts the scavenger.

Scavengers are scrap–metal merchants, tomb raiders,
garbage pickers and toshers, who sift through the material that
is too dangerous, too strange or too distant for conventional
reclamation to handle. Common scavenger targets are:

- Shipwrecks
- Deep–space hulks
- Ruined worlds
- Death zones

Shipwrecks
Normally, when a ship reaches the end of its long life, it is sold
to a wrecker who demolishes it for scrap. Most starships reach
the century mark before being retired and some are far, far
older. There are Free Traders plying the star lanes that were
built before the Third Imperium was founded and First Imperium
warships are still in ceremonial service on some core worlds.

If a ship cannot make it to the wrecker yards, it is scavenged
for parts. This commonly occurs when the ship breaks down in
a system without a wrecker yard. The dying ship cannot jump
but still contains valuable parts. The scavengers come in, strip
the ship and leave the hulk fl oating in space or grounded on
some convenient rock. Another common source of salvage for
wreckers is the aftermath of a crash or pirate attack.

**Shipwreck Salvage:** An intact ship can be sold to a wrecker
yard for 1/10th of its base price. A wrecked ship or a wrecked
ship's location can be sold to a scavenger for 1/20th of its base
price, although this should be modifi ed based on the condition of

the wreckage (saying ' yeah, the wreck is an expanding sphere
of debris centered on this point' is not worth much).

Shipwreck adventures: Hunting for shipwrecks can be an
adventure in itself. The scavenger characters will have to visit
isolated border planets and pirate systems to fi nd wrecked
ships for salvage.

Deep–space hulks
Deep–space hulks are old ships, vessels so old that they
have been drifting through space for hundreds of years. Some
are survivors of old battles where the crew was wiped out by
radiation or forced to abandon ship; others are the result of
misjumps, where the ship ended up jumping into empty space.
When a deep–space hulk is detected, the scavengers may
attempt to salvage it.

Not all hulks can be salvaged – a hulk fl ashing by a settled
system at a sizeable percentage of c is unreachable by any
conventional vessel. Other hulks are detected in deep space
by long–range telescopes and can be reached only by jumping
into deep space, with all the risks that entails.

Even if the hulk can be salvaged, it is a risky proposition.
By defi nition, a hulk is a ship where the entire crew died
under circumstances that left the ship unrecoverable. These
circumstances may never be discovered by the salvage team

- the strange case of the _Annic Nova_ is a classic example –
but they may also still pose a threat. If the crew were wiped
out by radiation from a faulty reactor, then switching back on
the reactor without checking the safety seals will be fatal for
the scavengers. Alien parasites, lethal viruses, automated
hunter–killer robots, malignant shipboard defence systems that
interpreted their own crew as threats, these and many other
potential dangers lurk on board hulks.

If the scavenger is able to recover the hulk, of course, the
rewards are worth it. In addition to the scrap value, some hulks
are invaluable archaeological fi nds. A 5,000–year old scout
ship from the dawn of the First Imperium might only be worth a
few thousand credits in scrap but it belongs in a museum. The
vacuum of space preserves what it takes.

Hulk Salvage: When sold for scrap, hulks sell for less than
modern designs (1/20th the base value or less) because it is more
diffi cult to salvage spare parts from old designs. However, the
value of a hulk may be greatly increased if it is of archaeological
signifi cance or can be repaired.

###### SSCAVENGERSCAVENGERS

**Hulk Adventures:** Hulks are basically dungeons in space.
Board the ruined ship and make your way cautiously through
the dark and empty corridors... when suddenly you see blips on
your motion detector! Roll for initiative.

Ruined worlds
Not all worlds survive. Some are destroyed by war or disease,
others are abandoned because of ecological or economic
collapse or the retreat of empire. Some planets have but a few
thousand inhabitants where billions once lived, leaving tens of
thousands of square kilometers of post–urban wasteland. Such
planets draw scavengers by the horde, picking through the
bones of civilization for a few scraps of worthwhile salvage.

Most ruined worlds have been stripped of the richest salvage
long ago; a scavenger might get lucky and fi nd a warehouse
full of imperishable goods but in general, ruined worlds are
the safe option for scavengers. There are few dangers and
equally few big payoffs but a few weeks scavenging can turn up
enough scrap metal, old electronics or other salvage to make
the expedition worthwhile.

**Ruined World Salvage:** The salvage available from a ruined
world is determined by making a Recon check. The diffi culty
of the Recon check varies depending on what the character is
looking for. If the Recon check is successful, the character fi nds
a number of tons of salvage equal to the Effect of the check+1.

**Ruined World Adventures:** In addition to threats like wild
animals, territorial natives and crumbling, unstable buildings,
the big threat on a ruined world comes from other scavengers.
Some scavenger gangs have been working on the same ruin
for years or even for _generations_ and do not take kindly to
intruders.

Death zones
Death zones are regions or even whole planets, rendered
uninhabitable. The normal cause for such a catastrophe is
biological warfare or a virus but nuclear attack or disaster,
intense solar activity or hostile creatures can also create a
death zone. Tragic as the existence of a death zone is, it is

also immensely profi table to scavengers. Death zones usually
happen with terrifi c suddenness, leaving the technology of the
zone intact. Scavengers – taking suitable protective measures

- can recover valuable items from the zone.

Death Zone Salvage: Death zones offer the same sort of
salvage as a ruined world but are much less likely to have been
picked clean.

Scavengers who enter a death zone without precautions

- vacc suits, weapons, intelligence on both the pre– and post–
apocalypse status of the zone, maps and a clear idea of what
they are looking for and where it is – will perish horribly. By
entering a death zone, the players are positively _asking_ the
Referee to put them through hell.

# GGAMBLINGAMBLING ANDAND C CONON G GAMESAMES

Gambling is a universal human vice. In any civilization, in any
culture, in any conditions, betting and games of chance are
a common pastime. Religions and governments have tried to
ban or restrict gambling but the sport just goes underground
for a time until it becomes legal again. Among regular space
travellers, gambling is even more common. After all, one has to
do _something_ to fi ll those long days in jump space.

There are three main types of gambling:

- **Games of Chance:** Gambling on the results of random
    processes; rolling dice, pachinko machines, fl ipping coins.
- **Games of Skill:** Gambling on the results of a game or
    contest where the abilities of the contestants play a role;
    poker and most card games.
- **Wagering:** Gambling on the results of a game or contest
    where the abilities of individuals or entities other than the
    contestants play a role; this includes betting on sporting
    events.

There are other sorts of gambling, such as lottery or bingo,
where the Gambling skill cannot help (other than telling the
character not to participate).

Making A Living From Gambling
A character with the Gambler skill can make a living from it,
although it is a risky one. To be a professional gambler, the
character needs a Gambler skill of at least 3. The character also
needs to seek out high–stakes gambling games where he can
earn enough to survive. Streetwise and criminal contacts may
be vital to the professional gambler.

In any month, a character may make a Gambler check to
earn money. This represents the character spending most of
his waking hours gambling, checking the odds, fi nding games
and moving money around and cannot be combined with other
activities or adventuring. The amount of money earned depends
on the Diffi culty of the check; the character chooses what level
of risk and reward he wants. If the check is failed, then the
character loses the listed amount of money.

Diffi culty Money Earned
Simple (+6) Effect x 25 Credits.
Easy (+4) Effect x 50 Credits
Routine (+2) Effect x 100 Credits.
Average (+0) Effect x 150 Credits
Diffi cult (–2) Effect x 200 Credits.
Very Diffi cult (–4) Effect x 500 Credits.
Formidable (–6) Effect x 2000 Credits

In addition, if the character rolls doubles, he may make another
check this month, representing an unexpected additional
tournament or a winning streak.

For example, Teldun the rogue attempts to earn a living through
gambling. He picks an Average diffi culty check and rolls,
succeeding with Effect 2. He has earned 2 x 150=300 Credits.
However, Teldun just rolled two 3s – doubles – letting him roll
again. Ambitiously, he picks a Diffi cult check this time and fails
with Effect 1. He loses 1 x 200=200 Credits, fi nishing the month
with 100 credits profi t.

Gambling in Play
The Gambler skill can be used in several ways:

- Earning a living, as described previously.
- Judging the odds in a game of chance. With a successful
    Gambler check, the character may roughly determine the
    odds, thus maximising his chances of profi t.
- Participating in a game of skill. In a casual game, the
    participants can just make Opposed Gambler checks but
    sometimes a more detailed resolution method is desired
    (say, for a critical poker game where the players just bet
    their ship). The following abstract gambling system may be
    used in such situations.

Determine Endurance: A character's Endurance measures
how long he can stay in the game; it is a combination of both the
character's assets and a measure of his nerve. Endurance is
determined by the referee but should be on a scale of 5 to 15 in
most games. A rich, confi dent player with the lion's share of the
chips would have Endurance 15; a nervous player on a losing
streak might have Endurance 5. In most games, everyone starts
at Endurance 8–10.

###### GGAMBLINGAMBLING & C & CONON G GAMESAMES

A character with no Endurance is eliminated from the table.

In each round of the game, follow these steps:

**1. Declare Risk:** The character with the lowest Endurance
    declares the starting risk for this round. Risk is measured
    in dice. Go around the table in order; each participant may
    either raise the risk by 1d6 or fold. Characters who fold roll
    the current Risk and subtract the total from their Endurance.
    Each character may only raise once.
**2. Choose Tactic:** A character may attempt one or none of the
following options:

- **Mislead:** The character makes a Persuade check. If his
    Persuade check effect is higher than the Gambler skill of all
    the participants, he gets a +2DM to his Gambler check this
    round. Otherwise, he suffers a –2DM to his check.
- **Cheat:** The character makes a Deception check. If his
    Deception check effect is higher than the Streetwise skill
    of all the participants, he gets a +4DM to his Gambler
    check. If he fails, he has been spotted cheating and may
    be ejected.
- **Use a Psionic Power:** Various psionic powers (Telepathy,
    Clairvoyance and Telekinesis) all lend themselves well to
    gambling. The character gains a +4 DM to his Gambler roll
    for each ability successfully used).
**3. Roll Gambler:** Each participant in the game rolls their
Gambler skill. The diffi culty of the check is determined by the
highest Gambler skill present.

Gambler Skill Diffi culty
0 Routine (+2)
1 Average (+0)
2 Average (+0)
3 Diffi cult (–2)
4 Diffi cult (–2)
5+ Very Diffi cult (–4)

**4. Determine Effects:**

- If a character succeeded, he rolls the risk and increases his
    Endurance by that amount.
- If a character failed, he rolls the risk and reduces his
    Endurance by that amount.
- If a character got the highest Effect of all the participants,
    he increases his Endurance by the maximum amount
    possible on the dice. If two or more characters tied for
    the highest Effect, they roll the dice instead of taking the
    maximum result.
- If a character got the lowest Effect of all the participants, he
    reduces his Endurance by the maximum amount possible on
    the dice. If two or more characters tied for the lowest Effect,
    they roll the dice instead of taking the maximum result.
       **5. Eliminate Players:** Any players reduced to 0 or less
       Endurance are removed from the game.

#### GAMBLING GAMES

There are thousands of different gambling games played across
the Imperium; every starport bar has a unique game being
played at some corner table. A character with the Gambler skill
can intuit the basic principles behind most of these games but
others are so bizarre that they must be explained before they
can be played successfully.

Games of Chance
Runestones: Common in the Sword Worlds of the Spinward
Marches, the runestones game is derived from a popular
divination method. The players throw small fl at or cubical stones,
each face of which is marked with a particular mystic rune. The
combination of runes shown determines who wins. Players take
it turns to pick up some of the runestones and throw them once
more to make new combinations, so there is a little skill in the
game. Superstitious pilots from the Sword Worlds believe that
toying with the mystic runestones is dangerous and unlucky.

Fusor: A gambling game based around a polyhedral crystal
with a radioactive isotope at its core. As the isotope decays,
it sends out an alpha particle every few seconds. This alpha
particle collides with one of the facets of the crystal, causing
that facet to fl uoresce. Gamblers bet on which facet will be the
next to fl ash.

Hiver's Chess: Technically, this is a game of skill from
Hiver space but the rules are so complex as to be utterly
incomprehensible to humans. Therefore, Hiver's chess is
normally played as a gambling game, with the players moving
pieces almost at random until one of them wins.

Games of Skill
Psi–Topple: Traditionally, psi–topple is played with a small
crystal tablet that is a psionic resonator. This tablet is especially
easy to move with telekinesis and even a latent psion with very
undeveloped powers can push the tablet. The two players put
the tablet between them and both try to push it over using the
power of their mind alone.

A common variant of this game replaces the tablet with a playing
card and puts the playing card on top of a bottle of alcohol
(typically, 'ol Janx' spirit). The loser takes a drink.

Zero–g Dicing: Dice games are games of pure chance, except
in zero gravity. It takes tremendous skill and dexterity to throw
a pair of dice so that they actually come to rest on a surface
instead of just bouncing around the cabin.

###### GGGAMBLINGAMBLINGAMBLING & C & C & CONONON G G GAMESAMESAMES

**Lunion Stud:** A variant on poker, Lunion Stud is played using
the standard spacer's deck (suits of Ships, Suns, Blades and
Coins, cards from Ace (or Low), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Knight,
Empress and Emperor).

Wagering
**Low Lottery:** The low lottery is a macabre tradition but still
practised on many worlds. On a passenger ship with low berths,
the captain donates 10 credits of the passage price for each
passenger to a pool. Each passenger, before they are placed
in suspended animation, guesses how many of the passengers
will survive the journey. If he guesses correctly, he gets the
pot. If no–one guesses correctly or the winner dies, the captain
takes the pot.

**Travel Speed:** Popular on worlds with regular space traffi c
between them, the participants bet on which ship will arrive back
fi rst. Rival shipping companies can become bitterly competitive
when bets are at stake, with captains ordered to do anything
they can to shave a few minutes off travel time in order to land
fi rst. The skill of the astrogator (to bring the ship back into
realspace close to the 100–diameter limit) and the randomness
of jump space are the deciding factors in these contests.

**Duels:** On worlds with suffi ciently advanced medical technology,
having a limb chopped off is a minor inconvenience. Duelling
with swords tends to enjoy a resurgence in popularity in such
cultures. Duellists become prized athletes and gamblers wager
on the outcome of a duel as they would on another sport.

#### CON GAMES

Regrettably, the nature of space travel makes certain cons
much easier to accomplish. Information is slow to propagate
from world to world and there are always more gullible marks
out there to be taken advantage of.

**Fixed Games:** This covers three–card monte and other crooked
gambling games, where it looks like the player has a good
chance of winning but the con artist has rigged the game to
make it impossible. Often, the con artist will have an accomplice
who 'wins' in order to make the game seem more plausible.

**The Cargo Scam:** This scam is aimed at tramp traders. The
con artist offers a load of cargo at an excellent price – say,
pharmaceuticals for Cr. 2,000/ton or uncommon raw materials
for Cr. 5,000/ton. Unfortunately, when the trade is complete,
the trader discovers that most of the cargo is made up of
substandard or entirely bogus items. That cargo of high–tech
electronics turns out to be mostly broken washing machine
parts and so forth.

**The Broker Scam:** Another scam aimed at tramp traders,
this trick requires two brokers and a tramp trader. The fi rst

broker on one world spreads a rumor that some moderately
unusual goods – usually pharmaceuticals or chemicals – are in
desperately short supply on a nearby planet. The trader hears
this rumor and decides to take advantage of it; the broker
sells him the goods at a nice ( but not excessive) mark–up and
promises that the tramp trader will be able to make a huge profi t
at the far end of the jump.

The trader jumps to the other planet, where he fi nds the goods
are not wanted there at all. The other broker offers to buy the
goods at a 'fair price' – less than the trader paid for it but a better
price than the trader will get anywhere else on this planet. The
brokers have made a profi t at both ends and can often ship the
same goods back again with another mark.

The Violin Scam: This scam is older than jump travel. Again,
it requires two con artists. The fi rst pretends to be a penniless
drifter with one prized possession, traditionally an old battered
violin. This pathetic wretch visits a café, bar, starport or even
takes passage on a ship. While there, he leaves his violin
behind him.

The second con artist then arrives and sees the violin. He
exclaims that it is an antique and he wishes to purchase it for
50,000 credits. If the mark agrees, the con artist leaves to get
the money. The fi rst con artist – the putative owner of the violin

- then returns to collect his property. He moans about money;
why, he would sell this violin for 5,000 credits if anyone would
buy it. The mark buys the violin for 5,000, expecting to be able

###### GGAMBLINGAMBLING & C & CONON G GAMESAMES

to resell it for 50,000 credits in a few minutes. The fi rst artist
leaves and neither is ever seen again by the mark. Profi t for the
con artists – 5,000 credits, minus the cost of a 50–credit violin.

**Salted Asteroids:** A variation on a classic, the con artist sells
the location of an asteroid containing valuable minerals to the
mark. He even brings a sample of the rock with him and the
sample is clearly rich in gold or some other valuable ore. The
mark buys the location, which turns out to be a worthless rock.

**Fraudulent Payment** : Another trick played on free traders,
this scam comes at the end of some large trade. The con artist
buys a valuable cargo off the trader but offers to pay in goods
rather than credits. 'I don't have the money but I do have 16
tons of rare emeralds – would that do?' The trader realises that
he will make a greater profi t by accepting these goods in lieu of
cash, only to discover later that he has been scammed and the
'emeralds' are worthless rocks.

**Snake Oil:** It is a big galaxy out there, full of wonders. Why, I
just this week got back from Zhodani space, where I bought
this psionic liniment from a wise psion there! It uses psionic
nanotechnology to remove your aches and pains! Guaranteed
to work within seven days! Buy now!

**The Duke of Magonia:** This scam takes advantage of the
deference people feel towards the nobility in the Imperium.
The con artist and his allies pretend to be a duke from some
distant planet. They barge into a medium–quality hotel and
demand rooms, fi ne food and other entertainments. If the hotel
staff quibble, one of the con men pretends to be a government
diplomat and explains that the eccentric duke is the Duke of
Magonia, an isolated and culturally backward world. Just give
the duke what he wants and all bills will be settled later – it

is incredibly rude in Magonian culture to ask for payment up
front. Above all, the duke must be kept happy, as the planetary
government is hoping to sign an important trade treaty with
Magonia in the next few weeks.

In a variant on this scam, the hotel is then contacted by another
con artist, posing as a law enforcement agent. He tells the
hotel staff that he is on the trail of a band of known con artists,
who are posing as the non–existent Duke of Magonia and his
retinue. He will shortly arrest the duke, as soon as his backup
arrives. In the mean time, keep the duke and his retinue from
leaving by giving them whatever they want – the government
will cover any expenses once the duke is arrested.

The Low Berth Corpse: Another scam targeting tramp traders.
In this scam, the trader is contacted by the retainer of a rich
noble who has fallen ill while on holiday. The noble has been
placed in a low berth to keep him alive while he is shipped
home. The trader accepts the low berth as cargo and transports
it to the noble's homeworld.

Once the trader arrives, he discovers that the noble is dead (he
was dead all along; a corpse was loaded into the low berth).
Among the noble's possessions is a set of documents, noting
that he has a bank account with vast savings. There are also
contact details for an agent used by the noble. The trader
contacts the agent, who proposes taking advantage of the
situation. He can act in the noble's name and get access to
that account using biometric data from the corpse. However, he
needs a few thousand credits to get the necessary paperwork
forged. The trader pays and the agent vanishes, never to be
seen again – until he turns up at the starport with another frozen
corpse, looking for another mark...

# LLOSTOST W WORLDSORLDS

_Or, where do the barbarians come from?_

The default _Traveller_ assumption is that humanity was scattered
across the stars, either by a period of expansion and exploration
from Earth or (as in the OTU), by the cryptic Ancients who
planted colonies of humans on other planets millennia ago.
Both of these origins can give rise to Lost Worlds, primitive
planets where technology is limited to a maximum of that of the
Middle Ages and where violence and barbarism are endemic.
Lost worlds can also be deliberately created and perpetuated
by corrupt regimes.

Ancient Worlds
These are barbarian worlds where humanity was seeded by
aliens millennia ago. For one reason or another, the human
colony has failed to advance in technology. Sometimes, this
is due to cultural regions, such as a hidebound religion that
deems any deviation from tradition to be heresy but more often
it is because of conditions on the world. A planet without fossil
fuels and iron will never have an industrial revolution; a planet
where the wildlife is hostile and dangerous may make mere
survival take up so much time that the humans never have a
chance to develop.

Ancient worlds of this sort have no advanced technology
whatsoever, unless the alien seeders left something behind.
Some ancient worlds are uninhabitable by humans but have
vast alien relic–machines to preserve a small biosphere for the
barbarians. It is possible to fi nd a TL1 culture living in an airless
or waterless world, supported by ancient machines.

Lost Colonies
Lost colonies were seeded by spacefaring humans but have
lost their technology since then. Perhaps the original colonists
were a handful of people on board a starship that misjumped;
unable to get home and lacking the ability to perpetuate their
technology, they survived as best they could. Other colonies
decline due to a lack of resources; a mining colony, for example,
might never develop an industrial base or education system
and be dependent on regular supplies from an industrial world.
When the supply ships stop coming, the mining colony slips fi rst
into anarchy and then into lower–technology barbarism.

Lost colonies may still have relics of their former technological
heights. Barbarian tribes stalk game through the vine–covered
canyons that were once city streets; statues of the gods wear
crudely depicted vacc suits and space helmets.

Worlds Of Perpetual Night
Some lost worlds want to stay lost. There are always
throwbacks and reactionaries in human cultures who believe
that technology is a negative infl uence, that each development
takes humans away from some idealised balance with nature.

Such movements may grow widespread enough to found their
own back–to–nature technology–free colonies.

Other lost worlds have governments that deliberately restrict
access to technology to keep the population in line. There are
barbarian worlds where the peasants till the fi elds with iron
ploughs but the kings survey their domains from grav–fl oater
castles.

Other Lost Worlds
Other worlds are lost because of unusual conditions. Extremely
strong solar fl ares, for example, might induce electric currents
in the atmosphere, making electronics unusable on the planet.
A planet with extremely fi ne dust would also pose problems for
most advanced technology, as microscopic dust particles get
into everything. On such planets, electronics and computing is
impossible, severely limiting technology.

Another form of lost world is the generation ship. If a culture
has not developed jump drives, then one way to cross the vast
gulf between the stars is to use a huge slow ship that takes
hundreds of years to reach its destination. It is the descendants
of the original crew who reach the destination. For a successful
generation ship, it is important to have a robust method of
teaching the next generation how to operate the vessel. If this
fails – say, because of damage to the ship's computer or an
accident that wipes out much of the crew – then the survivors
will rapidly lose their understanding of technology. A few
generations later, the result is a ship overgrown with hydroponic
jungle and crewed by sword–wielding barbarians.

Gaining Technological Familiarity
Familiarity is easily gained. A character may gain Familiarity with a few hours' practical experience or tuition.

Comfort takes longer to acquire. A character must spend several months or even years in a culture before he becomes Comfortable
with that culture's Technology Rank.

#### ADVENTURING ON LOST WORLDS

Lost worlds offer a unique form of _Traveller_ adventure. Take the
average crew of a Type S scout – on most worlds, they are just
average people. (Well, average wandering mercenaries with an
alarming amount of personal weapons). Their equipment and
skills may be above the norm but are not especially exceptional.

On a lost world, they are gods and wizards. They can kill by
pointing a 'wand' at an enemy; they call up spirits out of the air;
their armor is invulnerable and their medicines can heal any
disease; they ride a chariot of steel and fi re. The average crew
of a Type S can completely remake the culture of a lost world in
a matter of months if they put their minds to it.

Stranded Spacefarers
The characters have misjumped or their ship is damaged; either
way, they are stuck on a primitive planet. They may be forced
to wait for rescue or wait until their ship is repaired and may
need to acquire the necessary raw materials. A brave new world
awaits them.

The Referee should keep careful track of the characters'
resources. Ammunition is impossible to acquire, for example
and food may run out quickly, forcing the characters to learn
to survive in the wild. No doubt the arrival of the spacefarers
has attracted the attention of the locals – will the characters be
treated as gods or demons?

Traders From The Stars
In this variant, the characters can leave the lost world whenever
they wish. This calls into question why the lost world is lost

- are the characters the fi rst ones to discover it or is some
force keeping the world from advancing? What effect will the
characters' presence have on the world?

Lost worlds do not usually have a starport and so trading
opportunities will have to be developed by the characters. There
is vast opportunity for profi t in unequal situations like this one

- the characters can take advantage of the primitive natives,
exchanging glass beads and toasters for gold and silver.

Gods, Monsters & Heroes
Characters may wish to use their advanced technology to
deliberate effect change in the lost world. They could set
themselves up as kings or even as gods or they could overthrow
the existing regime and bring the people of the lost world to the
stars. Even introducing basic knowledge like the germ theory
of medicine or the use of steam power could revolutionise a
backward society.

Barbarian Adventurers
For a very different Traveller game, the Referee could begin
with a band of barbarian characters. This would play as a low–
magic swords–and–sorcery game initially, although the 'magic'
would either be advanced technology (' Curse the mage! He
has a wand of fi re! And look out for that golem!' ) or psionics.
Eventually, the characters should have the opportunity to fi nd
a starship or another way offworld, at which point they can
apply their unique barbarian perspective to the wider Traveller
universe ( 'I smite him with my broadsword in zero gravity!' ).

###### LOST WORLDS

Tech Level Familiarity (Optional Rule)
To simplify matters in most _Traveller_ games, it is assumed that all Player Characters can operate items from any technology
level, as long as they have the correct skills. A musketeer from a TL3 world and the Gun Combat (slug rifl es) skill can
operate a TL12 gauss rifl e with just as much skill as he would his TL3 antique rifl e. A character may have grown up on a
low–technology world but over the course of his travels he has picked up enough of an understanding to operate items
from a higher technological base. However, players may wish to play barbarian characters who have not been exposed to
advanced technologies; in which case, use the Tech Level Familiarity rules.

Technology levels are divided into several ranks:
**Primitive:** TL0 to 3
**Industrial:** TL4 to 6
**Pre–Stellar:** TL7 to 9
**Early Stellar:** TL10 to 11
**Average Stellar:** TL12–14
**High Stellar:** TL15–16
**Advanced Stellar:** TL17–20

In each group, a character may be Unfamiliar with that technology, he may be Familiar with it or he may be Comfortable with
it.

**Unfamiliar:** The character does not understand how to operate the technology. Parts of it may be familiar but others are
wholly incomprehensible. When attempting to operate a device from that technology level in a challenging or complex fashion,
he suffers a –3DM to his roll. For example, a barbarian has never seen a laser rifl e before. He therefore suffers a –3DM when
attempting to use it.

The Referee should use his best judgement when applying the penalty for Unfamiliarity. A character from a High Stellar world
can use a TL1 knife and fork to feed himself without penalty. However, he may have a problem fi ring a TL1 bow.

**Familiar:** The character knows how to use most items from that technology rank and may do so without penalty as long as he
has the requisite skills. He may not necessarily understand _how_ the item works but he is comfortable with using it and does
so without penalty.

Remember that familiarity does not trump skills. Two characters may both suffer a –3DM when using a rifl e; one because he
is Unfamiliar with that technology rank and the other because he does not have the Gun Combat skill.

**Comfortable:** The character can not only operate items of that technological rank but he understands the basic principles
behind them. He can apply his understanding to other items from that technology rank, even if he has not previously
encountered them. Note that training in any technical skill like Science, Engineer or Mechanic gives a character a much more
thorough understanding of the principles at all technology levels.

For example, three characters encounter a TL8 vacuum cleaner. None of them have ever seen exactly such a device before.
The barbarian from the Primitive world is Unfamiliar with the device and has no idea what to do. The spacefarer from the
High Stellar world is Familiar with the device – he can see there is an on–off switch and that one is supposed to hold this
tube but it does not seem to respond to verbal commands like any good appliance should. Finally, the average traveller from
a Pre–Stellar civilization is Comfortable with this rank of technology and intuits how to operate it. You have to plug it in and
operate it manually.
