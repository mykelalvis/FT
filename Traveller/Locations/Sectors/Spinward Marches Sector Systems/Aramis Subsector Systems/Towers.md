Towers was once the seat of government for the [[Towers Cluster]] for the few years before the area was absorbed into the [[Imperium]]. Towers is an [[amber zone]]; its customs include a definite sense of honor and a strict dueling code to right slights and insults. Offworlders are warned to be cautious in their interaction with locals. Even visitors are expected to abide by the local _code duello_.
