# 40<sup>th</sup> Squadron

The 40th Squadron is one of the best-organised Vargr bands in Gvurrdon. They are descended from a squadron of Vargr warships that survived the First Frontier War and established their own petty kingdom in the chaotic aftermath of the conflict. The 40th controls a loose alliance of a half- dozen systems. Individual planets have their own governments but the 40th Squadron's naval officers are the real power in the empire. The 40th lacks the resources to maintain its full fleet without external help; in the past, the Zhodani have propped them up to threaten the Imperium's flank.

# Alell

Originally settled by the descendants of hotel staff, Alell has become a rich and influential world despite its extremely dangerous native wildlife. The population is clustered into a small number of fortified cities, although modern technology makes it possible to live in more rural areas. Alell's primary industry is tourism; secondary exports include wood, furs, pharmaceuticals and other material harvested from the jungles that cover 30% of the planet's surface area. Alell has a Class B starport whose original structure dates back to the First Imperium and is considered an excellent example of fin-de-siecle Vilani design.

# Ancients

Colloquial name for a species of aliens that lived 300,000 years ago. Comparatively little is known about the Ancients. They are believed to be responsible for transplanting Humaniti from its original homeworld of Terra (see Solomani Hypothesis) and scattering the species across hundreds of planets. They are also believed to have uplifted the Vargr from [[Terra|Terran]] canines. The Ancients had an exceedingly high level of technology and many of their artefacts are millennia beyond even cutting-edge Imperial science. Estimates of high end Ancients technology place them beyond TL25.

Several Ancients sites have been discovered across Charted Space, especially in the Spinward Marches. Curiously, the technology at these sites varies considerably, suggesting different Ancients groups pursued radically different paths of development. Furthermore, most Ancients sites show signs of damage consistent with orbital bombardment or other violence; there are also anomalies in other systems that can be explained only by the use of weapons that destroyed entire planets. These facts, coupled with the sudden disappearance of the Ancients from known space, have given rise to Ancients Extinction Theories.

# Ancients Extinction Theories

The Ancient race vanished abruptly some 300,000 years ago. This sudden extinction is a mystery to archaeologists, who have developed several competing theories to explain it. Mainstream theories are divided along two axes – the Heterogenous/Homogenous axis and the Catastrophist/Gradual Decline axis.

The Homogenous Ancients school believes there was a single Ancients culture that expanded and then vanished; the Heterogenous school argues there were multiple competing cultures or a series of empires, or even multiple races that achieved high technology levels in the Ancients time period. The Homogenous theories explain the similarities between Ancients sites, commonalities in architecture, the use of Droyne as pets or servants and so forth. The Heterogenous theories seek to explain the wild variations in Ancients technology and architecture, the lack of any clear structure to Ancients territory and the sudden end of their civilization.

The Catastrophists hold that a single terrible event ended the Ancients hegemony. Various candidate apocalypses have been advanced; Homogenous Catastrophists point to disease, a hostile alien race or a strange accident that wiped out Ancients civilization. Heterogenous Catastrophists also suggest a civil war could explain the sudden disappearance. Gradual Declinists argue that a super-civilization would be more robust and that the Ancients must have slowly declined in vitality and viability over a period of millennia.

# Assumption of Custody

Under Regina law, the Public Order Commission has the power to detain suspects for up to a month without trial. Assumption of Custody is a process where multiple suspects of a crime are detained and questioned; these 'suspects' might just have been in the area of the crime, or match a profile, or even be randomly swept off the streets. Those Assumed into custody are innocent until proven guilty. Assumption is held to be a civic service and while a small stipend is available to those who are Assumed, it can still cause considerable inconvenience. Critics of the policy note that most citizens of Regina are never Assumed but certain groups – known criminals, transients, uneducated youths, Travellers – are regularly detained by the POC.

# Beck's World

Former pirate base. Beck's World is a volcanic wilderness with a minimal biosphere and few natural resources.

# Boughene

A scout base is established at Boughene, as part of the continued surveying operations coreward and spinward of the Imperium. There is little else in the system of interest to Travellers; the scout base is not open to visitors.

# Brotherhood of Humaniti

A quasi-religious group that arose following the confirmation of the Solomani Hypothesis that all Humaniti stems from a single source. The Brotherhood believes that all humans should come together as one species, united under a common government. As such, any government or institution that opposes such radical unity is an enemy of the species and must be destroyed. Since its inception, the Brotherhood has moved towards mysticism, attributing increasingly unlikely supernatural powers to 'true Humaniti', the ur-race that was destroyed when the Ancients divided Humaniti into different 'tribes'.

# Cadgeree

The cadgeree resembles a winged snake with a spiked tail. Cadgeree are extremely effective predators, who attack by hurling themselves down on prey from a great height, embedding their tail spikes deep into the target's flesh. The serpent then thrashes wildly, snapping the spine of its victim with ease. Cadgeree usually attack smaller creatures but have been known to attack humans when hungry.

# Church of the Chosen Ones

A Vargr religious sect who believes Vargr are the chosen heirs of the Ancients and therefore the rightful rulers of the galaxy. The Church was at its height some 200 years ago and today is more of a fringe cult.

# Credo

[[Capital]] city of Regina, with a population of 87 million. Located on the eastern edge of the continent of Noncredo. Credo prides itself on its cosmopolitanism – it has a high transient population, including many visitors from the Core worlds. Fashion and culture on Credo are heavily influenced by these visitors, leading to tension between Credo and more traditional cities on Regina. The city is sometimes called 'little Capital', a mocking reference to Credo's mimicry of Imperial high culture. Despite its cultural pretensions, the curious and strict legal system of Regina is still in effect here – laws must be voted on by the entire population and the justice system is as bureaucratic as it is enthusiastic, without being efficient at either. See Public Order Commission.

# Dandelion

See Llellewyoly.

# Dancado

Forested region north of Credo City; private property of the Duke of Regina.

# Efate

With its high Tech Level and population, Efate is almost as influential as Regina. It is a major crossroads for trade and Imperial naval operations – the 213th fleet is headquartered here. Visitors to Efate are cautioned that local customs and cultures are prone to change over short periods and that the pace of life here is uncomfortable to many. To quote the Efate tourist board:

> "live fast, die young, get resurrected by our advanced medical technology."

# Feri

Travellers are advised that a civil war is underway on Feri and the world has a provisional Amber classification. The starport is under Imperial protection but other regions are subject to unpredictable violence.

# Hos

"Staff"
Term used to denote an inferior or servant in Alell culture; derived from old Vilani dialect term
'hos'ai', servant or staff used in the catering industry.

# Kaldi Research

Kaldi is a private corporation with two main branches. The bulk of Kaldi's assets are employed in fixed installations that undertake research on contract for corporate bodies and planetary governments. A much smaller proportion of Kaldi's effort is placed into the operation of a number of laboratory ships that travel throughout the Marches and beyond, either hiring out their services to whomever needs a general research team or engaging in ongoing studies.

# Knorbes

Knorbes is an Imperial game reserve; hunting permits are available to citizens of excellent standing from the starport. Visitors are advised that Knorbes is a technologically restricted zone and permits are required to use any advanced technology outside the confines of the starport.

# Lagrangian Point

One of five points in a three-body orbital configuration where a small object affected only by gravity will be stationary relative to the two larger bodies. In the Assiniboia system with its multiple moons, there are several semi-stable points.

# Lambdragon

Large herbivore common to the Alell jungles. Lambdragons slowly graze through the forest, eating from the treetops. They have few natural predators, due to their size and the protection of the pack. The term 'lambdragon' was given to them because of their perceived gentleness but attacks by lambdragons are not impossible. The creatures have surprisingly sharp teeth for a herbivore (more accurately, they have two sets of teeth – an exterior set of flat teeth for feeding on leaves and a retractable set of sharper teeth used in defence and mating rituals) and a stampede of lambdragons can flatten a tank.

The creatures reproduce by depositing egg sacs in hollows in trees. The larval lambdragon feeds on the interior of the tree and 'hatches' when the weakened tree collapses. The passage of a large herd of lambdragons can cause sizable seismic tremors, causing trees to fall and thus bring new dragons into the herd.

# Llellewyoly

The Llellewyoly are a minor race native to Junidy in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches. They are nicknamed 'Dandelions' or 'Dandies', as they resemble a two-meter-tall version of a [[Terra|Terran]] plant, with five stalk-like limbs that are used for manipulation, movement and sensing. Llellewyoly are highly intelligent and have excellent memory recall and organizational skills, possibly as a result of their incredibly complex social structure. A Llellewyoly possesses dozens of formal titles simultaneously and addressing it by the wrong title is a grievous insult. They are rarely encountered outside their homeworld.

# Maleficent

Infamous and mysterious predators of the Alell jungles, maleficents are fast and brutal creatures. They are jet-black in colour, although markings can be seen under ultraviolet light. They travel through the trees by means of tentacles, snaking along the canopy in search of prey. Little is known about their biology but some scientists believe they are not originally native to Alell.

# Menorb

An unremarkable agricultural planet, known mainly for producing food for export to the Vargr market. Unfortunately, this has drawn more than its share of raiders, who snack on Menorb before moving on to more profitable targets.

# Oyntrip

A Droyne unit of social organization, ranging in size from a handful of individuals to the population of a whole planet. Roughly cognate to a 'clan' or 'nation'.

# Pixie

The Pixie system is home to a forward operating base of the 213th Fleet. Travellers are requested not to travel to this system without due cause. The only civilian port is home to a small community of belt miners.

# Public Order Commission

The local police force of Regina. The moon is Law Level 9, banning most personal weapons. Public Order Commission officers are also empowered to detain individuals or confiscate items that are judged to be 'disruptive or damaging to public order and safety'. In the past, this has been used to control technologies or restrict the movement of visitors to the moon. In practice, the POC is much more lenient in the most cosmopolitan cities; visitors to the less trafficked regions of Regina are advised to exercise caution.

# Regina

The capital of the Regina subsector and seat of the Duchy of Regina, this is one of the most important worlds in the Spinward Marches. It is a bulwark against Zhodani aggression and the largest trade hub in the sector. Vessels travelling along the Spinward Main from the Core worlds often offload their cargoes at Regina, leaving smaller local traders to carry the goods on to the lesser systems. Regina Highport sees more traffic in a day than some lesser systems see in a decade.

Technically, Regina is a moon, not a planet; it orbits the gas giant Assiniboia, which itself orbits the locus of the primary star Lusor and its companion star Speck. There is a third star in the system, a red dwarf on a long eccentric orbit.

# Regina Highport

This Class A starport is one of the largest ports in the entire sector. Over 80% of the cargo that passes through Regina is destined for other worlds in the sector, so most of the port is given over to cargo handling and warehousing. The port itself is located in geostationary orbit over Regina Downport and Startown, which is located halfway between the cities of Credo and Atora.

# Roup

Roup is a water world. The only stable 'land' consists of synthetic islands grown from webs of micro- organisms and seaweed. These huge rafts support vast cities, factories, farmland and even the starport. Roup's citizens practice aquaculture on a planetary scale, with whole oceans sectioned off using bubble-nets to maximise productivity.

# Rynkatropa

The Rynkatropa are a minor race of sophonts who resemble ambulatory sea slugs. They have three pseudopods that they use to manipulate objects and move on land, and communicate by whistling. They have four sexes (male, female, neuter and incubator) and had just reached TL1 when they were enslaved by the Vargr.

# Solomani Hypothesis

The theory that Humaniti originally evolved on the planet of Terra, the home of the Solomani. According to this theory, the Ancients transplanted primitive humans to other worlds in the galaxy, most notable the homeworlds of the Vilani and Zhodani. Genetic evidence has largely confirmed the Solomani Hypothesis, although some scientists and religious groups advocate other origins for Humaniti, such as parallel evolution or divine intervention.

# Startown

The region around the old Regina starport, now the primary downport. This strip of bars, cheap hostelries, raucous entertainments and less savory businesses is notoriously violent, corrupt and profitable. Technically, it is divided between the nearby cities of Credo and Atora; both blames the other for the state of Startown.

# Siu (Guest)

Term of respect used on Alell, derived from old Vilani dialect term 'Siu'ch', meaning guest or honored visitor.

# Tusal

Tusal is an illegal narcotic, usually sold in the form of tablets, although some prefer it in its less processed, undried form as a wad to be chewed. Tusal is derived from a seaweed. The origin of the drug is unknown but is believed to have been imported from the Vargr extents a century ago and is now grown on various worlds along the Corridor sector. A dose of tusal produces mild euphoria and intoxication; a very strong dose can dull pain receptors and cause unconsciousness. As a tusal user can remain functional while under the effects of a low dose, many addicts chew six or seven tablets per day to remain in a constant drugged haze. Tusal is especially associated with menial jobs and the unemployed, as an otherwise dull life of drudgery can be made pleasant by the drug. Long-term effects of tusal addiction include respiratory and digestive problems, and a high incidence of stomach cancer.

# Uakye

Uakye is tidally locked, so all settlements are in the habitable 'twilight zone'. The planet is closely associated with Efate but Countess Parasii strongly affirms her planet's independence from the technocracy one system over.

# University of Regina

Commonly used to refer to any of several prestigious academic institutions on Regina. Collectively, the University of Regina is the largest and most successful higher-level education and research facility in the Spinward Marches.

# Whisperhawk

One of the most common sights in the jungle, whisperhawks are beautiful avians with prodigious wingspans. The hawk's wings are both locomotion and feeding organs – whisperhawks feed by digesting the insects that are caught on the sticky underside of the wings. A flock of hawks can glide across the jungle canopy at twilight, catching hundreds of thousands of insects as they fly. The buzzing of the trapped insects and the susurrus of the wind gives the whisperhawk its name.

They are notoriously stupid creatures and have been known to attack humans and vehicles (as well as flagposts, fences, houses and even small trees). If threatened, whisperhawks attack by wrapping their wings around a larger foe and trying to smother it.

# Wochiers

The atmospheric pressure at sea level on Wochiers is more than four bars; the population therefore live in the mountains or in underground complexes. The high pressure makes Wochiers ideal for certain engineering projects, especially crystal growing. By tradition, all visitors to Wochiers must bring an offering of a living plant to the hydroponics caves; suitable plants are available in the starport gift shop.

# Yres

The only surface structure on Yres is the entrance to the starport, which is an extremely impressive system of airlocks and tubes reaching from the surface to the seabed. The cities of this balkanised world are all underground and underwater. Visitors face an additional docking fee of Cr250, which is an obligatory donation to the Yres Reconstruction and War Widows Fund. The atmosphere is highly radioactive; iodine tablets are available from public dispensers throughout the cities.
