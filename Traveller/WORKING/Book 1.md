### INTRODUCTION

Traveller deals with a common theme of science-fiction: the concept that an
expanding technology will enable us to reach the stars and to populate the worlds
which orbit them. The major problem, however, will be that communication, be it
political, diplomatic, commercial, or private, will be reduced to the level of the 18th
century, reduced to the speed of transportation. The result is a large (bordering on
the infinite) universe ripe for the adventurer's bold travels. Using this set of three
books, players can play single scenarios or entire adventuring campaigns set in any
science-fiction situation. These game rules are as complete as they could be and
provide for solitaire and unsupervised play. But the main thrust of the game is the
refereed or umpired situation. An independent referee allows a large degree of
flexibility and continuity often not possible when players themselves control the
game. A referee inserts some measure of uncertainty in the minds of the players as
they travel through the universe. Finally, the referee deals with new situations that
these rules may not cover; after all, no set of rules can totally define the universe
and how it works.

Traveller as player-characters. Typically,
a group will consist of two or more players and a referee. The group can easily be as
many as eight players, and some referees feel at ease with even more. Optimum
group size is based on what the referee can handle, and is probably between three
and ten players.

##### Playing The Game

There are three basic ways to play Traveller: solitaire, scenario, and campaign.

Any of these three may be unsupervised (that is, without a referee; the players
themselves administer the rules and manipulate the situation). Recommended
instead is the refereed game, where a separate player runs the situation and admin-isters the rules.
The Solitaire Game: One player undertakes some journey or adventure alone. He
or she handles the effects of the rules as the situation progresses. Solitaire is ideal
for players who are isolated by situation or geography.
In addition, there are many aspects ideally suited to solitaire consideration. A
single player can spend the time generating characters, designing starships, gener-ating worlds and subsectors, planning situations, and mapping out ideas to use in
later group adventures.
The Scenario: Several players embark on a journey or adventure together. The
scenario resembles a science-fiction novel, in that some basic goal or purpose is
stated, and the adventure occurs as the group strives to achieve the goal. Usually,
the scenario is a one-time affair and ends when the evening is over or the goal is
reached.
An example of a simple scenario might proceed like this: players generate
characters (Book 1) and then look for a patron (Book 3). When they find one,
he suggests an expedition to a world orbiting Sirius, a world reputed to be the
source of "diamonds as big as your fist."
In most cases, the scenario is intended to be a one-time affair, with the charac-ters and situation to be discarded at the adventure's end. Strangely enough, players
generally become attached to their characters and usually want to continue their
lives in further adventures. To this purpose, the campaign is designed.
The Campaign: Several players manipulate their characters in a series of contin-uing, linked adventures in a consistent universe. The referee is responsible for
generating the basic facts of the universe before play begins. As the campaign
unfolds. the players may range far and wide through the universe, perhaps beyond
the referee's original boundaries. In such cases, the campaign may be temporarily
halted as the referee expands the available data (or the referee may be forced to
work through the night getting ready for the next day's adventures). Where the
scenario is like a science-fiction novel, the campaign is like a continuing series.

##### Die Roll Conventions

Routinely in the course of Traveller, dice must be thrown to determine an
effectively random or unpredictable course .of action. These dice throws may
be made by players for their characters, or by the referee for the effects of nature,
non-players, or unseen forces. Rolls by the referee may be kept secret, or partially
concealed depending on their effects. In situations where the players would not
actually know the results of the roll, or would not know the exact roll made, the
referee would make the roll in secret.
Generally, a dice throw involves two dice; exceptions requiring one die or
three or more dice are clearly stated. The following terms and conventions for
dice throws apply to the game.
Saving Throw (also called Throw): That dice roll required to achieve a stated
effect. If only a number is stated, it must be rolled exactly. A number followed by

##### a plus (such as 8+) indicates that the number or greater must be rolled. Similarly,

##### a number followed by a minus (such as 6-1 indicates that that number or less must


be rolled. Throws can be identified because the sign follows the number.
Die Modifier (abbreviated DM): A number to be applied to a die roll before it is
used. Die modifiers are preceded by a sign which indicates whether the number is
to be added to or subtracted from the die roll. Thus +4 would be added to the die

##### roll while -2 would be subtracted.

#### The Referee

Crucial to the continuing campaign is the referee; he or she actually creates a
universe and then catalogs the creatures and societies which populate it. In order to
begin, the referee creates a star map of a subsector and generates the specific details
of the worlds within it. Initially, however, only clues (sometimes false or mis-leading) as to the nature of the universe are available to the players.
The referee may also indicate possible quests for characters through the use of
rumors, barroom conversations, and so-called general knowledge. For example,
a rumor may indicate the source of potential wealth or power; not-so-subtle clues
may exist which could lead to devices or techniques to save the world from cata-clysm. The possibilities are endless.
In any case, the referee can make or break a campaign, as it is his imagination
that the other players use as a springboard to adventure.
The referee is responsible for maintaining the master maps and charts of the
universe, and for determining the various effects of natural forces, chance, and
non-player characters on the adventurers. The referee must settle disputes about
the rules (and may use his own imagination while doing so, rather than strictly
adhering to the letter of the rules).

##### Getting Started


This book (Book 1) contains rules for generating individual characters, as well

##### as the overall personal combat rules and weapons types. It is the best place for

players to begin; all should generate a few characters to familiarize themselves with
the system, and then proceed to generate their player characters.

##### Book 2 contains details on starships. Players can travel on them using the basic

transportation rules, and may find it interesting to engage in trade and commerce
in order to make some money. Later, they will become involved in ship design and
construction.

##### Book 3 concerns the alien worlds and star systems that can be encountered in

the far reaches of the universe. The referee is concerned with that part as he or she
generates those worlds before the travellers arrive. Later, the players are concerned
with the same data as they explore and investigate the world they have travelled to.


## CHARACTERS


Characters are the central focus of Traveller; they are the alter-egos of the
players, and all activity is centered on them. Each character has abilities and charac-teristics which define his or her actions and reactions. The character is the Traveller
personality; the player is the person engaged in playing the game. Once a character
is generated, he or she continues to live and adventure until killed in action, or
until too old and decrepit to keep up.
All characters begin the game the same way: untrained, inexperienced, and
about 18 years of age.

##### Initial Character Generation


Characters are generated through a series of six two-dice rolls which determine
the basic characteristics affecting abilities

player should use the character as it is
created. The experience procedures and acquired skills table offer a genuine oppor-tunity to enhance values, given only time and luck. Should a player truly consider
the character so poor as to be beyond help, the low survival rate of the Scout
Service may make it the best career choice.
The Universal Personality Profile: Characters in Traveller are precisely defined
using the universal perspnality profile (the UPP), which expresses the basic charac-teristics in a specific sequence using hexadecimal (base 16) numbers. In hexa-

##### decimal notation, the digits 0 through 9 are represented by the common arabic

numbers: the digits 10 through 15 are represented by the letters A through F. The
highest single digit in base 16 notation is 15 (F). Characteristics are listed as a string
of six digits, in the order originally rolled: strength, dexterity, endurance, intelli-gence, education, and social standing.
For example, a character who is totally average in all respects would have a UPP

##### of 777777. If, instead, the individual were highly intelligent, his UPP would be



777B77 (the B in the fourth position indicates an intelligence of 11).

##### While the use of the UPP is optional, it allows the referee (and the players) to


tell at a glance the characteristics of
persons they encounter and deal with. NOBLE TITLES

Frank or Cindy, and everyone knows exactly who's who. This usage is convenient,
but tends to lose some of the flavor of the campaign.
Another school calls for the use of pseudonyms or fanciful names (for example:
Alexander Lascelles Jamison, or Timothy Fairweather; more extremely, Seeker
or Starkiller). As with everything in the game, the actual choice depends only on
imagination.
Titles: Any character with a social standing ofB (1 1 ) or greater may assume his
or her family's hereditary title. Noble titles are commonly used, even if the indi-vidual in not engaged in local government. At the discretion of the referee, a noble
may have some ancestral lands or fiefs, and may actually have some ruling power.
A knight (social standing B) is entitled to the use of Sir (or Dame) before his (or her) name. Social standing C entitles the individual to the title Baron or
Baroness. In lieu of this title, the individual may instead use the prefix von or haut
or hault (denoting baronial nobility) with his or her name.
Rank: Characters receiving commissions or promotions (as explained below)
may use their rank as part of their names, even after leaving the service or retiring.

##### Acquiring Skills And Expertise


A newly generated character is singularly unequipped to deal with the adven-turing universe, having neither the expertise nor the experience necessary for the
active life. In order to acquire some experience, it is possible to enlist in a service.
Enlistment: A character may choose one of the six services (Navy, Marines,
Army, Scouts, Merchants, and Other), and attempt to enlist. The prior service table
gives the service enlistment throw required to enlist. Successfully throwing the
number or higher on two dice allows enlistment. Most services allow die
modifications if the character has one or two stated characteristics of a certain level
or higher. If both stated characteristics are present in the required level, the die
modification is cumulative.
For example, the enlistment throw for the Navy is 8+; DM of +I is allowed for

##### intelligence of 8 or greater, and DM of +2 is allowed for education of 9 or greater.

##### Assuming a character with intelligence of 6 and education of 10 attempted to

enlist in the Navy, he would be allowed a DM of +2 (for his education). He rolls

##### a 3 on two dice, adds his DM of +2 to get a 5, which is insufficient to allow enlist-

ment in the Navy. He has been rejected.
Only one enlistment attempt is permitted per character. If rejected for enlist-ment, he must submit to the draft. Enlistment or draft is not allowed after age 18.
The Draft: Should an attempt at enlistment fail, the character must submit to
the draft. Each of the six services has a draft number; the draftee rolls one die, and


enters the service with that draft number. Note that it is possible for a character to
be drafted into the very service which had just previously rejected an enlistment.
Draftees are not eligible for commissions during their first term of service; they
do become eligible during the second and subsequent terms of service if they re-enlist.
Terms of Service: Upon enlistment (or upon being drafted), a character embarks
on a term of service lasting four years. This adds four years to the character's age.
Each time a character reenlists, it is for an additional four year term of service.
Survival: Each term of service involves some danger; during the term, a character
must successfully throw his service's survival number to avoid death in the line of
duty. Each service also has DMs which may apply. Failure to successfully achieve
the survival throw results in death; a new character must be generated.
-Optional Rule: If the referee or player so indicates prior to character gener-ation, then a failure of the survival roll can be converted to injury. The character is
not dead, but instead is injured, and leaves the service (after recovery) having served
only two years of the four year term.
Commissions and Promotions: Each service has a commission number; in order
to be commissioned as an officer, the character must throw the stated number. DMs
may apply to the throw. If the commission is achieved, the character receives rank
level 1 in his or her service. A character may attempt to acquire a commission once
per term of service until successful, with the exception that a draftee may not
attempt to acquire a commission in the first term of service.
In the same term of service that a commission is received and in each sub-sequent term of service, a character may attempt to be promoted. Each service
has a promotion number and DMs affecting that promotion throw. If a promotion
is achieved, the character advances to the next higher rank in the service. A charac-ter is eligible for one promotion per term of service.
Commissions and promotions are not available in the Scout Service or in the
Other Service.
Skills and Training: During each term of service, a character has the opportunity
to acquire personal skills and expertise.

allowed, using one die. There are four
tables, each containing different general types of skills. One of the tables is chosen
before the die is rolled, and the single die roll indicates the specific skill the charac-ter acquires.
Of the four acquired' skill tables, the first three may always be used by a charac-ter. The fourth is available only through advanced education, and may be used only

##### by characters with an education characteristic of 8 or greater.

During the character's first term of service, he or she becomes eligible for two
skills; during each additional term of service, the character becomes eligible for one
skill. Upon receiving a commission, he or she becomes eligible for one skill. Upon
being promoted, the character becomes eligible for one skill. Thus, a character who
joins the Navy, receives a commission, and then receives a promotion during the


initial term of service becomes eligible for four skills. The same character, in the
next term, is eligible for one skill if he or she does not receive another promotion.
Some skills automatically accrue to a character (without using eligibility) by
virtue of rank or service. These automatic skills are listed below the skills table.
The scout service is an exception to the normal eligibilities. Because the service
has no rank or promotion, scout characters do not become eligible for extra skills
during their careers. Instead, however, scouts receive two skills for each term of
service, including the first.
Reenlistment: Generally, a character is free to leave the service or to remain for
another term, depending on the individual's goals and desires. As always, the possi-bilities of war, peace, and other considerations loom ever-present over the charac-ter's career, and may force others to decide the course of the career. Each service
has a reenlistment number; in order to undertake a subsequent term of service, a
character must throw that number or greater (no DMs are allowed). If the throw is
not successful, reenlistment has been denied, and the person must leave the service.
If the throw is 12 (exactly), the needs of the service require that the character serve
another term, regardless of his or her personal desires. The reenlistment throw is
required during each term of service.
Retirement: A character may serve up to seven terms of service voluntarily, and
may leave after any term (provided mandatory reenlistment - a reenlistment throw
of 12 exactly - does not occur). A person may retire any time after the end of the
fifth term. Retirement grants the individual an annual retirement pay (in addition
to any mustering out benefits); rates of retirement pay are shown in the retirement
pay table.
Service beyond the seventh term is normally impossible, and retirement is
mandatory for an individual who has completed a seventh term of service. However,
persons who throw mandatory reenlistment must instead serve that additional
term of service. It is theoretically possible for an individual to be required to serve
ninth and even tenth terms under mandatory reenlistment.

##### Mustering Out


When a character leaves the service (for any reason), he or she is eligible for
mustering out benefits. The two muster-OUT ing out tables indicate the nature of these
Per term of service.......... .I benefits: one provides travel, education,
If rank 1 or 2............. .I and material benefits, while the other
If rank 3 or 4............. .2 provides cash severance pay. Each table is
If rank 5 or 6............. .3 matrixed by service and a single die roll.
When mustering out of the service, a
Allowed Die Modifications character is allowed to consult these

##### If rank 5 or 6: DM +I on skills table tables based on total terms of service and


Gambling: DM + level on cash table on final rank.
One benefit roll is allowed for each

##### term served. Additionally, a character who has received rank 1 or 2 receives one

##### extra roll. A character who has received rank 3 or 4 receives two extra rolls. A

##### character who has received rank 5 or 6 receives three extra rolls, and in addition

may apply a DM of +I to die rolls on the skills and benefits table. Any character
who has acquired gambling skill at level-I or higher may add +I to the die roll



on the cash table.
A character is free to choose between the skills and benefits table and the cash
table, but no one may consult the cash table more than three times during the
mustering out process.
For example, an uncommissioned character who has served four terms of service
is eligible for four mustering out benefits. She may roll a total of four times,
distributing the rolls as she desires between the two tables, provided only that she
may roll no more than three times on the cash table. The player must designate the
table being used before rolling the die.

##### Aging


Because each term of service is four years in length, a character can potentiallv
age twenty years or more before venturing into the adventure portion of the game.
This aging may even have a detrimental effect on a character's strength, dexterity,
endurance, and even intelligence.

##### When a character reaches 34 years of age (the end of the fourth term of service)


aging begins to take its toll. The aging table must be consulted then, and thereafter
at four year intervals. This table shows each of the characteristics affected, and the
throws necessary to avoid the effects of aging. If a specific throw is failed, then the
reduction indicated is applied to the characteristic.
In some situations, the use of drugs (to speed up or slow down body chemistry)
or low passage (suspended animation for low cost travel) will make the character
age faster or slower than a strict game calendar would indicate. It is therefore quite
important that each player maintain careful records on his or her character's
physical age.
Aging Crisis: If, as a result of aging, a characteristic is reduced to zero, the

##### character is considered to have had an aging crisis and become quite ill. A basic


saving throw of 8+ applies to avoid death (subject to a DM for the expertise of any
attending medical skill). If the character survives, recovery is made immediately (under slow drug, which speeds up the body chemistry). The character ages (one die
equals the number of months in added age under slow drug) immediately, but also
returns to play without delay. The characteristic which was reduced to zero auto-

##### matically becomes 1. This process occurs each time (and for each characteristic) a


characteristic is reduced to zero. In the event that slow drug is not available, the
individual is incapacitated for the number of months indicated if the basic throw of
8+ is successful.

The negative number is the potential reduction in characteristic if the saving throw (on two
dice; throw shown in parentheses) is not made. Term of service refers to the end of that num-bered term; age refers to the first day of the personal (physical, not chronological) year.


##### Non-Player Characters


Sometimes (often) player-characters will encounter people not actually manipu-lated by a player. They may be thugs or assailants; they may be potential hirelings
or patrons. In any case, their skills and abilities should be determined by the referee
using the character generation procedure.
For example, a starship captain may be looking for a crew for his ship. The
referee would generate characters until one occurs with the required skill (naviga-tion, medical, etc). Generally, the first appropriate character to be generated would
present himself or herself for employment, and if not accepted (or considered to be
unsuitable) a suitable delay would occur before another becomes available. As an
alternative, the referee may simply generate a character and assign the required skill
plus a few others for variety. Similarly, the characteristics of thugs and brigands
who are menacing player-characters, or of people presenting themselves for hire,
may be determined and recorded for use when necessary.
Loyalty and Dedication: In most cases, non-player characters will be dependable
and loyal (assuming the absence of bad treatment by their employers); the possi-bility exists, however, that a seemingly loyal non-player character has foul play at
heart. The referee should utilize the character reaction table (in Book 3) to deter-mine such potential, and note such possibilities as they exist. Continued loyalty of
non-player characters is ultimately dependent on the quality of treatment and level
of skill of their employing player-characters.
Character Generation: Most players new to Traveller spend some time in the
generation of various character types. It is recommended that the referee save
these characters for future use as non-player characters, hirelings, and other types.

##### CareerTypes


The six career types generated here are general careers assumed to exist in the
human societies within the galaxy. They can roughly be described as follows:
Navy: Members of the interstellar space navy which patrols space between the
stars. The navy has responsibility for the protection of society from lawless ele-ments in the interstellar trade channels, and from foreign powers.
Marines: Members of the armed fighting forces carried aboard starships. Marines
deal with piracy and boarding actions in space, defend the starports and bases
belonging to the navy, and supplement other ground forces such as the army.
Army: Members of the planetary armed fighting forces. Soldiers deal with

##### planetary surface actions, battles, and campaigns. Such individuals may also be

mercenaries for hire.
Scouts: Members of the exploratory service. Scouts explore new areas, map
and survey known or newly discovered areas, and maintain the communications
ships which carry information and messages between the worlds of the galaxy.
Merchants: Merchants of the commercial enterprises. Merchants may crew
the ships of the large trading corporations, or they may work for the independent
free traders which carry chance cargos and passengers between worlds.
Other: Characters who do not serve in one of the above areas instead follow
unproductive careers with a variety of experiences. The Other service covers some
trades, ne'er-do-wells, and the shady realm of the underworld. The exact nature of
the career of any specific character in the Other field must be deduced from the
skills and benefits received during character generation.

Some skills accrue to a character
automatically (without the necessity of
throwing for them, and without using
up eligibility). This table shows the
specific rank and service required for
each automatic skill; this table should
be consulted at the end of each term of
service. Each automatic skill may be
received only once.

##### Skills And Benefits

The skills and benefits which can be acquired during a term of service are of
greatly diverse types and values. They form an integral part of the player's charac-ter, assisting the referee (and the player) in calculating both general ability and the
specific probability of performing certain tasks.
There are a finite number of skills listed, and it is possible that one specific skill
may be acquired more than once; in such cases, the second acquisition increases the
character's expertise in that skill. Upon the first acquisition of a skill, the player
writes the skill name, followed by a dash and the number1 (thus: navigation-1).
The second time the skill is acquired, the number is increased to show greater ex-pertise (thus: navigation-2). Additional acquisitions of the same skill will increase
this skill level to 3,4, or higher.

##### Benefits are of three basic types: characteristic alterations (such as +I strength),

weapons expertise (such as blade combat), and basic skills (such as navigation).
Characteristic Alterations: Expressed as an addition (or subtraction) to a charac-ter's ability. In this category, alterations tend to affect strength, dexterity, or
endurance (although some services can affect other abilities as well). Characteristic
alterations are applied immediately, and require no further attention. An example
of a characteristic alteration is +I dexterity.
Weapon Expertise: Expressed as a general trait, such as brawling, blade combat,
or gunnery. When acquired, the character notes the area of expertise, and immed-iately selects the specific type of skill received. Thus, if the weapon skill received is
gun combat, the character must select which type of gun the expertise is in.
Gunnery and brawling do not require any selection because they have no sub-divisions.
All player-characters have an innate weapon expertise, in all weapons, of
zero. Acquisition of a weapon skill boosts this to level-I. Additional acquisi-tions of expertise in the same weapon increase the present level by one.

##### Brawling: Brawling is a general skill for hand-to-hand combat. It includes the

use of hands, clubs, and bottles as weapons.
Blade Combat: Blade combat is a specific skill in the use of blades and polearms.
The character may select one blade or polearm each time blade combat is received.
The blades and polearms table indicates the weapons available under this skill.
Selection of a specific blade or polearm should be a discriminating decision; the
table is intended to assist in that decision even for players still unfamiliar with the
Traveller combat system. Following each listed weapon are three columns. The
+DM column indicates the minimum required strength for the character if he or
she is to receive strength bonuses for using the weapon in combat. It is advan-tageous for a character to have skill in a weapon which provides such bonuses.
The - DM column shows the level of strength (or less) which calls for mandatory
strength penalties for using the weapon in combat; such penalties are to be avoided.
Finally, the wounds column indicates the degree of wounding ability which the
weapon has; it indicates relative power of the weapons.
A character may select one weapon each time that blade combat skill is re-ceived. In the event that a character receives blade combat three times, he might
choose, for example, cutlass-2 (taking cutlass twice) and dagger-1, or decide to
concentrate on one weapon, perhaps taking foil-3.
Note that one of the possible weapons is named blade. Players must be careful



to designate the weapon or weapons they have selected; otherwise, skill defaults
to the edged weapon named blade.
Blade combat is explained in the personal combat section later in Book 1.

Gun Combat: Gun combat is a specific skill in the use of firearms. The character
must immediately choose one firearm from the guns table; a different gun may be
selected each time that the skill is received. The table contains columns indicating
positive or negative DMs, but these are based on dexterity (not on strength).

##### Gun combat is explained in the personal combat section later in Book 1.


Gunnery: Gunnery is a skill in the use of weapons mounted on board spacecraft (beam and pulse lasers, sandcasters, and missile launchers). This skill entitles the

##### individual to the job title of gunner. Space combat is covered in Book 2.


Basic Skills: Expressed as a general ability, such as navigation or engineering.
Each skill is further defined below.

Administration: The individual has had When contact with officials is required,
experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understanding their needs and motives will

avoidance of police harrassment, insuring prompt issuance of licenses, approval of applications,
avoidance of close inspection of papers, etc). DM5 to be applied: no expertise, - 3: per level of
admin expertise, +2.
When serving in a bureaucratic organization, admin expertise allows competency in the eyes
of superiors. DMs to be applied: +1 per level of expertise. The exact throw to be determined by
the referee under the circumstances.
Referee: Admin expertise should also affect the quality of work and potential of success for
an organization which the character is controlling or managing.

AirIRaft: The individual has training and The airlraft is the major transportation
experience in the use and operation of the vehicle on most worlds with high enough tech
airlraft, floater, flier, and all types of grav levels. Most people are aware of the basics of
vehicles. operation for such vehicles. The airlraft can
be dangerous to operate in high speed situa-tions or in bad weather. A basic throw of 5+ to avoid an accident or mishap in bad weather,
chases, or high speed maneuvers should be used. DMs to be applied: per level of expertise, +l;
if weather is extremely bad, if the craft is old, or if gunfire is involved in the chase, - 1.
Referee: Generally, roll once for a short chase, twice or three times for longer flights.
Book 3 provides a more complete description of the airlraft.



ATV: The individual is acquainted with modern all terrain vehicles, and has been trained in, or has experience with, their operation. The term ATV (all terrain vehicle) includes AFV (armored fighting vehicle) within its meaning.
The ATV is used, in varying forms, on frontier and airless worlds. or in situations where weather, atmosphere, or players' intent preclude the use of air/rafts or aircraft.

ATVs are quite reliable (throw 11+ per day  for mechanical breakdowns), but are susceptible to off-road difficulties such as becoming bogged down in mud or sand, or trapped by jungle growth. Generally, driver expertise will serve as a DM (+I per level) to help avoid such difficulty.

Referee: ATV skill will also serve to allow increased speed and greater maneuverability. It
will also allow the individual to diagnose malfunctions within the vehicle, to help repair them,
and to perform preventive maintenance on the ATV.


Bribery: The individual has experience in Petty officials can generally be bribed to
bribing petty and notso-petty officials in ignore regulations or poor documentation,
order to circumvent regulations or ignore requiring a throw of the law level of the world
cumbersome laws. Bribery skill does not guar- in question or less (plus a cash offer) to
antee success, but does minimize bad effects do as asked. If the first offer is refused, a
if the offer is rebuffed. second roll may be made with the cash offer
doubled. The character offering the bribe
should first roll on the reaction table (Book 3) and should not offer to a negatively reacting
official. DMs to be applied: no expertise, +5; per level of expertise, -1 ; if the official reacts as a
strong friend on the reaction table (a roll of 12). -2.
Referee: Insure that both the cash offered and the act solicited are reasonable; if not, imple-ment appropriate DMs. Note that the roll for accepting a bribe varies inversely with the law
level of a world; the more stringent the laws, the greater the corruption. If a bribe is not accept-ed, roll 3- for the offer to be reported to higher authorities.

Computer: The individual is skilled in the Computers perform valuable functions in
programming and operation of electronic and human society, and individuals capable of
fibre optic computers, both ground and ship- using them find that their skill is equally
board models. valuable. Characters with computer expertise
may be hired (when needed) to operate and
program computers for organizations, ships, or other employers.
Computer programs (especially starship programs as mentioned in Book 2) may be written
by characters with expertise. The individual must have access to a computer which will handle
the intended program, knowledge of the skill being incorporated, and no other duties or re-sponsibilities during each week of work. Book 2 gives more details.
In spite of all good intentions, there is always the possibility that such a program will have a
fatal flaw, and will not function when actually used in space combat. Referee: Throw 7 exactly
for a fatal error to be written in. If there is none, throw 5- for a negative DM to appear on the
program when used; there is a half chance that the DM will be -1 or -2. These flaws will gener-ally remain hidden until the program is actually used.
Referee: When characters want to write computer programs, the general procedure shown in
Book 2 should be used, with modifications for the specific purpose.

Electronics: The individual has skill in the An advanced technological civilization
use, operation, and repair of electronic depends heavily on the use of electronic de-devices. The person is considered handy in vices. The need to use, repair, and replace
this field, with the equivalent of a green electronic devices is ubiquitous.
thumb talent. This skill includes the repair of Electronic expertise allows a character to
energy weapons. use and operate electronic items; generally
the skill is a DM applied to the throw to
understand, repair, assemble, or operate. Complex items would also require a certain level of
education or a very high intelligence; many devices may also require some degree of dexterity.
Referee: Specific throws for specific situations must be generated. Obviously, some throws
will be harder than others, and many will be impossible without an accumulation of DMs based
on expertise, education, dexterity, intelligence, and the availability of parts and tools.


Engineering: The individual is skilled in Engineering experience enables an indi-the operation and maintenance of starship vidual to operate the vital drives of starships
maneuver drives, jump drives, and power (and interplanetary craft) and to maintain
plants. the machinery against failure.
The engineer is essential for the proper
operation of any starships. Expertise qualifies the individual for such jobs, and can be used to
get working passage on a ship in need of help. Greater levels of expertise enable the individual
to handle problems of greater complexity and jobs with higher levels of responsibility.
Referee: Skill level is generally a DM applied to the throw to remedy an engineering
problem. In order to handle the relative value of experience, the DM may be assigned on the
basis of t2 per level of expertise.

Forgery: The individual has a skill at Documents necessary for cargo transfers,
faking documents and papers with a view to bank transactions, personal identification, and
deceiving officials, banks, patrons, or other many other purposes are often closely in-persons. spected by officials such as the police, cus-toms agents, or clerks when encounters
occur (such encounters happen when the law level for a world or less is thrown; generally once
or twice per day). The throw for detection of forged or fake documents is 6+; DMs to be
applied: -2 per level of expertise.
Referee: Forgery is a useful skill, but control is required to prevent blatant misuse (to
provide a bottomless checking account, for example). Note that administration and bribery
may also be used to determine whether documents are actually examined by the individuals
involved.

Forward Observer: The individual has Modern fire support can be a tremen-been trained (in military service) to call on dously effective weapon, when available, but
and adjust artillery (projectile, missile, and is virtually useless unless the technique of its
laser) fire from distant batteries and from application and adjustment is known. If
ships in orbit. artillery of any form (including communica-tion with the firing battery) is available, the
first shots fired will invariably miss the target. On each subsequent turn in which such fire is
delivered, a basic throw of 11+ to hit is required. DMs to be applied: +4 per level of expertise;
per turn of adjustment (two minute turns): +l; if adjusting person has no expertise: -4.

Gambling: The individual is well in- Organized games (as at casinos) allow bets
formed on games of chance, and wise in their of up to Cr5000, and require a throw of 9+ to
play. He or she has an advantage over non- win. Private games allow bets ranging from
experts, and is generally capable of winning Cr50 to Cr5000, and require a throw of 8+ to

however, should not be confused with general level, but the house will always win on a
risk-taking. throw of 2 exactly.
Games may be crooked (throw 10+ to be
dishonest) in which case the referee will stack the odds against the players. Gambling-3 or
better will usually detect crooked games (throw 7+ to detect).
Gambling-4 or better may be suspected of cheating and ejected (or worse) due to the
finesse of the skill involved (throw 9t to be suspected; DM -1 per level over 4). Characters may
elect to use a lower expertise level in some cases in order to avoid detection of true skill level.
Referee: Characters' die rolls should not be divulged when gambling; instead merely inform
the individual of wins and losses. This will serve to conceal any manipulation of the throws.

Gunnery: The basic skill of gunnery is Defensive and offensive weapons are
covered on page 13. The individual is trained mounted on a variety of interplanetary and
and competent in the operation of weapons interstellar vessels. Gunnery expertise quali-mounted on starships. fies an individual to operate such weaponry,
and to be hired on a ship's crew with the title
of gunner. Gunnery expertise provides DMs in space combat as covered in Book 2. Gunnery
may also be used for similar weapons mounted,on ATVs or airlrafts.



Jack of All Trades: The individual is The well-rounded individual (the renais-proven capable of handling a wide variety of sance man, so to speak) is uncommon in all
situations, and is resourceful in finding societies, but is naturally proficient when he
solutions and remedies. or she occurs.
This skill is a general ability which may be
applied to nearly any endeavor at the discretion of the referee. The jack of all trades can
attempt activity which is not normally possible due to the absence of skills or expertise. Un-skilled people have no idea how to even start many projects; jack of all trades can apply this
skill to such a project as if he or she has the skill. Jack of all trades can be considered to confer
skill level4 in every other skill (but never level-1).
For example: one of a group of adventurers arrives at an aging crisis (page 8) while on an
expedition into the wilds of a unsettled planet. No one has medical expertise. Jack of all
trades can be applied as a substitute for medical skill in this situation; the referee should assume
that the person has studied independently at some time or has seen such a crisis previously and
knows something of what to do. When using jack of all trades skill, the referee should also
consider appropriate personal characteristics (intelligence, education), availability of equipment (drugs, medical instruments), and other factors (weather, shelter, the specific situation).
Jack of all trades, however, is never sufficient for an individual to achieve standing in
another skill. Use of the skill in medical situations does not imply medic skill. Use of the skill to
pilot a ship in an emergency does not imply pilot skill.'


Leader: The individual has led troops in Leadership is a required ability to control
battle (or on adventures) and is possessed of a a group of more than six non-player hirelings
knowledge and self-assurance which will make or soldiers. Such a group will tend to obey the
for a capable emergent or appointed leader. general orders of the character with the
highest leader expertise. Reaction throws are
necessary when the leader and the group first meet. DMs may be applied: +1 per level of leader
expertise when consulting the reaction table (Book 3).
Leader3 or better is sufficient to allow soldiers to obey orders without hesitation.
Leader4 or better will allow a positive DM when recruiting soldiers or hirelings for
adventures. The throws for such hirelings, and DMs, depend on the situation.

Mechanical: The individual has skill in the Many of the devices of civilization are
use, operation, and repair of mechanical strictly mechanical in nature, and the need to

in this field, with a talent similar to that of a life. Mechanical expertise allows a character

the field of engineering; it does include non- easily, as well as to repair them quickly and
energy weapon repair. efficiently.
Any situation requiring a knowledge of
mechanical aspects of devices or equipment can be affected by mechanical skill.
Referee: Specific throws for specific situations must be generated. Obviously, the throw to
fabricate a new main drive bearing as a starship plunges into a flaming sun would be harder
than the throw to repair a broken air lock hatch while in port. Success in any mechanical
enterprise is also affected by such variables as tool availablity, personal strength and dexterity,
education, and situation.

Medical: The individual has training and Medical science is capable of great feats in
skill in the medical arts and sciences. preserving and maintaining the health and
welfare of individuals. The services of medi-cally trained individuals are in great demand. The levels of medical skill represent steps in
increasingly better ability and knowledge.
Medical-1 is sufficent to qualify a character for the position of medic on a starship crew. An
expertise of medic-2 or better allows a DM of +1 when reviving low passengers (each normally
throws 5+ to revive after a trip; otherwise the passenger dies.
Medical3 is sufficient for a character to be called doctor, and assumes a license to practice
medicine, including writing prescriptions, handling most ailments, and dealing with other
doctors on a professional level. A dexterity of 8+ is required for a doctor to also be a surgeon.


Xeno-Medicine: Normally, medical expertise is considered to apply to humans, and to a
limited extent to the animals which live on human worlds. Anyone with medical expertise can
apply that expertise (with a reduction of -2) to non-human aliens. For example, a human
doctor (medical-3) may find herself in a situation which calls for treatment of an alien, with
anatomy and physiology unfamiliar to her. She could provide treatment with the equivalent of
medical-1. Obvious encumbrances such as strange environment or unfamiliar chemistry should
also be considered by the referee.

Navigation: The individual has training Travel between worlds depends on the
and expertise in the art and science of inter- starships and their crews; the navigator is
planetary and interstellar navigation. relied upon to plot the course and to insure
that correct information is made available to
the pilot and crew as they need it. The navigatdr interprets the long-range data provided by the
ship's scanners and detectors.
Navigation expertise qualifies a character for the job position of navigator on a starship
or interplanetary vessel.
Referee: In general, navigation skill allows a character to perform in a starship crew position
which requires this type of skill. On exploratory missions, or when venturing into unexplored
territory, navigation skill may be used to assist in the speedy computation of courses, in the
accurate determination of courses, and in the determination of position when lost or strayed.
Navigation expertise can assist an individual in land or sea navigation as well. In any
situation where directions need to be known or location must be determined, navigation
expertise can be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed information.
The only requirement is that the night sky must be visible from the planetary surface.

Pilot: The individual has training and Interstellar travel depends on starships and
experience in the operation of starships and their crews; the single most important crew
large interplanetary ships. This skill encom- position is that of the pilot, responsible for
passes both the interplanetary and the inter- control of the starship's lift-offs, landings, and
stellar aspects of large ship operation. routine flight.
Pilot expertise qualifies a character for the
job of pilot on a starship or interplanetary vessel over 100 tons.
Referee: Pilot expertise is usable as a DM in handling of starships as they move from world
to world. Pilot expertise generally refers to interstellar ships; much of the ordinary operation,
however, is similar to that of interplanetary craft and pilot expertise also applies to large inter-planetary craft (100 tons and up). Small interplanetary craft (under 100 tons) handle somewhat
differently; pilot expertise minus 1 may be used as ship's boat expertise as applied to inter-planetary vessels under 100 tons; thus, an individual with pilot-3 could also operate a small
craft interplanetary vessel as if he or she had a skill of ship's boat-2. The reverse is not true.

Ship's Boat: The individual is familiar The small interplanetary craft carried as
with the function and operation of small auxiliaries or boats on larger ships, or serving
interplanetary craft collectively known as the needs of bases and stations, are distinctly
ship's boats. These craft range in size from different from the large vessels which ply the
five to 100 tons, and include shuttles, life- space lanes. Ship's boat expertise reflects a
boats, launches, ship's boats, and fighters. distinct experience and training in the oper-ation of these craft. Pilot expertise minus 1
can be used as the equivalent level of ship's boat expertise.
Referee: Ship's boat skill is used as a DM in handling throws to determine various oper-ations and their results. The following examples should illustrate this concept. Assume a hostile
attack on a pinnace (small craft) flown by a character with ship's boat-2..Throw 10+ for the
pinnace to escape on contact and avoid the attack; DM +2 based on the skill. Throw 8+ to avoid
being hit by enemy fire if the escape attempt fails; DM +2, again based on the skill. Alternate
these'throws until either escape succeeds of the craft is hit. If the pinnace is hit, throw 5+ for
it to be crippled and boarded; 4- for the craft to be destroyed; no DMs apply to this throw for
damage type.
Similarly, assuming bad weather (storms, wind, etc) at a planetary surface landing point,
throw 9+ to land safely; +2 per level of expertise above 1.



Steward: The individual is experienced The responsibility for the welfare of
and capable in the care and feeding of passen- passengers aboard a starship falls on the ship's
gers: the duties of the ship's steward. steward. Although anyone can be hired as a
ship's steward, this skill represents training in
the various duties necessary, and serves as an advantage when attempting to get such a job.
Referee: Steward skill represents a general awareness of cooking, personal care and atten-tion, and other areas of experience which will make passengers and crew happy and content
with their conditions of passage.


Streetwise: The individual is acquainted Close-knit subcultures (such as some
with the ways of local subcultures (which portions of the lower classes, trade groups
tend to be the same everywhere in human such as workers, and the underworld) gen-society), and thus is capable of dealing with erally reject contact with strangers or un-strangers without alienating them. This skill is known elements. Streetwise expertise allows
not the same as alien contact experience. contact for the purposes of obtaining infor-mation, hiring persons, purchasing or selling
contraband or stolen goods, and other shady or borderline activities.
Referee: After establishing throws for various activities desired by the characters (such as
the name of an official willing to issue licenses without hassle: 5+; the location of high quality
guns at low prices: 9+), allow streetwise as a DM on the throw. If no streetwise expertise is
used, impose a DM of - 5.


Tactics: The individual has training and When small units encounter hostile forces
experience in small unit tactics (up to and (in battle, by ambush, or while adventuring),
including units of 1000 troops or individual tactical skill can provide an advantage in
spaceships). This skill is not to be confused gaining victory or reducing the disaster of
with strategy, which deals with the reasons defeat.
for the encounter and the intended results of Referee: Because tactical skill is an in-the encounter; strategy is the realm of the tangible, the exact results in battle are left to
players, rather than the characters. the referee to implement as necessary or
prudent. It might influence the type and
amount of information available to the character in the miniature figure resolution of a battle
which uses hidden movement, or could be applied as a DM in crucial situations.
Tactical skill should be considered by the referee when the character is applying for em-ployment wh~ch might find such skill useful.

Vehicle: The individual is skilled in the The individual immediately selects one
operation, use, and maintenance of a specific vehicle from one of the following groups and
type vehicle commonly available in society. gains one level of skill in that specific type.
The groups available are: ground car, water-craft, winged craft (including helicopters), hovercraft, and grav belt. Individual vehicles within a
class may be found in Book 3, beginning on page 20. In the case of ground car, winged craft,
and watercraft, other similar vehicles may be operated by the individual at skill level minus 1 (the ground car class includes ATV). Vehicle skill is used for operation and as a DM against
accident, and may also be used for assistance in repairing and maintaining a vehicle.

Vacc Suit: The individual has been trained Non-breathable atmospheres or hostile

maneuver is attempted while wearing a vacc
suit (including running, jumping, hiding, jumping untethered from one ship to another, or
other such activity). Allow a DM of +4 per level of expertise. When such an incident occcurs, it
may be remedied by any character with vacc suit skill (including the character in danger) on a
throw of 7+; DMs: per level of expertise, +2; if no expertise, -4. Battle dress and combat armor
are special forms of armored vacc suit and require at least vacc suit-1 to wear at all.


##### Other Skills

The above list of skills is certainly not exhaustive. Additional skills may be en-countered.

##### Creating New Skills: The experience rules of Book^2 indicate methods by

which an individual can learn additional skills after he or she begins actively adven-turing. Those rules also cover the requirements for creating a new skill not other-

##### wise detailed in the Traveller rules. For example, if a new weapon is developed

(perhaps a laser pistol), a new skill would be required to enable its use.
Default Skills: Often, some characters will have no skills appropriate to a given
situation. A journey across a vacuum plain may be called for, and no one has vacc
suit skill. In such cases, the referee may indicate that all individuals not otherwise
skilled have vacc suit-0. A level of 0 for a skill indicates that the individual can
undertake ordinary activities, but is not experienced enough to try dangerous
activities or fancy actions. Level-0 indicates an orientation to the skill by an ex-perienced person; it should not be taken as a stepping stone to level-1. Skills appro-priate for level-0 are: airlraft, ATV, forward observer, steward, vacc suit, and
weapons.

##### Other Benefits

In addition to the skills acquired while actually in service, the following skills
and substantial rewards can be acquired through the mustering out procedures.
Retirement Pay: Any character who leaves the service at the end of the fifth or
later term of service is considered to have retired, and

##### receives retirement pay. This pension is paid at the PAY

##### beginning of each year, effective upon leaving the 5 terms Cr4000

service, and may be collected at any class A or B 6 terms Cr6000

##### starport. The table indicates the rate of pay, which is 7 terms Cr8000

##### dependent on the character's total terms of service. 8 terms Cr10.000

Service beyond the eighth term adds Cr2000 per

##### additional term. Retirement pay is not available to characters who have served in

the scout or the other service.
Travel Allowances: The mustering out procedure makes a variety of benefits
available which may generally be called travel allowances. Such allowances take
three basic forms: money, passages, and Travellers' Aid.
Money: Tlie cash table (page 14) indicates specific amounts of money which
become available. Some portion of the money should be considered severance pay
or life's savings; the remainder is a travel allowance.
Passages: The skills and benefits table (page 14) includes passages, or tickets, for
travel. They are acquired in blank, and represent one passage, or trip, between one
world and the next world visited by the starship. They are available in three forms:
high passage, middle passage, and low passage. Passages may be retained and used
as needed, or they may be cashed in at 90% of their face value.
High passage includes first class accomodations and excellent cuisine, and allows
up to one ton of baggage. High passage costs Cr10,OOO when purchased.

##### Middle passage includes second class accomodations (although still of reasonably

good quality) and passable food and drink, and allows up to 100 kilograms of
baggage. The passenger is expected to tend to his or her own affairs (maid service,
laundry, cleaning, etc) during the voyage. Middle passage costs Cr8000 when pur-



chased, and is subject to stand-by conditions; the ticket holder may be bumped if a
high passenger appears (the middle passage ticket being returned in such cases).
Low passage involves travel in cryogenic capsules (cold sleep, or suspended ani-mation), and the traveller is unconscious for the course of the journey. A character
does not age while in cold sleep. Because of the intrinsic dangers of this method of
travel, a basic throw of 5+ applies when the journey is over and the low passenger is
revived. Failure of the throw results in death; a DM of +1 is allowed if there is an

##### attending medic-2 or better, DM -1 if the low passenger has endurance of 6 or less.

Low passage costs CrlOOO if purchased, and includes a baggage allowance of 10
kilograms.
Travellers' Aid: The Travellers' Aid Society is a private organization which
maintains hostels and facilities at all class A and B starports in human space. Such
facilities are available (at reasonable cost) to members and their guests.
Travellers' Aid Society membership may be acquired upon mustering out while
using the skills and benefits table. Once this benefit is achieved, further receipt of
the benefit has no effect; membership may be achieved only once per character.
Receipt of membership in the Travellers' id' Society upon mustering out may be
construed as a reward for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society, rather
than an official benefit of the service.
Membership in the Society may also be purchased. Such purchase involves
avoidance of a "blackball" (throw 4+ to avoid), and (if accepted) payment of an
initiation fee of Cr1,000,000. Only one application per person is allowed. Member-

##### ship is for the life of a character, and is not transferrable. The Travellers' Aid

Society invests its membership fees and other income; it uses its capital and return
to provide benefits to its members. Every two months, it pays dividends in the form
of one high passage to each member. This passage may be used, retained, or sold.
Material Objects: The mustering out procedure makes two types of material ob-jects available: weapons and starships.
Weapons: The skills and benefits table indicates as results blade or gun; in such
cases, a character may choose any weapon in the category. If, while mustering out,

##### the same benefit is received again, the character has the option of taking another

example of the same weapon, selecting a different weapon, or taking the benefit as
+1 in skill in the weapon previously received. For example, the benefit blade
entitles the character to select any blade weapon, and he chooses cutlass. On the
next benefit roll, he again receives blade as a benefit. At this point, he could select a
different blade (perhaps foil), choose cutlass again (giving him two cutlasses), or
elect to take expertise in the weapon he has already received (giving an expertise of
cutlass-I ). Expertise may on1 y be taken in a weapon received as a benefit.
Starships: Two types of starships are available as mustering out benefits: type
A free traders and type S scout/couriers.

##### The type A free trader is a 200-ton cargo vessel equipped to handle both freight

and passengers. The ship and details on the financial circumstances noted below are
fully described in Book 2. Receipt of this ship as a benefit confers possession of the
ship, but also liability for the monthly payments (about Cr150,OOO) for the next
forty years. Fuel, crew, and other expenses must also be handled by the character.

##### If the ship benefit is received more than once, each additional receipt is considered

to represent actual possession of the ship for a ten-year period. The ship is thus ten
years older, and the total payment term is reduced by ten years. It is possible for a


character to own a ship, free and clear, by successively rolling the ship benefit five
times (once to obtain it, and four times to pay off the four 10-year sequences of
payment). The ship is also forty years old.
The type S scout/courier is a 100-ton dispatch vessel of a type very common
within human space and fully described in Book 2. It is the policy of the scout
service to make available such surplus scout ships to selected individuals on a
reserve basis. The vessels are (hopefully) put to good use while they are not re-quired in service, and both the ship and its pilot are available for recall to duty
when needed. Only one scout ship may be acquired by a character; further receipt
of this benefit results in no further effect. Possession of the scout ship is at the
pleasure of the scout service, and it cannot be sold by the character. The ship may
be used as desired. Fuel is free at scout bases. Maintenance is free at the scout
bases at class B starports. The character is responsible for both upkeep and crew
costs.
Characteristic Alterations: Finally, the skills and benefits tables makes provision
for some characteristic alterations. These tend to be increases in education or
intelligence, and are applied to the character immediately.

##### A Note On Gender And Race

Nowhere in these rules is a specific requirement established that any character (player or non-player) be of a specific gender or race. Any character is potentially
of any race and of either sex.

###### Formats

Characters may be referred to in a variety of ways. The simplest involves an
identification of the character's occupation or name, followed by the UPP (uni-versal personality profile). For example, Arlent Streen, businessman, 895678.

##### When more detail is needed, or to be more precise, the following format should

be used. It indicates rank and service, and can include name. The UPP, age, and
terms of service make it easy for the referee or the players to relate any prior career
to the present situation. The credit balance shows how much money the person has
available. The second line indicates the skills the person has, and (at the far right)
any personal possessions of import.

##### Character Generation Example


The following example is given to illustrate the process of character generation.
Actual die throws are shown in brackets, as are comments on the application of
game rules. Die modifications are labelled DM.

Alexander Lascelles Jamison. Having just finished school, Jamison sets out to
win his fortune in the universe. Taking stock of himself and his personal qualities
[generate all six personal characteristics; he rolls, consecutively, 6, 8, 8, 12, 8, 91
he soon decides that his UPP of 688C89 adapts him best for the merchant service.
He visits his local starport, checks out the situation [required roll of 7+ to enlist,
with a DM of +2 allowed for his intelligence of greater than 6; he rolls5 (+2=7)1,
and just barely manages to convince a merchant captain to let him sign on.
First Term: During his first term of service [survival roll required is 5+, with a
DM of +2 allowed for intelligence; he rolls 11 (+2=13)1 he faces no great dangers,
merely the humdrum of day-today events. His application for a commission [re-quired roll of 4+, DM of +I allowed for intelligence; he rolls 7(+1=8)1 is a mere

##### formality. As a 4th officer, he proves hard-working and efficient [promotion roll

required is lo+, with a DM of +1 for intelligence; he rolls 10 (+l=ll)l, and is
quickly promoted one rank. 3rd Officer Jamison clearly feels that he has found
his place in life, and decides that he would like to continue in service [reenlistment
roll of 4+ required, no DMs; he rolls 71 and reenlists. He has become eligible for
four skills during this term of service [two for the initial term, one for obtaining a
commission, and one for being promoted]. The work as 4th officer was, at times,
strenuous [Table 1, roll 1 = +1 strength] but he certainly developed his muscles.
While learning the details of his job and dealing with people [Table 1, roll 5= blade

##### combat] he learns to handle a dagger. Routine operations [Table 2, roll 2= vacc

suit] require that he learn to handle himself in a vacuum suit. Finally [Table 2, roll
5= electronics], he takes an elementary course in electronics.
Second Term: The rapidly maturing Jamison suddenly finds himself faced with
some of the dangers of the merchant service [survival throw required is 5+, with a

##### DM of +2 allowed for intelligence; he rolls 3, which is the lowest it is possible to

roll and still survive (+2=5)l, possibly a pirate raid. He does stay alive, however. His
continued efficiency [promotion throw of 10+ with a DM of +1 for intelligence; he
rolls 12 (+1=13)1 gains him his desired promotion to 2nd officer. He signs on for a
third term of service [reenlistment throw of 4+ required, no DMs; he throws 61 and
is accepted. He is eligible for two skills this term [one for service and one for his
promotion]. He goes on a physical fitness kick [Table 1, roll 3= +1 endurance]
and learns to better defend himself [Table 2, roll 4= gun combat] using the small
body pistol.
Third Term: Jamison's third term is rather uneventful [survival throw of 5+, DM
of +2 for intelligence; he rolls9 (+2=11)1. Unfortunately [promotion roll of 10+
required, DM +1 for intelligence; he rolls8 (+1=9)l, he fails the examination for
1st officer by two points, and does not receive a promotion. Determined to suc-ceed, he reenlists [reenlistment roll of 4+ required, no DMs; he rolls 101. He is
eligible for one skill [Table 2, roll 5= electronics] and studies an advanced course in
electronics to increase his knowledge.
Fourth Term: Things go right in the fourth term for Jamison. Facing little
danger [survival throw of 5+ required, DM +2 for intelligence allowed; he rolls 7



(+2=9)], he also passes his 1st officer exam [promotion throw of 10+ required, DM
+1 allowed for intelligence; he throws 12 (+1=13)] easily, receiving his promotion
and an automatic pilot-1 expertise. Reenlisting again, he begins a fifth term of
service [reenlistment roll of 4+ required, no DMs; he rolls 71. He is eligible for two
skills this term. He trains himself in the martial arts [Table 1, roll 5= blade combatl,
choosing the cutlass and [Table 2, roll 4= gun combatl the submachinegun. Finally,
this being the end of his fourth term, Jamison is (for the first time) susceptible to

##### aging [saving throws for strength (8+), dexterity (7+), and endurance (8+) are


made; he rolls 12, 7, and 9, resulting in no changes].
Fifth Term: Beginning his fifth four-yeqr hitch [survival roll of 5+ required, DM
+2 for intelligence; he rolls7 (+2=9)], he stands for promotion [promotion roll of
10+ required, DM +1 for intelligence; he rolls 10 (+1=11)] and makes captain. At
this point [reenlistment throw of 4+ required, no DMs allowed; he rolls 31, the
service falls on hard times, and notifies Jamison that it will no longer require his
services after the current term. He is eligible to retire (with a pension of Cr4000 per
year). His service entitles him to two final skills. He studies [Table 4, roll 5= pilot]
to improve his piloting skill, and [Table 3, roll 3= electronics] continues his interest

##### in electronics. Age also begins to take its toll [throw for strength (8+), dexterity


(7+), and endurance (8+); he rolls 9, 6, and 11, resulting in the reduction of his
dexterity by one point] with a slight decrease in his health.
Mustering Out: Having completed twenty years of active duty in the merchant
service, Captain Jamison is eligible for a variety of service benefits [five rolls on the
tables for terms served, plus two by virtue of his rank; in addition, he is allowed +1
on all rolls on the benefits table]. He receives [cash table, roll 4= Cr20,OOOl a

##### severance bonus of Cr20,000, [benefits table, roll5 (+1=6)= +1 education] an edu-


cational benefit, [benefits table, roll6 (+1=7)= merchant ship] possession of a
merchant ship, [benefits table, roll2 (+1=3)=middle passage] a travel allowance,
[benefits table, roll6 (+1=7)= merchant shipl credit for participation in the ship
acquisition program, [benefits table, roll6 (+1=7)= merchant ship] credit for

##### more participation in the ship acquisition program, [benefits table, roll6 (+1=7)=

merchant shipl and more credit for participation in the ship acquisition program.
Jamison has apparently been putting much of his salary and ship profits into a
continuing program dedicated to acquiring a ship; now he has one, and thirty
years of the forty year payment schedule have already been paid off.
Alexander Lascelles Jamison is now 38 years old, a retired merchant captain,
with a pension of Cr4000 per year, and a healthy cash balance. His single middle
passage, useless to him as a shipowner, has been converted to cash (Cr7.200).
Considering that the merchants forced him out of the service at the peak of his
career, he has some slight resentment against the merchant service.

##### actually undergoes the proper testing and training. Psionics is detailed in Book 3.


Corn bat


As adventurers journey through the cities and the wilds of the worlds they visit,
they will encounter both men and beasts. At times, the only way such encounters
can be dealt with is by force. To this end, the following combat system is provided.

###### Basic Combat Concept


This combat system is intended to cover situations where a party of adventurers (of one or more characters) encounters a party of people or beasts, and violence is
offered by either side. The actual circumstances of each encounter are governed by
the referee, in accordance with the encounter provisions of Book 3. Those rules
provide for the likelihood of encounters and for the basic reaction of the other
party to the encounter.
Combat is based on successive attacks by' each character involved (blows if
brawling, swings with blade weapons, and shots with
BASIC



8+

guns). A basic throw of 8+ is required in every case to
THROW obtain a hit; that throw is subject to die modifications
TO (DMs) for such considerations as range between the two
HIT parties, attacker and defender expertise in the weapons
they are using, the types of weapons used, surprise, and
other factors. If a hit is obtained, wounds are inflicted based on the type of weapon
which made the hit.

##### Each combat round lasts 15 seconds. Combat continues until one party is van-

quished, flees, dies, or surrenders.

##### Procedure


Once an encounter occurs, the following procedure is used to determine the
process of resolution of combat. Steps

table.
Only one party can achieve surprise, and it is possible that neither party will
achieve surprise. If no surprise is achieved, both parties are considered to be aware
of each other at the range of the encounter.

Escape and Avoidance: Encountering parties may attempt to avoid contact with,
or escape from, an encounter. A party which has achieved surprise may always
avoid an encounter by so stating. Non-player character parties which have surprise

Once contact or combat begins, a
party may leave the field of battle only through movement.

###### Movement


For movement, distances are measured in range bands, each representing approx-imately 25 meters. The range band table gives the size of each of the combat ranges
in range bands. For example, a character 4 range bands

##### RANGE BANDS away from another character is at long range with


Close, Short: 0 respect to the other character.

##### Medium: 1 to 2 In order to provide a simple display of ranges in an

##### Long: 3 to 10 encounter, it is suggested that they be mapped out on a

Very Long: 11 to 20 line grid (as shown in the diagram below). Ordinary
lined paper serves this purpose quite well. Each band
on the grid represents one range band. At the beginning of an encounter, markers
representing each of the members of the encountering party and those encountered
are placed in bands separated by a dist-ance corresponding to the encounter
distance. In subsequent rounds characters
may move to close or open the range.
Close and short range are each less
than a complete range band in size. To
indicate that two characters are at close
range, place their markers touching each
other. All other characters in the same
range band are at short range.
Characters may move one band per
combat round if walking or two if run-ning; animals may move faster, as covered

##### in Book 3.

The line grid is intended to provide a
simplified way of taking care of range
determination and sacrifices some realism
for the sake of play ease. The referee may
choose to expand this system to a square
or hexagonal grid to take maneuver and
actual position into account.


Before each combat round, each character must state his or her movement
status. The four possible movements statuses are evade, close range, open range, and
stand.
Evade: A combatant, at any range, may state evade as a status. The person may
not make any attack (no swings, blows, or shots are allowed) during the combat
round and may not use his weapon to parry or block (see expertise); he or she

##### receives an advantageous DM in the defense, based on range from the attacker (-1 if

##### at short or close range, -2 if at medium range, -4 if at long or very long range).


Close Range: A combatant may elect to move closer to the enemy during the
combat round. Normally, a character may walk, moving one range band per combat
round, or run (or ride animals or vehicles) at approximately double speed. Running
is considered an expenditure of energy and is counted as a combat blow (reducing
total endurance points and prohibiting the character from attacking that round).
See the endurance rule. Moving from short to close range is counted as moving one
range band.
Open Range: A combatant may move away from the enemy by opening range in
much the same manner as he would close range. However, he may move from close
range to one band away in one move without running.
Stand: A combatant may elect not to move during a combat round.
All movement is performed simultaneously. If parties consist of more than one
member, each member may decide for himself what his movement will be for the

##### round. Any character who moves more than 20 bands away from the nearest enemy


character is out of range and has escaped.

##### Combat Resolution


Combat is resolved in a series of attacks represented by dice throws made by the
combatants. A series of such throws, in which each participating individual capable

##### of making a combat throw makes one, is called a combat round. Combat rounds


continue until the battle is resolved by the defeat of one party through rout, death,
or surrender.
Basic Required Throw: During each combat round, each combatant selects a
member of the opposing party as a target. He or she must then make a basic throw

##### of 8+ to hit the target, and if successful, then determine the wounds inflicted.


The basic throw of 8t is subject to a variety of applicable die modifiers, inclu-ding armorlweapons relation, range, strength of attack (combat or weakened
blows), movement status, attacking and defending expertise, and other aspects. The
weapon matrix indicates weaponlarmor relation; the range matrix indicates range
effects; the weapon table indicates the effects of strength and dexterity, and of

##### weakened blows. Other DMS are called for by later sections of these rules.


All DMs to the basic throw to hit are cumulative, being added together and then
applied to the basic throw. It is important to remember that adding negative

##### numbers (DMs) is subtracting (3+1=4; 3+ -1=2; 3+ -1 =-4).

##### Roll two dice and modify by the DM created; if the modified result is 8 or

greater, the attack has achieved a hit on the target. If a hit is achieved, the wound

##### column on the range matrix must be consulted to determine the extent of the

wounding which has occurred.
Wounding and Death: The wound column indicates the amount of damage

##### which has been inflicted on the target if a hit is achieved, and is dependent on the



type of weapon used (not the strength of the character or of the blow). The abbre-viation used in the wound column is a capital D, meaning die or dice. The number
before the D indicates the number of dice to be thrown: thus 3D means that the
wound has inflicted hits equal to the throw of three dice.
Wound points are applied to the target's (defending character's) strength, dex-terity, and endurance on a temporary basis. Each die rolled (for example, each of
the two dice rolled in a result of 2D) is taken as a single wound or group of hits,
and must be applied to a single characteristic.
The first wound received by any character, however, can be sufficient to stun or
daze him or her, and is handled differently. This first wound is applied to one of
the three physical characteristics (strength, dexterity, or endurance) determined
randomly. As a result, first blood may immediately incapacitate or even kill.
When any one characteristic is reduced to zero by wounds, the character is
rendered unconscious. When two have been reduced to zero, the character has been
seriously wounded. When all three have been reduced to zero, the character is dead.
Once a characteristic has been reduced to zero, further points may not be applied
to it; they must be applied to other (non-zero) characteristics.
Unconscious characters (with at least one characteristic reduced to zero) recover
consciousness after ten minutes (40 combat rounds) with all characteristics tempo-rarily placed at a value half way between full strength and the wounded level.

##### For example, a character with a strength of 8 who is wounded to a strength of 4


(and rendered unconscious through the zeroing of another characteristic) becomes

##### strength 6 when he regains consciousness, and remains so until recovered. Round


fractions against the character. A return to full strength for the character requires
medical attention (a medical kit and an individual with at least medical-I skill), or
three days of rest.
Unconscious characters with two characteristics reduced to zero are considered
seriously wounded and recover consciousness after three hours. Their characteristics
remain at the wounded level (or 1, whichever is higher). Recovery is dependent on
medical attention (a medical facility and an individual with medical3 skill; re-cuperation to full strength without medical attention is not possible).

##### The Effects Of Characteristics


Personal characteristics can affect combat, being the source of die modifications
based on weapons and the duration of the battle.
Strength: The efficiency of various blows and swings (but not of shots) is
dependent on personal strength. The weapons table indicates both a required
strength level and an advantageous strength level for all blade and brawling

##### weapons. A character using a specific weapon who does not have strength equal

to or greater than the required strength level for that weapon is subject to the
negative DM (applied to the basic throw to hit) stated in the weapon table. For

##### example, a character with strength 5 does not meet the required strength of 7 for

##### the cutlass, and if using that weapon is subject to a DM of -2.

A character of great strength, equal to or greater than the advantageous strength
level stated for a specific weapon being used, is eligible for a positive DM (applied
to the basic throw to hit) given in the table. For example, a character with strength
11 or greater is allowed a DM of +2 when using the cutlass.
Dexterity: The accuracy of shots is dependent on the dexterity of the char-



acter firing the weapon. In a manner similar to the effect of strength on swings and
blows, the weapons table indicates the required and advantageous dexterity levels
for guns, and shows the positive and negative DMs which should be applied to the
basic throw to hit.
Endurance: The number of blows and swings which may be made, and their
inpact, is dependent on endurance. For this purpose, all blows and swings may be
classed into one of four classes: surprise, combat, weakened, and special.
Surprise blows and swings are completely unrestricted; as long as the attacking
character retains the element of surprise, he or she may make surprise blows and
swings without limit (but only one per combat round).
Combat blows and swings are the ordinary attacks made in the course of battle
after surprise is lost. A character may make a number of combat blows and swings

##### which does not exceed his endurance; a character with endurance 9 may make 9


combat blows. Once this allowance has been used up, the character may make no
more combat blows until he has rested for at least thirty minutes.
Weakened blows and swings are those attacks made after the combat blow and
swing allowance has been used up. Each weakened blow or swing is subject to the
negative DM indicated in the weapons table. Any number of weakened blows and
swings may be made. To conserve strength, a character may elect to make any blow
or swing weakened, and thus not have it counted against his endurance limit.
Special blows and swings are allowed in situations in which strength would not
normally be a factor, such as against an unconscious opponent. Special blows and
swings are not weakened, and may be made at any appropriate time without
affecting the endurance limit.
Note that a character is allowed only a specific number of swings and blows by
his endurance characteristic, and that only one blow or swing may be made per
combat round. The number of blows and swings is based on the individual's endur-ance at the beginning of the combat encounter; wounds suffered during the
encounter do not reduce the total possible swings and blows, but wounds suffered
prior to the encounter which reduce endurance will reduce the allowance according-ly. The total allowance for swings and blows applies to all such attacks, regardless
of whether the character shifts from brawling to blade combat or back. Gun com-bat is not affected by endurance.

###### Expertise

A character's expertise or skill in a weapon can affect personal combat in both
the attack and the defense.
Attacking: The level of expertise in a specific weapon is used as a positive DM on
the basic throw to hit. If the character changes the weapon being used, then the
expertise for the new weapon is used in combat.
Parrying: A character may use his expertise level in his brawling or blade weapon
weapon as a negative DM when engaged in brawling or blade combat (i.e. when
using a brawling or blade weapon against an enemy also using such a weapon). The
character is considered to be blocking or parrying his enemy's blow. Obviously,
only blows or swings may be blocked, not shots. A long gun such as a rifle or
carbine (but not a pistol) may be used to parry; if so, it is treated as a brawling
weapon (a cudgel). A weapon may be used both to attack and parry in the same
round.



Untrained Weapon Usage: Any character using a weapon in which he or she has
no training is subject to a penalty of -5 when attacking and +3 when definding. All
player-characters automatically have an expertise of zero (0) in all weapons shown
in this book. This zero value is sufficient to avoid the noexpertise penalty, but it is
not enough to provide a positive DM. Playercharacters selecting their weapons
should consider the potential benefits of their strength and dexterity level and any
DMs that might be available for those characteristics.

##### Weight


Characters are restricted in the total weight which they may carry, and may
suffer negative DMs if they carry enough weight to become encumbered.
Normal Load: Any character may carry a load equal to his or her strength
characteristics, in kilograms. A person with strength 12 could carry 12 kilograms.
Weapons and other materials are given weights in grams and kilograms. Load is
calculated by totalling the weight of all relevant items. Clothing, personal armor,
and minor items such as holsters, scabbards, and belts are not counted. Other items
such as tools, communicators, instruments, rations, and calculators are described in
Book 3, and their weight constitutes part of the total load.
Double Load: A character may carry up to twice his or her strength in kilo-

##### grams. Someone with strength 6 could carry 12 kilograms. Encumbered persons are

treated as if their strength, dexterity, and endurance are one less than normal. For
example, a character with a UPP 788953 carrying 12 kilograms of load would be
treated as 677953 until such time as at least 5 kilograms have been shed.
Triple Load: A character who is part of a military force (mercenary unit; combat
unit; troop unit) may carry up to triple his or her strength in kilograms, subject to a
reduction of 2 in strength, dexterity, and endurance.
Different Gravity: A world of size 8 is assumed to have normal gravity. Subtract
the size of the world on which the adventurers are from 8 and multiply the result
by 12.5%. This indicates the additional load that the character is capable of carry-ing, in kilograms.
For example, a world with size4 (8-4=4; 4x12.5%=50%) allows a character to
carry an additional 50% load without beng considered encumbered. A world with
size 10 (8-lo=-2; -2x12.5%=-25%) reduces the allowable load by 25%.

##### World sizes are explained in Book 3. World sizes also assume that the world has


normal (earth) density; different densities of worlds are possible through the use of

##### a density constantK (determined by the referee; mentioned in Book 2). When a

##### density constant K is in use, multiply the world size by K to determine the true

gravity factor, and use that in determining load sizes.

###### Morale

A party of adventurers which sustains casualties in an encounter will ultimately
break or rout if it does not achieve victory.
At the point in time when 20% of a party is unconscious or killed, the party

##### must begin making morale throws. For an average party, 7+ is the throw to stand,

or not break and run. Valiant parties may have a higher throw. DMs are allowed: +1

##### if the party is a military unit; +1 if a leader (leader skill) is present; +1 if the leader

has any tactical skill; -2 if the leader is killed (for two rounds at least, and until a
new leader takes control); -2 if casualties (unconscious and dead) exceed 50%.


###### Combat Equipment

The weapons and armor used by a ~haracter constitute his or her primary means
of achieving goals once logic and persuasion have failed. Weapons are also essential
for self-defense. These various weapons, weapon accessories, and armor are de-scribed below. Weights are given in grams; costs are given in credits (Cr). The
technological level at which the weapon is first produced is shown after the abbre-viation TL; tech levels are explained in Book 3.
Brawling Weapons: Brawling generally involves found weapons which are already
at the site of the battle. Brawling weapons are effective only at close and short
range. Such weapons are classified as clut)ls, cost nothing, and generally weigh from
500 grams to 3 kilograms (one die times 500 grams). Pistols may be used as clubs
when brawling. Bottles may be used as clubs (once, then they become dagger minus
1 ). Animals are equipped with their own weapons, generally specified in the en-counter tables of Book 3.
Blade Weapons: The following edged weapons cover the range of blades which
are available. Blade weapons are effective only at close and short range.
Dagger (250 grams; CrlO; TL 1): A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged
blade approximately 200mm in length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath,
and less frequently are concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the forearm.
Daggers are usually the last weapon of defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs
250 grams; that weight, however, does not count against the weight load of the
character as the weapon is worn constantly and comfortably.
Blade (350 grams; Cr50; TL 3): A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat
two-edged blade nearly 300mm in length, and a semi-basket handguard. Because of
the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried in a belt scabbard.
Foil (500 grams; Cr100; TL 3): Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light,
sword-like weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or
cup hilt to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the belt.
Cutlass (1250 grams; Cr100; TL 3): A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon

##### featuring a full basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the standard ship-


board blade weapon and usually kept in brackets on the bulkhead near important

##### locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length varies from 600 to

900mm.
Sword (1000 grams; Cr150; TL 1): The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a
flat, two-edged blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A
scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps (or a sash)
over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm.
Broadsword (2500 grams; Cr300; TL 2): The largest of the sword weapons, also

##### called the two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is

extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt is rela-tively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little basketwork or protection.
When carried, the boardsword is worn in a metal scabbard attached to the belt; less
frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the
shoulder.
Polearms: The following polearms are generally available. In most cases, they
will be in the hands of non-player characters encountered in the process of an
adventure. They are effective at close and short range.
Bayonet (250 grams; CrlO; TL 3): A knife-like weapon similar to a dagger or



blade. When not attached to a rifle, a bayonet is treated as a dagger (or blade),
carried in a belt scabbard, and requires dagger (or blade) skill for use to advantage.
When attached to the muzzle of a rifle (only, not carbine or auto rifle), it trans-forms the gun into a polearm, and increases the length of the arm by 200mm.
Spear (2000 grams; Crl 0; TL 0): A long (3000mm) polearm with a pointed tip,
usually of metal. Often made by the person who carries the weapon, the spear is
quite inexpensive.

##### Pike (3000 grams; Cr40; TL 1 ): A long (3000 to 4000mm) polearm with some

form of flat blade tip.
Halberd (2500 grams; Cr75; TL 2): a quite elaborate polearm featuring a point-ed, bladed tip. This weapon may be considered to be a combination between a
battle ax and a spear. Length: 2500mm.
Cudgel (1000 grams; CrlO; TL 0): A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily ob-tained from standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a
rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels). Length: 1000
to 2000mm.
Guns: The following guns are generally available (but note especially that the
law levels given in Book 3 may restrict the possession, use, or importation of some
or all of these guns). Pistols are effective at all but the longest ranges; other guns are
effective at all ranges.
Body Pistol (300 grams loaded; Cr 520; TL 7): A small, non-metallic semi-automatic pistol designed to evade detection by most weapon detectors. It fires 5

##### gram projectiles at a velocity of 500 to 600 meters per second. A magazine con-

taining six cartridges is inserted into the pistol handle; one cartridge is fired for each
pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines may be inserted into the pistol when it is
empty, taking one combat round to do so. Body pistol ammunition is not inter-changeable with the ammunition for any other types of guns.
Length: 100mm. Weight, unloaded: 250 grams (a loaded magazine weighs 50
grams). Base price: Cr500 (one loaded magazine: Cr20).
Automatic Pistol (1000 grams loaded; Cr210; TL 5): The basic repeating hand-gun, firing 9mm caliber bullets (each weighing approximately 10 grams) at velo-cities from 400 to 500 meters per second. A magazine containing 15 cartridges fits
into the handle of the pistol, and one cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger.

##### Automatic pistol ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition

(although magazines are not). Preloaded pistol magazines may be inserted into an
empty pistol, requiring one combat round for this reloading procedure to occur.
Length : 175mm. Weight, unloaded : 750 grams (loaded magazine weighs 250
grams). Base price: Cr200 (loaded magazine: CrlO).
Revolver (1 000 grams loaded; Cr155; TL 4): An older variety of handgun, the
revolver fires 9mm bullets with characteristics similar to those fired by the auto-matic pistol, but not interchangeable with them. No magazine is used: six cartridges
are inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat rounds, or
one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of evasion.
Length: 200mm (some versions may be shorter or longer). Weight, unloaded:
900 grams (weight of six cartridges: 100 grams). Base price: Cr150 (six cartridges
cost Cr5).
Carbine (3125 grams loaded; Cr210; TL 5): A short type of rifle firing a small
caliber round (a 6mm bullet, weighing 5 grams, at a velocity of 900 meters per


second). A magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into the underside of the
carbine, ahead of the trigger guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the
trigger. Replacement of empty magazines takes one combat round. Carbine ammu-nition is not interchangeable with any other type of ammunition.
In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A
sling usually allows the carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way.
Length: 750mm. Weight, unloaded: 3000 grams (loaded magazine weighs 125
grams). Base price: Cr200 (loaded magazine: CrlO).
Rifle (4500 grams loaded; Cr220; TL 5): The standard military arm, firing a
7mm, 10 gram bullet at a velocity of approximately 900 meters per second. Longer

##### and heavier than a carbine, it is also more effective. Standard equipment includes


provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder sling.
A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger guard, and one

##### round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of the empty magazine


takes one combat round. Rifle ammunition may also be used in automatic rifles;
rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable, and weigh the same.
Length: 1000mm. Weight, unloaded: 4000 grams (loaded magazine weighs 500
grams). Base price: Cr200 (loaded magazine: Cr20).
Automatic Rifle (5500 grams loaded; Cr1020; TL 6): A highly refined and tuned
version of the rifle, capable of full automatic fire as well as semi-automatic shots.
Normally, the automatic rifle fires in bursts of four bullets for each pull of the

##### trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the end of a combat round,

after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle until switched back. Ammunition
and magazines are identical to those used for the rifle.
The automatic rifle is equipped with a sling (which allows the weapon to be
slung from the shoulder while carried in the ready to fire position), a bipod, and a
muzzle brake to steady the gun while firing.
Some versions of the automatic rifle are available which use 100 round belts of
ammunition (not usable in rifles, however). Such belts cost the equivalent of six
loaded magazines and weigh 2500 grams. Reloading with a new belt requires three
combat rounds.
Length: 1000mm. Weight, unloaded: 5000 grams (loaded magazine: 500 grams).
Base price: Cr1000.
Shotgun (4500 grams loaded; Cr160; TL 5): The basic weapon for maximum
shock effect without regard to accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel
and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm
pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams. Velocity for the
projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical magazine containing 10
shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed auto-matically into the shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical
magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of the
trigger.
Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in diameter and
are quite clumsy to carry.
Shotguns are equipped with a sling for carrying.
Length: 1000mm. Weight, unloaded: 3750 grams (loaded magazine: 750 grams).
Base price: Cr150 (loaded magazine: Crl 0).
Submachinegun (3000 grams loaded; Cr520; TL 5): A small automatic weapon



designed to fire pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted
into the weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip, depending on the
design. The gun fires four rounds per pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty
magazine requires one combat round.
Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with auto-matic pistol ammunition.
Most submachineguns are equipped with slings to allow ease of carrying.
Laser Carbine (8000 grams, including power pack; Cr3500; TL 8): A lightweight
version of the laser rifle, firing high energy bolts using current from a backpack
batterylpower pack. The laser carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by
integrated optic sights. The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it
requires recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a high
energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by a heavy duty
cable.
Length: 800mm. Weight of carbine: 5000 grams. Weight of power pack: 3000
grams. Base price: Cr2500 (extra power pack: Cr1000). Cost of recharge, at com-mercial rates: Cr200.
Laser Rifle (10 kilograms, including power pack; Cr 5000; TL 9): The standard
high energy weapon, firing high energy bolts in the same manner as the laser car-bine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also capable of longer sustained action, and is some-what sturdiek. The power pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the
laser carbine, the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy duty cable.
Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however.
Length: 1000mm. Weight of rifle: 6000 grams. Weight of power pack: 4000
grams. Base price: Cr3500 (extra power packs: Cr1500). Cost of recharge, at
commercial rates: Cr300.
Accessories: The following special accessories are generally available for the
various weapons.
Telescopic Sights (800 grams; Cr200; TL 6): High-quality telescopic sights for
attachment to rifles and carbines, for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer
ranges. A rifle equipped with such sights has a DM of +4 to hit at long and very long.
ranges. Note that this DM is in addition to other allowed and required DMs.
Telescopic sights are delicate, however, and may be jarred out of alignment by
any violent action (such as being left untended in a moving truck, a close explosion,

##### or being dropped) on a throw of 7+. When the sights go out of adjustment, the

basic throw to hit should not be revealed to the firer, and he or she will always
miss.
Electronic Sights (1500 grams; Cr2000; TL 9): Electronic sights with image
enhancement and low-light capabilities are available to provide the capability to see
and hit in the dark. Electronics are treated like telescopic sights for damage and
reliability, and function.similarly.
Silencer (600 grams; Cr200; TL 6): Devices are available which will muffle or
eliminate the sound of guns firing, but so far they have proven practical only when

##### applied to body pistols, revolvers, and automatic pistols. A silencer attaches to the

muzzle of the pistol, increasing its total length, and making it impossible to holster
until the silencer is removed. Silencers are not interchangeable; one must be pur-chased for each specific model of pistol used.
Length: 100 to 300mm. Weight: 500 to 700 grams. Base price: Cr200.


##### Shoulder Stocks (1000 grams; Cr75; TL 5): It is possible to produce a shoulder


stock which may be attached temporarily to a pistol or revolver, resulting in a crude
carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranger. The overall length
of the pistol is increased by the length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be
holstered. Attaching the stock (or detaching it) requires five combat rounds.
Length: 350mm. Weight: 1000 grams. Base price: Cr75.
Folding Stocks (500 grams; Cr100; TL 6): Carbines, rifles, and shotguns can be
equipped with folding stocks which make it possible to reduce the overall length of
the weapon by 300mm.
Weight: adds 500 grams to the weapomweight. Base price: Cr100.
Armor and Protection: The following items of armor and personal protection
are generally available. The weight of personal armor and clothing is assumed to be
part of the character's clothing load and is not affected by the weight rule. Only
one form of personal armor may be worn, except that reflec may always be worn
under other clothing or armor.
Jack (Cr50; TL 1): A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering
the torso and upper arms and legs. Jack is somewhat better than ordinary clothing
or bare skin when defending against blades; it is worthless against guns.
Mesh (Cr150; TL 7): A, jacket or body suit made of natural or synthetic leather
and reinforced with a lining of flexible metal mesh, similar to chain mail but lighter
and stronger. Mesh reduces or stops penetration by blades and has some effective-ness against guns; it is ineffective against laser fire.

##### Cloth (Cr250; TL 6): A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The


fabric absorbs impact energy, distributing the blow over the body of the target and
possibly resulting in bruising. Nevertheless, cloth armor is almost the best and the
most versatile available.
Reflec (Cr1500; TL 10): Reflective material on a plastic base can be tailored
into a body suit which is ineffective against most weapons, but superior in defense
against laser fire. Unlike other forms of armor, reflec is worn under other clothing.
Reflec is expensive and often difficult to obtain.

##### Ablat (Cr75; TL 9): Ablat is a cheap alternative to reflec, and is fashioned from


a material which will ablate (vaporize) when hit by laser fire. The ablation of the
material carries away the energy of the laser, and protects the wearer. Continued
fire against ablat degrades its effectiveness, but the armor is cheap and easily
replaceable. Ablat also has some value against other forms of attack.

##### Vacc Suit (Cr10.000; TL 8): The personal vacuum or space suit is designed to


protect the individual from vacuum, tainted or noxious atmospheres, and some
radiation situations. It carries its own communicators, oxygen tanks for six hours,
and other basic survival appurtenances. Use of a vacc suit requires vacc suit-0
or better. It acts as cloth armor when subject to attacks. Vacc suits are relatively
bulky, and weigh 10 kilograms; the weight counts against personal weight allow-

##### ances. This weight is reduced 2 kilograms per tech level as the suit gains increasing

##### sophistication. For example, a TL 10 vacc suit weighs 6 kilograms, and a vacc suit

at tech level 13+ adds no apparent weight.
Combat Armor (Cr20000; TL 11 1: Combat armor is a complete vacc-suit-like
array of metal and synthetic armor. Combat armor is strictly military and not
available on the open market; it is issued to troop units and elite mercenary battal-ions. Before combat armor can be wocn, the user must have vacc suit skill-I or



better.
Battle Dress (Cr200.000; TL 13): The ultimate in individual protection, battle
dress is an advanced and powered version of combat armor. Battle dress enhances
the strength and senses of individuals wearing it with variable feedback personal
controls, servopowered limbs, and various kinds of electronic assistance. The
individual wearing battle dress is effectively doubled in strength and given unlimited
endurance (for lifting, carrying, and fighting purposes; not for wounds received)
and receives a DM of +2 for surprise.

###### Special Considerations


The following are important to the implementation of weapons use.
Drawing: Weapons are usually carried holstered or slung, unless the characters
specifically state the contrary. A character attempting to use a holstered or slung
weapon in a combat round is subject to a DM of -3 when drawing. When two or
more people draw against each other (assuming surprise is not a factor), each rolls
two dice and adds his or her dexterity; the character with the highest modified
throw thus achieves surprise for the purpose of a first shot.
Minor Accessories: Holsters, magazine carriers, belts, scabbards, cleaning kits,
and other accessories are available for 10% to 20% of the base price of the weapon.
They have effectively no weight (being included in the personal clothing group).
Shoulder holsters may be worn to conceal pistols in public; otherwise, pistols are
carries in hip holsters.
Throwing Blades: Daggers, blades, and bayonets may be thrown at a target at

##### short range. Throw 18+ to hit; DM +dexterity, +blade skill, -target evasion DM

if evading. If a hit is achieved, the wound is 2D. Retrieval of the thrown blade
requires one combat round at close range with the target.
Full Automatic Fire: Submachineguns and automatic rifles fire four round
bursts instead of single shots. The higher ammunition usage results in the hit
probabilities shown on the table (auto rifle uses the rifle row on the table when
firing single shots). In addition, automatic fire allows rolling to hit twice against the
same target. Finally, the group hit rule applies against companions of the target.
Group Hits By Automatic Fire: Regardless of the designated target for auto-matic fire, non-evading individuals adjacent to the target are also attacked by the
burst of automatic fire. No more than two adjacent targets may be attacked, but
each is the subject of a to hit roll with a DM of -3, and all other appropriate DMs.
Group Hits By Shotguns: Each shot by a shotgun may attack up to three indi-viduals adjacent to the original target, provided they are in a group (herd, pack,
band, etc) and are each human-sized or smaller. In addition, when firing against
flying targets (winged animals, flying vehicles) within range, a DM of +2 is allowed.
Coup De Grace: Any gun or blade may be used to administer a coup de grace
and kill an unconscious or unstruggling individual (person or animal) at close range
in one combat round if the character using the weapon so states. Ammunition is
expended, but no die rolls are necessary. A coup de grace may be administered with
hands or brawling weapons using special blows, but die rolls must be made.
Archaic Firearms: The guns shown previously are those available in interstellar
societies and which travellers granted free choice might want to purchase. Firearms,
however, are also available at lower tech levels in less developed forms. Adventurers
on primitive worlds may encounter them, and may conceivably be required to use


them. A few types of archaic firearms are given below. Prices are extremely variable.
Hand Cannon (5000 grams; TL 2):, Literally a small, hand-held, muzzle-loading
cannon, it takes 2 rounds to load with powder and a ball, and is fired by holding a
flame to the touchhole. It fires as body pistol, but may not fire at close range.

##### Flintlock Musket (4000 grams, TL3): A long smoothbore weapon relying on

##### sparks struck from a flint to ignite the powder. It requires 1 round to reload during

which time the firer may not evade, and when fired may misfire (roll 4+ to avoid);
if a misfire occurs, the weapon will not fire, but the firer may attempt to fire it in
the next round. The musket fires as a carbine, but may not fire at very long range.
Percussion Rifle (4000 grams, TL4): A,muzzle-loading rifle relying on an explos-ive cap to ignite the powder. Loading is the same as for a musket but there is no
chance of a misfire. The weapon fires as a rifle.
Muzzle-loading Pistol (1500 grams, TL 3 or 4): A single-shot pistol, either flint-

##### lock or percussion (with the same loading characteristics as described above). It


fires as a body pistol.
Percussion Revolver (1000 grams, TL 4): A sixshot revolver, with each chamber
individually loaded with powder, ball, and a percussion cap. The gun may be reload-ed in 8 rounds, or the cylinder may be detached and another, previously loaded cyl-

##### inder may be put on in 2 rounds (cylinder weight: 300 grams). It fires as a revolver.

All these weapons require that the owner also carry gunpowder and properly
sized lead balls; percussion weapons also require a supply of percussion caps.

###### Antique Equivalents


Most of the gun weapons described above are based on weapons available in the
1980s. While technology will certainly progress in the centuries that come, it will
also remain a fact that one of the surest ways to injure or kill an adversary is to
subject him or her to a large dose of kinetic energy; the simplest way to deliver that
energy to someone is with bullet impact. The guns noted below are used as the
basis for the weapons described, although some changes have been made in weight
and power. Individuals interested in more information on the capabilities and
parameters of the weapons can use this information as a springboard.
Body Pistol: Equivalent to the Walther PPK .380 or the OMC .380 Back-up.

##### Automatic Pistol: Equivalent to the Smith & Wesson Model 59 9mm or the

Auto-Mag .44 Magnum.
Revolver: Equivalent to the Smith & Wesson Model 66 .357 Magnum.
Carbine: Equivalent to the Ruger 5.56mm Mini-14 or the Armalite 5.56mm
Ar-180.
Rifle: Equivalent to the Springfield 7.62mm MI4 Rifle or the Belgian FN FAL
7.62mm Rifle.
Automatic Rifle: Equivalent to the full automatic versions of the rifles men-tioned above. The belt-fed automatic rifle is equivalent to the Russian DShK in rifle
caliber.
Shotgun: Equivalent to the Remington MI 100.
Submachinegun: Equivalent to the British Sterling 9mm L2A1, or the Israeli
9mm UZI.
Some weapons such as the laser rifle and laser carbine are not currently available.
