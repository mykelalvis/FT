Reacher supports its economy by exporting simple organic compounds, produced naturally in its exotic atmosphere and gathered more cheaply than they can be synthesized elsewhere. The recent introduction of better synthesis technology into the subsector has reduced Reacher's market ([[Aramis]] and [[Patinir]], once importers, now produce their own organics), and recent incidents of violence against offworlders have led the Travellers' Aid Society to declare Reacher an [[amber zone]].
