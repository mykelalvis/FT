# Vanejen

Vanejen/[[Rhylanor Subsector|Rhylanor]] (0709-C686854-5) is the major inhabited world in the Vanejen system, situated in a backwater cluster or worlds in the [[Rhylanor subsector]] in the [[Spinward Marches]]. The system consists of a bright central star, a total of seven planets (including Vanejen} and five satellites. Only Vanejen is in the system's life zone, and none of the other worlds show any sign of life or of value. In addition, the Vanejen system has no gas giantâ€” surprisingly, an asset which first drew Imperial attention to the system. The oceans of Vanejen can provide water for starship fuel to forces occupying the world, but attacking starforces are at a distinct disadvantage, needing to conquer the world itself before gaining access to the water they require for volume refueling.

Vanejen has two of the five satellites in the system, both of them small chunks of rock. Both were used as orbital bases by the [[Imperial Navy]] when Vanejen was fortified in  [[IY0980]]; they have since been stripped of any armaments, but may retain some equipment not considered important enough to remove.

## Starport

Vanejen itself boasts a class C starport, a lower quality installation which once served as an [[Imperial Navy|Imperial naval]] base. But no longer: the navy pulled out of the base in [[IY0995]], and the installation was retained as the world's starport. In a few years, as Vanejen gets up to tech level 8 or 9, the starport will probably be upgraded to B. Currently, the starport provides unrefined fuel, and does not have either ship building or repair facilities. It is located at the urban center on the large central continent.

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Vanejen is a medium-sized world with a dense atmosphere. Having a diameter of 8900 kilometers and a circumference of 28000 kilometers, the world has an atmosphere with a more or less standard gas mixture and no noxious elements. Seas of water cover 62% of the world's surface. These seas are quite deep, especially away from land masses. Polar icecaps are present in both hemispheres, but the lack of continental anchors or boundary land masses makes them fragile and prone to dispersion into icebergs due to weather.

## Planetography

[[A2RSG-28.jpg|Vanejen Map 800km hexes]]

The equator divides the world into north and south hemispheres, and passes through three of Vanejen's four continents. The northern fourth continent is relatively barren, without any mineral wealth or large human settlement, although there is a chirper population.

The three other continents each have urbanized and settled areas as indicated by the city symbols; urbanization and extensive development can be encountered on each continent within four hexes of those symbols. Mountain symbols indicate mountainous, rough or broken terrain; clear areas may be clear, prairie, forest, jungle, desert, swamp, marsh, or river. Arctic terrain can be expected in the top and bottom four hex rows of the map. Flora and Fauna. The animal and plant life of Vanejen is unremarkable (with the exception of the semi-intelligent chirpers) and corresponds to standard animal encounter tables constructed from the instructions contained in Traveller Book 3.

## SOCIAL DESCRIPTION

Human population on Vanejen is 543 million (a computer estimate) as of [[IY1105]]. Racial extraction is primarily [[Vilani]], a result of colonization some 3500 years ago; only limited intermingling (primarily from naval personnel during the [[Third Frontier War]]) with [[Solomani]] and other human races has occurred. Government is a planet-wide feudal technocracy imposing a rather liberal law level of 4. Technology. The current technological level of Vanejen is 5, equivalent to the [[Terra|Terran]] period 1900 to 1939. Electronics are rudimentary and gravities nonexistent. The primary emphasis of manufacturing is mechanical.

## HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

During the [[Third Frontier War]] (979 to 986), the major efforts of the [[Outworld Coalition]] were directed at [[Efate]], [[Boughene]], and [[Pixie]], all in the [[Regina subsector]]. This strategy was essentially the same as had been used in the previous wars. But in addition, the Coalition launched a subordinate drive through the [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]] and [[Lanth subsector]]s, across the Abyss, and gaining a foothold at [[Jae Tellona]]. From there, both [[Rhylanor]] and [[Porozlo]] were put under siege. This salient diverted large portions of the Imperial fleet from their main engagement in the [[Regina subsector]], and brought the war to a stalemate that lasted some eleven months. Neither side could make any real advances, but the entire rear of the Imperial defense was threatened. The insertion of substantial reinforcements from the neighboring Sabine subsector eventually broke the deadlock, and forced the Zhodani hordes back.

Vanejen figured prominently in this campaign of the [[Third Frontier War]]. Originally settled in the third colonization wave of the Vilani Empire, circa 1230 VI, Vanejen regressed (along with most of the human worlds) to barbarism during the [[Long Night]], and remained at low tech levels until recontacted in 980. Strategically, the [[Imperial Navy|Navy]] needed a rear area starbase from which to support the expulsion of the Outworlders; Vanejen looked to be most suitable. The local inhabitants became aware of their starfaring neighbors.

Ordinarily, this would be the cause of great civil upheaval, but the Navy was exceptionally prudent. Preliminary contacts were made; the ruling families were convinced that they could chart a well-planned course into their own future. The government of Vanejen was (and is) basically feudal, and (while static), was a comfortable sinecure for those in power. These ruling families each held their own territories, and competition had become essentially stylized, channelled into trade and commerce. The rulers could see the obvious appeals of progress, so long as their own power was not challenged.

In return for services to the [[Imperial Navy|Navy]], the government received orbital surveys, computer simulations (complete with advisers to translate them), and basic technological assistance to get their programs moving. And then, the people in power translated their regional authority into monopolies in commerce and technology. The [[Margrave family]], for example, assumed the monopoly on steel and construction metals, while the [[Flandren family]] took land transportation. Other families took other basic areas (such as communications, chemicals, or banking; sea transport was ultimately divided among several families), while long-range planning left open new areas (such as electronics, and gravities) to be issued to worthy or powerful groups which might arise in the course of time.

In the century since the naval base was established (and long since closed down), Vanejen has progressed slowly and deliberately from tech level 2 to tech level 5, while the original ruling families have retained their power in the planet-wide government.

From [[Behind the Claw]]

Vanejen is a moderate-sized planet with a dense atmosphere and about 60% water coverage. Average temperatures are low and about a third of the oceans are frozen or covered by ice caps. Although somewhat sub-optimal as a place to live, Vanejen can easily support humans. It was settled around -2400 by Vilani colonists but became isolated during the [[Long Night]], falling back to barbarism before climbing back up to a modest technological base. By the time the [[Imperium]] arrived in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], Vanejen had experienced centuries of cultural drift and lost most traditional Vilani habits in favor of a home-grown culture. The population were initially pureblood Vilani and there has been little intermingling over the centuries.

Vanejen lies on the [[Spinward Main]], a less-travelled spur running coreward from [[Mora]]. This arm offers jump-2 access to [[Jae Tellona]] and thereby to [[Rhylanor]], or another arm of the main to coreward, but is otherwise unimportant to interstellar trade and political affairs.  This region has been a backwater for centuries and never received much in the way of investment. It might have remained entirely underdeveloped but for the events of the [[Third Frontier War]], which required the [[Imperial Navy]] to create a temporary base on Vanejen and brought interstellar affairs onto the locals' doorstep.

Prior to this, Vanejen was a more or less forgotten colony world, whose inhabitants managed to create a stable TL2 society. Progress beyond that never really happened. Vanejen fell off the map and escaped notice for centuries. Only those locals who interacted with starfarers aboard the few ships that came through were reminded that there was a wider universe out there.

After the war, the Navy kept the base open for a time even though it was no longer needed. Budget constraints resulted in its closure after a few years but by that time things had changed considerably as a result of offworld influences. When the Navy came to Vanejen they did so carefully, making a number of deals with local leaders.  In return for making the construction of the base easy, the ruling elite were given orbital surveys of mineral deposits and technological assistance in creating an industrial base to exploit them.

In the century since the war, Vanejen has advanced steadily to TL5, with most sectors of industry a monopoly for one of the ruling families; literally all steel production is owned by one family, all land transport by another and so forth. Some sectors, for example sea transport, are divided between several families.

Today, Vanejen has a population of just over 540 million, scattered across three of the world's four continents, the fourth being barren and more or less uninhabited.  Government is by a stable semi-feudal system based on control of critical industries and the ruling families were firmly entrenched in power even before they gained their monopoly on industry.

Local travel is by rail, for the most part, but sea travel is commonly used for commercial purposes. In the northern hemisphere and equatorial regions, surface ships are the norm but submersibles are used in the southern oceans and particularly stormy or ice-prone areas. Submersibles run on the surface most of the time, submerging to avoid ice or ride out a storm.

The submersibles of Vanejen range from small personal transports to large cargo vessels and run on a diesel-electric system that can use a snorkel to pull in air while remaining submerged. An explosives-rigged buoy is carried to blast a hole to the surface in pack ice, allowing a boat to halt, recharge its batteries and then proceed on a long under-ice transit. These are not military boats and are unarmed, with a large glassed-in area forward and powerful searchlights mounted alongside. This allows visually-guided manoeuvring at close range although it does pose a hazard in the event of collision. Most boats are capable of operating at a safe maximum depth of about 200 meters, and can survive at somewhat greater depths.

Vanejen has a substantial population of [[Chirper]]s, most living on the northern continent, despite it being less hospitable than the other land masses. This may be because the Chirpers have moved away from humans, although that begs the question of how they crossed the seas to their new home. There are smaller populations of Chirpers on the other continents.

Vanejen is listed as the location of Imperial [[Research Station Gamma]], reported to be a tower-like structure built on the seabed in the far south, projecting up above sea level. It is accessed by grav craft and supply submarines from local contractors. As with all such stations, the station is a local [[Red Zone]]; access without a permit is strictly prohibited. It is not known how this is enforced, nor what research goes on inside.
