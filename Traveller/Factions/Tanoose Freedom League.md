A strong and pro-[[Imperial]] independence movement on [[Garda-Vilis]], . The harsh measures used in putting down the rebellion in [[IY1103]] drove the TFL underground for a time but increased its base of sympathisers. It has become apparent that some outside agency is smuggling advanced weapons to the TFL and providing training to insurgent units.

The TFL maintains that it is loyal to the [[Imperium]] and wants to bring a free Garda-Vilis (or more accurately, a world named Tanoose) into the [[Imperium]]. In [[IY1083]] the anti-Imperial terrorist [[Ine Givar]] organization approached the TFL with offers of alliance. The bodies of the Ine Givar agents were found outside the scout base. This was taken as a reminder of both the TFL's pro-Imperial stance and its rejection of the Ine Givar proposal.

The region around [[Garda-Vilis]] is of interest not only to the [[Imperium]] but also the [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]], [[Sword Worlds]] and fledgling [[Federation of Arden]]. There have been hints that one or all of these foreign states was interested in events on [[Garda-Vilis]], and it is possible that the TFL might align itself with a foreign power if offered a real chance at independence.

Thus far, the rebellion on [[Garda-Vilis]] has been treated as an internal matter and [[Imperial Army]] forces have not been deployed. Were foreign influences found to be involved, that policy might be revised. In the meantime, the ruling council is stretched very thin. Local forces have been deemed untrustworthy and disarmed, leaving the administration desperately short of manpower at a time of deepening crisis.

Various measures have been suggested to mitigate the situation, ranging from the use of mercenary forces to augment the Vilis Civil Affairs troops, a [[Imperial Navy|Navy]] guardship to intercept arms shipments or the appointment of an Imperial noble to represent the world. The latter was vigorously rebuffed by the government of [[Vilis]] - colonies do not have their own representatives, they are looked after by their parent world. Assigning a representative would be a step towards recognizing Garda-Vilis as an independent world and this is not acceptable to the government that has benefited from having it as a colony for 1,000 years or more.

The situation on Garda-Vilis continues to simmer, sometimes violently. With the majority of the population opposed to offworld rule, and not greatly benefiting from it, and a ready supply of weapons available for the use of rebels, it would seem to be only a matter of time before things come to a head.
