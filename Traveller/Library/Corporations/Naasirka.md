### Naasirka

Naasirka is an electronics giant, unable to compete with Makhidkarun for the top end of the market but dominant at the mid-level and low-end. Naasirka has numerous government contracts, including standard systems for the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. Naasirka's public image in Deneb is of straightforward industrialists producing highly useful products for everyone, which is not totally inaccurate. Its spokespeople can be expected to urge calm and restraint to all factions in every conflict that breaks out and the megacorporation is widely known to fund relief operations when the shooting stops.

Naasirka makes no secret of the fact that this is good long-term business – if the lights go black on using Naasirka equipment, then those people will buy Naasirka when it comes to keeping them on. Critics claim that Naasirka is profiting from instability and conflict and the firm typically replies that it is merely adapting to the current business climate.

Naasirka is the second Vilani Bureau–turned–Megacorporation.
Founded primarily by the Shugili, Naasirka moved into other areas
when it became apparent that the specialist skills of the Shugili were
only required on Vland itself and a few other, similarly borderline
worlds. It was not possible to control food production on most
worlds, where nothing more than rinsing or heating was necessary
to make food edible.

Naasirka became a general and diversified corporation, dealing
in electronics, software, computers and robotics as well as
transportation and energy production. Naasirka is at the cutting
edge of robotics and artificial–intelligence research and supplies
most of the electronic and data–transfer equipment used by the
Imperial Express–Boat service.

Naasirka maintains extensive manufacturing plants on many worlds
and less well publicised research establishments in quieter areas.
Many of these are located on moons or asteroids off the beaten path
and are not welcoming to visitors.
