[[Chwistyoch]] [[Chwistyoch]] 0104 B766766–A Z 0104 B766766–A Z Z Ri Ag Ga GZ Ri Ag Ga G This verdant world was colonized by the Zhodani shortly after they settled on [[Clan]]. [[Chwistyoch]] has become a rich world from both its agricultural and mineral exports. Most offworlders prefer to visit the [[Vexx]] settlement even though the Zhodani discourage this activity. 

The Chwistyoch system has five planets, two of which are gas giants. Chwistyoch is in the second orbit.

Chwistyoch 104 B766766–A Z Z Ri Ag Ga G Chwistyoch was first colonized in 207 by [[Vexx]]  refugees who fled Condyole after the cataclysm. The idyllic conditions on Chwistyoch and the fertile lands drew the [[Zhodani]] here shortly after they colonized Clan. In 333, colonists arrived and claimed ownership of Chwistyoch, imposing [[Zhodani]] rule over the [[Vexx]]. The [[Zhodani]] also upgraded the starport from class E to class B.

Much of the land on Chwistyoch is devoted to mining and farming. This has lead Chwistyoch to become a rich world from both its agricultural and mineral exports. There is also a re-education center here, built exclusively for the noble class. A high speed monorail connects the major cities and the starport, so both visitors and locals can easily travel around the planet at no expense.

# ATTITUDES

The people here are happy and proud of life here on Chwistyoch. They know it shows the very best of what [[Zhodani]] society has to offer and few people who live on Chwistyoch ever need re-education. However, most offworlders view the [[Zhodani]] here as arrogant and condescending.

There is some hostility between the [[Vexx]] and [[Zhodani]] due to the imposed rule that was forced upon the [[Vexx]]. This was a long time ago and for the most part, the [[Vexx]] have actually prospered as a result of [[Zhodani]] rule.

However, there is a resistance movement being led by a charismatic leader named [[Onak]] who is slowly gaining support. The group is becoming a concern to the [[Zhodani]] and plans are underway to find the cause of the dissention and re-educate those responsible.

[[Vexx]] culture on Chwistyoch is very different to their homeworld. Although the [[Zhodani]] try to discourage travellers from visiting the [[Vexx]], many offworlders prefer their company. The [[Vexx]] culture has adapted by learning a variety of languages and providing facilities for visitors to their settlement. The [[Vexx]] here are also more impulsive and adventurous, heeding few lessons of their past.

# LAWS

Travellers are permitted to land at the starport but are discouraged from visiting [[Vexx]]town. Carrying weapons is discouraged on Chwistyoch and most weapons are illegal except for stunners, melee weapons and small firearms.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Haven
The capital city on Chwistyoch certainly lives up to its name. It is a beautiful city with landscaped parks and elegant buildings. Haven is located 10km north of the starport.

## Chwistyoch Retreat
The paradise setting on Chwistyoch made it a perfect choice to build this special re-education center on the outskirts of Haven. Since most people on Chwistyoch are happy with their lives, the center has become an exclusive retreat for nobles in neighboring systems.

## Military Base

The military base on Chwistyoch is situated between [[#Haven]] and the starport.

## [[Vexx]]town

The existing [[Vexx]] settlement was named by the [[Zhodani]] when they arrived on Chwistyoch. It is situated 25km south of the starport. [[Vexx]]town is not as elegant as the [[Zhodani]] settlements but it has a pleasant atmosphere and has enough facilities to meet the needs of the travellers that are permitted to land.

Vexxtown is becoming something of an embarrassment to the [[Zhodani]]. Many offworlders make it their first port of call after landing, preferring the second rate town to the extravagant [[Zhodani]] cities. As a result, the [[Zhodani]] are beginning to tighten their restrictions on visitors, especially with growing support for the [[Vexx]] resistance movement.
