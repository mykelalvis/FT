Benoit Zahn is an accomplished diplomat and is currently the aide to the governor of Jewell, Lucien Gray. Governor Gray is now in his sixties and wishes to retire, so not only will Benoit assume Lucien's role but Benoit Zahn will also be given the title and position of Duke of Jewell subsector.

Benoit is a slim man who stands roughly six feet in height. He has short dark hair and a closely cropped goatee beard and moustache. Benoit is not one for pomp and circumstance but sees it as a necessary part of his job. He is a clever man but also knows how to head the wisdom of others, which makes him an ideal candidate for the position of duke.
