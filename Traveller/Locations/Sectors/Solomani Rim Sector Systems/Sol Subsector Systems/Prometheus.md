**Prometheus** is a high-population, pre-rich garden world with a billion or more sophonts in population size, a near-ideal utopian environment conducive to most sophonts, and still lacks adequate population to expand its economy to a rich status.

*   Its economy and population are rapidly growing and living conditions are expected to quickly rise barring outside forces.
*   This is a "high technology" world with technology achievements at, near, or over technology standards for [[Charted Space]].
*   This world toils under the control of a military government with conditions reflecting that situation including curtailed civil rights and limited freedoms.
*   It is a balmy tropical world, with a climate of high temperatures.
*   It is a member of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] in the [[Sol Subsector]] of [[Solomani Rim]] Sector in the [[Domain of Sol]].
*   This world has an Imperial [[Scout base]], capable of handling [[Scout Service|IISS]] starships and personnel.
